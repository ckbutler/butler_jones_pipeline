 BRAZIL
 
 Brazil, the world's fifth largest and sixth most populous
 country, is undergoing a gradual process of political
 liberalization -- popularly known as the political
 "opening." Initiated during the presidency of Ernesto
 Geisel (1974-79), the political opening has been accelerated
 by President Figueiredo.
 In 1978, President Geisel, in a major move, revoked
 most of the Government's exceptional powers effective
 January 1, 1979; this act eliminated the President's
 authority to close Congress, terminate mandates of
 elected officials and suspend the political rights
 of individuals. A new and less severe national security
 law was promulgated, and the last vestiges of formal
 censorship of the press were eliminated. Television
 and radio news continues to be subject to government
 controls, although there is somewhat freer programming
 allowed. Also restored were habeas corpus for political
 crimes, parliamentary immunity (except or national
 security offenses), and autonomy of the judiciary.
 Illegal arrests and mistreatment of political prisoners
 have been virtually eliminated at the federal level,
 and such actions by local police have increasingly
 been subjected to critical scrutiny by the media and
 Brazilian civil rights groups.
 During 1979 several thousand persons, accused or convicted
 of illegal political activity, benefited from steps
 which included an amnesty, a pardon and a lifting
 of banishment orders.
 The Brazilian system of government, historically,
 has been based on a strong executive; decision-making
 is concentrated in the hands of the President and
 his cabinet. At present the Presidency, Vice Presidency,
 state governorships and one-third of the Federal Senate
 are filled by indirect election in specifically constituted
 electoral colleges; most other public offices are
 elected by direct popular vote.
 Brazil's rapid economic growth over the past three
 decades has made it the tenth largest industrial economy
 in the world. However, there still exist considerable
 poverty, underdevelopment, and wide regional disparities
 in income distribution and in the delivery of education,
 health and social services. Most of the economic
 benefits flow to the urban industrial south, while
 urban slums and parts of the rural, largely traditional
 northeast remain some of the poorest areas in Latin
 America. The poorer sectors of society have lagged
 behind in reaping the benefits of Brazil's economic
 growth, although there have been absolute gains, in
 real terms, from a low historical base.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the
 Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is officially condemned by the Brazilian Government,
 and its use by Federal authorities has been eliminated.
 Charges of torture against local police officials
 
 (262)
 
 
 263
 
 are still made (see discussion below).
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 According to knowledgeable Brazilian observers, physical
 abuse of prisoners by some local police persists.
 The rate of abuse diminished in 1979 and was confined
 to common criminal cases. Lawyers, the press, Church
 and civil rights leaders have greater access to prisoners
 as a result of the political "opening." Most complaints
 of abuse are centered on the initial phase of detention.
 The President and other top Federal officials have
 expressed publicly their determination to eliminate
 completely mistreatment of'prisoners.  (Among state
 governments, Sao Paulo, for example, is also making
 a particularly strong effort in this regard.) Official
 investigations are occurring with increasing frequency,
 as is the disciplining of police for such acts. For
 example, at President Figueiredo's order, a special
 investigation of the July 1979 death of a criminal
 suspect in Rio de Janeiro during interrogation, initially
 described as a suicide, resulted in several police
 officers being convicted of abuse of power. The political
 reforms reduced the period during which arrestees
 in security cases may legally be held incommunicado
 from ten to eight days and provided for medical examinations
 of prisoners durfng this period. There is no capital
 punishment in Brazil. The Federal government is seeking
 to curb vigilantism, but assassinations of common
 criminals by illegal local groups are not infrequent.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Habeas corpus, which is constitutionally guaranteed
 was restored for political offenses on January 1 and
 is usually respected in practice. Courts are legally
 required to rule on a habeas corpus petition within
 30 days but in practice----uently take longer. Brazilian
 law permits preventive detention in certain well-defined
 instances. In cases of offenses against the national
 security law, the accused may be kept in custody for
 30 days, renewable for a like period, so long as a
 competent judicial authority is notified. Although
 infrequent, cases of persons being arrested and illegally
 held without charge have been reported in the Brazilian
 press.
 In the event of an arrest in a non-security case,
 statutory law provides for notification within 24
 hours of a judicial authority, who must then determine
 the legality of the arrest, set bail, and grant habeas
 corpus if requested by the arrestee's attorney.
 The number of prisoners exceeds the capacity of detention
 facilities, and the level of prison health care, diet
 and sanitation is low. Government officials point
 out that, as with other social services, the country
 lacks resources to upgrade detention facilities.
 Prisoners are normally allowed visits following the
 initial period of detention. Distinctions are made
 between prisoners held for offenses against the national
 security law and for ordinary crimes, the former
 generally being held in units set apart from ordinary
 criminals. Prisoners held for security reasons are
 subject to more restrictions with respect to family
 
 
 264
 visits, reading material and correspondence. According
 to some legal observers, access by attorneys to security
 prisoners improved significantly in 1979. Estimates
 are that fewer than 40 individuals convicted of violent
 political crimes did not benefit from the amnesty,
 and many of these benefitted from a presidential Christmas
 pardon. The Brazilian Government does not permit
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 or similar foreign or international agencies access
 to prisoners.
 Apart from a few unconfirmed allegations, there are
 no reports that persons in Brazil are held clandestinely
 or "disappear." some local security authorities have
 reportedly cooperated with Southern Cone counterparts
 in extra-legal detention and transfer of political
 refugees to or from these countries. These chages
 are being investigated by Brazilian executive and
 judicial authorities.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Brazilian law entitles an accused person to a fair,
 public trial. Trial by a single judge is the general
 practice, with trial by jury required in cases of
 willful crimes against life. Defendants are entitled
 to counsel, which, if necessary, will be provided
 by the state. Instances of harassment of defense
 attorneys and police interference with lawyers' access
 to their clients were alleged prior to 1979. The
 Brazilian Bar Association has stated that the situation
 has significantly improved. Brazilian law requires
 that defendants be made fully aware of the charges
 against them, and defendants and their lawyers are
 legally entitled to be informed of the evidence on
 which the charges are based.
 In general, the Brazilian judicial system is independent
 of executive or military authority. The judicial
 system provides for a range of specialized courts
 to deal with specific areas of activity -- i.e., criminal,
 civil, electoral, family, labor, and military courts.
 The Brazilian military court system hears cases involving
 both military personnel and civilians charged with
 offenses against the national security law or military
 institutions.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The Brazilian Constitution provides that "the home
 is the inviolable asylum of an individual." No authority
 can legally enter a home without a warrant, except
 when it is believed that a crime is being committed
 or an accident has taken place. The Brazilian press
 has reported instances of illegal police entry.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the
 Fulfillment of Such Vital Needs As
 Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education:
 Despite rapid economic growth since World War II,
 Brazil still possesses elements of a "dual economy",
 one increasingly modern, urban and industrial, the
 other traditional, poor and largely rural. Brazil's
 per capita income is about 1,500 dollars per year,
 but income distribution is highly skewed, with rural
 areas in the northeast having per capita incomes of
 
 
 265
 250 to 750 dollars. Brazilian Government statistics
 indicate that between 1970 and 1976 real income of
 the poorest 50 percent increased in absolute terms.
 The income distribution problem in Brazil remains
 acute and the percentage of national income going
 to the poorest 50 percent of the population declined
 during the same period from about 15 to 12 percent,
 continuing an earlier deterioration from 17.7 percent
 in 1960.
 President Figueiredo expressed concern in his Inaugural
 Address over the skewed income distribution that has
 accompanied Brazil's rapid growth and called for more
 equitable distribution of wealth. Recent government
 decisions on minimum wage levels were designed to
 help accomplish this goal. Brazil's tax system has
 both progressive and regressive elements. Moves are
 underway to impose higher excise rates on luxury items
 and lower rates on basic necessities. Federal revenue
 sharing with the states aims at narrowing regional
 income distribution, with the poorer states receiving
 relatively larger shares.
 Rapid population growth of about 2.7 percent per annum
 has strained Brazil's capacity to meet the demand
 for housing, education and health facilities. These
 problems are compounded by a large and continuing
 rural-to-urban migration. There have been problems
 in assuring that lower-income groups benefit from
 housing programs. To boost housing security for tenants,
 the Government in 1979 enacted a law eliminating the
 landlord's right to evict renters without justification.
 Wide regional disparities characterize the delivery
 of health services and education. Much of Brazil's
 poorer regions, especially the largely rural northeast,
 lack minimal health services, and infant mortality,
 endemic tropical diseases and general malnutrition
 all take a high toll. Clinics and hospitals, which
 are part of Brazil's social security system, cover
 some 80 percent of the urban population, but availability
 of treatment suffers due to the heavy demand on these
 services. The high priority given to boosting agricultural
 productivity is aimed in part at improving diets,
 and a large government program currently subsidizes
 both the import and the production of wheat. Government
 efforts over the past several years through the Brazilian
 Literacy Movement have considerably improved literacy,
 although illiteracy is still high.
 The Federal government is seeking to clamp down on
 corruption which, although a problem, has not hindered
 government efforts to fulfill vital needs.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of religion is respected. The Government
 
 
 266
 in 1979 showed broad acceptance of public manifestations
 of protest and dissent. The printed media are free.
 Depending on editorial policy, they use their right
 to criticize the Government and generally provide
 full coverage of political and social topics no matter
 how controversial or sensitive. Prior censorship
 restrictions were removed from the last three periodicals
 still subject to them in 1978. Nevertheless, journalists
 and opposition politicians frequently cite as a potential
 threat to press freedom the national security law,
 which grants considerable discretion to the executive
 branch to punish writers and publishers for such offenses
 as "offending the honor and dignity of high national
 officials" or "alienating the people from the government."
 While there is a distinct trend toward freer radio
 and television programming, as well as theatrical
 and film offerings, the Government closely follows
 these media, which are considered a great deal more
 influential than the press. The electronic news media
 practice internal controls on their programming to
 avoid potential conflicts over content. Political
 subjects receive heavier coverage, both serious and
 satirical, than in previous years. Specific bans
 by the Government on spot coverage of certain sensitive
 developments or topics, frequently used in past years,
 do not appear to have been employed by the Figueiredo
 administration. The rights of free speech, assembly
 and association are widely enjoyed in Brazilian society
 and are increasingly accepted by the Government as
 a natural outgrowth of the political opening. At
 the same time, the administration has issued warnings
 that abuse of the liberalization process would not
 be tolerated. The Government declared its opposition
 to the re-establishment of the National Student Union
 (UNE), banned since 1964, but permitted a national
 student convention in May 1979 and UNE national elections
 and the installation of the new directorate in October.
 In August, the Government formally revoked the ten-
 year-old decree laws which had prohibited political
 activity by students and professors and local student
 directorates (although such organs have been functioning
 unofficially for several years without government
 interference).
 b.   Freedom of Movement
 Freedom of movement within the country, foreign travel,
 and emigration are guaranteed by the Brazilian Constitution
 and are respected in practice. As a balance of payments
 measure, the Government has required since 1976 a
 substantial deposit for Brazilians going to most countries
 abroad. This disincentive has, however, been eroded
 by domestic inflation, and the administration announced
 on December 7 that it will be discontinued.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the
 Political Process
 The basic right to vote, freely and in secret, is
 guaranteed, but the direct choice of the voter is
 limited by the fact that the presidency, vice presidency,
 one third of the Federal Senate and state governorships
 are filled by the vote of specially constituted electoral
 colleges. The Federal Chamber of Deputies, the state
 legislatures and two-thirds of the Federal Senate
 
 
 267
 are elected by direct popular elections, and the restoration
 of direct election of governors is expected in 1982.
 The reallocation of Federal Chamber of Deputies seats
 and curbs on broadcast media political advertising
 in 1977 were designed by the Geisel administration
 to assure the pro-government political party, the
 National Renewal Alliance (ARENA), a majority in both
 houses of the National Congress and most state legislatures,
 as well as possession of 21 of 22 state governorships.
 The opposition party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement
 (MDB), did win, however, a majority of the nationwide
 popular vote in the 1978 elections.
 The present administration sponsored legislation dissolving
 the two party system imposed in 1965 and restoring
 a limited multiparty system. The new law will provide
 offically sanctioned vehicles for a wider range of
 political views, but also has been criticized as aimed
 at dividing the opposition party. New parties may
 freely organize and can elect office holders if they
 receive more than five percent of the popular vote
 nationwide. The Brazilian Communist Party is banned
 by law. All legal political parties are treated equally
 under the law.
 Participation in the political system is constitutionally
 guaranteed to all. literate citizens, regardless of
 race or sex; illiterates may not vote. Legislation
 taking effect January 1, 1979, took away Presidential
 authority (held since 1968) to deprive citizens of
 their political rights, including the right to vote
 and hold public office. The 1979 amnesty restored
 these political rights and swept away convictions
 for all but violent political drimes, thus allowing
 most voluntary exiles (estimated to be some 1,000)
 to return to Brazil without fear of imprisonment.
 An additional 4,000 persons who were dismissed or
 suspended from public-sector jobs for political
 reasons from 1964 to 1978 were granted the right to
 petition their former employers for reinstatement.
 In the course of Brazil's rapid though uneven
 economic development, women have made major strides
 in attaining status equal with that of men. Basic legal
 rights are guaranteed without distinction as to sex.
 In Brazil's relatively affluent, economically and
 politically dynamic urban areas, women are increasingly
 active in the professions, industry, education and the
 arts, as well as political life, including a small
 representation in the National Congress. This level
 and range of activities are less in evidence in the
 rural, economically underdeveloped sectors of the country,
 and especially in the northeast, where poverty, constitutes
 an obstacle. Although a legal requirement, equal pay
 for equal work is not widely practiced.
 Brazil has an active trade union movement which claims
 to represent some 40 percent of Brazil's work force,
 although government figures, based on the number of
 dues-payers, indicate that only about 17 percent of
 the labor force is organized. The rights of labor unions
 to organize and represent the economic interests of
 workers are carefully respected. In general, the Government
 has not prevented strikes when they are in non-essential
 sectors.
 
 
 268
 The "essential sector" is broadly defined. The Government
 has occasionally invoked its anti-strike powers, most
 notably during the Sao Paulo metallurgical workers strike
 in March-April 1979, when it intervened in three unions
 by removing (temporarily) the union leaders and imposing
 a cooling-off period. The Government allowed the deposed
 leaders to remain de facto in charge of their unions
 and to negotiate a settlement with management. The
 Government has made it clear on various occasions, that
 direct political activity by unions will not be accepted.
 The Government has also indicated to the business community
 that labor and management are expected to make greater
 efforts to negotiate directly wage settlements.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 The Brazilian Government considers inter-national and
 third-country investigation into alleged human rights
 violations as unwarranted interference in Brazil's internal
 affairs. The Federal Government has not impeded visits
 by such organizations within the period covered by this
 report, including one by a representative of the International
 Commission of Jurists in December 1978 and another by
 a representative of Amnesty International in August,
 1979. The International Commission of Jurists in its
 June, 1979 report on Brazil, although expressing concern
 that the executive might potentially use the extraordinary
 powers it constitutionally retains, concluded that recent
 changes "constitute a notable advance toward the restoration
 of democracy and bear promise that more progressive
 policies will prevail."
 Non-governmental Brazilian organizations, such as the
 National Conference of Brazilian (Catholic) Bishops
 (CNBB), the national Brazilian Bar Association (OAB)
 and its local chapters, the Brazilian Press Association,
 many amnesty committees, and local lay and Church-sponsored
 justice and peace groups, have frequently publicized
 alleged human rights violations or have instituted legal
 proceedings. During the Government's formulation of
 its amnesty legislation, the Justice Minister consulted
 with the CNBB and OAB leadership, and the President
 maintains an ongoing dialogue with the CNBB leadership
 in which human rights, among other topics, are discussed.
 In addition, most civil rights organizations maintain
 links with members of Congress. Brazil is a party to
 a number of UN human rights conventions including the
 conventions on genocide, racial discrimination, refugees
 and the political rights of married women. Brazil has
 not signed the American Convention on Human Rights.
