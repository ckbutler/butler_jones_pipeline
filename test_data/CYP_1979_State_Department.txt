 CYPRUS
 
 Human rights issues in Cyprus stem from a long history of
 troubles between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot com-
 munities. Human rights is a staple element of the Cyprus
 problem and will continue to be central in any political solu-
 tion. Human rights in Cyprus must be seen in the context of a
 bicommunal island with long and strong cultural and religious
 ties to both Greece and Turkey.
 The two communities frequently take opposing views on ques-
 tions of human rights. The continuing presence of Turkish
 military forces in northern Cyprus is the major area of dis-
 agreement. The Government of Cyprus considers the Turkish
 military an occupying force whose presence constitutes a con-
 tinuing violation of international law. Turkish Cypriots argue
 that, until a comprehensive settlement is achieved, the Turkish
 military presence is required to guarantee the security of the
 Turkish Cypriot community.
 Another important issua is the serious displaced person prob-
 lem arising from the 1974 de facto division of the island.
 The Government of Cyprus m-lnt-asl  that all displaced persons
 must be permitted to return to their homes in accordance with
 United Nations resolutions. The Turkish Cypriot leadership,
 however, argues that return of displaced persons must be imple-
 mented in a way that takes account of practical difficulties
 and the requirements of a bicommunal state. The question of
 persons who are missing as a result of violent events, parti-
 cularly since the hostilities of 1974, also remains unresolved.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not permitted or practiced by the Government of Cyprus,
 the Turkish Cypriot Administration, or Turkish forces in northern
 Cyprus.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or-
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment is guaranteed by law in both communities and has been
 respected in practice within each community during the past
 year. Adequate health care is-provided in prison and deten-
 tion facilities. Diet is considered adequate. In detention,
 family members may visit'at any interval not deemed to impede
 an investigation. Once sentenced, prisoners may be visited
 by family members once a month or more frequently when humani-
 tarian needs exist. Attorneys may visit prisoners freely.
 Differing classes of imprisonment do not exist except in cases
 requiring medical treatment.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. The right of habeas corpus is
 scrupulously observed. "Preventive detention" eis    neitHer
 in law nor in practice. No individual may be held for more than
 
 
 574
 three days for investigation of a crime without referral to
 a court for extension of the period of detention. Most
 periods of investigative detention do not exceed eight or
 ten days before formal charges are filed.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In both communities, fair public trial is guaranteed and
 provided in practice. Because Cyprus was a British colony,
 it incorporated many of the features of the British judi-
 cial system. The judiciary is independent of executive
 or military control. Jury trials are almost unknown --
 although a request for a jury trial is usuall1grated. Cas
 are generally tried before.a judge or a pane    ) - u ges. CLL
 defendents are entitled to counsel, and counsel has unre-
 stricted private access to his client. There are no known
 incidents of harassment of defense lawyers. There are no
 special courts to deal with security or political offenses.
 There are no political-prisoners. Civilians are not tried
 by military courts.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the home, except with judicial warrant,
 is guaranteed by the Cyprus Constitution. A "constitution"
 adopted by the Turkish Cypriots in 1975 has a similar
 guarantee. The Greek Cypriot population resident in the
 Turkish Cypriot administered area continues to decrease as
 a result of gradual transfers to the south. Officials of
 the United Nations force in Cyprus continue to monitor all
 transfer requests in order-to ensure that they are voluntary.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Cypriot economy is free enterprise-oriented with only
 a modicum of government participation or regulation. The
 economy is divided almost equally among agriculture, manu-
 facture, trading, and tourism. The problems faced by the
 Greek Cypriots are those of over-consumption, slight inflation,
 and sectoral labor shortages. The Turkish Cypriot economy,
 which is tied to the Turkish Lir , suffers from high inflatiom,
 low investment leadin to significant unmployment, and re-
 s    Es Tct-edaccess to foreign capital and markets. Income and
 wealth are fairly evenly distributed.within both communities,
 and-the marked disparity between the upper and lower classes
 common in many countries does not exist. Cyprus saciety-is
 6ssentiallk middle class.
 The tax systems of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots are
 progressive,and the right of private property is vigorously
 protected by authorities of both communities. Adequate
 housing is available, even for displaced persons, as is
 health care. There is a "national health scheme" in each
 community which provides free medical care to lower income
 people and all government employees. Educatiofi is free
 
 
 575
 through age 15 and is available throughout the country.
 Illiteracy is virtually unknown in the population under
 age 55. Corruption is also virtually unknown.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 All of these basic rights are guaranteed by law and are
 widely and freely practiced. The press is entirely free.
 It is remarkable that on an island of about 630,000 there
 are 27 daily and weekly periodicals that run the breadth
 of the political specturm. The government is frequently
 criticized. There is no censorship and no known incident
 of intimidation of journalists. There is freedom of religion
 for the majority Orthodox and Muslim communities,and re-
 ligious freedom for the Maronite, Armenian, Christian, and
 Jewish minorities is guaranteed.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Turkish and Greek Cypriots enjoy normal freedom of movement
 within their respective areas. Turkish Cypriot authorities
 have, as reported by Secretary General Waldheim, relaxed
 some of the restrictions on travel by the Greek Cypriot
 population in the north, but Greek Cypriots still do not
 have the same freedom of movement there as do Turkish
 Cypriots. There are no restrictions on freedom of movement
 of Turkish Cypriots residing in the government-controlled
 area. Travel between the two sectors is extremely limited,
 but some is permitted for humanitarian reasons.
 HovWever, the right of Turkish Cypriots to travel
 abroad is complicated by the fact that most nations do not
 recognize passports issued by the "Turkish Federated State
 of Cyprus" (TFSC) or expired passports issued before July 15,
 1974 by the Government of Cyprus that have been extended by
 the "TFSC." The government denies individuals who have entered
 Cyprus through the ports or airport of the Turkish Cypriot
 administered area access to the government-controlled sector.
 Freedom of movement from the Turkish Cypriot area to the
 government-controlled area thus ordinarily is not possible
 for visitors to Cyprus. Turkish. Cypriot authorities normally
 restrict entry into their area.by individuals of Greek
 Cypriot or Greek ancestry, ostensibly to avoid any possible
 incident of revenge or provocation. The right to travel
 abroad or emigrate is observed. There are, however, some
 restrictions on exit permits from both areas for those of
 military service age. In the government-controlled area,
 because of labor shortage, some controls are also exercised
 over those seeking employment abroad.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Both the Government of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot Adminis-
 tration have lively and free Western-style multi-party
 
 
 576
 political systems. Both have a parliament, and suffrage
 is universal. There is active and unrestricted competition
 for support by political parties among all elements of
 society, except for Greek Cypriots living in the north,who
 are not permitted to vote in Turkish Cypriot elections. The
 Turkish Cypriot authorities, however, have announced plans
 to enable Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north
 to participate in local elections and run for local office.
 Women have legal status equal to that of men in both com-
 munities. Cyprus is a traditional Mediterranean society
 in which custom rather than law has retarded the partici-
 pation of women in all areas of public life. Women are,
 however, employed in government and business as profes-
 sionals and are accepted as equal partners in political life.
 There is an active trade union movement that has the right
 to organize, strike, bargain collectively, and lobby.
 4. Government Attitude-and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 Despite a 1977 agreement in principle between the leaders
 of the two communities to establish a body for investigating
 cases of missing persons, the two sides have not reached
 agreement on the terms of reference, particularly on the role
 of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
 In response to two Government of Cyprus petitions, the
 European Commission of Human Rights in 1979 issued a finding
 which charged the Government of Turkey with six violations
 of the European Convention of Human Rights in connection with
 the intervention of Turkish troops in 1974. The Turkish
 Government rebutted that finding in a counter-memorial.
 Later, when the Commission released its report detailing the
 Turkish violations, the Turkish Cypriots published a lengthy
 rebuttal that claims Greek Cypriots violated Turkish Cypriot
 human rights on a massive scale during the 1963-1974 period.
 A third Government of Cyprus petition, alleging continuing
 Turkish violations of human rights since 1975, is currently
 being processed by the Commission. The Turkish Government
 and Turkish Cypriots, however, have thus far refused to
 cooperate in any of these investigations.
