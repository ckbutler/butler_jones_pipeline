 BOLIVIA
 On October 10, 1982, the installation of a constitutionally
 elected government in Bolivia marked the end of 18 years of nearly
 continuous rule by the armed forces. With the inauguration of
 Hernan Siles Zuazo, a peaceful transition to constitutional
 democracy was achieved.
 Within a year Bolivia has progressed from a country known for
 offenses against human rights to a promoter of democratic
 institutions and human rights. Unions and opposition political
 parties are free to organize and criticize the Government.
 Municipal elections are scheduled for May 1984. The Congress
 functions independently from the executive branch. House searches
 and political arrests no longer take, place. The former security
 police apparatus has been abolished and political prisoners
 released. The Government is pursuing the investigation of missing
 persons from the regime of Gen. Luis Garcia Meza (July 1980-August
 1981) and from earlier military governments. The Government is
 also seeking the extradition of Gen. Garcia Meza and his former
 Minister of Interior to face trial for violations of human rights
 that occurred in their tenure.
 However, continuing political instability could threaten the
 democratic process. In one year the Silas administration has
 undergone four cabinet crises. The resignation of the six
 ministers of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left Party in
 January 1983 weakened the ruling political coalition, and the
 Government has continued since to seek a broader base of popular
 support. Persistent rumors of coups d'etat and divisions within
 the Government, along with strikes, road blockades, and popular
 demonstrations in favor of wage demands and against proposed
 economic reform measures, have hindered the Government.
 From the time of the Garcia Meza coup in 1980 until the return to
 democratic government in 1982, rightist "paramilitaries" operated
 with impunity in the countryside. They were grouped into private
 bands, some including foreigners, and financed by proceeds of the
 cocaine trade. These organizations had great power and wealth and
 used sophisticated weapons and communications equipment. Overt
 activity by these groups diminished after the Government captured
 and returned to Italy a key paramilitary terrorist, Pier Luigi
 Pagliai, in October 1982. However, many potent networks remain,
 principally linked to narcotics trafficking, and attempts by
 Government forces to establish control over their "territories"
 are likely to meet violent resistance.
 The Bolivian economic system is dominated by state enterprises,
 with about 75 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) being
 produced by the public sector. The Siles administration inherited
 an economy debilitated by years of mismanagement, waste, and
 corruption. These factors, combined with the world economic
 recession and declining prices for Bolivian mineral exports, have
 compounded the Government's problems. The country--whose per
 capita income is the lowest in South America--has also been hard
 hit by the "El Nino" weather phenomenon that affected the Andean
 region in 1982-83.
 In spite of economic hardship and criticism of the Government,
 there is widespread belief in both civilian and military circles
 that the constitutional order should be preserved. Through its
 performance and outspoken advocacy of democratic freedoms, the
 Government has sought to regain international prestige lost when
 human rights abuses were a serious problem in Bolivia.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There have been no government-sponsored killings since the
 restoration of constitutional government in 1982. Only a few
 isolated incidents of political or social violence were reported.
 In September 1983, an army captain from the Center for Special
 Troop Instruction was murdered and mutilated in the Chapare area,
 where the military had begun agricultural projects. The killing,
 believed to be a terrorist or narcotics-related act, prompted
 special investigations, not yet completed, both by the Government
 and by the Permanent Assembly on Human Rights. The Assembly,
 comprised of representatives from church, labor, professional, and
 cooperative groups, is Bolivia's principal non-governmental
 organization monitoring human rights.
 The. Government has also taken steps against persons accused of
 killings under the Garcia Meza regime. On February 24, 1983,
 Interior Minister Mario Roncal announced the detention of 15
 "paramilitaries" who had been members of the abolished Special
 Security Services and of the Department of Investigations of the
 National Police. They were charged with the murders of 10
 prominent political leaders in 1980-81. They have been turned
 over to the regular criminal courts and are awaiting trial.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no politically inspired disappearances in Bolivia in
 1983.
 To uncover those guilty of the disappearance of political
 opponents under previous regimes, the Siles administration soon
 after taking office created the National Missing Persons
 Commission, with representatives from the Government, the
 Congress, the National Labor Federation, the Permanent Assembly on
 Human Rights, the Catholic Church, the armed forces, and the
 Bolivian Red Cross. They are investigating the cases of 146
 missing persons. Four investigations have been completed and
 those implicated are awaiting trial. The Commission has been
 hampered by a shortage of funds and personnel and by what it has
 called a lack of cooperation by elements of the police, military,
 and judiciary.
 In February 1983, the Commission discovered the remains of 14
 persons who apparently had disappeared during the regime of Gen.
 Hugo Banzer (1971-78). Most had been in official custody in 1972,
 but others were guerrillas killed in armed clashes with the
 police. Gen. Banger immediately issued a public statement denying
 that there had been any officially sanctioned disappearances or
 other violations of human rights during his administration. The
 Executive Secretary of the Commission reported receiving anonymous
 death threats connected to his role in the investigation.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Siles government has stated that it will not employ torture.
 It has abolished the former security police, and it has physically
 dismantled the apparatus used for torture.
 However, seven persons detained by the Bolivian Army in Loayaza
 Province in late October have complained that they were tortured
 by the military. The seven, described in government and press
 
 
 476
 accounts as armed and uniformed guerrillas, were captured
 following complaints by local farmers about their presence and
 activities in the area. They had reportedly been training groups
 for armed combat over the previous six months. According to the
 Permanent Assembly on Human Rights, whose representatives met
 twice with the detainees, the methods used on them included
 beatings, dunkings in water, and threats by masked men to shoot
 them unless they made confessions. After the Permanent Assembly's
 intervention the mistreatment reportedly atopped, and the
 Permanent Assembly acknowledged that their treatment had
 improved.
 On December 14, the Bolivian press reported that a Navy
 noncommissioned officer died while under detention in the Naval
 Military School for alleged involvement in selling arms to leftist
 political groups. The Navy stated that the death resulted from a
 heart attack, but the man's family and other naval officers stated
 that he died as a result of mistreatment in detention. At the end
 of 1983 the official cause of death had not been announced.
 The remaining problems connected with the treatment of prisoners
 arise mainly from chronically poor prison conditions and a lack of
 properly trained prison and police personnel. Prisons for common
 criminals are'badly crowded. San Pedro Prison in La Paz, which
 was built to house 300, now holds some 900 prisoners. Corruption,
 malnutrition, and unsanitary conditions are widespread. Prisoners
 pay guards for food, better cells, contraband liquor, drugs, and
 passes. Several riots and disturbances have taken place in the
 prison, mostly involving protests against food shortages.
 Although no injuries occurred, the prison director's office was
 sacked in October.
 While men and women are confined in separate facilities, common
 criminals are not segregated by type of offense. Very few
 well-to-do Bolivians are arrested or jailed before or after
 trial. The Permanent Assembly on Human Rights has alleged that
 criminal suspects are commonly mistreated by individual police and
 narcotics agents to extract confessions. Human rights and church
 groups have intervened when cases of prisoner abuse have been
 brought to their attention. Although these groups have not been
 able to provide data on the results of their interventions, they
 have stated that reported abuses have diminished significantly
 during 1983.
 Police excesses have sparked violent reactions in rural
 communities. On October 16, 1983, the Executive Secretary of the
 Farmers' Union of the Chapare was detained and subsequently
 complained of being badly beaten by officials at a narcotics
 checkpoint. The union retaliated by blockading the
 Cochambamba-Chapare road and taking a number of police as
 hostages. Only one year before, in the town of Chulumani, farmers
 killed seven narcotics agents after a local woman was raped by
 narcotics policemen, Vigilante justice is common in areas where
 government authority is weak or nonexistent.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, and Exile
 People have not been arrested or exiled for criticizing the
 Government. At the same time, the Government took exceptional
 steps in 1982 in detaining and extraditing a number of notorious
 offenders of human rights from Bolivia. The most prominent case
 involved Klaus Barbie, an ex-Gestapo leader who had been linked
 during his long stay in Bolivia to the "paramilitaries" and
 cocaine traffickers. Barbie's detention in January 1983 was
 initially occasioned by a legal and financial quarrel with the
 
 
 477
 Government. This led to his summary expulsion to France, where he
 was imprisoned on charges of crimes against humanity involving
 the killing, torture, and deportation of hundreds of Jews and
 French resistance fighters during World War II.
 On August 25, 1983, Bolivia also summarily expelled to France a
 French national, Jacques LeClerc, after holding him for five
 months in the Ministry of Interior. LeClerc reportedly admitted
 links to a neo-Nazi group called "Los Novios de La Muerte" (The
 Bridegrooms of Death) which had been involved in narcotics
 trafficking and "paramilitary" activities under the Garcia Meza
 regime.
 In December 1982, Argentine national Mario Mingolla was arrested
 and accused of an attempt on the life of Vice President Jaime Paz
 Zamora and of being a close collaborator of the Italian
 "paramilitary" terrorist Pier Luigi Pagliai. After several months
 of questioning the Government found no evidence to bring charges.
 In June the Minister of Interior said that Mingolla would be in
 danger if he were returned to Argentina and that continued
 "protective custody" was necessary. The year-long detention has
 brought criticism and, under pressure from the Catholic Church and
 from humanitarian and human rights groups, the Government now
 appears willing to consider deporting him to a third country.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Political prisoners were released soon after the Siles government
 took office. No political trials have taken place in recent
 years. There are no prisoners held specifically for political
 reasons.
 Under the Constitution, arrested persons have the right to be
 charged within 24 hours and to have counsel. They must be tried
 before regularly constituted civilian tribunals, with the right of
 appeal to district courts and the Supreme Court. In practice,
 however, prisoners often await trial for years because of archaic
 procedures, shortages of qualified court personnel, and favoritism
 by judicial authorities. A recent investigation found that 92
 percent of the prisoners in Bolivia's largest jail had not yet
 been sentenced.
 The seven persons detained by the Army in Loayaza Province in late
 October for alleged involvement in training leftist groups for
 armed combat remained in military custody at year's end. They
 have been charged with violations of the military penal code and
 are to be tried by a military court. Their families and human
 rights groups have said that this is illegal and that the cases
 should be brought before a civilian court. Bolivian statutes
 allow defense attorneys to appeal to the Supreme Court to decide a
 conflict of jurisdiction of this kind. The accused have civilian
 legal counsel. All 12 Supreme Court members, who serve 10 years,
 were elected in late 1982 by the newly constituted Chamber of
 Deputies from nominees proposed by the Senate.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The privacy of the home and the daily lives of citizens are
 protected by the Constitution and respected in practice. House
 searches, monitoring of conversations, and other abuses that
 occurred under military regimes in the past have stopped. A few
 cases of warrantless entry by narcotics police are under
 investigation by the Permanent Assembly on Human Rights.
 
 
 478
 Section 2  Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are no government controls on free speech or the press. The
 views of opposition parties, leaders, and organizations--often
 harshly critical of the Government--received full play in the
 press, radio, and television.
 The principal danger to freedom of expression in 1983 was posed
 by terrorist activities of unclear sponsorship. Although the
 number of bombings of newspapers and non-government organizations
 decreased during 1983, several incidents did occur. In
 mid-September the offices of a La Paz daily newspaper were
 bombed. Three weeks later, as President Siles was celebrating
 the anniversary of his inauguration, a bomb exploded at the home
 of the owner of another La Paz daily, the second bombing of his
 residence within a year. Further bombings occurred in La Paz and
 other cities during October and November. No one was killed in
 these incidents, which included the bombing of the Congress
 building on the night of November 24.  Police arrested a number
 of persons in connection with these incidents--one as he left the
 scene of a bombing--and confiscated weapons, explosives, and
 documents allegedly indicating their involvement in terrorist
 activities. Further police investigations suggested that these
 persons had links to advisers to President Siles, but their exact
 connections and motives remained under investigation at the end
 of 1983.
 All Bolivian universities except Catholic University in La Paz
 and the Protestant college in Santa Cruz are part of the state
 system. In January 1983, the Supreme Court restored Oscar Anez
 as Dean of the University of Santa Cruz, thus removing the last
 of the rectors appointed to Bolivian state universities by
 previous military governments.
 Academic freedom is recognized in the Fundamental Law of the
 Bolivian University passed in 1972, but political activists in
 student and campus governing bodies have seriously interfered
 with the exercise of this right. Under the present system of
 "professor-student co-management" students have a 50 percent
 voice in every decisionmaking committee and council of the
 university, and they have used this power to install professors
 who agree with them politically and to replace those with whom
 they disagree.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There have been no restrictions on peaceful assembly and
 association under the current Government. Labor unions, which
 played a vital role in the restoration of democracy in 1982, have
 freely exercised their right to recruit, negotiate, and strike.
 Virtually all Bolivian workers in the mining, industrial, and
 service sectors are organized. In May 1983, the Congress
 abrogated a law which prohibited union activity by public
 employees, who are now unionized as well.
 The Bolivian Labor Confederation is independent, wields
 considerable political influence, and often opposes Government
 policies. It has campaigned for an "emergency social-economic
 program" as an alternative to the Government's economic
 adjustment measures. The number of strikes, work stoppages,
 blockades, and other militant actions rose in 1983 as workers
 increasingly felt the effects of food shortages and the steady
 loss of purchasing power in a deteriorating economy. In July,
 the miners, who are the most cohesively organized group, won the
 right of worker "co-management" in the state mining corporation.
 
 
 479
 The Government has also attempted to involve farmers' unions in
 its decisionmaking.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Citizens are free to practice the religion of their choice, and
 there are no restrictions on publishing, istablishing places of
 worship and religious schools, training clergy, or maintaining
 international ties. Bolivian law requires that religious groups
 be incorporated, but there is no state control or censorship.
 Since the return to civilian government, no clergy have been
 persecuted for their political beliefs or activities.
 Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion in Bolivia.
 Catholic bishops receive a nominal stipend from the state, but no
 other secular advantage is conferred. Protestant churches
 operate openly and freely. In 1982, a Protestant college opened
 in Santa Cruz. The Mormons and Seventh-Day Adventists
 prosyletize and run churches and training centers throughout the
 country. The small Jewish community is not disturbed as it was
 under military regimes, which tolerated neo-Nazi "paramilitary"
 groups that published anti-Semitic tracts. The Mennonites have
 large colonies in Santa Cruz.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions on travel within the country or
 abroad. The Bolivian Government neither encourages nor
 discourages emigration.
 Since May 26, 1983, all political exiles from previous military
 regimes have been allowed to return. Many who faced financial
 problems in returning were assisted by the Intergovernmental
 Committee on Migration, which had earlier sponsored their
 departure. An estimated 700 persons returned in 1982 and 250 in
 1983.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The inauguration of President Siles on October 10, 1982,
 culminated a long effort to restore freely elected, democratic
 government to Bolivia. Although he had received a plurality in
 the 1980 Presidential elections, he was prevented from taking
 office by a military coup led by Gen. Luis Garcia Meza. Over two
 years later, the Congress which had been elected in 1980 was
 finally seated and chose Siles as President under constitutional
 procedures. The next general elections are scheduled to be held
 in 1986.
 Twenty-seven political parties and fronts are represented in the
 Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. A myriad of other parties
 covering the ideological spectrum also functions, although they
 have no seats in the Congress. The two houses of Congress often
 take opposing sides on issues. Although the legislative branch
 is not strong under the Bolivian Constitution, it has rejected
 certain policies of the executive branch.
 The political system is dominated by persons of largely European
 origin. Indians, who make up an estimated 60 percent of the
 population, have little opportunity to advance to top positions
 because of economic disadvantages and cultural isolation.
 However, President Siles has chosen Indians as Ministers of
 Peasant and Agricultual Affairs, and he recently appointed
 
 
 480
 another Indian as a presidential adviser. There are several
 Indian Congressmen.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The present Bolivan Government has cooperated with the Working
 Group on Disappearances of the U.N. Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC) and with other international organizations. In March
 1983 the UNHRC, acting in light of the conclusion of its Special
 Envoy that the Government had demonstrated a complete respect for
 human rights, ended further consideration of the human rights
 situation in Bolivia. The Inter-American Human Rights Commission
 of the Organization of American States commended the Bolivian
 Government for drastically curbing violations of political
 liberties and for creating a commission to investigate the fate
 of missing persons from past regimes. The Americas Watch
 organization also lauded Bolivia for setting an example for the
 hemisphere of how the restoration of democracy can lead to gains
 in human rights. In its 1983 report, Amnesty International noted
 that since the current Government was formed it had received no
 further reports of political arrests in Bolivia and that the
 Government had taken steps to investigate killings and
 disappearances from previous military governments. Freedom House
 in 1983 gave Bolivia its highest rating of "free."
 In September 1983, the Executive Branch issued a Supreme Decree
 approving a series of eight U.N. conventions and protocols on
 human rights, which included those on apartheid, war crimes,
 slavery, the political rights of women, and the treatment of
 expatriates. The Commissions on Human Rights of the Senate and
 the Chamber of Deputies plan to propose legislation to ratify
 these conventions and give them the force of law.
 Of non-governmental organizations, the Catholic Church, the
 Permanent Assembly on Human Rights, and the press have been the
 most aggressive monitors of human rights in Bolivia. The
 Bolivian Episcopal Conference and some Protestant ministers
 played a role in the past in visiting detainees and speaking out
 against abuses. Individual Catholic bishops, many priests and
 such lay groups as the Bacherer and the Confederation of Lay
 Persons have been active in the investigation of social problems
 and, occasionally, human rights issues.
 In early October 1983, the National Conference of Religious
 Persons commented that, in spite of serious political and
 economic problems, the benefits of civilian democratic government
 in terms of respect for basic freedoms and for the dignity of the
 person have been enormous. The Permanent Assembly on Human
 Rights has continued its work, noting that while the human rights
 situation is vastly improved, the country's economic crisis
 threatens the fundamental rights of the people. Since the
 inauguration of the present Government, the Assembly has
 collaborated in the continuing investigation of missing persons
 and protested against the alleged presence of certain
 "paramilitaries" in government agencies. The executive branch
 has cooperated by giving the investigators access to information
 it has.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The World Bank's development report estimated Bolivia's
 population in 1983 at 5.8 million with a growth rate of 2.6
 percent. Current estimates by the National Institute of
 
 
 481
 Statistics place the population at 6.08 million. Life expectancy
 at birth is estimated at 50.2 years. The infant mortality rate,
 the highest in South America according to UNICEF, is 124.6 per
 1,000 live births. Data from the 1976 census indicates that 291
 out of 1,000 rural children die before their fifth year, compared
 to 186 per 1,000 urban children. Only 34 percent of the
 population had access to safe water in 1975 (the last year for
 which this statistic is available), and the calorie supply
 available for consumption relative to nutritional requirements
 was only 86.6 percent in 1977.
 For the past several years Bolivia has endured the longest, most
 severe economic crisis in its history. Added to the structural
 weaknesses of an economy which is highly centralized, dependent
 on international commodity markets, and burdened with a large
 foreign debt, were the burdens of world recession, reduced prices
 for mineral exports, and drought and flooding from the "El Nino"
 weather phenomenom. Losses from natural disasters exceeded 13
 percent of GDP and included a million-ton loss of food
 production. The state mining corporation, which is the country's
 main enterprise, suffered an estimated loss of over $150 million
 from 1976 through June 1983. Acute shortages of foreign exchange
 have left many banks and businesses unable to satisfy basic
 industrial needs.
 The Bolivian economy declined in 1982 by 9.2 percent in real
 terms as per capita gross national product (GNP) fell to $673.
 GDP dropped from an estimated $7.5 billion in 1981 to $6.9
 billion in 1982. Between December 1982 and June 1983, the annual
 rate of inflation rose to 151.5 percent, while the average
 Bolivian worker lost an estimated 42 percent in purchasing
 power. Hoarding, speculation, and smuggling have created
 shortages in basic goods such as sugar, bread, flour, meat,
 coffee, and kerosene. Hunger has sharply increased, especially
 in the rural areas hardest hit by drought. The urbanized middle
 classes are also suffering from the hyperinflation. The upper
 class has not been affected as adversely, since most can adjust
 their businesses to inflation, have savings or investments
 abroad, or have income denominated in U.Si dollars.
 The adult literacy rate was 62.7 percent in 1976, but more recent
 Bolivian estimates place it at about 73 percent. Public
 education is free and generally available in urban areas. Except
 in the most isolated areas, Bolivian rural youth can expect at
 least three years of schooling. The primary school enrollment
 ratio was appoximately 82 percent in 1980.
 Since 1952 racial discrimination has been banned in Bolivia.
 However, informal discrimination persists against persons of
 Indian ancestry, who tend to have lower incomes and social
 positions than do persons of European origin.
 Women do not enjoy a status in society equal to that of men. The
 main obstacles to advancement are cultural traditions, social
 conditions, and a lack of political power.  In rural families,
 women contribute significantly to economic activities but are
 considered subordinate and rarely participate in cooperatives,
 community meetings, or training programs. In Hispanic urban
 families, women are more likely to stay at home and be socially
 but not economically active. However, women are slowly achieving
 a greater role in Bolivian business life.
 While in general Bolivian laws do not discriminate against women,
 under the agrarian reform law title to land cannot pass to a
 woman even if she is widowed or divorced. Also, agricultural
 credit to women is restricted by most banks and lending
 institutions. Although by law women workers have the right to
 three months maternity leave, in practice most are unaware of
 
 
 482
 this right or are concerned that they will lose their salary or
 jobs if they exercise it. The Chamber of Deputies recently
 formed a Women's Commission which plans to work with the many
 organizations concerned with women's advancement, to challenge
 discriminatory practices, and to propose reform legislation such
 as the inclusion of domestic workers in the social security
 system.
 Although there is no overt political discrimination against
 women, they are rarely named to high-ranking positions in the
 Government. The most notable exception was Lydia Gueiler, who
 served as interim President from November 1979 to July 1980. The
 Congress which convened in October 1982 included three women
 Deputies along with a number of women as alternate Deputies and
 Senators.
