 BURMA
 Burma is a military dictatorship ruled by the 19-member State
 Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), which seized power
 in September 1988 after suppressing massive, countrywide,
 prodemocracy demonstrations. These demonstrations had led to
 the resignation of long-time military ruler Ne Win, whose
 policies had isolated Burma from the international community
 and engendered economic decline. The military imposed martial
 law and established the SLORC, headed by the armed forces
 commander-in-chief, as Burma's governing body. Members of this
 council are all senior military leaders. Although the military
 held a relatively free election in May 1990, it did not
 transfer power to the victorious party, which was headed by the
 leaders of the 1988 demonstrations. Moreover, it took further
 steps in 1991 to prolong its rule until a constitution and
 civilian leadership acceptable to the military can be
 produced. Such preconditions could well take years to fulfill.
 The military Government enforces martial law by posting troops
 in major urban centers and by a pervasive security apparatus
 composed of the military's Directorate of Defense Services
 Intelligence (DDSI) as well as several police intelligence
 agencies under the Ministry of Home and Religious Affairs. An
 11 p.m..to 4 a.m. curfew; surveillance of government employees
 and private citizens; restrictions on contact with foreigners;
 arrests, harassment, and torture of political activists; and
 repeated denunciations of agitators and foreign interference
 buttress the military's control.
 The military Government justifies its security apparatus as
 necessary to maintain law and order and to combat numerous
 ethnic insurgencies, though in recent years these have posed no
 threat to the country's major population centers. Insurgent
 groups engage in small-scale fighting, mostly in remote areas,
 in hopes of lessening domination by the ethnic Burman majority.
 Apart from the Karen National Union (KNU), these groups are
 financed mostly through trafficking in and/or producing
 narcotics.
 After Ne Win's 26-year rule reduced what was once Southeast
 Asia's richest land to a U.N.-designated "least developed
 country", -the new military Government formally abandoned his
 "Burmese Way to Socialism," opening up the economy to permit
 modest expansion of the private sector and attract foreign
 investment as well as badly needed foreign exchange. It has
 failed, however, to address fundamental problems: highly
 centralized decisionmaking; significant restrictions on private
 commercial activity; an overvalued currency; rapid monetary
 expansion; a timid, bloated bureaucracy; and disproportionate
 funding for military purposes.
 Politically motivated arrests decreased in 1991, perhaps due to
 reduced activity by'opposition groups that had been previously
 devastated by arrests of their members. Burma's deplorable
 human rights situation did not otherwise measurably improve.
 Politically motivated arrests continued throughout the year,
 particularly after the award of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize to
 opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Torture, arbitrary
 detentions, and compulsory labor persisted. The military
 Government's program for relocating many urban poor continues
 to wreak hardship, though some experts believe it also may
 serve legitimate long-term objectives. Freedom of speech, the
 press, assembly, and association remain practically nonexistent.
 The military continued to negate the right of the people to
 change their government by failing to implement the results of
 
 
 787
 BURMA
 the 1990 elections, in which the opposition National League for
 Democracy (NLD) won over 80 percent of the seats in a new
 National Assembly. The new Assembly has never been allowed to
 meet, 70 of its 485 members have been arrested on political
 charges, nearly 20 have fled the country, at least 6 have
 resigned, and at least 1 has died in custody.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no verifiable reports of government-directed
 political or extrajudicial killings in 1991. There were
 sufficient credible reports, however, to suggest that a few
 civilian deaths resulted.from brutality-in prison, including
 denial of medical treatment. Several political prisoners,
 including elected National Assembly member U Tin Maung Win and
 writer Ba Thaw (also known as Maung Thawka), died under
 circumstances aggravated by poor treatment in custody. There
 were also credible reports that over 100 political prisoners
 and common criminals died while performing forced labor under
 inhumane conditions.
 While there was no clear evidence that any summary executions
 were carried out -against civilians in 1991, some knowledgeable
 observers believe that secret extrajudicial killings
 occasionally occur. A number of death sentences were publicly
 announced after trials which fell far short of international
 standards. However, well-placed observers believe that none
 was actually carried out.
 b. Disappearance
 The number of people who disappeared during 1991 seems to be
 far smaller than in 1988 and 1989, but accurate estimates are
 again impossible. Family and friends assume that those who
 have disappeared are under detention or have died in jail.
 Some who disappeared were later reported as arrested. Others
 may have dropped out of sight or quietly attempted to leave the
 country for fear of arrest. A handful of youths continued to
 join student insurgent groups fighting the regime, while others
 were impressed as army porters.
 Authorities seldom responded to inquiries from embassies or
 from families concerning the whereabouts and welfare of
 disappeared or jailed people. The few replies routinely
 consisted of only general statements that such people were
 arrested for violations of existing laws.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Substantial evidence documents that torture, beatings and-
 mistreatment of political detainees continued to take place in
 Burmese prisons and detention centers operated by the DDSI.
 Maltreatment includes sleep and food deprivation; beatings of
 prisoners severe enough to cause permanent injury; suffocation;
 cigarette burns; electrical shocks to the genitals and
 elsewhere; and forcing prisoners to squat or assume unnatural
 positions for lengthy periods. Techniques designed to
 intimidate and disorient prisoners prior to interrogation are
 also routinely practiced. Prisoners assigned to forced labor,
 
 
 788
 
 BURMA
 such as sugarcane harvesting and road construction in remote
 areas, were reportedly given inadequate food, water, medical
 care, and protection from the elements.
 Guards and prison physicians also have deprived political
 prisoners of needed medical treatment. Imprisoned antiregime
 activists have received beatings after requesting medical
 attention, according to several well-sourced reports. Despite
 repeated expressions of concern by foreign governments and
 international human rights organizations, the regime made no
 apparent effort to investigate charges of torture or to punish
 members of the security forces involved. The military
 Government routinely denied that it engaged in torture or
 condoned the practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The regime arbitrarily detained or arrested hundreds of people
 during 1991, though exact figures are not available. Most were
 held only a short time and released after interrogation, but
 significant numbers were subsequently rearrested. Detainees
 were commonly accused of violating criminal statutes, although
 some were simply held without trial. Detention and
 interrogation of political party officials occurred regularly,
 either as harassment or reprisals for antigovernment statements
 or actions. In connection with the insurgent activity in the
 Irrawaddy Delta and the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Aung
 San Suu Kyi, for example, the military Government arrested 9
 Members of Parliament, over a dozen leaders of small political
 parties, and well over 200. rank and file members of opposition
 groups. While most detainees were members of-political parties
 or people involved in distributing antigovernment literature,
 businessmen and other private citizens were also subject to
 arbitrary detention.
 In July the military, without public announcement, extended by
 6 months the house arrest of National League for Democracy
 General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi, who in October was awarded
 the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize. The decision was taken under the
 provisions of the "Law to Safeguard the State From the Dangers
 of Subversive Elements"--also the basis for her initial year of
 house arrest which began in 1989. In August the military
 Government amended this law to authorize further 1-year
 extensions of arbitrary detention without charge or trial for
 up to 5 years. Aung San Suu Kyi has never been formally
 charged. Similarly, former Prime Minister U Nu has been held
 under house arrest since December 1989.
 Even before the establishment of martial law, there was no
 provision in Burmese law for judicial determination of the
 legality of detention. .Under martial law people have no
 pretrial rights. There is also no bail for defendants in
 martial law proceedings, though bail may be granted by civilian
 courts.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Burma remained under martial law throughout 1991. Official
 spokesmen on numerous occasions emphasized that the military
 Government rules according to martial law and is not bound by
 any constitutional restrictions. Military tribunals continue
 to exercise jurisdiction over all cases involving defiance of
 orders issued by the SLORC or local military commanders.
 Tribunals can mete out the death penalty, a life sentence, or a
 
 
 789
 BURMA
 minimum of 3 years' imprisonment with labor irrespective of
 existing legal provisions.
 The tribunals are free to summon or reject witnesses, and to
 consider or ignore evidence. The accused is not presumed
 innocent and has no right to a defense attorney. When allowed
 to participate, a defense attorney's role is severely limited.
 Lawyers have been warned that an overly aggressive defense
 could jeopardize both attorney and client. Subject to certain
 conditions, appeal is possible. Sentences of 3 years'
 imprisonment may be appealed to the regional commander within
 30 days. In cases involving the death sentence, life
 imprisonment, or sentences of over 3 years, appeals may be
 lodged within 30 days with the army commander-in-chief.
 Significantly, among dozens of cases known to be tried by
 military tribunals, there have been no reports of acquittals or
 of any convictions being overturned on appeal.
 In 1991 the military courts continued to hand out heavy
 sentences to political prisoners, ranging up to 25 years'
 imprisonment for peaceful opposition activity. Also in 1991,
 some political sentences were arbitrarily extended. For
 example, opposition leaders Chit Khine and Kyi Maung had been
 sentenced in 1990 to 7 and 10 years' imprisonment, respectively,
 but in 1991 their prison terms were each extended by an
 additional 10 years.
 The number of political prisoners in Burma remains impossible
 to estimate, but credible sources suggest that as many as 2,000
 may be in jail. Rangoon's Insein Prison as well as prisons in
 Mandalay, Tharrawaddy, Kalemyo, and at least three other
 locations reportedly hold political prisoners. The military
 Government denies holding any political prisoners and maintains
 that all those jailed are common lawbreakers and insurgent
 "terrorists." However, the military Government's own
 propaganda makes clear that it considers such acts as
 possession of opposition literature and tape recordings to be
 tantamount to "terrorism." Despite martial law, civil suits
 and common crimes of no interest to the State are left to
 civilian courts. Though corruption remains widespread and
 judges are vulnerable to pressure from military authorities,
 some informed sources report that these civilian courts have
 become somewhat more professional and fair in handling
 nonpolitical cases since 1988. Most political cases are
 handled by military courts. Some basic due process rights,
 including the right to a public trial and to be represented by
 a defense attorney, are generally respected by civilian judges.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The State continued to intrude extensively into the lives of
 private citizens during 1991. Forced entry and warrantless,
 unannounced searches of private homes were often conducted.
 The military Government strictly monitored the travel,
 whereabouts, and activities of many Burmese, including
 political leaders elected in 1990. A ubiquitous system of
 neighborhood informers reported on dissidents and critics of
 the military Government. Civil servants and political party
 officials were also ordered to report whether any of their
 relatives had fled the country or contacted insurgent
 organizations. Security personnel selectively monitored
 private correspondence and telephone calls. Contacts or
 communications involving foreigners were subject to especially
 intense scrutiny, and government employees were generally
 
 
 790
 BURMA
 required to obtain advance permission from higher authorities
 before meeting with foreigners.
 The military Government continued a program of forced
 resettlement, involving an estimated half-million people
 throughout the country since 1989. While the military
 Government described all those forced to move as "squatters,"
 some people had been living on these properties for many years
 and had constructed permanent houses. Persons who protested
 resettlement were subject to arrest, and there were credible
 reports that the authorities continued to use intimidation and
 threats of force against reluctant neighborhoods. Unconfirmed
 reports also allege official involvement in land speculation in
 areas vacated through the resettlement program. The military
 Government has resettled people, almost totally at their own
 expense, to "new towns" which are far from their previous
 residences. Occupants quite often live on abandoned rice paddy
 land, subject to flooding in the rainy season, without adequate
 transportation, medical facilities, or sanitation. However,
 conditions at some resettlement sites were generally improving
 in 1991, and some outside experts accept-the military
 Government's explanation that the resettlement program serves
 legitimate long-term urban planning objectives. They do not,
 however, endorse the forceful methods often used to move people.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 There were no confirmed reports in 1991 of deaths from the use
 of excessive government force to put down peaceful opposition
 demonstrations. There was, however, one credible report that
 at least two people suffocated to death in an overcrowded
 police van immediately after wholesale arrests on suspicion of
 insurgent activity.
 The Burmese Army has battled diverse insurgencies for- more than
 four decades. These conflicts have resulted in numerous human
 rights violations on both sides, including mistreatment and
 killing of prisoners, neglect of sick and wounded, impressment
 of civilians for porter duty, and indiscriminate attacks on
 civilians.
 In 1991 there were some reliable reports of deaths of impressed
 Burmese army porters. The Burmese military continues to use
 civilian corvee labor and prison labor in combat areas. There
 were reliable reports, for example, that several hundred
 prisoners were sent from Rangoon's Insein prison to work as
 porters in the military's Irrawaddy Delta campaign. Credible
 reports from multiple sources indicate that porters carry
 ammunition, supplies, and wounded under the harshest
 conditions. Other well-placed sources also note that they are
 subject to hostile fire as well as maltreatment at the hands of
 Burmese soldiers. They are placed at the head of columns to
 detonate mines and booby traps and to spring ambushes. When
 porters are wounded, fall ill, or become unable to continue
 their work, they are left unattended to die. At the end of
 their service, survivors often must find their own means to
 return home.
 Government-controlled media routinely cited numerous examples
 of insurgent violence causing civilian and military deaths,
 including several reports that the KNU and other insurgent
 organizations killed civilians during attacks on villages and
 ambushes along transportation routes. There were also credible
 reports that the KNU executed two people accused of spying for
 
 
 791
 BURMA
 the military Government after a "trial" by the opposition
 Democratic Alliance of Burma.
 As in past years, Burmese authorities denied impartial
 observers permission to travel to areas of heavy insurgent
 activity ostensibly for security reasons. Information about
 human rights abuses by either side in those areas is therefore
 all but impossible to verify.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties,. Including:.
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Severe restrictions on freedom of speech persisted throughout
 1991. Though the degree of enforcement varied, the military
 Government did not tolerate opposing views and criticism.
 Private citizens remained reluctant to express opinions for
 fear of government informers. The military GovernLent
 continued to ban publications Qhich criticized its programs and
 policies.
 Government propaganda repeatedly denounced various foreign news
 organizations for interference in Burma's affairs. Censors
 occasionally banned issues of newsmagazines with articles
 criticizing regime practices or reporting activities of
 opposition figures or groups. While the military Government
 continued to discourage listening to foreign radio broadcasts,
 these remained a major source of information for the Burmese
 people and even the military.
 The military Government continues to operate the mass media,
 including television, radio, and the only newspapers, the
 Working People's Daily and Rangoon's City News. Military
 officials appoint newspaper editors and approve editorials in
 advance. Especially for domestic news, journalists must
 observe strict publishing and broadcast guidelines. The
 military Government receives the product of several wire
 services, but selects and edits international news before
 publication or broadcast. All forms of communication--domestic
 and imported books and periodicals, stage plays, motion
 pictures, and musical recordings--are officially controlled and
 censored. Criticism of the military Government, its officials,
 or sectors of the economy it controls or partially controls is
 not permitted.
 In 1991 the official media spearheaded the military
 Government's determined propaganda campaign against "decadent"
 Western culture. Burmese were discouraged from adopting
 Western styles of music, dance, and dress. Nevertheless,
 foreign audio and video recordings, as well as modern Western
 clothing, remained widely available and extremely popular in
 Burma.
 University teachers and professors are subject to the same
 restrictions on freedom of speech, political activities, and
 publications as other government employees. These include
 frequent warnings against criticism of the military Government;
 repeated instructions not to discuss politics while at work;
 and strictures against joining or supporting political parties,
 engaging in political activity, and meeting foreign officials.
 The military Government began a purge of civil servants and
 teachers in September, accusing them of lack of political
 loyalty and "deceptive practices." At least several hundred,
 and perhaps thousands, were fired from their jobs.
 
 
 792
 BURIMA
 Virtually the entire Burmese university system was closed from
 the time of the 1988 disturbances until May 1991. Prior to the
 opening of the new academic year in October 1991, all educators
 were required to complete questionnaires concerning their
 loyalty to the military Government and their personal political
 views. In actions separate from the purge described above,
 several dozen teachers and administrators were reportedly
 dismissed because the authorities deemed their answers
 insufficiently supportive of official policy. Similar
 mandatory questionnaires were distributed during 1991 to other
 civil servants and political party officials, who were then
 faced with a choice between renouncing their political views or
 likely arrest. Students were allowed to return to university -
 only.after they and their parents signed promises not to engage
 in any antigovernment activity. When Rangoon and Mandalay
 students nevertheless staged prodemocracy demonstrations on
 December 10 and 11, the military Government once again
 announced the indefinite closure of all universities-, colleges,
 and technical schools.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The military Government does not respect the right to freedom
 of peaceful assembly. A martial law edict prohibiting outdoor
 assemblies of more than five people was again unevenly
 enforced, but political demonstrations were strictly banned.
 Political parties were required to requestopermission from
 military authorities even to hold internal meetings of their
 own membership. The military's intimidation generally served
 to discourage public expressions of antigovernment sentiments.
 However, on December 10 and 11, hundreds of university students
 demonstrated peacefully in Rangoon and Mandalay in support of
 detained Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and for
 democracy. The military Government responded by sending in
 large numbers of heavily armed troops, arresting well over 100
 people, and closing all of the country!s higher education
 institutions'for an indefinite period. In a few other reported
 instances of opposition political activity, security forces
 intervened swiftly to arrest participants in unauthorized
 meetings and to halt distribution of'antigovernment leaflets.
 The right of association exists only for those organizations
 permitted by law and duly registered with the military
 Government. Moreover, the military Government severely
 restricts the activities of even these organizations.
 Seventy-five political parties remained formally legal at the
 end of 1991, but they were effectively paralyzed through
 arrests, intimidation, and constant surveillance. Under
 intense government pressure, the leading opposition National
 League for Democracy (NLD) dropped several detained leaders
 from its Central Executive Committee and expelled General
 Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi from the party.
 Trade associations and professional bodies, like other
 organizations, are permitted only if sanctioned by the military
 Government, which strictly monitors their activities. Members
 are not free to discuss politics or criticize the regime. The
 military Government took steps during.1991 to establish tight
 control over the hitherto independent Burmese Chamber of
 Commerce. The old chamber was dissolved and replaced by an
 association packed with 4overnment officials.
 
 
 793
 BURMA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in law and widely observed
 in practice. The great majority of Burmese are Buddhist, and
 the military Government frequently proclaims its commitment to
 Buddhism in seeking to establish its own legitimacy. Sizable
 numbers of Christians, Muslims, and animists exist among
 various minority ethnic groups. While generally allowing these
 groups to practice freely, security services monitor the
 activities of some religious communities. The military
 Government requires all religious organizations to register,
 and subjects religious publications to the same control and
 censorship imposed on secular ones. In 1991 there were
 numerous, but often unsubstantiated, reports that government
 troops committed abuses against Muslim populations in Arakan
 State, including destroying of mosques and Muslim cemeteries
 and carrying out several hundred arrests and beatings, and
 dozens of rapes. While the area is inaccessible to independent
 .observers and many of the accusations appear exaggerated,
 credible sources report that upwards of 20,000 Muslim refugees
 fled from Arakan State to Bangladesh. The military Government
 has denied allegations of abuse while acknowledging that a
 relatively small number of arrests were made, largely for
 illegal currency transactions and smuggling. Some refugees have
 claimed that the Burmese Army forcibly uprooted civilian
 populations, an apparent response to actions of at least two
 insurgent groups in Arakan State that seek to achieve autonomy
 through armed struggle.
 In the fall of 1990, the authorities arrested upwards of 100
 politically active Buddhist clerics, outlawed several groups of
 opposition monks, and took other repressive measures in
 reaction to organized passive opposition by monks in Mandalay
 and elsewhere. While only a handful of monks were reportedly
 arrested in 1991, little information emerged on the whereabouts
 or fate. of those monks previously detained. Restrictions on
 unauthorized religious groups remained in force, and military
 authorities continued to monitor activities in and around
 Buddhist monasteries and pagodas.
 Religious groups can and do establish links with coreligionists
 in other countries, although such links are reportedly
 monitored by the military Government. The Catholic Church, for
 example, maintains ties to the Vatican. Foreign religious
 representatives are usually allowed only tourist visas and are
 not permitted to preach, proselytize, or remain to carry out
 missionary activities. Permanent missionary establishments
 have not been permitted since the 1960's.
 As part of its large-scale "urban development" program in
 recent years, the military Government has taken control of
 several Christian and Muslim properties throughout Burma. In
 1991 credible sources report that more than 10 Muslim mosques
 were seized by the military Government nationwide. Muslim
 cemeteries were reportedly destroyed in Mandalay, Moulmein, and
 Pegu.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 AlthoughBurmese citizens have the legal right to live anywhere
 in th&:country, an estimated 500,000 poor urban residents have
 beengorgibly relocated to rural areas since 1989. Except for
 limi , '   in areas of insurgent.activity, Burmese citizens
 may  eTf:Yreely within the country but must inform local
 
 
 BURMA
 authorities of their temporary place of residence. People who
 fail to report either guests or intentions to stay overnight to
 the authorities are subject to a jail term, and arrests are
 occasionally made. Throughout the year, the military
 Government imposed an 11 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew on the entire
 country. In most cases, the curfew was strictly enforced.
 Burmese authorities do not recognize the right of everyone to
 leave his or her own country. Passport applicants must justify
 the reason for each trip abroad, generally supported by an
 employment offer or similar document. Legal requirements,
 bureaucratic procedures, and corruption cause long delays in
 obtaining passports. Emigrants must reimburse the military
 Government for "educational expenses" before receiving exit
 permission and are severely limited in what they may take with
 them Those who leave the country illegally may return but
 must go through judicial proceedings.
 Burmese citizens who leave the country legally are generally
 allowed to return to visit relatives. However, the law does
 not recognize dual citizenship, and acquiring citizenship in
 another country results in loss of Burmese nationality. While
 those who take citizenship in another country are legally
 banned from returning, the military Government has shown
 flexibility within the last 2 years in permitting some former
 Burmese to visit for brief periods. Emigrants wishing to
 return permanently are required to reapply for Burmese
 citizenship, and approval is not guaranteed. Noncitizen
 residents, including ethnic Indians and Chinese born in Burma
 who hold foreigners' registration cards, must obtain prior
 permission to travel.
 Foreign refugees or displaced people may not resettle or seek
 safe haven within Burma. The military Government treats people
 claiming to be refugees as illegal immigrants and expels or
 imprisons them.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Burma is governed solely by the military, and the Burmese
 people do not have the right or the ability peacefully to
 change their government. In the past 3 years, active duty
 military officers replaced civilians in important positions
 throughout the bureaucracy. The military occupied every
 cabinet-level position except that of foreign minister,
 numerous director general and subordinate posts, and key
 positions previously held by technocrats in the economic
 ministries.
 On May 27, 1990, the military Government held Burma's first
 national election involving multiple parties in 30 years.
 While the election campaign was severely restricted and several
 leading opposition figures were barred from participation,
 election day procedures were free and fair.
 In the election, the National League for Democracy (NLD)
 received nearly 60 percent of valid votes cast and over 80
 percent of the parliamentary seats. By the end of 1991,
 however, the military Government still had not transferred
 power. Meanwhile, it arrested most of the leadership of the
 NLD. In late 1991, the military Government exerted pressure
 against NLD leaders at the national, state, division, and
 township levels by querying them about whom they considered to
 be the leader of their'party. The leaders were given to
 understand that neither the name of jailed NLD Chairman Tin Oo
 
 
 795
 BURMA
 nor that of detained General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi would
 be appropriate answers. By the end of 1991, a total of over 90
 elected opposition parliamentarians were either in custody, in
 exile, or dead. Dozens of politically active people, including
 parliamentarians and leaders of minor opposition parties, were
 detained and pressured to denounce the Nobel Prize. In July
 the military Government also retroactively amended the election
 law to provide for disqualification of elected parliamentarians
 on a wide range of grounds, including conviction for vaguely
 defined crimes involving "moral turpitude." The authorities
 now insist that transfer of power to a civilian government can
 occur only after completion of a protracted constitution-
 drafting process under its control. The conditions it has
 imposed effectively negate the election results and ensure
 indefinite military rule.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No internal human rights organizations are allowed to exist. A
 group called Amnesty International of Burma, established during
 the 1988 prodemocracy demonstrations, was subsequently denied
 registration as a legal organization. The military Government
 resents outside scrutiny of its human rights record. It is
 only selectively willing to discuss human rights problems with
 foreign governments or nongovernmental organizations and
 routinely denies visas to foreign officials other than U.N.
 experts concerned with human rights. The military consistently
 denies charges of abuses and criticizes other governments and
 independent organizations for interfering in its affairs.
 Many nongovernmental organizations and governments have
 repeatedly and publicly expressed concern over various human
 rights abuses in Burma. The February 1990 meeting of the -
 United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) appointed an
 "independent expert" who visited Burma to examine Burma's human
 rights situation and who subsequently presented a confidential
 report to the UNHRC's 1991 session. The UNHRC decided to keep
 the case of human rights in Burma under review for another
 year, and a new independent expert visited Burma in October.
 While the 6xpert met with senior Burmese officials and visited
 Insein prison, the government-arranged and supervised program
 provided little scope for interaction with the Burmese people.
 In November the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution
 urging Burma's government to establish a democratic state and
 to allow all citizens to participate freely in the democratic
 process. The resolution, which Burma's U.N. representative
 rejected as "interference" in Burma's internal affairs, also
 expressed concern about Burma's "grave" human rights situation
 and recalled an appeal by the U.N. Secretary General for the
 release of detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Burma's numerous ethnic minorities have been underrepresented
 in the military Government and largely excluded from the
 military leadership. These minorities have their own distinct
 cultures and languages. Despite recently increased government
 attention to the problem, economic development among minorities
 continued to lag and many still live at the subsistence level.
 This is due in part to geographic factors which impede economic
 development in the rugged, isolated, border areas populated by
 minorities. People of nonethnic Burmese ancestry, primarily
 
 
 796
 BURMA
 Indians and Chinese, are denied full citizenship and excluded
 from government positions. In addition, some have been denied
 national identity cards, especially in Arakan State. Indian
 and Chinese minorities continue-to play an important role in
 the economy-a situation resented by many Burmans. Social
 prejudice against the country's Muslim community has in the
 past erupted into violence and prompted official actions
 infringing on the practice of Islam. Multiple, reliable
 sources indicate that the military occasionally requires
 minority populations to provide without compensation vehicles,
 equipment, and lodging for soldiers.
 Women in Burma have traditionally enjoyed a relatively high
 status. They exercise the same basic rights as men and have an
 active role in business. They keep their own names after
 marriage and often control family finances. Female
 participation is low in the minuscule industrial sector and in
 the bureaucracy. There are no women's rights organizations in
 Burma.
 There is no violence directed specifically against women and
 authorities appeared generally to treat detained women better
 than men. Although Burmese culturally view rape with great
 abhorrence, there were nonetheless widespread unconfirmed
 reports of rapes committed in 1991 by Burmese soldiers against
 Muslimwomen in Arakan State, as well as some allegations of
 such incidents elsewhere in the country.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 After seizing power.in 1988, the military banned the workers'
 and peasants' organizations established by the previous
 Government. Several political parties established workers'
 organizations or committees to consider labor issues, but there
 continue to be no trade unions and no independent labor
 movement in Burma. Workers are not free to form or join trade
 unions of their own choosing, and leaders of unofficial labor
 associations are subject to arrest.. Workers do not have the
 right to strike and none did so in 1991.
 In April 1989, the United States suspended Burma's eligibility
 for trade concessions under the Generalized System of
 Preferences program (GSP) pending steps to afford its labor
 force internationally recognized worker rights. In 1990 a
 United States interagency government committee declined a
 formal request to reconsider the suspension.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers have no right t& organize and bargain collectively.
 Military authorities are the sole arbiter of workers' issues.
 The regime abolished labor arbitration boards which, while
 government controlled, at least theoretically provided means
 for airing labor disputes. No special export processing
 economic zones exist.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Burma's legal code does not prohibit forced labor. The
 military Government routinely employs corvee labor on its
 myriad building projects and, according to credible reports,
 officials at times accept bribes to excuse people from work.

 BURMA
 The Burmese army has for decades conscripted civilian males to
 serve as porters. According to numerous eyewitness reports
 this past year, the army continued to take youths off the
 streets in various cities in minority areas. Women are now
 also being impressed as cooks and launderers for soldiers in
 front-line areas, according to one report. Military
 authorities commonly permit conscripted persons and their
 families to pay money in lieu of serving as porters.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children aged 13 to 15 may work 4 hours a day.' The penalty for
 employers who disregard this regulation, 2 years in prison,
 generally is not enforced. In cities, working children are
 highlyvisible. Many spend their nights on the street,
 according to numerous reliable sources. They are hired at
 lower rates than adults for the same kind of work, and economic
 pressure forces them to work not only for their survival but
 also to support their families.
 Burmese law requires children to attend school through the
 fourth standard, usually reached between the ages of 12 and
 15. The Department of Basic Education estimates, however, that
 38 percent of children aged 5 to 9 never enroll in school. Of
 those who do, less than 30 percent complete the fourth grade.
 Two-thirds of Burma's primary school children, primarily in
 rural areas, leave school for economic reasons. In the higher
 grades, the drop-out rate for girls is double that of boys.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is a legally prescribed 5-day, 35-hour workweek for
 employees in the public sector and a 6-day, 44-hourworkweek
 for private and parastatal sector employees, with overtime paid
 for additional work. Workers have 21 paid holidays a year.
 While there is a government mandated minimum wage, it is
 insufficient to provide a decent standard of living. The
 actual average wage rate for casual laborers in Rangoon is
 about twice the official minimum. Wages continue to lag far
 behind inflation. There are numerous provisions to protect
 health and safety at workplaces, pertaining to room size,
 ventilation, fire hazards, and the availability of latrines and
 drinking water. In practice, these are seldom enforced,
 particularly in the private sector.
