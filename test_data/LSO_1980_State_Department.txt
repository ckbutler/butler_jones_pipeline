 LESOTHO
 Lesotho, a nation with a highly literate population and a
 tradition of political activism, has a history of simmering
 political unrest marked by occasional incidents of violence.
 The present government came to power when Lesotho gained
 independence in 1966. After the elections in 1970, the
 government annulled the results and suspended the constitu-
 tion. Ensuing protests were suppressed. Opposition
 continued, however, and in 1974, after averting a feeble
 coup, government authorities made a number of arrests. The
 opposition leader fled the country. About a score of
 persons were convicted of various crimes in connection with
 the coup attempt; others were acquitted. All are now free.
 Though the government suspended written guarantees of
 individual rights in 1970 when it suspended the constitu-
 tion, the existence of an independent and impartial
 judiciary has mitigated actual violations of human rights.
 In recent years, the government has embarked on a strategy
 of national reconciliation, which has included lifting the
 state of emergency, and appointing members of the opposition
 parties to key cabinet positions and the interim National
 Assembly.
 Unsatisfied with these moves, the opposition    turned to
 violence with a series of bombings and sabotage attempts in
 April 1979. In November 1979, a village chief and an
 eighteen-year-old girl in northern Lesotho were killed by
 members of the opposition. Subsequent police operations
 conducted in villages considered sympathetic to the exiles
 reportedly led to several deaths and prompted over seven
 hundred villagers to seek refuge in neighboring South
 Africa. Interred in a refugee camp there, these persons
 have gradually been returning to Lesotho.
 In 1980 there have been a series of armed attacks on
 villages along the South African border. The government
 responded by increasing police patrols in troubled areas
 and detaining and questioning persons considered to be
 opposition sympathizers. At the same time amnesty has
 been offered those opposition leaders who wish to return
 to Lesotho and work peacefully with the current government.
 A few have accepted the offer and returned to the country
 unmolested.
 1.     Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no law which specifically forbids torture,
 but prohibition of its use derives from common law through
 court-established precedents. Public law Section 233,
 Subsection 1 states that confessions may not be extracted
 under duress. The courts have construed this as a prohibi-
 tion against torture or assault by the police and have
 extended this construction to protect those detained under
 the security act. No instances of torture have been alleged
 in 1980 and there is no evidence that it is practiced or
 countenanced.
 
 
 139
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is
 forbidden by law. No instances of such practices have been
 alleged in recent years. In general, prison conditions in
 Lesotho are acceptable, and prisoners are humanely treated.
 C.    Disappearances
 Under the provisions of the security act, detainees may
 be held incommunicado up to 60 days. The law does not
 oblige the gOve=rt to inform the public or the family of
 the detainee.  Recent detentions,however, have been well
 publicized in both the South African press and Lesotho's
 Sesotho language press. No one is known to have disappeared
 permanently. Most detainees have been held 10-14 days, one
 for as long as four weeks.
 d.    Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under emergency security legislation adopted in 1974,
 persons can be arrested without charge and detained for
 renewable periods of 60 days. Detention may not be chal-
 lenged in the courts. The legislation contains no provision
 for public acknowledgment of a person's detention.
 In response to continued opposition attacks the government
 has detained and questioned several persons associated
 with the opposition party. In such cases, the detainees
 have usually been held for two weeks and then released
 without any further restrictions upon their activities.
 All those imprisoned for participating in the 1974 coup
 attempt have been released.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 No trial is accorded to persons detained under the emergency
 security legislation. All other persons arrested are
 accorded public trial with the right to legal counsel. The
 judiciary in Lesotho retains its independence and integrity;
 a public trial, including rights of appeal, was granted to
 the leaders of the unsuccessful 1974 coup attempt.
 f.    Invasion of the Home
 There have been no allegations in 1980 of invasion of the
 home. Warrants are required for ordinary police officials
 to enter private homes, but senior police officers may
 enter homes without warrants at their discretion.
 2.    Government  Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Lesotho is an extremely poor country with a per capita
 income of approximately $280 per year (according to
 World Bank estimates) and a heavy dependence on foreign
 assistance.
 Lesotho's dependence on South Africa for virtually all its
 economic needs has made it intensely aware of its vulner-
 ability to economic disruptions (e.g. United Nations
 sanctions against South Africa) or politically-inspired
 economic pressures from its powerful neighbor. It has
 therefore given priority to projects aimed at reducing its
 dependence. The government recognizes the dilemma this
 priority poses for development and the danger of reducing
 
 
 140
 emphasis on the needs of the poor. It has cooperated with
 donor efforts to focus aid increasingly on fundamental
 problems of agriculture, health and education. It has
 encouraged foreign investment and sought to concentrate it
 in labor-intensive industries in order to increase limited
 domestic employment opportunities.
 Public and private corruption exists in Lesotho, although
 it has not affected the implementation of foreign aid
 programs. There are indications that political and family
 loyalties are a factor in the provison of government
 services or in admittance to the university in obtaining
 government employment. In the past year there have
 been some incidents in which qualified students lost
 government-administered university scholarships because
 of their anti-government views.
 Lesotho's tax system is progressive. Taxes are collected
 primarily from those employed in the small cash sector,
 particularly the civil service, where real wages are
 considerably higher than in the rural subsistence
 sector.
 The government has demonstrated a commitment to improving
 the educational system in Lesotho, both as regards the
 relevance of the curricular content to the country's
 development needs, and the access of all elements of the
 population to basic educational facilities. Primary
 enrollment increased at an approximate rate of 1.6percentper
 annum for the ten years through 1976, with over 70 percent
 of primary school age boys and over 90 percent of primary
 school age girls now in school. In secondary schools
 enrollments have increased markedly in the past decade,
 the total number of teachers has increased, the percentage
 of formally trained teachers has improved, and the student-
 teacher ration has improved.
 Because so many men seek work in South Africa, the
 majority of farms in Lesotho are worked by women. Women
 hold a significant number of responsible positions in the
 civil service.
 3.    Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.    Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Lesotho has no restrictions on religion but the provisions
 of the security act restrict freedom of speech. Free
 assembly is not guaranteed; consequently political
 organizations must receive permission of the government
 before they can meet. However, the Sesotho language
 newspapers published by the Roman Catholic and Lesotho
 Evangelical churches remain free to criticize the government.
 The government has criticized the papers but has not
 attempted to close them. Government sinecures and
 scholarships are sometimes used as a reward for
 cooperation.
 b.    Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel    Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on domestic travel and few on
 emigration. Obtaining the required police security
 clearance for the issuance of an international passport
 has proved difficult for some opponents of the government.
 
 
 141
 One outspoken member of the opposition has been denied
 travel documentation on security grounds to prevent his
 leaving Lesotho. Lesotho has acceded to the 1951 conven-
 tion on refugees and its 1967 protocol and has taken in
 refugees and exiles from South Africa, who are generally
 well treated.
 c.    Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political activity has been restricted since 1970, when
 the government suspended the constitution and declared
 a state of emergency. In 1973 an interim national assembly
 was established to act as a legislative branch. While all
 members are appointed by the government, they include
 representatives of the opposition and important local
 interest groups as well as a number of traditional chiefs.
 This process.gradually has been expanded until virtually
 all national political groups have some representation
 in the government. No plans for elections have been
 announced.
 On the local level, citizens can participate in the
 political process through village development committees
 and through the traditional public meeting, the pitso.
 At the national level, individual political participation
 is limited to those who support the government.
 Labor unions are allowed to bargain collectively with
 employers and enter into contracts, but are discouraged
 from political activity. The government recognizes
 the right to strike, and one strike occurred during the
 past year. Women have equal suffrage rights. The small
 minority of white citizens of Lesotho experience no
 apparent discrimination.
 4.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The government of Lesotho does not deny that violations
 of human rights have occurred and discusses past repressive
 measures openly. The government has allowed outside investi-
 gations of alleged human rights violations. In mid-1978 it
 met with representatives of Amnesty International to discuss
 the few persons still imprisoned at that time for partici-
 pation in the 1974 coup attempt.
