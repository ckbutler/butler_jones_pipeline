 IRELAND
 Ireland attaches great importance to the observance and
 maintenance of human rights. Individual liberties and civil
 rights are guaranteed and protected by the constitution.
 Ireland has signed the International Covenant on Civil and
 Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic,
 Social and Cultural Rights, and plays an active role in human
 rights questions in the United Nations. Political
 institutions are democratic, and political life is orderly.
 The growth of terrorist activities resulting from the civil
 unrest in Northern Ireland, including the murder of the
 British Ambassador and bombings of hotels, stores and pubs in
 Dublin in 1976, caused the Irish government to introduce
 legislation to combat terrorism. The Parliament adopted this
 legislation. The August 1979 murder of Earl Mountbatten by
 the Provisional Irish Republican Army prompted an Irish
 government review of security measures but did not result in
 any new legislation.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by Article 40 of the
 Constitution of 1937 and respected in practice..
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Constitutional protections against such conduct generally are
 observed. Amnesty International, in a 1977 report, expressed
 concern about alleged maltreatment of detainees or prisoners,
 especially where terrorism or other serious crimes may have
 been involved. In response, the government appointed a
 special committee headed by a retired judge to consider the
 allegations and make recommendations on measures to safeguard
 the rights of prisoners and detainees. This committee's
 report was made public in September 1978. The government
 stated that a majority of the recommendations were either
 accepted or already in effect. Those recommendations
 accepted by the government included informing those persons
 needing to know of an arrest made, and permitting the suspect
 to write his own statement. Recommendations already in
 effect included informing the suspect of his rights,
 maintaining police records on all developments in arrest
 cases and stressing in police training the proper treatment
 of persons arrested. The government withheld application of
 some committee recommendations pending further examination
 and rejected others. Amnesty International issued a
 statement in October 1978 urging the government to reconsider
 several of the rejected proposals, such as permitting
 solicitors to attend interrogations and establishment of an
 independent complaints tribunal.
 There is no summary execution and no discrimination in
 treatment of prisoners due to race, religion, sex or social
 class. Conditions in places of detention generally are
 adequate, though several prisons have problems of
 overcrowding.

 C.   Disappearances
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested or held in
 clandestine detention by the Irish authorities, nor does the
 Irish government condone such practices by any element of
 society.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Article 40 of the Irish Constitution states that deprivation
 of personal liberty shall be only in accordance with the law
 and provides for habeas corpus. In 1976, the spillover of
 terrorist activities arising from the Northern Ireland
 situation led the Irish government to declare a state of
 emergency and to allow police to detain persons up to seven
 days without charge. A party to the European Convention on
 Human Rights, Ireland availed itself of the rights of
 derogation permitted under the Convention until security
 conditions improved. The new Irish government elected in
 June 1977 decided to return to a maximum period of two days
 of detention without charge. This took effect October 12,
 1977. There are no political crimes per se under Irish law
 and therefore no political status for any convicted persons.
 A number of those convicted for terrorist offenses are
 members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army and other
 illegal organizations.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public-trial is guaranteed by Articles 38 and 40 of the
 constitution and respected in practice. The courts are
 independent of executive and military control. Article 38
 provides, however, for special criminal courts. The Offenses
 against the State Act of 1939 established such courts and
 provided that they may try persons for offenses against
 national security. Trial is by a panel of jurists, not by
 jury. The panel is uneven in number but no less than three;
 the verdict is by majority vote. Rules of evidence generally
 are similar to those of regular courts, but the statement of
 a police Chief Superintendent that the accused is a member of
 an illegal organization is considered evidence of such
 membership. Court sessions are usually public but may
 exclude certain persons, except genuine press
 representatives. There -is provision for free legal aid and
 appeal against conviction of sentence.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by Article 40
 of the constitution and respected in practice. Search
 warrants are required for entry to private property and are
 issued by District Justices, Peace Commissioners and, in
 cases involving the Offenses against the State Act of 1939,
 by Police Superintendents.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Successive Irish governments have successfully promoted
 industrialization and diversification and have raised living
 standards considerably. Generous incentives have encouraged
 investments by Irish and foreign firms. Social and
 educational services have been expanded and improved. With
 the gross national product growing by almost four percent per
 
 
 823
 year through the 1970s, Ireland has made considerable
 progress in providing for the economic needs of the
 population.
 The present government has a firm commitment to improve the
 quality of life for all citizens. This commitment has been
 challenged in 1980 by slowing economic activity,
 unemployment, which reached 10 percent in October 1980, and
 high inflation. Although constrained by a large trade
 deficit and a high level of official borrowing, the
 government has sought to frame policies to stimulate
 employment and economic growth in a non-inflationary manner.
 Article 43 of the constitution guarantees the right of
 private property. In practice, Ireland has a mixed economy.
 State-owned corporations operate in a number of spheres, most
 notably in public transportation and public utilities, but
 most economic activity remains in the private sphere.
 Article 45 (4.2) of the constitution provides that the state
 shall endeavor to ensure that the strength and health of
 workers, men and women, and the tender age of children shall
 not be abused, and that citizens shall not be forced by
 economic necessity to undertake employment unsuited to their
 sex, age or strength. A large body of law regulates safety
 and other aspects of working conditions.
 More than half of all employed persons in Ireland belong to
 trade unions. Unions representing about 95 percent of all
 union members are affiliated with the Irish Congress of Trade
 Unions (ICTU). In recent years, broad questions of wage
 increases and working conditions have been negotiated by the
 ICTU and the Federated Union of Employers. These national
 wage agreements have helped reduce the number of major
 strikes and improve labor-management relations. In October
 1980, final agreement was reached on a new national wage
 agreement which covers a term of fifteen months and provides
 for pay increases of some sixteen percent, in addition to
 improvements in the areas of taxation, health, social welfare
 and education. The government played an active role in
 facilitating this agreement.
 Economic modernization has been accompanied by changing
 social patterns, especially in the status of women, who now
 comprise one-third of the work force. The
 Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act of December 31, 1975 requires
 equal pay for equal work, and the Employment Equality Act of
 July 1, 1977 makes discrimination on grounds of sex or
 marital status unlawful and provides for maternity leave.
 Legislation reducing fiscal disincentives for working wives
 and providing unemployment benefits for single women is also
 in egfect, as are laws dealing with other aspects of women's
 rights, such as the Family Home Protection Act of July 21,
 1976 ind the Maintenance Orders Act of April 1, 1975.
 Women's organizations acknowledge that much has been done to
 ensure total equality of treatment, but some problems
 remain. For example, while the disparity between earnings
 has decreased steadily, women's average industrial pay was
 still only about 65 percent of men's in June 1978.
 The Irish government seeks to assure an adequate standard of
 living, primarily by pursuing policies promoting economic
 growth and development. These policies have had considerable
 success, and the per capita gross national product reached
 
 
 824
 2,175 Irish pounds in 1979 (approximately $4,400). Policies
 have emphasized job creation. As a result of the growth of
 the domestic economy, Ireland's traditional emigration has
 largely ceased in recent years. Recession in 1980 has
 retarded growth of personal incomes and employment.
 Various government programs seek to assure that all classes
 of the population benefit from an adequate standard of
 living. All employed persons are required to subscribe  to
 social insurance, which provides unemployment and disability
 benefits and old age and widows' pensions. A state-financed
 public health service provides comprehensive free services to
 those who cannot afford to pay for medical expenses, and
 certain medical services are provided without any means
 test. For those who do not qualify for free health care,
 comprehensive and low-cost medical insurance is available
 from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, a statutory,
 non-profit organization. Altogether, about 55 percent of
 current budgeted government spending is earmarked for social
 services: education, health, housing and sanitation, and
 income maintenance.
 The state requires school attendance to age fifteen, and free
 schooling is guaranteed at the primary and secondary levels.
 Schooling in Ireland was traditionally largely in the hands
 of religious denominations, but the network of public schools
 has been strengthened and expanded significantly in recent
 years.
 3. Respect-for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by Articles 40 and 44 of the
 constitution and respected in practice. Certain terrorist
 organizations are illegal, and membership in them is an
 offense against national security, but political parties or
 groups associated with terrorist organizations are not
 proscribed. Article 40(6) of the constitution provides that
 the state will endeavor to ensure that organs of public
 opinion, while preserving liberty of expression, including
 criticism of government policy, shall not be used to
 undermine public order, morality or the authority of the
 state. The article provides further that "publication or
 utterance of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter" is an
 offense punishable by law. Such censorship as exists in
 Ireland is directed largely toward materials considered to be
 pornographic.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of movement within the country,
 foreign travel, emigration and voluntary repatriation. To
 the degree that limited resources permit, Ireland has
 accepted refugees. Ireland welcomed a number of Hungarians
 following the uprising of 1956 and in 1979-80 received and is
 resettling 216 Vietnamese refugees within the country.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All Irish citizens may participate fully in an orderly,
 democratic, multi-party political system. The labor movement
 is free and strong, and even government workers have the
 
 
 825
 right to strike. Women play an increasingly important role
 in Irish society. They are represented in growing numbers in
 positions of executive, legislative and judicial authority,
 as well as in business and labor organizations. The current
 Cabinet, formed in-December 1979, includes a woman member for
 the first time since Irish independence. In July 1980, the
 Irish Congress of Trade Unions elected a woman to its
 executive council for the first time in many years, adopted
 the concept of "positive discrimination" to enhance the
 leadership role of women in trade unionism, and directed
 constituent unions to increase active participation by women
 in union affairs.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 The Irish government has a good record regarding independent,
 outside investigations of alleged human rights abuses. A
 1977 Amnesty International Report and the government's
 response to it were described in Section l.b. above.
