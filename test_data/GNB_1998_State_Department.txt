 GUINEA-BISSAU *
 The elected government of President Joao Bernardo Vieira ceased to exercise de
 facto control over most of Guinea-Bissau following a June 6 military rebellion led
 by Army Chief of Staff Ansumane Mane that enjoyed wide popular support. Viera
 had ruled the country since taking power in a 1980 coup, and was elected President
 in the country's first multiparty elections in 1994. Despite the intervention of Sen-
 egalese and Guinean troops in support of the Vieira Government, xebel troops and
 their civilian sympathizers quickly seized control over most of the country. The
 Vieira Government exercised effective control only over portions of the capital and
 the Bijagos Islands. President Vieira and Mane signed a peace agreement in Abuja,
 Nigeria, on November 1. The signatories agreed to put in place a government of na-
 tional unity that would include representatives of the rebels. The two leaders also
 agreed to hold general and presidential elections no later than the end of March
 1999. In November and December a National Executive Commission composed of
 representatives of the Government, the Junta, the National Assembly, and civil soci-
 ety established a plan for restructuring the government. The reorganization plan re-
 duced the number of ministries from 15 to 10 and gave control of leading ministries,
 including Defense, Interior, Territorial Administration, and Veterans' Affairs to
 rebel supporters. On December 2, the National Executive Commission selected
 Francisco Fadul as Prime Minister. Fadul had served as political advisor to Mane
 during the conflict. The National Assembly passed a motion on November 27 de-
 manding the resignation of President Vieira. President Vieira criticized the motion
 as invalid and vowed to remain in office until replaced through the election process.
 At years end, the national unity government had not been installed or begun to
 function, and there had been little progress in implementing any of the terms of the
 November 1 Abuja Agreement. The Constitution provides for an independent judici-
 ï¿½ On June 14, the United States Embassy suspended operations in the midst; of heavy fighting
 in Bissau and all official personnel in the country were evacuated. This report is based on infor-
 mation obtained prior to the suspension of operations, by embassies in neighboring countries,
 and from other sources.

 ary, however, it is subject to political influence and corruption. The judiciary ceased
 to function following the June fighting.
 The police, under the direction of the Ministry of the Interior, have primary re-
 sponsibility for the nation's internal security. However, following the June revolt the
 police became ineffective, leaving security primarily in the hands of the Senegalese
 and Guinean militaries. The Guinea-Bissau armed forces are responsible for exter-
 nal security and may-be called upon to assist the police in internal emergencies. A
 clear majority of soldiers joined the rebellion against President Vieira. Those who
 remained loyal, numbering no more than 300, generally took a secondary role to the
 Senegalese and Guineans in the fighting. The police, the military (both loyal and
 rebel), the Senegalese, and the Guineans were responsible for serious human rights
 abuses.
 The population of I million relies largely upon subsistence agriculture and the ex-
 port of cashew nuts. Both activities were affected negatively by the fighting. Annual
 per capita gross domestic product in recent years has been estimated at $840; how-
 ever, this was expected to decline significantly as a result of the conflict. In Decem-
 ber the economy was at a complete standstill. Exports of cashew nuts and other
 products had virtually ceased, significant quantities of warehouse stocks had been
 looted or destroyed, and all banks and other monetary institutions had ceased to
 function. With money scarce, the country returned to a barter economy. The country
 remains burdened by heavy external debt and massive underemployment.
 The human rights situation deteriorated markedly over the year. Before the June
 rebellion, President Vieira pursued a policy of isolating himself from all but an
 inner circle of advisors and attempted to concentrate power both in the ruling
 PAIGC and in the Government directly in his own hands. Troops loyal to President
 Veira killed an unknown number of civilians following the outbreak of the June re-
 bellion. The police continued to use beatings, physical mistreatment, and other
 forms of harassment, and arbitrary arrest and detention. The Government did not
 punish any members of the security forces for abuses. Prison conditions are poor.
 The Government at times use incommunicado detention. The judiciary is subject to
 political influence and corruption and ceased to function following the outbreak of
 the June rebellion. The Government infringed on citizens' privacy rights. The Gov-
 ernment at times limited freedom of the press, and journalists practiced self-censor-
 ship. The Government at times restricted freedom of movement. Violence and dis-
 crimination against women are problems. Female genital mutilation is widely prac-
 ticed. Child labor and some forced child labor persist.
 The June to November conflict, which was punctuated by several cease-fires,
 caused massive civilian dislocation and hardship. An estimated 250,000 civilians
 fled Bissau for the countryside, where most sat out the war with friends and rel-
 atives in rural villages. Several thousand persons also left for neighboring countries
 or Europe. The conflict also resulted in a significant but unknown number of casual-
 ties. The majority of deaths and injuries resulted from combat between rebel forces
 and the Senegalese intervention forces. Senegalese troops fired heavy artillery into
 Guinea-Bissau from Senegal. Most of the fighting occurred in Bissau and its imme-
 diate environs. An unknown number of civilian deaths and injuries resulted from
 shells fired by both sides into civilian neighborhoods.
 Senegalese troops reportedly killed and beat a number of civilians.
 Guinean troops reportedly beat a number of civilians.
 Both sides engaged in robbery and looting.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political and extrajudicial killings
 occurred.
 Troops loyal to or allied with President Vieira killed an unknown number of civil-
 ian noncombatants following the outbreak of the June rebellion.
 The Interior Ministry never released the results of an internal investigation on
 the police shootings of two African deportees following demonstrations in 1996; one
 of the deportees died. To date no one has been charged with the shootings.
 The 1992 death of Ussumane Quade, an army officer beaten to death while in po-
 lice custody, remains unsolved. Two police officers were arrested in connection with
 the death in 1997, but neither was ever charged formally and both were released.
 In the early stages of the fighting, Senegalese troops in the area near the rebels'
 main base in Bissau were reportedly under instructions to shoot to kill anyone seen
 on the streets. These instructions may have contributed to the June 23 shooting of
 two local guards of a foreign embassy, one of whom died from his injuries. Eye-
 witnesses identified the assailants as Senegalese soldiers. A subsequent investiga-
 
 
 203
 tion by Senegalese military authorities concluded that it was not possible to deter-
 mine which side fired at the two guards. Senegalese troops also reportedly shot and
 killed three unidentified youths on June 23 in the Bissau neighborhood of Antula.
 The youths reportedly were shot while fleeing the soldiers. President Vieira took no
 action to encourage forces allied with him to minimize the loss of life among the
 civilian population.
 Rebel forces loyal to General Mane also committed extrajudicial killings. The re-
 bellion began with an ambush on a government yehicle thought to be carrying Presi-
 dent Vieira. While Vieira was not in the vehicle, both occupants, his chief of protocol
 and the deputy director of the National Police, were killed. There were credible re-
 ports that rebel forces executed a Vieira military advisor whom they captured at the
 eginning of the rebellion. There were credible reports that army troops stationed
 in the interior who were sympathetic to the rebels killed superiors who expressed
 continued loyalty to Vieira.
 There were unconfirmed reports that Movement of Democratic Forces of
 Casamance (MFDC) rebels from the Casamance region of Senegal, operating in
 Guinea-Bissau and allied to the rebel forces, killed or tortured a number of Senegal-
 ese army prisoners.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits cruel and inhuman punishment, and evidence obtained
 through torture or coercion is invalid; however, the Government often ignored these
 provisions, and security forces beat, mistreated, and otherwise abused persons. Se-
 curity and police authorities historically have employed abusive interrogation meth-
 ods, usually in the form of severe beatings or deprivation. The Government rarely
 enforced provisions for punishment of abuses committed by security forces.
 During the early stages of the conflict,- forces loyal to Vieira engaged in wide-
 spread harassment, including stopping civilians and subjecting them to degrading
 body searches without cause. Refugees made credible claims that loyalist forces rou-
 tinely beat civilians believed sympathetic to the rebels, particularly in the early
 stages of the conflict. Refugees alleged rape by loyalist soldiers; the allegations were
 not confirmed.
 In March an arms trafficking scandal resulted in the arrest of five Guinea-
 Bissauan soldiers and two Senegalese civilians charged with selling arms to rebels
 in southern Senegal (see Section I.e.). At the time of their arrest, they were seen
 by representatives of the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Human Rights
 League and were reported to be in good condition. Following 2 days of questioning
 by police and military officials, all exhibited bruises consistent with severe beatings;
 one of the Senegalese was paralyzed on one side of his body. No action was taken
 by the Government to determine responsibility for these beatings.
 Two policemen accused of rape in 1995 have yet to stand trial and no trial date
 was set. They were unconditionally released from custody. Human rights monitors
 reported other incidents in which police accused of rape or the mistreatment of pris-
 oners have not been prosecuted.
 Senegalese troops reportedly beat a small number of civilians. Guinean troops re-
 portedly beat and harassed civilians.
 There were credible reports that rebel soldiers beat and harassed civilians sus-
 pected of government sympathies.
 There were unconfirmed reports that MFDC rebels tortured a number of Senegal-
 ese prisoners.
 Prison conditions are poor but generally not life threatening. Beatings and depri-
 vation were used as a means of coercion. The June rebellion effectively stopped a
 program aimed at halting such methods. Prison authorities had very little control
 over inmates, many of whom simply left during the day. Following a request by the
 Interior Minister for international donor assistance to rehabilitate the prisons, the
 European Union renovated two of them. However, many prisons were damaged dur-
 ing the fighting and the inmates escaped.
 The Human Rights League was given access to most prisoners during the first
 half of the year. Its members were allowed initial access to the arms-trafficking
 scandal detainees. However, after they reported on the visible injuries inflicted on
 the prisoners at the hands of the security forces, no further visits were permitted.
 The activities of the Human Rights League and other NGO's were hindered by the
 post-June 6 conflict.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Security forces arbitrarily arrested and
 detained persons.
 The law provides for procedural rights, such as the right to counsel, the right to
 release if no timely indictment is brought, and the right to a speedy trial. In prac-
 
 
 tice, the judicial system generally failed to provide these rights. The judicial system
 ceased to function following the June outbreak of fighting.
 Police detained suspects without judicial authority or warrants, occasionally
 through the device of house arrest. The Government held. detainees without charges
 or trial for extended periods of time, sometimes incommunicado. The authorities did
 not routinely observe bail procedures.
 There were credible reports that Senegalese forces routinely detained individuals
 without charges during the early stages of the rebellion. No such accusations were
 made against the rebel forces.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but judges, who are poorly trained and paid, are sometimes subject to political
 pressures and corruption. The Supreme Court is especially vulnerable to political
 pressure, as its members are appointed by the President and serve at his pleasure.
 The judiciary is reluctant to decide cases of a political nature. Cases against several
 former and current members of the Government were delayed. The Supreme Court
 failed to deal impartially with highly charged political cases. The Court refused to
 hear a challenge on the constitutionality of the President's decision to accept elec-
 tion as PAIGC President. In 1997 the Court took up the issue of the constitutional-
 ity of the manner in which the President named his new Government. The decision
 ultimately rendered was in favor of allowing the Government to remain in office,
 but was issued only after the President brought significant pressure to bear on the
 Court. Trials involving state security are conducted by civilian courts. Under the
 Code of Military Justice, military courts try only crimes committed by armed forces
 personnel. Prior to the rebellion, the Government had announced that two Senegal-
 ese civilians implicated in an arms trafficking scandal would be tried in a military
 court in violation of the law (see Section 1.c.). The Supreme Court is the final court
 of appeal for both military and civilian cases. The President has the authority to
 grant pardons and reduce sentences.
 The court system ceased to function following the outbreak of the rebellion in
 June.
 Citizens who cannot afford an attorney have the right to a court-appointed lawyer.
 Traditional law still prevails in most rural areas, and urban dwellers often bring
 judicial disputes to traditional counselors to avoid the costs and bureaucratic im-
 pediments of the official system. The police often resolve disputes.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of domicile, person, and correspondence,
 but the Government does not always respect these rights. The police do not always
 use judicial warrants and have forced entry into some private homes.
 Loyalist forces reportedly searched private residences in Bissau without cause and
 without warrants. Loyalist forces allegedly were guilty of theft from both private
 homes and stores.
 International and domestic mail at times was opened; however, this violation was
 by poorly paid postal employees in search of money or other valuables, not by secu-
 rity personnel. The country's main post office building was destroyed in June during
 the rebellion and-mail service ceased to function thereafter.
 Senegalese forces were observed stealing private vehicles and other goods and at-
 tempting to ship them-to Senegal (see Section 2.a.). Two Senegalese soldiers were
 arrested by the Senegalese military on charges that they looted a foreign ambas-
 sador's residence on July 14.
 Rebel forces allegedly stole from private homes and stores.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, however, the Government at times limited these rights in practice,
 and journalists continued to practice self-censorship.
 Prior to the rebellion, Guinea-Bissau's print media consisted of one independent
 daily, three independent weeklies, one government-owned biweekly, and one inde-
 pendent monthly. All of the newspapers published sporadically due to financial con-
 straints. The national printing press, the only facility for publishing newspapers in
 the country, often lacked the raw materials to publish them. No newspapers were
 published after the outbreak of the rebellion.
 Prior to the rebellion, there were three independent radio stations and one gov-
 ernment-controlled station in Bissau. In addition, Radio Portugal and Radio France
 International broadcasts were received from Lisbon and Paris. There were also
 three community radio stations run by the indigenous NGO Action for Development.
 
 
 One independent station rebroadcast the British Broadcasting Corporation and an-
 other rebroadcast the Voice Of America.
 After the June rebellion, the status of the electronic media changed significantly.
 Two independent stations, Radio Pindjiguiti and Radio Mavegro, ceased broadcast-
 ig. National Radio continued to broadcast for the first week from its normal trans-
 mitter. Later, it took over Radio Mavegro's headquarters (Radio Mavegro's owner
 was out of Bissau at the time of the coup) and continued to broadcast using Radio
 Mavegro's equipment. The independent station Radio Bombolom began broadcasts
 supportive of the rebels on the second day of the coup and soon changed its name
 to the Voice of the Military Junta. It is unclear whether the station was taken over
 by the rebels or whether its owner was a wiling collaborator. The community sta-
 tions ceased operations. Radio Portugal and Radio France International continued
 to be received.
 Journalists encountered harassment by government and allied troops at the early
 stages of the fighting. Their movements were restricted and they were kept from
 filming or photographing images deemed damaging to the image of the Government
 or its foreign allies. Portuguese journalist Christina Guerra was expelled from the
 country after photographing Senegalese soldiers loading private vehicles on boats
 bound for Dakar (see Section l.f). Notwithstanding these instances of harassment,
 many foreign journalists were able to circulate and report on the fighting and asso-
 ciated political developments.
 Academic freedom generally was observed  ntil the outbreak of fighting. Schools
 and research institutions ceased to fuction after the June rebellion.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government respected this right in practice until the
 outbreak of fighting in June. Government approval is reqie   for all assemblies
 and demonstrations, and prior to the June rebellion, the Government approved all
 such requests. Numerous organizations held rallies, some of which were critical of
 the Government. After the outbreak of the June rebellion, no groups attempted to
 hold rallies or demonstrations.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government re-
 spectd this right in practice prior to the June rebellion. The Government did not
 prohibit or actively discourage the formation of associations; however, all private as-
 sociations were required to register with the Government. There were no reports of
 associations beingdenied registration.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respected this right in practice. uhile religious groups must be licensed
 by the Government, no applications were refused. Various faiths, including Jeho-
 vah's Witnesses, continued  missionary activities during the year. The Government
 includes members from all major religious groups. There were no indications that
 either the Government or the rebel forces attempted to interfere with religious free-
 dom following the outbreak of fighting.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Prior to the June uprising, the Government generally did not restrict
 movement within the country, foreign travel, or emigration; however, checkpoints
 and police harassment occurred frequently. Afer the outbreak of fighting, vehicle
 traffic was curtailed severely. Both government and rebel forces blocked the road
 from Bissau to the interior and interfered with the free movement of traffic. The
 Government carefully controlled movement within Bissau, prohibiting most traffic.
 Movement in the interior was less restricted but still subject to occasional inter-
 terence by both government and rebel forces. The land borders with Senegal were
 closed to travelers during the early stages of the conflict. Later, Senegal allowed hu-
 manitarian convoys to transit the border. Land borders with Guinea generally re-
 mained oper The nationaairport remained under rebel control after the outbreak
 of fighting and was closed to commercial traffic. Rebel forces allowed airport access
 to humanitarian flights.
 Passports were issued by the Minister of the Interior. The issuance of passports
 ceased following the revolt. Citizens have the right to return and are not subject
 to political' revocation of their citizenship.
 The June to November conflict, which was punctuated lby several cease-fires,
 caused massive civilian dislocation and hardship. An estimated 250,000 civilians
 fled Bissau for he countryside, where most sat out the war with friends and rel-
 ative in-"rural villages. Several thousand persons also left Guinea-Bissau for neigh-
 boring countries or Europe. In June200 persons fleeing the fighting drowned when
 theymtri to reach the coastal Bijagos Islands.
 Prior to the conflict, the Government allowed refugees to stay if they feared perse-
 cution at home. There are no formal provisions to recognize refugee status, but it
 was granted on a case-by-case basis. No refugees were deported forcibly to a country
 
 
 where they feared persecution. Foreign refugees who fled Bissau with the outbreak
 of fighting are believed to have done so voluntarily. The Government provided first
 asylum to refugees from the conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and the Casamance
 region of Senegal. A January United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHOCR) census revealed the presence of just under 5,000 Senegalese refugees in
 Guinea-Bissau. The majority of these were found along the western Senegal-Guinea-
 Bissau border. Renewed fighting in the Casamance in March more than doubled
 this number for a short time; however, most of the new arrivals repatriated volun-
 tarily. The UNHCR established a refugee camp south of the border region at
 Jolomete that housed about 700 refugees. The UNHCR removed its representative
 during the fighting, the present status of these refugees is unknown.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In 1994 voters were able to choose their government freely for the first time in
 the nation's history. The PAIGC, the country's only legal party from 1974 to 1991,
 retained power in elections judged to be free and fair by international observers, al-
 though they acknowledged some irregularities. Local elections have been promised
 since 1995, but they had not been held by year's end and no substantive progress
 has been made toprepare for them.
 The Government was constitutionally required to hold multiparty legislative elec-
 tions before September. However, the Government took no steps to put the election
 machinery in motion. Prior to the outbreak of fighting in June, the Government had
 not yet begun to undertake an electoral census, nominate members of a newly cre-
 ated permanent independent electoral commission, or secure funding from inter-
 national donors. The June rebellion inhibited any possibility of organizing these
 elections.
 Joao Bernardo Vieira was elected President in Guinea-Bissau's first multiparty
 elections in 1994. Vieira had ruled the country since taking power in a 1980 coup.
 In May Vieira was reelected president of the PAIGC. Opposition parties claimed
 that Vieira's acceptance of this office was unconstitutional. The PAIGC holds 62 of
 the 100 seats in the National Assembly, where 4 other parties are represented. The
 National Assembly suspended its functions following the June 6 military rebellion,
 resuming only in early December. However, some National Assembly members fled
 the country during the revolt.
 Women are underrepresented in the National Assembly, where they occupy only
 8 of the 100 seats. Three of 15 cabinet ministers in the Vieira government were
 women. The composition of a new government structured in December under the su-
 pervision of the National Executive Commission was not known at year's end.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Prior to the outbreak of fighting in June, the Government did not interfere with
 the Guinea-Bissau Human Rights League (LGDH), and international human rights
 groups continued to investigate human rights abuses without government harass-
 ment. The activities of international and nongovernmental human rights groups ef-
 fectively ceased with the outbreak of hostilities in June.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and law prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, race, and
 religion. In practice, however, the Government does not effectively enforce these pro-
 visions.
 Women.-Physical violence, including wife beating, is an accepted means of set-
 tling domestic disputes. Although police intervene in domestic disputes if requested,
 the Government has not undertaken specific measures to counter social pressure
 against reporting domestic violence, rape, incest, and other mistreatment of women.
 Discrimination against women persists although officially prohibited by law.
 Women are responsible for most work on subsistence farms and have limited access
 to education, especially in rural areas. Women do not have equal access to employ-
 ment. Among certain ethnic groups, women can not own or manage land or inherit
 propert.
 Children.-The Government allocates only limited resources for children's welfare
 and education.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is widely
 practiced within certain ethnic groups, especially the Fulas and the Mandinkas. The
 practice is increasing as the population becomes more Muslim, and is being per-
 formed not only on adolescent girls, but also on babies as young as 4 months old.
 
 
 207
 The Government has not outlawed the practice. However, it has formed a national
 committee, which is conducting a nationwide education campaign to discourage it.
 International NGO's, including the Swedish group Radda Barnen and Plan Inter-
 national, as well as several domestic NGO's such as Friends of Children and Sinim
 Mira Nasseque, are working through the national committee to eliminate FGM. The
 efforts of both domestic and international groups were largely suspended after the
 outbreak of fighting in June.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legislation mandating accessibility. The law
 does not specifically prohibit discrimination against the disabled, and the Govern-
 ment does not ensure equal access to employment and education. The State has
 made some efforts to assist disabled veterans through pension programs, but these
 programs do not adequately address veterans' health, housing, and food needs.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides all civilian workers with
 the freedom to form and join independent trade unions. However, the vast majority
 of the population works in subsistence agriculture. Most union members are govern-
 ment or parastatal employees; only a small percentage of workers are in the wage
 sector and are organized.
 The Government registers all labor unions. There are 11 labor unions registered
 and operating. All unions are officially independent of the Government, but seven
 unions are affiliated with the National Trade Union Confederation (UNTG), which
 retains close informal ties with the PAIGC. The law does not favor UNTG-affiiated
 unions over others. The Constitution provides for the right to strike and protection
 for workers from retribution for strike activities.
 The only legal restriction on strike activity is the requirement for prior notice.
 Legal strikes have been conducted by several unions, with no retribution against the
 strikers in the past; there were no strikes in 1998.
 Both enforcement of the law and the functioning of the formal economy largely
 ceased after June.
 All unions are free to affiliate freely with national confederations and inter-
 national labor organizations of their choice.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution does not
 provide or protect the right to bargain collectively, and there were no instances of
 genuine collective bargaining. Most wages are established in bilateral negotiations
 between workers and employers, taking into consideration the minimum salaries set
 annually by the Government's Council of Ministers.
 The Government's provisions for the protection of workers against antiunion dis-
 crimination have very little effect due to low union membership. Although the Gov-
 ernment adopted no laws to establish penal sanctions against employers practicing
 suzh discrimination, no workers have alleged antiunion discrimination, and the
 practice is not believed to be widespread.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor, in-
 cluding that performed by children, is not permitted by law. These prohibitions gen-
 erally are enforced in the formal sector. However, children are often forced by their
 parents or guardians to work as street traders or agricultural laborers in the infor-
 mal sector (see Section 6.d.). The Government has not taken action to combat such
 practices.
 In 1996 the Armed Forces Chief of Staff, Ansumane Mane, was arrested after sev-
 eral children died in an explosion that occurred when they were forced to prepare
 shell cases for sale to Casamance rebels. Mane was placed under house arrest, but
 never formally charged; he ultimately was pardoned and reinstated by President
 Vieira. He is now the leader of the rebel forces.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gen-
 eral Labor Act of 1986 established a minimum age of 14 years for general factory
 labor and 18 years for heavy or dangerous labor, including all labor in mines. These
 minimum age requirements generally are followed in the small formal sector, but
 the Ministry of Justice and Labor does not enforce these requirements in other sec-
 tors. Children in cities often work in street trading, and those in rural communities
 do domestic and field work without pay. The Government does not attempt to dis-
 courage these traditional practices.
 Forced or compulsory labor by children is not permitted by law; this prohibition
 generally is enforced in the formal sector, although such labor occurs in the informal
 sector (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government's Council of Ministers annu-
 ally establishes minimum wage rates for all categories of work but does not enforce
 them. The lowest monthly wage is approximately $15 (9,000 cfa francs). This wage
 
 
 is inadequate to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family, and
 workers must supplement their income through other work, reliance on the -ex-
 tended family, and subsistence. agriculture. The maximum number of hours per-
 mitted in a normal workwyeek without further compensation is 45, but the Govern-
 ment does not enforce this provision. With the breakdown of the formal economy,
 most of the country returned to barter, and both the Government and the private
 sector lacked the funds to pay salaries.
 The Ministry-of Justice and Labor establishes legal health and safety standards
 for workers, with the cooperation of the unions, which are then adopted into law
 by the National Assembly. However, these standards are not enforced, and many
 persons work under conditions that endanger their health and safey
 Workers do not have the, right-to.remove themselves from unsafe working condi-
 tions without losing their jobs. Given high unemployment, a worker who left for
 such reasons would be readily replaced.
