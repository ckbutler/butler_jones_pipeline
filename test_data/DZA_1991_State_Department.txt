 ALGERIA
 Under a Constitution adopted in 1989 Algeria was converted from
 a one-party Socialist state, in which power was held by the
 National Liberation Front (FLN), to a multiparty parliamentary
 system. In 1991 political power on a national level was held
 by a government composed overwhelmingly of present and former
 FLN members, with President Chadli Bendjedid wielding executive
 power. He resigned on January 11, 1992.
 In April the one-party National Assembly (last elected while
 the FLN was the sole political party) approved a gerrymandered
 electoral districting law which the major opposition party, the
 Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) vehemently opposed. In June an
 unsuccessful FIS-led general strike protesting the law and
 calling for early presidential elections led to violent
 demonstrations and clashes with government forces in which
 perhaps as many as 300 people were killed, the majority of them
 as the result of the excessive use of force by the security
 forces. As the situation spun out of control, President
 Bendjedid declared a state of siege which lasted 4 months.
 Internal security is maintained by the urban police (Surete)
 and the national police (Gendarmerie), which have been known to
 resort to brutal treatment, including torture, of prisoners and
 detainees. During the June rioting there were numerous
 accusations of police brutality.
 The Algerian economy is largely under government control, with
 the state operating almost all major industries, much of the
 distribution and retail systems, and the entire banking and
 credit system. Although the Government has been pursuing a
 reform program emphasizing the decentralization of economic
 decisionmaking and calling for the creation of a market system,
 progress has been slow, apparently hindered in part by a lack
 of governmental consensus about the nature of reforms. High
 population growth, inflation, a scarcity of foreign exchange,
 and the legacy of .decades of economic inefficiency and
 corruption have continued to hamper the Government's efforts to
 meet social needs.
 Although the Government had been making progress on human
 rights, the Islamist violence and the government reaction
 thereto in June brought a setback. Apart from the security
 forces* use of excessive force to control the June rioting, the
 ensuing declaration of a state of siege temporarily imposed new
 restrictions and led to the detention of thousands of Islamists
 and the imprisonment of some 350. National Assembly elections,
 generally deemed free and fair, were held on December 26.
 Subsequently, the High Security Council, in which the military
 played the leading role, took over the Government and canceled
 the second round of voting, thereby effectively negating the
 result of the first round in which the FIS had won an
 overwhelming victory. In addition to the suspension of the
 constitutional provision that allows citizens to change their
 national-government, other human rights problems included
 brutal treatment of detainees, restrictions on the freedom of
 the press and freedom of religion, and women's rights.

 ALGERIA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killings
 There were no known instances of politically motivated
 extrajudicial killing by government forces, but a number of
 deaths were caused by police use of excessive force during the
 June rioting (see Section l.g.). Official and press sources
 claimed that two police officers were abducted and killed by
 FIS activists in Lakhdaria during the June rioting following
 the unsuccessful general strike.
 b. Disappearance
 A number of pro-FIS rioters reportedly disappeared during the
 June riots.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although prohibited by law, there continue to be reports of
 torture and brutal treatment of prisoners by police. The
 Government acknowledged one instance of torture by the security
 forces in 1991 and noted that the guilty police officer was
 punished, although the Government has not made public the
 nature of the punishment. During the June riots, FIS
 supporters reportedly were responsible for several instances of
 torture of abducted members of the security forces.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention and
 stipulates that detention for questioning in criminal
 investigation cases may not exceed 48 hours, after which the
 suspect must charged or released. This period may be extended
 to 4 days by written request of the government prosecutor.
 Provisional liberty may be authorized when the detainee shows
 that he can guarantee to be present at all necessary stages of
 the inquiry. Detainees must be informed immediately of charges
 against them. Once charged however, a person may be held under
 pretrial detention indefinitely while his case is being
 investigated. These constitutional provisions are adhered to
 in practice. There were no cases of incommunicado detention in
 1991.
 There is no bail system. Lawyers enjoy access to their clients
 at any time. Meetings are supervised visually by a guard.
 Although the state of siege decreed by President Bendjedid
 effectively suspended many constitutional protections, it
 theoretically retained judicial protections of detainees once
 they were formally charged with criminal actions and allowed
 administrative detainees to appeal their arrest to an
 independent board which reviewed their cases. According to the
 Algerian League of Human Rights, no boards were ever
 constituted because detainees were released quickly and had
 neither need nor time to file appeals before they were released.
 There were numerous arrests in the weeks following the
 declaration of the state of siege. Six major detention centers
 were set up temporarily to hold the detainees, most of whom
 were released after questioning; all the centers were closed by
 
 
 1336
 
 ALGERIA
 August.. The Government acknowledged on July 10 that it had
 brought in for questioning over 5,0010 Islamists (local human
 rights groups spoke of 8,000) under state of siege decrees
 giving military and security authorities wide latitude to
 enforce public order.
 The Prime Minister released official figures on July 30
 claiming that 327 detainees were being held in "administrative
 detention", as provided for under the state of siege. In
 December the Government said that all administrative detainees
 had been released but that some 200-240 Islamists remained in
 prison on criminal charges (including treason, sedition, and
 conspiracy to overthrow the State) stemming from the June
 events. Those charged included most of the top leadership of
 the FIS; on October 12, the military tribunal charged with
 prosecuting the cases of FIS president Abassi Madani and Vice
 President Ali Belhadj rejected their lawyers' appeals for
 provisional liberty.
 Exile is not a legal form of punishment in Algeria and is not
 known to be practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary, and it
 is generally independent of the executive branch. This
 independence was largely circumvented in cases prosecuted under
 the state of siege. The judicial system is divided into civic
 and military courts. There are no Islamic courts. Judges are
 appointed and promoted by the Ministry of Justice through an
 independent board, which was created in July.
 Defendants in civil courts have unrestricted access to counsel,
 who operate without government interference. The Algerian Bar
 Association provides free services to defendants unable to
 afford counsel. Defendants are made fully aware of the charges
 against them at the time they are bound over for trial.
 Defendants have the right to confront witnesses and present
 evidence. Trials are public, although generally not
 publicized, and defendants have the right of appeal.
 During the approximately 4 months' duration of the state of
 siege, military courts were given jurisdiction over crimes
 allegedly threatening state security. Many of the rights
 Algerians would have enjoyed under a civil court were ignored
 or circumscribed. The presidential declaration of the state of
 siege established military authority over those detained and
 gave military courts competency to continue prosecutions even
 after the eventual suspension of the state of siege. Judicial
 cases included in this category are those of Abassi Madani and
 Ali Belhadj (see Section i.d.). Of the approximately 350
 people formally charged during the state of siege, Algerian
 authorities said in December that 120-150 remain under military
 jurisdiction and 80-90 have been charged under the civil penal
 code.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home.
 The provision is generally respected, except during a state of
 siege and in cases involving security forces. Police may not
 enter a house without a warrant from the local prosecutor and
 may not enter a residence during the night hours. During the
 state of siege, security forces were given wide powers to enter
 
 
 1337
 ALGERIA
 and search homes and reportedly actively sought for questioning
 suspected FIS members in their residences. The police and
 security services are believed to use telephone-
 monitoring systems, reportedly without prior court
 authorization as required by law.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and'Violation of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 In the June riots and the repression that followed, numerous
 Algerians died. Estimates range from the official toll of 55,
 the Ministry of the Interior's figure, to 300, a figure
 advanced by human rights sources. The majority of these
 killings were due to the security forces' use of force to
 control the riots. During the rioting, police and gendarmerie
 units fired tear gas into crowded apartment buildings thought
 to harbor FIS rioters; in at least one instance, an infant died
 as a result. In another instance, police fired tear gas into a
 public hospital being used by FIS rioters as a refuge, causing
 a number of deaths according to credible sources. The security
 forces' use of rubber bullets as well as their practice of
 firing live ammunition above the heads of and, reportedly,
 occasionally into crowds led to additional deaths. Twelve
 police officers were also killed. In addition to the two
 murdered in Lakhdaria (see Section l.a.), other officers
 reportedly died as a result of hit-and-run attacks by vehicles,
 drive-by shootings, stabbings, and stoning by rioters.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Except for those FIS leaders imprisoned after the declaration
 of the state of siege, Algerians at all levels of society may
 generally express their opinions, and criticism of the
 Government is widely heard. Although the Government has not
 abolished censorship and there are other constraints on press
 freedom, the non-Islamist print media continued to enjoy a
 greater degree of editorial freedom than they had during any
 period since independence. However, the press was reticent in
 its coverage of potentially controversial themes in the
 aftermath of the June rioting. Additionally, two official FIS
 journals were banned in August in the aftermath of the FIS
 general strike, and a political tract by imprisoned FIS vice
 president Ali Belhadj was confiscated prior to its
 distribution. Since the state of siege ended, FIS newspapers
 have again been appearing, but another political tract by Ali
 Belhadj was confiscated prior to its public distribution.
 Also, military authorities seized the September 16 edition of
 the newspaper Al-Maser Al-Magharibi, not permitting it to be
 printed. No official explanation for the seizure was provided.
 The Government created an FLN-controlled holding company for 11
 major Algerian newspapers and magazines in September. This
 formalized the FLN monopoly on access to newspaper printing
 presses in Algiers. Independent papers in Algiers, which lack
 their own printing presses, are forced to go through the FLN
 holding company in order to print their publications.
 Nevertheless, numerous independent papers have strong
 readerships, and new independent journals continued to appear
 regularly. Individual Algerians, writing as columnists, often
 expressed opinions contrary to those of the Government.
 Criticism of government economic and social policies, but not
 of military management of the state of siege, appeared
 periodically in the established, FLN-controlled press, as well
 
 
 138
 ALGERIA
 as -in the independent papers, but was more frequently seen in
 the publications of various political parties.
 During the Persian Gulf war, previously unaccredited foreign
 journalists were denied access to Algeria on the grounds that
 their coverage of Algerian events would be biased. This
 position was revived during the June events, when foreign
 journalists attempting to enter Algeria were denied entrance at
 the border. In another instance, film of police action during
 the June rioting was stolen from the hotel room of a Western
 news agency's camera crew by unknown parties. During the first
 round of National Assembly elections in December, the
 Government was cooperative and open with foreign journalists
 covering the electoral process.
 Radio and television remained under government control, despite
 government disclaimers to the contrary. The coverage continued
 to be heavily biased in favor of governmental policies and the
 FLN; however, because of the widespread accessibility of
 satellite dish antennas among the Algerian middle class, many
 Algerians have easy access to European television news, which
 is watched regularly.
 There are moderate restraints on academic freedom. Algerian
 professors attend international conferences regularly, and many
 Algerian professors are active in human rights circles without
 apparent prejudice to their professional careers. However,
 recently there has been an increase in social pressure on the
 campuses to conform to Islamic norms of dress, thought, and
 behavior. In the new atmosphere, some female teachers have
 complained that they are finding it more difficult to continue
 teaching. Religious indoctrination in Koranic themes has taken
 the place of secular education in some elementary schools.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The 1989 Constitution provides for the rights of assembly and
 association. Implementing legislation adopted in 1989 set out
 procedures for obtaining permits to hold public gatherings.
 With the exception of the 4-month period of the state of siege,
 the Government routinely granted such permits in 1991. In May,
 before the FIS general strike erupted into rioting, the
 Government was still granting FIS organizers permission to use
 public squares and streets for demonstrations. in early
 October, a week after the lifting of the state of siege, the
 Government again granted FIS organizers permission to organize
 a mass rally in Algiers attended by an estimated 20,000 to
 40,0000 FIS supporters. Just prior to the December 26
 elections, the FIS held a rally estimated to have gathered
 100,000 demonstrators. During the state of siege, all
 gatherings were strictly forbidden.
 According to the July 1989 Political Associations Law,
 membership in political organizations is permitted for all
 Algerians except judges, army and security service personnel,
 and members of the Constitutional Council. All nongovernmental
 associations must be approved by the Interior Minister.
 Political groups across the spectrum were openly operating
 throughout Algeria. These range from political parties--there
 were over 50 parties active in 1991--to specialized groups such
 as the Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights (ALDHR),
 which monitors Algeria's human rights performance; the
 Committee Against Torture (CAT), which investigates allegations
 of government torture; Islamic trade unions; and secular
 women's groups. Despite the FIS' leading role in the June
 
 
 1339
 ALGERIA
 riots and its continued calls for rebellion against the State,
 it remained a legal party and participated in the first round
 of the National Assembly elections in December.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 While the Constitution declares Islam to be the state religion,
 it also prohibits discrimination based on opinion or any other
 personal or social circumstance or condition. The Government
 protects the rights of the very small Christian and Jewish
 populations and includes leaders of these communities at
 ceremonial state functions. The Jewish community numbers less
 than 300; it maintains a synagogue in central Algiers.
 Conversion from Islam to Christianity is severely sanctioned.
 Consequently, the Christian clergy focuses its activities on
 the foreign community. Those Algerians who do convert from
 Islam do so clandestinely to avoid the sanction of family
 andcommunity.
 The Islamic clergy is government trained, and the Ministry of
 Religious Affairs assigns imams to state-funded mosques.
 Privately funded mosques, however, may choose their own
 religious leaders. In 1991 a number of these privately funded
 mosques increasingly serve as centers for the promotion of an
 Islamic fundamentalist state.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom to travel within Algeria and abroad and to emigrate is
 provided for by law and generally is respected in practice.
 Gendarmerie checkpoints in the countryside routinely inspect
 vehicle registrations and occasionally search Algerian-owned or
 -operated vehicles for evidence of black-marketing. During the
 state of siege, police blockades became extremely intrusive,
 and cars and vehicles were regularly searched. There are some
 administrative restrictions related to mandatory military
 service and the obligation to repay state education
 scholarships. These controls are not applied arbitrarily or
 for political purposes.
 The Constitution provides for the right of political asylum an
 estimated 165,000 refugees from the Western Sahara live in
 camps in southwestern Algeria. They are supported by both the
 Government and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 With the approval in 1989 of a revised Constitution which
 converted Algeria from a one-party Socialist state to a
 multiparty system, the legal framework was in place to allow
 citizens to change their government. However, implementation
 was delayed until the end of 1991 by slow progress on the issue
 of electoral law reform. National Assembly elections were
 originally scheduled for June, but prior to these elections the
 National Assembly approved a gerrymandered electoral law which
 was construed by some as intended by the FLN-dominated Assembly
 to insure a FLN victory in the national legislative elections.
 The major Algerian opposition party, the FIS, protested the
 Assembly's actions and indicated that it would boycott the
 elections if the new law were not revised. The FIS' threats of
 boycott were ignored by the Government, and the FIS
 subsequently launched a general strike to protest the
 Government's position. Perhaps 20 percent of the population
 
 
 1340
 ALGERIA
 participated, many apparently acting under coercion from
 aggressive PIS partisans who pressured shopkeepers into closing
 their shops. The ensuing violence and the state of siege
 delayed the elections until December 26, when the first round
 was held. The results of the first round amounted to a strong
 popular condemnation of the Government and a major victory for
 the FIS. The overwhelming nature of the FIS' first round
 victory indicated that the FIS would almost certainly gain an
 National Assembly majority. President Bendjedid abruptly
 resigned on January 11, 1992, and the Higher Security Council
 took over the Government and interrupted the electoral
 process. A Council of State was subsequently created to
 exercise executive power until December 1993, when BendJedid's
 term.would have expired. This series of events suspended that
 part of the Constitution that would have allowed Algerian
 citizens to change their national government in 1991.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A number of legally established human rights organizations are
 active in Algeria. They include such organizations as the
 Committee Against Torture, the Algerian League of Human Rights,
 which is affiliated with the Maghreb Human Rights Association,
 and the Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights.
 Algerian human rights activists receive wide publicity in the
 press and regularly give press conferences to support their
 initiatives. Some activists have said, however, that they are
 quietly ignored by the FLN-controlled French-language daily El
 Moudjahid.
 The Government appointed a Minister Delegate for Human Rights,
 Ali Haroun, in June. Since the state of siege was declared,
 members of the Government have discussed the Algerian human
 rights situation with a wide range of visitors, including a
 delegation from Amnesty International, and foreign
 parliamentarians.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language or Social Status
 The current constitution specifically prohibits discrimination
 based on birth, race, sex, opinion, or any other personal or
 social conditions or circumstance. It omits, however, the
 specific guarantees for women's political, economic, social,
 and cultural rights that had been included in the 1976
 constitution. It does not appear that women and minority
 groups are treated unfairly in their access to housing,
 education, and health care. The Government's difficulties in
 meeting these social needs are linked to the country's rapid
 population growth and significant drop in oil revenues. Ethnic
 minorities, except black Algerians, seem to fare no better or
 worse than the Arab majority. Black Algerians, however, face
 continued social discrimination at all levels of society and
 are traditionally pushed into the most menial and lowest paying
 jobs.
 Berber ethnic consciousness remains strong and is fueled by the
 Berbers' desire to preserve their distinctive cultural identity
 and language in the face of the Government's emphasis on the
 development of Algeria's Arab identity. Berber spokesmen
 assert that the Government seeks to repress the distinct Berber
 culture, including the teaching and propagation of the
 Tamazight (Berber) language. Tamazight has never been taught
 
 
 1341
 ALGERIA
 in primary and secondary schools but is taught at Tizi Ouzou
 University.
 The fate of the nomadic Tuareg of Algeria's southern desert
 continues to be a subject of Algerian governmental and
 international interest. The continuing drought in the Central
 Sahara has disrupted traditional Tuareg patterns of life and
 led to insecurity in the desert areas of southern Algeria along
 its borders with Mali and Niger. In September 1990, an
 agreement was negotiated between the Governments of Algeria,
 Mali, Niger, and Libya, and Tuareg representatives. This
 agreement, which sought to address Tuareg grievances.
 apparently has not successfully resolved them, and violence
 continues in the south. In Algeria, the Tuareg are encouraged
 to settle and are generally treated fairly by government
 authorities.
 Women's rights are restricted by law, and they encounter
 discrimination in the workplace, home, and in society,
 dominated as it is by Algeria's traditionalist, patriarchal
 culture. Women's rights to work, live independently, and
 generally function outside the traditional Muslim social norm,
 although previously supported by government rhetoric, have come
 under heated attack from both Islamist political leaders and
 conservative elements of society. Under Algeria's 1984 family
 code, inspired by Islamic law, women are perpetual minors who,
 regardless of their age or civil status, remain under the legal
 guardianship. of a husband or father. The code also permits
 polygamy-which nevertheless remains rare due to the housing
 crisis-and makes it more difficult for a woman than for a man
 to obtain a divorce. The same law awards only 4 months of
 alimony to the woman regardless of the husband's means and the
 circumstances of the divorce. Because Islamic law and the
 family code forbid Algerian Muslim women from marrying
 non-Muslims, Algerian women engaged to non-Muslim men are
 sometimes subjected to harassment, including confiscation of
 their passports by authorities upon entering or leaving the
 country. Increasingly in 1991, some Algerian women found
 themselves pressured to wear Islamic dress (usually the
 hidjab-headcovering with ankle-length overdress) by husbands,
 fathers, and brothers jealous of the family's reputation. In
 municipalities run by Islamist political parties, there were
 continued efforts to ban women's sports, women's swimming,
 coeducation, and women in the workplace. In early 1991, FIS
 organizers orchestrated nationwide campaigns against
 coeducation. These campaigns, while discontinued during the
 state of siege, were revived after its end in October.
 With the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Algeria, secularist
 women regarded themselves as increasingly under attack from
 proponents of Shari'a (Islamic law). For example, some
 Algerians blame male unemployment on female participation in
 the workplace. Prior to the state of siege, Western-dressed
 women were occasionally spat upon on the streets by Islamists.
 This behavior apparently did not continue after the state of
 siege was declared, nor did it revive after the state of siege
 ended. In October, at a major Algiers mosque, FIS leaders
 suggested during a sermon that the Algerian unemployment
 problem would be "solved" if all women stopped working. Other
 FIS leaders have stated that women should not be allowed to
 work outside the home. It is estimated that 500,000 Algerian
 women work, mostly in urban areas, out of a total work force of
 4,700,000. Many are trained and employed in the professions,
 and some women serve in the armed forces. According to the
 
 
 1342
 ALGERIA
 most recent government statistics, girls represent 41 percent
 of all children enrolled in primary and secondary school.
 Although violence against women'is known to occur, little is
 know about its extent. Abuse within the family is seldom
 mentioned publicly because of the value attached to family
 honor in this traditional society. Wives who are the victims
 of wife beating may file criminal charges or sue for divorce,
 but the filing of such cases is rare.
 Women's issues seemed to have only a limited resonance with
 Algerian women in 1991. The Government has attempted to
 reassure feminist women that their rights will be defended, but
 many.Algerian women still saw fundamentalist strength and the
 1984 family code as the greatest threats to women's rights.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Under legislation passed in 1990, Algerian workers now have the
 right to form and be represented by trade unions of their
 choice. Under the new legislation, government approval for the
 creation of a labor union is not necessary. There are,
 however, limits on union activities. Unions are not allowed to
 be associated with political parties, although in practice
 some, including the FLN-backed general Union of Algerian
 Workers (UGTA) are. Unions are forbidden to receive funds from
 abroad, and a union's operations may be suspended by the
 Government if it violates the law. Unions are also subject to
 dissolution by judicial means if the courts rule they have
 engaged in illegal activities.
 Under the 1990 law on industrial relations, strikes are
 permitted only after mandatory conciliation, mediation, or
 arbitration efforts fail. This law states that arbitration
 decisions on worker-management disputes are binding on both
 parties.. However, another section of the same law states that
 if differences persist after conciliation and mediation efforts
 have been attempted (arbitration is not specifically mentioned
 in this context), workers may strike after giving 8 days'
 notice of their intention to do so. The strike must be
 approved by a majority vote of workers in a secret ballot.
 The result of the new law was a renaissance of labor activity
 as well as numerous strikes in all sectors. Although many of
 these strikes were not legally authorized under the terms set
 by the law, the Government has not prosecuted the persons
 involved. In 1991, both the UGTA and the Islamist Workers
 Union (SIT) called general strikes. The UGTA organized a
 48-hour strike in March to protest the escalating cost of
 living for workers. Though the UGTA claimed that 92 percent of
 the country's workers participated, in fact the participation
 rate was much lower and was limited to those working for the
 Government and state-owned companies. Workers belonging to the
 SIT boycotted the strike. The SIT carried out a politically
 motivated general strike in late May. The strike, boycotted by
 UGTA members, led to civilian unrest in several cities that
 prompted the Government to impose a state of siege. At the
 Government's direction, many state-owned companies fired
 workers who participated in this strike on the grounds that it
 was politically instead of economically motivated. However,
 most of the affected workers were eventually reinstated. In
 addition to these general strikes, airline pilots, air traffic
 controllers, and customs officials, among others, held strikes
 
 
 1343
 ALGERIA
 in 1991 to protest the unsatisfactory level of wage and fringe
 benefits. These were generally resolved by wage or other
 concessions.
 Unions may form and join federations or confederations and
 affiliate with international bodies, and in 1991 Algerian*
 unions sought contacts beyond the quasi-official Arab and
 African trade union organizations in which they still
 participate.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The 1990 legislation provides for collective bargaining for all
 unions, and this right has been freely practiced. It also
 prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union
 members and organizers and provides effective mechanisms for
 resolving trade union member complaints of antiunion practices
 by employers. It further permits all unions, whether
 longstanding or newly created, to recruit members at the
 'workplace; this right appears to have been consistently
 upheld.
 There are no special economic zones in Algeria.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is incompatible with the
 Constitution's sections on individual rights, and the penal
 code was amended-in 1990 to ban it explicitly.  This ban is
 effectively enforced by labor inspections and penal sanctions.
 The Government asserts that prisoners are paid for any work
 they perform and that forced labor does not exist in Algerian
 prisons; trade union officials also deny that forced labor
 exists.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum employment age is 16 years. Work inspectors, who
 report to the Ministry of Labor, are responsible for enforcing
 the minimum employment age by periodic or unannounced
 inspection visits to the workplace. The minimum age is
 enforced in the state seqtor, the country's largest employment
 sector. It is not effectively enforced in the agricultural
 sector or in the small private sector, but violations'are not
 widespread. With continuing economic hardship, however, there
 has been an increase in the number of children occupied in
 informal employment, such as street vending.,
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The 1990 Law on Work Relations defines'the overall framework
 for acceptable conditions of work, but leaves specific policies
 with regard to hours, salaries, and other work conditions to
 the discretion of employers in consultation with employees.
 Minimum wages are fixed by government decree after negotiations
 between the Government and the UGTA. Although Ministry of
 Labor work inspectors are responsible for ensuring compliance
 with the minimum wage regulations, enforcement has been
 spotty. The minimum wage is not adequate to provide a worker
 and his family a decent standard of living.
 Algeria has a 44-hour workweek and well-developed occupation
 and health regulations, but enforcement by g6vernment work
 inspectors is generally lax.
