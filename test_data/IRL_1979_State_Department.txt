 IRELAND
 Ireland attaches great importance to the observance
 and maintenance of human rights. Individual
 liberties and civil rights are guaranteed and pro-
 tected by the Constitution. Ireland has signed the
 International Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights and the International Covenant on Economic,
 Social and Cultural Rights. Political institutions
 are democratic and political life is orderly. The
 growth of terrorist activities resulting from the
 civil unrest in Northern Ireland, including the
 assassination of the British Ambassador and bombings
 of hotels, stores and pubs in Dublin in 1976,
 caused the Irish Government to introduce legisla-
 tion to combat terrorism. The Parliament adopted
 this legislation. The August 1979 murder of Earl
 Mountbatten by the Provisional Irish Republican
 Army has prompted an Irish Government review of
 security measures but has not prompted any new
 legislation.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and re-
 spected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Constitutional protections against such conduct are
 generally observed. Amnesty International, in a
 1977 report, expressed concern about alleged mal-
 treatment of detainees or prisoners, especially
 where terrorism or other serious crimes may have
 been involved. In response, the Government appointed
 a special committee headed by a retired judge to
 consider the allegations and make recommendations
 on measures to safeguard the rights of prisoners
 and detainees. This Committee's report was made
 public in September 1978. The Government stated
 that a majority of the recommendations were either
 accepted or already in effect. 'Those accepted by
 the Government included, for example, informing
 those needing to know of an arrest made, and per-
 mitting the suspect to write his own statement.

 Those already in effect included informing the
 suspect of his rights, maintaining police records
 on all developments in arrest cases and stressing
 in police training the proper treatment of persons
 arrested. The Government withheld application of
 some Committee recommendations pending further
 examination and rejected others. Amnesty Inter-
 national issued a statement in October 1978 urging
 the Government to reconsider several of the rejected
 proposals, such as permitting solicitors to attend
 interrogations and establishment of an independent
 complaints tribunal.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 In 1976, the spillover into the Republic of terrorist
 activities arising from the Northern Ireland situa-
 tion led the Irish Government to declare a state of
 emergency and to allow police to detain persons up
 to seven days without charge. A signatory of the
 European Convention'on Human Rights, Ireland availed
 itself of the rights of derogation permitted under
 the Convention until security conditions improved.
 The new Irish Government elected in June 1977 de-
 cided to return to a maximum period of two days of
 detention without charge. This took effect October
 12, 1977. There are no political crimes er se under
 Irish law and therefore no political status for any
 convicted persons. A number of those convicted for
 terrorist offenses are members of the Provisional
 Irish Republican Army and other illegal organizations.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice. The courts are independent of executive
 and military control. However, Article 38 of the
 1937 Constitution provides for special criminal
 courts. The Offenses against the State Act of 1939
 established such courts and provided that they may
 try persons for offenses against national security.
 Trial is by a panel of jurists, not by jury. The
 panel is uneven in number but no less than three;
 the verdict is bytmajority vote% Rules of evidence
 are generally similar to those of regular courts
 but the statement of a police Chief Superintendent
 that the accused is a member of an illegal organiza-
 tion will be considered evidence of such membership.
 Court sessions are usually public but may exclude
 certain persons except bona fide press representa-
 tives. There is provision for free legal aid and
 appeal against conviction or sentence.

 e. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 The Irish Government is firmly committed to improv-
 ing the quality of life for all its citizens. The
 1979 budget allots forty percent of current govern-
 ment expenditures to social welfare, health and
 education. Long-standing economic policies of
 industrialization and modernization have produced
 a substantial increase in the standard of living
 and a decrease in regional and occupational dis-
 parities. About forty percent of tax revenue comes
 from a progressive income tax, but the Government
 (like many European governments) relies heavily on
 indirect taxes such as value-added and excise taxes
 which are by nature regressive. Economic moderni-
 zation has been accompanied by changing social
 patterns, especially in the status of women, who now
 comprise one-third of the work force. Legislation
 requiring equal pay for equal work and providing un-
 employment benefits for single women is in effect.
 Adjustments have been effected to reduce fiscal
 disincentives for working wives. The significant
 gap in earnings between men and women is gradually
 narrowing. There is no corruption of any conse-
 quence. There is no discrimination on ethnic,
 religious or other grounds.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.  Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice. Certain terrorist organizations are
 illegal and membership in them is an offense against
 national security, but political parties associated
 with terrorist organizations are not proscribed.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,.
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There is complete freedom of movement, foreign
 travel and emigration.
 
 
 622
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 All Irish citizens participate fully in an orderly,
 democratic, multi-party political system. The labor
 movement is free and strong, and even government
 workers have the right to strike. Women play an
 increasingly important role in Irish society. They
 are represented in growing numbers in positions of
 executive, legislative and judicial authority as
 well as in business and labor organizations. The
 new Cabinet announced December 11, 1979, included a
 woman member for the first time since Irish
 independence.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Irish Government has a good record
 regarding independent, outside investigations of
 alleged human rights abuses. A 1977 Amnesty Inter-
 national Report and the Government's response to it
 were described in Section l.b. above.
