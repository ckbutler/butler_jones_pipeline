 BOLIVIA
 Bolivia is one of the poorest nations in Latin America.
 The harsh realities of geography, complicated by the
 lack of access to the sea, have frustrated until recently
 any sustained efforts at development. In good part as
 a result of these conditions, Bolivian history, even
 during periods-of democratic rule, has been marked by
 bouts of violence and instability, frequently accompanied
 by state of siege and other extraordinary provisions
 limiting personal and political rights.
 President Banzer's announcement of November 7, 1977 that
 Bolivia would return to civilian constitutional government
 in 1978 has led to a series of significant improvements
 in the status of human rights. In the area.ofjpoJi-..
 tical rights the Government has announced that .Presiden---
 l-an p-llam---i enay--eliction-ill be held on July 9,
 1978 and all restrictions on-political party and trade
 union activities have since been lifted. In the area of
 personal and political security there has been significant
 change as well. First, the Government announced in
 December a partial amnesty allowing all but 348 Bolivians
 to return from exile. At the same time the-Government
 announced the release of 33 of the 52 political pri-
 soners then in custody and the remanding for trial of
 the remaining 19.
 Then in January 1978, under pressure of a hunger strike,
 the Government announced-a general amnesty to all
 Bolivians in exile or subject to the system of Oresi-
 denciamientou (restrictions on activity or movement).
 Continued economic progress, with significant emphasis
 on the rural poor, has also undoubtedly improved the
 situation of some of the poorest segments of Bolivian
 society and contributed to the economic and social
 cohesion of this country.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Informed Bolivian human rights proponents report that
 the security police continued in 1977 to use forms of
 (137)
 
 22-145 0 - 78 - 10
 
 
 138
 torture against political prisoners they considered
 to be important during initial interrogation to obtain
 information. However, with the decrease in 1977 in the
 number of political prisoners (see c below) there was a
 significant decrease in the number of alleged incidents
 of torture' With the release of 33 political prisoners
 and the remanding to the courts for trial of the remain-
 ing 19 political prisoners in December 1977 and January
 1978 there have been no recent allegations of torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Many prisoners have been roughed up during the first days
 of confinement. Some have been severely beaten. However,
 the trend has apparently been toward fewer incidents and
 less severe treatment. When it occurs, mistreatment is
 most likely during initial interrogation before arrival
 at detention centers. International observers consider
 that treatment of political prisoners in detention centers
 is generally correct. Catholic Church and International
 Red Cross representatives report that the Government has
 allowed them.unimpeded access to almost all political
 prisoners, and that prisoners are able to receive weekly
 visits from their families. The Red Cross has also been
 able to assist prisoners with medicine, blankets, food,
 etc.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The number of arbitrary arrests followed by imprisonment,
 as mentioned above, declined significantly during the
 past year. In a report published in October 1977, the
 Bolivian Permanent Assembly on Human Rights (PAHR), listed
 450 persons as having been detained on politically-related
 charges for various periods during the first 10 months
 of 1977. The PArR is a human rights organization, includ-
 ing members of the clergy and some opposition politicians.
 It is led by Father Tumiri and former President Siles
 Salinas. The PAHR figure for 1976 was 800, 900 for 1975,
 and 2,400 for 1974. Some qbservers feel these figures
 are exaggerated, and confirmation is impossible. However,
 they do suggest a. steady decline in the number of people
 arrested on political charges.
 
 
 139
 Most persons arrested for alleged security or political
 offenses are detained for brief periods and released.
 There are no confirmed figures on the number of political
 prisoners, but one estimate suggested 58 at mid-December
 1977, down from between 80 to 170 a year earlier depending
 on the source. There may have been as many as 1000 trade
 unionists detained for up to six months, as Amnesty
 International has reported, if that figure includes the
 many who were held for only a few days. On December 21,
 1977, the Government announced that of the 52 political
 prisoners it said it held at that time, 33 would be re-
 leased and the remaining 19, considered violent and
 dangerous, would be handed over to the courts for trial.
 d. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 The 1967 Constitution contains a particularly detailed
 and clear guarantee of due process, including habeas
 corpus. The Government has overridden these guarantees
 with a 1972 General Security Decree and by a, November 1974
 announcement that the Constitution would be overruled by
 specific decrees. No political prisoners were actually
 brought to trial during 1977 and PAHR efforts to secure
 habeas corpus by the courts have been rejected. However,
 as mentioned above, the Government has now turned over 19
 political prisoners to the courts for trial. In cases
 of non-political prisoners, mechanisms for fair and
 public trials exist but delays, as noted below, hinder
 the judicial process.
 Despite strong U.S. Government efforts to achieve rapid
 judicial processing of the cases of US citizens confined
 in Bolivian prisons, awaiting trial on narcotics charges,
 and despite increasing cooperation from the Bolivian
 authorities, progress in the cases has been inordinately
 slow. The procedural delays affect everyone, Bolivians
 and foreigners alike, and are not the result of policy
 but of the inherent problems of the system. However,
 there has been improvement in moving American cases
 through the courts, and during the second half of 1977 15
 Americans were released. In November the Bolivian Govern-
 ment appointed a commission of distinguished jurists and
 high-level officials to recommend reforms of the narcotics
 
 
 140
 law, having particularly in mind the need to enhance
 guarantees of due process.
 *. Invasion of the Home
 Invasions of the home probably occur from time to time.
 There is no evidence that the central government condones
 these practices.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The Government has formulated a Five Year Economic and
 Social Development Plan for the 1976-1980 period. The-
 plan calls for rapid growth and development. It also sets
 forth the goals of improving national income distribution,
 incorporating the rural population (over 60% of the popu-
 lation) into the modern life of the country, and improving
 the welfare of the poor through education, health and
 agriculture programs.
 Current Government agricultural policy, while giving
 priority to commercial crop development, also seeks self-
 sufficiency in food production for domestic consumption.
 In support of its agricultural sector objectives, the
 Government increased the Ministry of Agriculture's budget
 by 56% in 1976.
 Five Year Plan goals for the health sector'are to increase
 life expectancy to 52 years by 1980, to reduce infant
 mortality and morbidity rates by 6% and 8%, respectively,
 and to strengthen health services. The Ministry of
 Health receives only 1.2% of the public budget. Despite
 this stringent resource base, the Ministry doubled its
 investment budget in 1976 and has since concentrated on-
 construction and renovation of health facilities.
 Education expenditures constitute 28.5%, the largest
 single item of the national budget. However, over half
 of education expenditures are in urban areas, whereas
 two-thirds of the population is rural.
 
 
 141
 The Bolivian housing program has been directed at urban
 requirements. Recently, however, the Government has
 expressed interest in extending low-cost housing develop-
 ment and the savings and loan system to the countryside.
 Urban poverty is wideppread. But the nation's recent
 rapid economic progress, including an urban construction
 boom, appears to have raised urban employment. Much of
 the industrial and infrastructure investment contained in
 the Five Year Plan can be expected to help the urban poor.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 These rights are generally respected in Bolivia with
 some exceptions, most of which of which are in the
 process of being removed. On November 9, in preparation
 for presidential elections to be held in July 1978,
 President Banzer announced the lifting of the November
 1974 decrees suspending allpolitical activity. Poli-
 tical parties are now free to assembly and conduct their
 normal activities. In mid-1977, representatives of a
 British mine workers union secretly visited a Government-
 run mining area in Bolivia. They later issued a report
 criticizing working conditions and restrictions on labor
 union activity. However, in January 1978 the Government
 lifted all restrictions on trade union activities. Re-
 strictive decrees remain in effect for universities and
 professional groups but are now under active review and
 it is expected that these too will be ended either
 shortly before or after the July 1978 election. In the
 meantime, civic organizations continue to meet without
 ,government reprisals.
 In October 1977, the Committee on Freedom of the Press
 of the Inter-American Press Association (IAPA) questioned
 the desirability of the establishment of a national
 system of information, which had been decreed by the
 Government. However, it also noted that the Government
 amended the decree after strenuous objections from the
 
 
 Bolivian press. The reformed decree states, "The Govern-
 ment of the Armed Forces maintains its objective of
 respect for freedom of expression, access to sources of
 information, and the right to express opinions and criti-
 cisms on public matters.0 The Committee also noted there
 was a considerable amount of self-censorship. More
 recently, the press has exercised less self-censorship
 in response to the more open atmosphere created by the
 announcement of elections.
 -Bolivians enjoy total freedom of religion.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Most Bolivians enjoy complete freedom of movement, both
 within and outside Bolivia. However, the PAR has esti-
 mated that the Government has exiled some 3,610 people
 for political reasons since taking power in 1971. The
 number exiled annually has dropped steadily through 1977.
 While the Assembly also states that *a total of 19,410
 people have had to leave Bolivia since 1971u, this figure
 includes 5,430 people who have chosen to.leave, many
 apparently out of concern over how they might be treated
 should they stay, and some 10,000 dependents. -
 In two stages, the first on December 21, 1977 and the
 second on January 17, 1978, the Government extended
 .amnesty to all political exiles. Amnesty was also"
 granted to those Bolivians under the system of Oresiden-
 ciamentom, which restricts an individual to or from
 an area, e.g., a miner believed to have been involved
 in proscribed political activity being restricted from
 returning to work in the mine.
 There are no known restrictions on emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 As noted above, on November 9, 1977, in announcing
 presidential elections for July 1978, President Banzer
 also announced the lifting of the November 1974 decree
 suspending all political activity. He also issued a
 
 
 general amnesty allowing all Bolivian politicans
 to return from exile. Political parties are now awaiting
 further word from the Government regarding ground rules
 for the conduct of the elections. The last national
 election in Bolivia was held in 1966.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The Government has cooperated fully with representatives
 of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 during 1977. The Swiss ICRC delegation and a Swiss ICRC
 medical doctor visited political prisoners in Bolivia in
 November 1977, and were able to talk privately with all
 of them. The Government has also cooperated with Bolivia's
 Catholic Church.
 The Bolivian Government has not generally harassed the
 PAHR, but in late 1977 11 of the 12 members of the PARR'S
 sub-division in the important mining center of Catavi were
 allegedly detained or transferred to other mining areas.
 During the January 1978 hunger strike directed by the
 PAHR, one PARR official was arrested for two days and
 then released unharmed at the end of the strike.
