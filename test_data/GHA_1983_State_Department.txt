 GHANA
 After almost two years in power the Provisional National
 Defense Council Government installed by Flight Lieutenant
 Jerry Rawlings appears to have weathered the worst of the threats
 to its existence posed by coup attempts and popular reaction
 against sane government actions. Effective state power is
 exercised by Rawlings and his close associates, many of whom look
 to Cuba and similar Marxist-oriented societies for role models on
 which to base the progress of the Ghanaian revolution. However,
 there are also more benign influences on the Government. Only
 two of the original seven members of the governing Council remain.
 One former member was convicted of murder and executed, one was
 imprisoned in 1982 for opposition to the current Council leader-
 ship, and three resigned. An attempt was made in the selection of
 replacement Council members to broaden the Government's base of
 support by including a traditional leader from the Muslim north
 and a woman.
 The Government forcefully and successfully put down a series of
 local civilian demonstrations in May 1983 and two attempted coups
 on June 16 and 19, 1983, which involved dissidents from abroad
 and elements of the armed forces within Ghana. The number of
 individuals killed by the military, police, or other unofficial
 backers of the Government is unknown but estimated to exceed 100
 since December 31, 1981. The events of May and June*1983 cowed
 opposition elements. Partly as a result, but also in recognition
 that the ultimate success of Ghana's revolution and its efforts
 to redress the economy require greater public support and effort,
 the Government began in mid-1983 to adjust its policies in an
 attempt to gain new support. Since August, for example, the
 Government, through speeches, meetings, and organized sessions has
 sought to instill a sense of responsibility into its cadres, to
 enlist the support of the more traditional and moderate elements
 in Ghanaian society, and to have the government-owned press pre-
 sent the news in a more neutral tone. Externally, it began a cam-
 paign to mend its relations with the developed countries of the
 West and Japan. However, systematic violations of international-
 ly accepted human rights continued to occur.
 In 1983, after years of urging by the World Bank and Interna-
 tional Monetary Fund, as well as by Western friends, Ghana
 agreed to undertake a massive program of economic reform, the
 principal features of which were a 1,000 percent currency
 devaluation, compression of Government expenditures, including
 civil service salaries, and institution of measures designed to
 drastically increase incentives to producers. In response to
 the Government's action, the Fund and the Bank approved
 financing of over half a billion dollars to support this
 reform program. Should the program work, its success will
 likely seriously diminish many of the economic problems that
 have been partially responsible for the country's political
 instability for years. That very instability is one of the
 prime causes for such abuses of human rights as have taken
 place in recent years.
 Human rights in Ghana in 1983 suffered from the Government's
 reaction to three attempted coups and demonstrations against the
 regime. Although some detainees were released, additional
 detentions occurred, including some of the more outspoken
 critics of the Government. A night curfew remains in effect
 and the borders with two of the three surrounding countries are
 partially closed. Most newspapers critical of the Government,
 
 
 149
 as well as the university system, have been shut down. All diplo-
 mats wishing to travel outside the greater Accra region must
 request permission 48 hours in advance. On the other hand, the
 Government is continuing a vigorous campaign against corruption,
 although some of the instrumentalities used to carry odt the pro-
 gram (citizen's vetting committees, price tribunals, and special
 investigatory bodies) do not provide the normal procedural safe-
 guards. The regime's success in repelling coup attempts from
 abroad, its use of repressive force, and a general public desire
 for stability, have resulted in a significant lessening of overt
 opposition to the Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Abritrary Deprivation of Life
 Last year the attention of the country was focused on the murders
 of three high court judges and a retired army major, allegedly
 because of past activity inimical to the interests of one or more
 important figures in the current regime's leadership. A special
 investigation board conducted an inquiry into the matter and issu-
 ed a final report in March. A government tribunal tried those
 directly accused by the board and, after confirmation of the sen-
 tence by the Government, executed the five found guilty. However,
 the Government rejected the investigation board's recommendation
 that there was sufficient evidence to warrant the trial of a
 senior official for complicity in the murders. There have also
 been executions of persons convicted for their roles in the coup
 attempts of June 16 and 19. In spite of requests for legal coun-
 sel, most persons appearing before the tribunals are unable to
 secure attorneys because of a boycott instituted by the Ghana Bar
 Association. The boycott is based on a number of criticisms of
 the tribunal system, including lack of an appeal process. (An
 appeal process was announced on December 22, 1983.) Following
 the June 19 coup attempt, there were numerous allegations of
 summary executions of military intelligence officers detained
 after the December 1981 coup who were suspected of participating
 or sympathizing with those who organized the June 19 jail break
 and take-over of Radio Ghana. One official is reported to have
 shot two prisoners being held by the border guards on suspicion of
 being escapees. Executions were sometimes carried out by agents
 or supporters of the Government without authorization. Capital
 crimes include "economic sabotage," which includes diversion or
 smuggling of petroleum products, cocoa, timber, diamonds, and
 gold.
 There are numerous media and private reports of persons shot by
 off-duty military personnel in random incidents. Early in 1983,
 alleged assailants were rarely identified or disciplined. More
 recently, perpetrators have been apprehended and punished.
 b. Disappearance
 Because of the difficult economic situation and the political
 situation, a substantial number of Ghanaians have gone abroad,
 sometimes without notifying friends and family. Earlier in the
 regime, arbitrary arrest and detention of individuals was not
 uncommon; however, during the past six months disappearances
 attributable to direct action by the Government have lessened
 considerably.
 
 
 150
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Government does not encourage or condone torture or cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment. In fact, there has been
 increased government and public concern expressed over the
 harsh prison conditions which caused a number of deaths from
 cholera and malnutrition. There have been private efforts to
 relieve these conditions, and the Government has eased regulations
 to permit prisoners to receive food, conjugal visits, and to
 participate in work-release programs, especially farming.
 However, there have been some instances of severe beatings
 administered to imprisoned opponents or detainees. From time to
 time there are unverified reports of interrogators using torture
 or deprivation to induce cooperation from detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 A number of persons detained in the aftermath of the December 31,
 1981 coup have been released, including the former President and
 Vice President. The number of those still detained from that
 period is probably fewer than 75. However, an unknown number of
 prominent persons have since been detained. These include Sgt.
 Daniel Alolga Akata-Pore, a former Council member; Sam Okudzeto,
 president of the Association of Recognized Professional Bodies;
 Michael Adjei, Public Relations Officer for the Ghana Oil Company;
 Obeng Mano, a lawyer writing in the local press; Tommy Thompson,
 publisher of the "Free Press" and John Rugblenu, his editor.
 Other persons, including clerics and some Americans, have been
 detained briefly, but released. The Government's Law No. 4
 provides for preventive custody and originally listed some 492
 persons to be detained. The law stipulates "indefinite
 detention." There has been no instance of the successful
 exercise of the right of habeas corpus. In fact, the right of
 appeal or of the exercise of habeas corpus is specifically
 denied in Section 11 of Goverrment Law No. 1 (Citizens Vetting
 Committee). Bail is still used with persons or property
 accepted as surety. The former President was recently released
 on "bail" of $1,667, despite the fact he had not been charged
 with any specific offense. There is an increasingly large number
 of Ghanaians who have gone into voluntary exile because of a
 desire to seek better employment or because of their hostility
 to the regime. Many of the estimated 1.2 million Ghanaians
 expelled from Nigeria in January 1983 are now returning to that
 country, primarily for economic reasons.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Traditional legal safeguards remain available in the functioning
 court system, which in the past had a better international
 reputation than its actual operation warranted. However, the
 Citizens Vetting Committee, the National Investigations
 Committee, the Special Military Tribunal, the Price Tribunal, and
 the Public Tribunal, organs set up by the current regime, do not
 provide for normal judicial safeguards or for the right of
 appeal. (An appeal process was announced December 22, 1983.)
 As a result, many of these bodies are boycotted by members of the
 Ghana Bar Association. The boycott effectively denies the accus-
 ed the right to qualified counsel, which reportedly results at
 times in unjust sentences by laymen not experienced in law who
 function as judges in these bodies. The Government has confirmed
 
 
 151
 sentences of execution by firing squad for those convicted of
 capital crimes by the public tribunals, although there was no
 legal requirement to do so, nor was there a right as such to an
 appeal. In one instance, a death sentence was commuted to life
 imprisonment.
 The number of known political prisoners is believed to exceed
 65, if one updates Amnesty Internatonal information, but the
 exact number is unknown and it is impossible to determine how
 many people may be held in indefinite detention outside of Accra.
 One estimate is over 600. There is also the question of defini-
 tion as there have been a number of persons convicted by the pub-
 lic tribunals and the Citizens Vetting Committee, who have not
 been tried in accordance with the standards that prevailed in
 Ghana before the revolution. The best known instance of someone
 so convicted is Kwame Pianim, a former chief executive of the
 Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board, who was tried by a public tribunal
 for his involvement in the November 23 coup plot.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 While membership is not compulsory, it is helpful to be
 associated with a People's Defense Committee in the home
 neighborhood and a Worker's Defense Committee at the place of
 work. There are allegedly special allocations of food and other
 scarce commodities through the Defense Committee network and the
 local people's shops. Lack of membership in these organizations
 reportedly precludes access at official prices to some of the
 most basic necessities, including rice, flour, sugar, and engine
 oil. Telephone conversations are apparently monitored as some
 people have reportedly been picked up for questioning without
 judicial authorization and reportedly there have been forced
 entries and searches, especially at the time of coup attempts.
 Members of defense committees have exercised quasi-judicial
 powers by establishing roadblocks, setting up ad hoc tribunals,
 or engaging in questionable activities ostensibly designed to
 uncover black marketeers or smugglers. Recently, the committees
 have reportedly been brought under more effective control.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government owns the radio and television stations, as well as
 two daily newspapers. There used to be a lively weekly press, but
 through the control of the allocation of newsprint and intimida-
 tion, the private press has dwindled to four organs. Several
 press critics of the Government are reported to have been severely
 beaten and put into indefinite detention. In June, the premises
 of the "Free Press" and the "Citadel Press" were attacked
 and the papers closed. The editor and publisher of the "Free
 Press" remain in detention. While the Government provides guidance
 and occasional actual articles for use by the media, it claims that
 it does not normally exercise prior censorship and sometimes shows
 signs of annoyance at the excessive zeal displayed in its own media.
 Some employees of government media who do not follow government
 policy have been reassigned, placed on indefinite leave, or dis-
 missed. There are certain topics which are generally excluded
 from the media, which include comments personally critical of
 Chairman Rawlings or against the revolution in principle.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are a number of restrictions on the freedom of peaceful
 assembly and association. For example, police permits are
 required for public meetings. They are generally granted except
 in cases where the meeting's purpose is suspected to be anti-
 government in nature. In 1982, supporters of the regime took
 over the leadership of the Trades Union Congress and its 17
 member unions by installing Interim Management Committees.
 During 1983, a series of elections was held that reinstated
 regular union officials in all but the Maritime and Dock
 Workers Union. There were complaints under the Inter-
 national Labor Organization's Convention Number 87 about a
 lack of freedom of association. However, during 1983, a series
 of elections were held that reinstated regular union officials
 in all unions. In mid-December 1983, the twice-postponed quad-
 rennial Conference of Ghana's Trades Union Congress finally met
 and held elections in which traditional trade unionists won the
 major positions. In response to antigovernment agitation by
 university students, workers were urged and provided incentives
 to demonstrate against the students on May 9. The demonstrators
 were moved in government-owned vehicles and accompanied by an
 Information Services Department vehicle carrying public address
 equipment and a ranking government official. In a series of ac-
 tions at the Hall of Trades Union, the Methodist Church and the
 University, numerous persons were attacked, beaten and injured and
 two students may have been killed. The University was taken over
 by the "workers' and has been closed since. An earlier demonstra-
 tion resulted in a U.S. Government-owned vehicle being com-
 mandeered by "workers" after they had beaten two employees of the
 U.S. mission. The Government apologized for this act and paid
 damages in September 1983.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is freedom of religion with no state or otherwise-favored
 religion. There is no restriction on the exercise of religion
 or in contacts with others of the same faith, both inside and
 outside the country. While government treatment of religious
 matters is basically evenhanded, Muslims making the Haj
 pilgrimage to Mecca are given special foreign exchange allot-
 ments. Persons of other faiths going abroad for religious
 reasons are not given any special consideration for foreign
 exchange.
 Individual church leaders, sometimes with significant numbers of
 congregation members, have sharply expressed opposition to the
 current Government. Consequently, the Government has sometimes,
 particularly at times of political tension, moved against church
 leaders.
 Following the attempted coups of June 16 and 19, six members of
 the Christian Council were ordered to report to authorities
 "without fail for their own safety." On June 23 two priests, one
 an American, and an officer of the Salvation Army were arrested
 and briefly detained. On the same day, an unlawful search of
 the Lutheran Church offices in Kaneshie took place. A June 24
 request for police protection for a Catholic bishop was turned
 down by the Secretary of the Interior with the observation:
 "The church deserves what they have because they have been
 inciting the people against the Government." On June 26, a
 Catholic Church at Mamprobi was vandalized and a Catholic priest
 
 
 153
 was arrested at Kaneshie; the Catholic Bishop of Cape Coast was
 also detained. Since July 1983 no further harassment of church
 people has been reported.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 People are free to move from one part of the country to another
 without any permission or pass requirement. However, since
 June 1983, diplomats have been required to give 48 hours' notice
 before traveling outside the greater Accra region. The existence
 of numerous police, military, and border guard checkpoints inhibits
 travel to some extent. Some of these checkpoints are manned by
 People's or Worker's Defense Committee personnel who claim to be
 looking for smuggled or black-market goods. Travelers tell of
 being asked for a receipt or waybill if they have more than some
 arbitrarily determined minimum acceptable amount of a particular
 item; failure to have proper documentation leads to forfeiture of
 the goods and possible trial for attempting to smuggle goods.
 As a member of the Economic Community of West African States
 (ECOWAS), Ghanaians are free to travel for up to 90 days to
 other member states. However, all land borders were closed
 in September 1982. These controls have been relaxed with Upper
 Volta and although Ghana has declared the Togo border open at
 four points, the Togolese have demanded a completely open border
 and refused to honor the Ghanaian position. Ghanaians are
 generally free to emigrate or to be repatriated from other
 countries unless they are considered a security threat and then
 special permission must be obtained. Sometimes there are
 administrative delays of over a year in issuing passports.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The Provisional National Defense Council, chaired by Flight
 Lieutenant J. J. Rawlings, exercises executive power in Ghana.
 In addition, a number of close advisers, both within and out-
 side the formal government structure, advise on government
 policy. There are no elections and no current procedure by
 which citizens can freely choose to change their laws or
 officials.
 The Government claims it is attempting to establish a decen-
 tralized system of rule which aims at bringing decisionmaking
 closer to the people at the regional, district, and village
 level. Plans call for the bureaucracy to be dispersed throughout
 the country and for the Defense Committee network to function as
 a two-way system to transmit government policies down to the
 people and the concerns of the people up to the Government. The
 Secretary to the National Defense Committee has said that there
 will be some form of elections leading to a National Congress in
 1984. In planning this new political system for Ghana, the
 leadership has tended to look to Cuba, Libya, and Ethiopia, as
 role models.
 While a conventionally organized bureaucracy operates the
 Government on a day-to-day basis, all key policy decisions are
 made by Chairman Rawlings with a few close advisers.
 
 
 154
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Within the country there are a number of religious and profes-
 sional bodies concerned about human rights and the direction
 of government policy. While these organizations in 1982 called
 attention to human rights violations and asked the Government to
 restore democratic rights, they are now concentrating on such
 nonpolitical issues as prison improvement. The president of one
 organization (Association of Recognized Professional Bodies) has
 been detained by the Government. The International Parliamentary
 Union (IPU) last year passed a resolution criticizing the continued
 detention without charge of elected members of the previous
 government. Three International Parliamentary Union delegations
 have visited Ghana, the last in April 1983. Perhaps in response
 to this concern, the Government has released a number of detained
 elected officials, including the former President and Vice Presi-
 dent of Ghana.
 The Organization of Africa Trade Union Unity, the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the International Labor
 Organization have noted the takeover of the Trades Union Con-
 gress; elections subsequently were organized in all 17 member
 unions and in the umbrella organization, the Trades Union
 Congress.
 In July 1983, Amnesty International issued a report on its
 concerns in Ghana, including the establishment of public
 tribunals, the detention without trial of suspected political
 opponents, the imprisonment after an unfair trial of suspected
 political opponents, reports of arbitrary killings by members of
 the armed forces, and the beating and ill treatment of suspected
 political opponents and criminals. Amnesty's attempts to secure
 visas to attend a public tribunal session have so far not been
 successful and it has received no reply to at least two inquiries
 for information on the number of political detainees in Ghana.
 Freedom House terms Ghana "not free."
 General human rights matters are handled by the Office of
 International Organizations and Conferences in the Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs.
 Ghana participates in the work of the U.N. Human Rights Commis-
 sion in Geneva.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Ghana is a developing country of about 13,367,000 citizens (1983
 estimate). The population is growing at 3.2 percent (1983).
 Life expectancy at birth is 49.46, and the infant mortality rate
 in 1983 is estimated at 78 per 1,000 live births. The gross
 national product per capita was estimated by the International
 Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) at $360 in 1982.
 The Ghanaian economy is mixed, with the Government owning a num-
 ber of enterprises in the agricultural, mining, and manufacturing
 sectors. However, most agriculture enterprises, including the
 key cocoa sector are owned by small farmers. The Government
 maintains a monopoly over the purchase of cocoa, coffee, shea
 nuts, and cotton. There is also a substantial private trading
 sector, although the Government favors the state-owned companies
 
 
 155
 for procurement and the Ghana National Trading Company and the
 People's Shops for distribution. The Government has signifi-
 cantly increased the prices paid to the farmer for cocoa this
 year and announced plans to try to increase the efficiency of
 the overstaffed Cocoa Marketing Board.
 An austere economic policy was adopted this year which was
 welcomed by the International Monetary Fund/International Bank for
 Reconstruction and Development and Western donors as an essential
 element for economic growth. Among its features were: a deval-
 uation of Ghana's currency by over 1,000 percent; establishment
 of producer and export incentives; and budgetary stringency.
 Agreements with the Fund and International Bank of Reconstruc-
 tion and Development on a multimillion dollar stabilization
 program designed to reverse the country's economic decline were
 reached this year. Foreign donors and international lending agen-
 cies formed a consultative group on Ghana which met in Paris in
 November 1983 to support Ghana's recovery program.
 The Government seeks as a goal to increase access by all elements
 of the population to health and nutritional services, education,
 credit, and other government services. While there are encouraging
 signs of greater access to government services, the present
 depressed state of the economy and the lack of sufficient
 resources to fund expansion inhibit the ability of the Government
 to deliver.
 In 1970, the adult literacy rate was estimated to be 30.2 per-
 cent, but the male level was 43.1 while the female was only 18.4
 percent. This can be attributed partly to limited educational
 facilities and the tradition of choosing to favor educating the
 male over the female children. By 1978, primary school enrollment
 ratios indicated that 71 percent were enrolled, with the dif-
 ference having narrowed to 80 percent for boys and 62 percent for
 girls. Observation tends to indicate there is now a more equit-
 able access to education, and the principal problem currently is
 lack of inputs in general rather than preferential treatment.
 In 1975, 35 percent of the population had access to safe drinking
 water, with 86 percent of the urban population and only 14 per-
 cent of the rural population having such access. Here again,
 newspaper accounts and a large World Bank loan indicate the
 Government is attempting to increase the availability of water
 for both the rural and urban populations. The past year a com-
 bination of natural disasters (drought, desiccating winds, and
 bush fires) and misguided policies by successive governments
 (lack of inputs and low farm gate prices) have resulted in a
 severe grain shortfall estimated at 192,000 tons for the last
 growing season and 280,000 tons for the next. The Government has
 appealed to the Food and Agriculture Organization and the
 international donor community for assistance in meeting this
 food crisis.
 Other tribal groups consider the Government to be somewhat biased
 in favor of the Ewe tribe. However, tribalism generally is not
 a serious problem in Ghana. Women's rights in the economy,
 business, and the civil service, as well as in the home, have
 long been well-established and respected in Ghana. No insti-
 tutional antifemale biases exist. There is one woman among the
 five members of the ruling Provisional National Defense Council,
 a woman Cabinet member, and at least four women in subcabinet
 positions. Although women in urban centers and those who have
 entered modern society encounter little bias in most endeavors,
 those in the rural agricultural sector still are subject to the
 impositions associated with traditional tribal male-dominant
 mores.
