 URUGUAY
 
 The human rights situation in Uruguay continued to
 improve in 1981. An accelerated plan for the restoration
 of democracy was announced. Political rights were
 restored to many of the leading politicians from the
 major parties. In consultation with political party
 repreeentatives, the government drafted and promulgated
 a law governing the organization and functioning of
 political parties Internal party elections are set
 for November 28, 1982. A revised constitution is
 to be drafted and debated in 1983-84. Open elections
 for president and congress and a plebiscite on a new
 constitution are scheduled for November 1984. While
 .restrictions continued during 1981 on the right of
 political assembly and press freedoms, there were
 *significant improvements in both areas.
 Although traditional constitutional guarantees remain
 suspended for national security cases, there were
 few instances of arbitrary arrest in .1981. The number
 of.political and national security prisoners continued
 its slow decline. Serious charges arose again over
 prisoner mistreatment. While conditions are harsh
 .and abuses occur, available evidence indicates these
 charges are exaggerated.
 Uruguay .has long been a democracy with advanced social
 welfare policies. However, in the late 1960's a period
 .of national-malaise reflecting decades of economic
 stagnation culminated in the breakdown of social and
 .political institutions, economic paralysis and urban
 terrorismby the Marxist-oriented Tupamaros. Representative,
 civilian government was unable to cope with this situation.
 In 1972 the elected government passed a national security
 law-which limited individual rights, expanded police
 and military powers and shifted national security
 cases to military courts. In 1973 conflicts between
 the legislature and the armed forces over the anti-
 . subversion campaign led to the closure of the congress.
 The trend thereafter was toward de~facto military
 rule. In 1976 the military removed the president,
 and since then the armed forces have exercised control
 over a civilian military government.
 Anti-terrorist activities during 1971-73, conducted
 with little regard for individual rights, resulted
 in 'the virtual elimination of the Tupamaros. Further
 .security arrests in 1975-77 concentrated on communists
 .and far-left activists. The period from 1976 to 1979
 was marked by the de facto suspension of the political
 rights of political leaders, restrictions on the freedom
 of expression and loss of an independent judiciary.
 In each year since 1978 there have been fewer violations
 of individual rights. Although the institutional
 framework under which such violations occurred still
 remains, the early pattern of arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment under harsh conditions is no longer the
 norm. The government in 1979 ordered an end to torture.
 Credible reports of physical abuse have declined.

 A constitutional plebiscite which the government lost
 in 1980 marked the beginning of a process for return
 to democratic rule. The new president has pledged
 his support for a return to constitutional, elected
 government in 1985.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Following internal measures taken in 1979 to curb
 the use of torture, credible reports of physical brutality
 have continued to decline. The 1972-77 period witnessed
 widespread use of torture to obtain information.
 Several prisoner deaths in 1981 were alleged to have
 resulted from torture, but extensive inquiries have
 not been able to substantiate such charges.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The death penalty and brutal treatment are outlawed
 by the 1967 constitution.   Prisoners, relatives and
 others allege psychological intimidation and harassment
 although to a lesser extent than in the past. Harsh
 treatment still may occur during initial detention
 and interrogation, including beatings, lack of food
 or water, isolation, hooding or deprivation of sleep.
 Treatment is determined in part by the type of charges,
 the individual's prominence and the security unit
 handling the case.
 There is no evidence of discrimination in treatment
 of prisoners because of race, religion, sex or social
 origin.
 Prison conditions for political detainees are somewhat
 better than for common criminals. After indictment,
 prisoners are not normally mistreated, although there
 have been reports of abuse at Libertad Prison by guards
 and other prisoners. Diet is monotonous and limited,
 but adequate. Health care is comparable to the national
 norm. Prisoners are permitted to see visitors every
 two weeks under restricted conditions and to receive
 parcels and funds for canteen purchases. Allegations
 of systematic psychological pressure to break down
 prisoners' personalities are difficult to verify.
 Although admittedly difficult to assess, the behavior
 of released prisoners seen by foreign diplomats has
 not confirmed these allegations.
 c. Disappearances
 Since 1978 there have been no reported disappearances.
 Families are not informed of the arrest of prisoners
 detained for security reasons until initial investigation
 is completed. A number of reported disappearances
 from earlier years have not been resolved.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Habeas corpus and other constitutional guarantees
 have been effectively suspended for national security
 cases since 1972, but there have been very few reports
 of arbitrary arrest in recent years, including 1981.
 
 
 539
 Uruguayan authorities insist that all *national security
 prisoners' were arrested for violent crimes or other
 illegal, subversive activities. Subversive acts are
 broadly defined and include "undermining the morale
 of the armed forces" and "disrespect for military
 authorities.*
 Since April 1972 approximtely 6,200 persons have been
 turned over to the military justice system. Of this
 number, over 1,300 were subsequently released without
 trial. Approximately 3,500 others were freed over
 time by judicial order. Of the 1,500 such prisoners
 held at the end of 1979, 1,014 remained in prison
 as-of December 18, 1981. (These figures exclude a
 small number detained at any-given time without formal
 charges under interim security measures.) During
 1981, 205 were released. A certain number of the
 prisoners still being held, once estimated by authorities
 at about 300, have been convicted of violent crimes,
 such as bombing or kidnapping. There are reports
 of the continued detention under the interim security
 measures of some prisoners who have completed their
 sentences. Other prisoners, upon release, have reportedly
 been rearrested and prosecuted on new charges. In
 -late 1980 authorities charged a small group of prisoners
 and their families with participation in a defamation
 campaign to rally international opinion against prison
 conditions.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A new institutional act has formally restored the
 independence of the judiciary, and implementing laws
 and regulations are being written.
 Both the civilian and the military court systems use
 written proceedings. The judge decides on the basis
 of briefs and often confronts the accused only during
 arraignment and sentencing. The evidence, arguments
 and records are normally closed to the public.
 An individual accused of subversive activities is
 subject to trial under the military justice system,
 which is secretive, often arbitrary and limits the
 ability of the accused to mount an effective defense.
 Standards governing admissibility of evidence are
 less rigorous than under the ordinary penal code.
 Confessions, sometimes obtained under severe physical
 or psychological pressure, have formed the basis for
 the majority of convictions. Harsh sentences imposed
 on political/security prisoners reflect the Uruguayan
 government's perception of the seriousness and extent
 of-past subversion. Decisions of the military court
 system may be appealed to the supreme court, although
 this process is rarely used. The appeals process
 provides for a public hearing, but there were no open
 proceedings in 1981. The 1980 report of the Inter-
 American Human Rights Commission states that the military
 judicial system did not guarantee due process. The
 1981 report of Amnesty International expressed concern
 abut the lack of legal.safeguards for detainees and
 the trial of civilians before military tribunals.
 Since 1978 Uruguayan authorities have accelerated
 the work of the military court system. The backlog
 
 
 540
 of prisoners awaiting indictment has been eliminated,
 while the number of persons not yet sentenced declined
 from 400 in 1979 to about 50 in 1981. There are still
 prolonged delays in the system.
 Detainees are free to choose their own counsel, but
 usually accept court-appointed defenders. Counsel
 does not have pre-indictment access to clients or
 full access to the evidence. The defense role is
 limited largely to sentence-bargaining and pleading
 for early release.
 Approximately 500 prisoners were released in 1977,
 600 in 1978, another 600 in 1979, about 330 in 1980
 and 205 in 1981. Most were freed on parole, which
 may restrict movement and limit the right to travel
 abroad. Most ex-prisoners experience problems in
 finding employment.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Guarantees of inviolability of the home are respected
 in non-security cases, but are suspended under the
 emergency security measures for persons suspected
 of terrorism, subversion or similar activities. Since
 1978 invasion of the home by security forces has been
 infrequent.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The media continued to be restricted, but exercised
 greater freedom of expression in 1981 than previously.
 They operate under a system of self-censorship, monitored
 by the national office of public relations. Unfavorable
 comment on the armed forces is not allowed. The government
 is sensitive to criticism of its policies and responded
 to infringements in 1981 by admonishing media officials,
 withdrawing official advertisements, closing two publications
 for short periods and briefly detaining an editor.
 Most such actions were directed against new opposition
 weeklies which opened during 1980-81. Despite these
 restraints, the press and electronic media reported
 more extensively on political topics and commented
 critically upon a wider range of subjects in 1980-
 81 than previously. Foreign publications from non-
 communist countries are available in Uruguay, although
 an occasional issue may be banned for critical articles.
 The right of public assembly was expanded in 1981,
 although it remains controlled. Traditional political
 parties held meetings immediately before the 1980
 plebiscite. They have met extensively since mid-1981
 under new rules which require advance permission and
 require that such meetings be open to the public.
 A new labor code guaranteeing the right to organize
 and to bargain collectively was enacted in 1981.
 The right-to-strike is expected to be restored in
 1982. Labor organizations had been in limbo since
 the early 1970's when the communist-dominated National
 Labor Confederation was dissolved. Labor activities
 remain closely controlled. In 1978 the government
 began to relax some of the constraints on organizing
 
 
 541
 and bargaining, and democratic trade unions and their
 national confederation slowly began to revive. A
 1981 report of the International Labor Organization
 expressed satisfaction with improvements made in the
 Uruguayan labor code.
 Uruguay is a secular state. Religious freedom is
 constitutionally guaranteed and respected. There
 were no incidents of anti-semitism in 1981. The Korean-
 origin Unification Church has been allowed to register
 and operate despite strong local opposition.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no general restrictions on freedom of movement.
 The government sometimes delays or denies renewal
 of passports to persons suspected of national security
 offenses. There has been no known forcible repatriation
 since 1978. Uruguay has not received any refugee
 groups in recent years.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 A marked increase in political participation began
 in 1980 and continued in 1981. The November 1980
 constitutional plebiscite was the first opportunity
 for the public to vote since 1971. Political activity
 was widespread immediately prior to the vote, and
 the plebiscite was conducted honestly.
 Following the rejection of the government-supported
 constitution there was a lull in political activity
 while authorities examined plans to return to civilian
 government. In mid-1981 the government removed legal
 proscriptions against political activity from a large
 number of political leaders and reaffirmed its intention
 to continue the political transition. Political rights
 were restored to all but a few of the non-Marxist
 politicians of the two major traditional parties during
 1981, although several major political figures remain
 proscribed. A different category of restrictions
 on civil and political rights, applicable principally
 to an estimated 8,000 Marxist and related party members,
 remains in force.
 An active dialogue with party representatives resumed,
 and political party activity was permitted. Negotiations
 were completed on a new law governing establishment,
 structure, and operations of political parties. Citizens
 will be able to nominate and elect new party leadership
 in November 1982. The passage of the law was widely
 hailed by.party spokesmen, including leading opposition
 groups. It is the most important step taken thus
 far in the process of restoration of democratic institutions.
 That will be followed by the drafting of a new or
 revised constitution, with party participation, in
 1983. A plebiscite on the constitution and open elections
 for president and congress are planned for November
 1984.
 Retired General Gregorio Alvarez, selected as President
 of Uruguay, took office September 1, 1981, for a 42-
 month transitional period. President Alvarez has
 pledged personal support for a return to elected,
 constitutional government by 1985. A new council
 
 
 542
 of state and local officials were also named under
 the terms of the current institutional acts.
 The new president has stated that he would rescind
 Institutional Act No. 7, under which thousands of
 persons have been fired since 1977 from government
 positions, mainly in the educational system. These
 dismissals, directed at employees suspected of subversive
 political beliefs and carried out without effective
 recourse, continue on a diminished level.
 There were no reports of deprivation of nationality
 or citizenship.
 Women in Uruguay are accorded equality before the
 law. They attend the university and pursue professional
 careers in large numbers. A female cabinet officer
 was appointed in 1981 for the second time in Uruguayap
 history. Another woman was appointed in 1981 as Uruguay's
 first female Supreme Court judge. Overall, equality
 of pay is not always granted, especially to ordinary
 workers in the private sector, and there are barriers
 to equality stemming from traditional social patterns
 and restricted employment opportunities.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alledged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Uruguay amended its constitution in 1976 to permit
 international monitoring of human rights under certain
 strict conditions. Since 1976 it has responded to
 inquiries made in the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission, which considered Uruguay under its confidential
 1503 procedures. The government also cooperates with
 the International Labor Organization regarding trade
 union practices, but opposes a visit by the Inter-
 American Human Rights Commission.   Other organizations,
 such as B'nai B'rith, the National Academy of Sciences
 and important European groups, have visited and/or
 maintained dialogue with the Uruguayan government
 on human rights issues. An office of "Paz y Justicia",
 the Latin American human rights organization, opened
 in Uruguay in 1981.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Uruguayans are well fed by any standards. The basics
 of a well-balanced diet are relatively inexpensive
 and in good supply.   With a per capita gross national
 product of $2,100 (1979), average income is relatively
 high. Income is more equally distributed than in
 most developing countries.
 The availability and standards of medical care also
 are considerably above the hemispheric norm. There
 is high life expectancy at birth (71 years in 1979)
 and low infant mortality (34 per 1,000 live births
 in 1978). In 1975 84 percent of the population had
 access to safe water and the quality of public sanitation
 compared favorably with that of other developing countries.
 Health care is free to the poor and available at nominal
 cost to others.
 Uruguay has a 94 percent literacy rate (1976). Virtually
 all children receive a primary school education.
 
 
 543
 Total adjusted primary school enrollment ratio was
 105 in 1978. Secondary school attendance also is
 .,relatively high, and university education is free.
 Male students. outnumber :females in higher education
 by-a emallmargin; 'There isno variation by sex at
 -primary and secondary level.
 For a 'half century, wider income distribution was
 a prime objective of economic policy. Indices of
 income:concentration indicatethat a decade ago income
 was as evenly.spread in Uruguay as in Western Europe.
 However, the:country's economic policieswere less
 successfulnin-creating wealth. Following a policy
 �of-import substitution sustained by a transfer of
 resources from an already weak agricultural sector,
 exports fell,.and the country was beset by periodic
 balance of payment crises.. Burdened by a large public
 sector as well as distortions and disincentives caused
 by price controls and tax-and foreign exchange regulations,
 per capita income declined in the period 1955-1974.
 -Inflation-soared.  Since then a program of economic
 reform hasresulted in a growth .in per-capita income
 -oftover.35 percent. .However, it was accompanied by
 a sharp decline in real wages and a narrowing in the
 distribution of income. Real-wages began to increase
 . again in mid-1980. Economic growth continued in 1981,
 although at a lower level, an estimated two percent,
 .compared to over four percent'in 1980. Inflation
 declined to:approximately 30 percent, and 'unemployment
 :was reduced to six percent compared to over 11 percent
 in 1977. , Overall, Uruguay compares very-favorably
 with other hemispheric nations,.and often with the
 .developed countries as well, on a broad spectrumof
 socio-economic indicators.
