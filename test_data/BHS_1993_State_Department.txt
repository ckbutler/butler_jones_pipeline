 THE BAHAMAS
 The Bahamas is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy and a member of the
 Commonwealth of Nations. Queen Elizabeth II is the nominal Head of State and
 is represented in The Bahamas by an appointed Governor General. The Government
 is headed by an elected Prime Minister and Parliament. Since 1992 the Government
 has been controlled by the Free National Movement (FNM) of Prime Minister Hu-
 bert A. Ingraham. The opposition Progressive Liberal Party is led by Sir Lynden 0.
 Pindling, who was Prime Minister from independence in 1973 until 1992.
 The police and a small defense force are answerable to civilian authority and gen-
 erally respect laws protecting human rights. However, there were continuing credi-
 ble reports that po ice occasionally abuse suspects during interrogations. Man of
 the allegations involved members of the Criminal Investigations Department (CID),
 which is also the body charged with investigating such cases. CID issued no public
 reports of such investigations during 1993.
 The economy depends primarily on tourism, which accounts for more than half of
 the gross domestic product. Financial services, particularly offshore banking and
 trust management, are also important foreign currency earners. While some Baha-
 mians enjoy relatively high average income levels overall unemployment is esti-
 mated to exceed 20 percent, and there is considerable underemployment and some
 poverty.
 Bahamians enjoy a wide range of democratic freedoms and human rights. As in
 past years, the principal human rights problems were police abuse of detainees,
 harsh and overcrowded conditions at the only prison, abuses against Haitians
 caused by local antagonism toward the Haitian migrant community, violence
 against women, and the slow pace of justice. The Government established a coro-
 ner's court in 1993 to conduct independent investigations in cases where criminal
 suspects die while in police custody and for other deaths in unusual circumstances.
 Only one prosecution on the basis of alleged police abuse commenced during 1993,
 that of three police officers charged with a beating death in 1989.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of killings for
 political motives by the Government or domestic political groups. Three police offi-
 cers from the island of Eleuthera were placed on trial on charges of manslaughter
 arising from the 1989 beating death of a criminal suspect at the time of arrest. At
 year's end, this trial had not been completed. The Government established a coro-
 ner's court in 1993 to investigate deaths of suspects in police custody and accidental
 deaths involving unusual circumstances. There were no such deaths reported in
 1993. Most Bahamian police still do not carry firearms, although several were shot
 during attempted arrests in 1993.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of abductions, secret arrests, or clandes-
 tine detention by police or other official security forces.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel and degrading treatment or pun-
 
 
 355
 ishment but Bahamian human rights monitors expressed concern over a pattern of
 police abuse against criminal suspects. The police Criminal Investigation Depart-
 ment is charged with investigating allegations of abuse and disciplining those offi-
 cers determined to be guilty. Many of the charges of abuse, however, involved CID
 officers themselves who allegedly beat criminal suspects, occasionally with instru-
 ments such as baseball bats, during interrogations in an effort to extract confes-
 sions. In one incident being investigated by the Grand Bahama Human Rights Or-
 ganization, a criminal suspect in Freeport claimed to have been cut with garden
 shears during an interrogation. Charges by a Jamaican attorney that he had been
 beaten by Bahamian immigration officers at Nassau International Airport in De-
 cember led to an official protest by the Jamaican Government.
 Although Bahamian police claimed to be investigating many of these incidents, no
 reports of such investigations were published during 1993, nor were any police offi-
 cers tried or disciplined for such abuse. In at least one incident, an alleged victim
 of such abuse reported being harassed after release from custody by the officer he
 accused.
 Conditions at Fox Hill, The Bahamas' only prison, remain harsh and overcrowded.
 The men's facility1 originally built in 1953 to house about 500 inmates, holds over
 1,800 prisoners. Up to four male prisoners may be housed in 6- by 8-foot cells de-
 signed to hold no more than two. Most prisoners lack beds and many sleep on con-
 crete floors. The cells have no running water, and drinking water is often not sup-
 plied unless the prisoner has paid a trusty. Sanitation facilities usually consist of
 a plastic bucket i each cell. A public investigation in June into the 1988 death of
 a F ox Hill prisoner highlighted the problem ofpoorly controlled violence among pris-
 on inmates. Prisoners allege that requests for medical attention are sometimes de-
 nied. Prison authorities often decline to forward prisoners' letters, including letters
 to the courts by prisoners defending themselves.
 The Grand Baama Human Rig ts Association conducted a limited instpecion of
 onditions at Fox Hill in May. On two se parate occasions, diplomats and Bahamian
 journalists were allowed to make comprehensive, unsupervised visits. The journal-
 ists' subsequent articles, accompanied by photographs of prison conditions, received
 wide coverage in the local press, and the Ingraham administration appointed a new
 superintendent and senior deputy superintendent at Fox Hill. In September the
 Government transferred oversight of the prison from the Ministry of Justice to the
 Ministry of Public Safety and Transport. Improvements in prison conditions, how-
 ever, still await the availability of adequate government funding.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention. Authorities conduct arrests openly and, when required, obtain
 judicially issued warrants. Felony cases, including those of suspected narcotics or
 firearms possession, however, do not require warrants where probable cause exists.
 Suspects under arrest appear before a magistrate within 48 hours (or by the next
 business day for cases asining on weekends and holidays) to hear the charges
 against them. At this point they generally gain access to an attorney of their choice.
 The Government respects the right to a judicial determination of the legality of ar-
 rests, but Bahamian law allows no compensation for false arrest. It is possible to
 sue police authorities for malicious arrest but the standard of proof is high and
 there are no recent reports of successful suits on this ground.
 A system of bail exists, albeit mostly for Bahamian suspects, as foreign offenders
 are generally considered to be likely to flee if granted bail. Judges sometimes au-
 thorize cash bail for foreigners arrested on minor charges, but generally prefer to
 levy fines in exchange for guilty pleas. The Government is obligated to provide legal
 representation only to destitute suspects in cases involving capital crimes. Illegal
 migrants, mostly Haitians, have the right to retain legal representation, although
 not at government expense, but are generally held at Fox Hill prison pending depor-
 tation unless they can arrange private means for their repatriation. As a result, ille-
 gal migrants may be held at Fox Hill for weeks or months while awaiting repatri-
 ation.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The justice system in The Bahamas derives from
 English common law. The judiciary is independent, appointed by the executive
 branch on the advice of the Judicial and Legal Services Commission, and conducts
 fair and public trials. Defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence and the right
 to appeal. However, the overburdened judicial system must handle a rapidly in-
 creasing caseload, most of it related to narcotics, which often results in excessive
 pretrial detention and prison overcrowding, it can often take as long as 2 years from
 time of arrest to eventual conviction or acquittal.
 In 1993 the Government constructed new magistrates' courts on New Providence
 Island and announced plans to appoint additional magistrates to help reduce the
 case backlog. The Government and the Grand Bahama Port Authority also con-
 
 
 356
 structed a building to house four magistrates courts and a Supreme Court in Free-
 port, the latter to be the first court at that level to be located outside Nassau. Public
 and private sector attorneys participated in a study of the judicial system, which
 developed recommendations for inproving court efficiency. The Ministry of Justice
 and the College of The Bahamas began planning for a 1994 course to train addi-
 tional court reporters, the short supply of whom has contributed to the case backlog.
 There are no political prisoners in The Bahamas.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure. A court order is usually
 required for the entry into or search of a private residence, but a police inspector
 or more senior police official may authorize the search of a residence without a court
 order where probable cause of a weapons violation exists. Such an official may also
 authorize the search of a person (which extends to the vehicle in which the person
 is traveling) without a court order should probable cause exist for drug possession.
 Aside from restrictions on prison mail, the Government neither censors mail nor re-
 stricts receipt of foreign correspondence or publications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the right of free
 expression and that right is respected in practice. The political opposition freely and
 frequently criticizes the Government. Three daily and three weekly newspapers, all
 privately owned, express a variety of views on issues of public interest, including
 varng degrees of criticism of the Government and its policies. Foreign newspapers
 and magazines are readily available.
 Reporters occasionally self-censor stories about government fraud, corruption, and
 moral turpitude due to the threat of libel suits under laws unchanged since the
 nineteenth century. In March an election court consisting of two Supreme Court jus-
 tices issued a "contempt of court" verdict against the publishers of two newspapers
 for printing a letter to the editor highly critical of the election court's reversal of
 the result of a close House of Assembly race in the 1992 general elections. The jus-
 tices assessed $1,000 fines against both publishers.
 In August the Government issued radio broadcasting licenses to two private com-
 panies, one associated with the afternoon daily The Tribune and the other with the
 weekly Bahama Journal and a trucking company, thereby ending the state monop-
 oly on radio broadcasting since independence. Opposition politicians claimed that
 the companies receiving broadcasting licenses were sympathetic to the ruling FNM;
 the Government, while indicating it might issue additional licenses for local broad-
 casting, claimed it needed to limit the number of private nationwide radio stations
 in order to maintain the economic viability of the state-run network. Florida radio
 stations are easily received in most of The Bahamas, but a Bahamian law forbids
 the use of foreign radio or television to broadcast Bahamian election advertisements.
 The sole television broadcaster in The Bahamas, the state-owned station ZNS,
 presents a variety of views, although opposition politicians claim with some jus-
 tification that their views do not receive as extensive coverage as those of the Gov-
 ernment. Prior to the 1992 election, however, the then-ruling PLP also received far
 more television coverage than did its critics. The Government announced that by
 August 1994 it would issue a permit for a private company to provide cable tele-
 vision service in Nassau; such service is already available in Freeport.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights to free assembly and association. These rights are respected in practice.
 Private associations are permitted, but groups must obtain permits to hold public
 demonstrations. Such permits are freely granted.
 c. Freedom of Religion. -Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution
 and respected in practice- no restrictions are placed on any religious denomination.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Bahamians and residents of The Bahamas enjoy free movement within
 the country, and Ilahamians face no impediments to foreign travel or emigration.
 The Government liberally grants passports to its citizens.
 Although Cuban asylum seekers are officially regarded as illegal immigrants and
 are occasionally held in prison or at other official facilities until a third country ar-
 ranges to admit them, the Government in most instances works with private groups
 to arrange temporary housing. Opposition politicians charged that the Government's
 willingness to make such arrangements for Cubans whose intended third-country
 destination was the United States constituted discrimination against Haitian mi-
 grants. The Bahamas is reluctant to accept Cuban migrants for long periods of time,
 however. On several occasions, Bahamian authorities have initially declared their
 inability, due to shortage of operational craft, to assist Cuban rafters stranded on
 isolated small islands in The Bahamas.
 
 
 357
 The presence of an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Haitian migrants in The Bahamas
 remained a volatile social, economic, and political issue. According to United Na-
 tions High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) officials, who interview the refu-
 gees to determine their status, relatively few qualified as legitimate refugees. In
 January the Government repatriated 339 Haitians under the auspices of the
 UNHCR. In May authorities conducted raids on Abaco and Eleuthera Islands,
 rounding up over 400 Haitians. Church and human rights officials criticized the
 Government for conducting some of the raids at night, for refusing to allow some
 Haitians to collect their belongings, and for causing the separation of many Haitian
 children from their parents. These officials further criticized the Government for
 conducting the raids without having prepared adequate housing for the captured il-
 legal immigrants. Several hundred detainees were housed on an emergency basis by
 the Roman Catholic Church in an abandoned convent in Nassau after they were
 originally sent to a government building with no sleeping or sanitary facilities.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Bahamas is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy with a multiparty po-
 litical system, governed by an elected Prime Minister and Parliament. The political
 process is open to all elements of society, and citizens 18 years of age and older are
 eligible to register and vote. In the 1992 elections, slightly over 92 percent of reg-
 istered voters cast valid ballots. Registration is on a nonparty basis. The two prin-
 cipal political parties are the ruling Free National Movement (FNM) and the opposi-
 tion Prgressive Liberal Party (PLP). The PLP led the country for 6 years of inter-
 nal self-government from 1967 to 1973, and held power under Prime Minister Sir
 Lynden 0. Pindling from independence in 1973 to 1992.
 Since the 1992 general elections, the FNM under P'ime Minister Hubert A.
 Ingraham has held 32 of 49 seats in the House of Assembly, while the PLP holds
 17. In May The Bahamas Court of Appeals overturned an earlier Supreme Court
 ruling that would have permitted a parliamentarian defeated for reelection in 1992
 to appeal his loss via the election court. The decision left the composition of Par-
 liament unchanged. The Cabinet has 3 female members, and 4 women were elected
 in 1992 to the 49-member House of Assembly. One of the four was a parliamentar-
 ian later elected Deputy Speaker of the House. Under the Constitution, the next
 general elections must be held before August 1997.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Hwnan Rights
 Four local human rights groups operate in The Bahamas: the Grand Bahama
 Human Rights Organization, the New Providence Human Rights Organization, the
 Abaco Human Rights Organization, and the National Association for the Protection
 of Human Rights.
 These organizations o erate freely and report without government restriction on
 alleged human rights violations. No internatio nal human rights organization sought
 to visit The Bahamas to investigate human rights conditions during 1993.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability. Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for individual rights and freedoms regardless of race,
 place of origin, political opinion, creed, or sex, and this policy is generally respected
 in ractice.
 Women.-The Constitution diflrentiates between the sexes in that it does not
 provide Bahamian women the ability to bestow citizenship upon their foreign-born
 spouses. Additionally, nationality laws confer citizenship more easily on the children
 of Bahamian men than on those of Bahamian women in marriages involving two
 nationalities. The FNM  pledged in its party platform to "ancord non-Bahamian
 spouses of Bahamian women the same privileges as those afforded the spouses of
 Bahamian men," but as of year's end had not introduced legislation to carry this
 out.
 Women participate fully in Bahamian society and are well represented in the
 business and professional sectors, as well as in the judiciary and in government.
 Women's rights activists, however, claim that the scarcity of public and private child
 care facilities, particularly important in a society with a high proportion of single
 mothers, discourages many women from entering the work force,
 Domestic violence against women continued to be a problem, with independent
 women's support groups reporting that many women sought shelter at the private,
 but government-supported, Women's Crisis Center in Nassau. Women may have
 their cases heard in a closed domestic court and may scek a restraining order
 against an abusive spouse. In the case of an abusive male companion, however,
 
 
 358
 women can only obtain a magistrate's order for their protection, which carries less
 legal force than a restraining order. Women's rights groups speak freely on ways
 to improve the condition of women and children, including safeguarding their phys-
 ical safety. In September the Ministry of Justice cosponsored with private women's
 groups a conference aimed at devising a national policy statement on women's
 rights. The conference concluded that an important first step would be the develop-
 ment of better statistics documenting the status of women in Bahamian society.
 Children.-Since independence, both major political parties have been committed
 to defending the rights of Bahamian children and improving child welfare and edu-
 cation. In 1993, at a time of fiscal austerity, the Government placed priority on
 maintaining adequate expenditures in these areas. One of the few areas to receive
 a modest increase in government expenditure was youth and education, with par-
 ticular emphasis on efforts to improve physical conditions in the nation's schools.
 According to the Women's Crisis Center, however, child abuse and neglect continued
 to be serious problems. In 1992 the Center reported 206 cases of sexual abuse of
 minors, and the frequency of such reports increased during 1993. Women's and chil-
 dren's rights monitors said that far more cases of abuse were not being reported,
 although a public education campaign mounted in 1992-93 by the Women's Crisis
 Center resulted in increased calls to the Center's telephone "hot line."
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Approximately 85 percent of the Bahamian
 population is primarily of African descent, with the rest mostly of either European
 or mixed descent. Since independence, both black and white Bahamians have been
 well represented in Government, the civil service, and private business. Although
 opposition politicians occasionally charge that the business community continues to
 be dominated by white Bahamians, the number and size of black Bahamian-owned
 businesses continue to grow steadily and they probably constitute a majority of busi-
 ness activity. Black and white Bahamian business leaders no longer appear to re-
 grd themselves as representing separate interest groups. On several occasions in
 November and December, former Prime Minister and opposition leader Pindling
 called on Bahamians to boycott white-owned businesses, claiming that black busi-
 nessmen were still at a competitive disadvantage. Pindling's comments drew wide
 criticism, and no boycott or change in business patterns developed.
 Many Haitians in the Bahamas are illegal immigrants and face economic and so-
 cial deprivation. Although they provide a ready supply of cheap labor and fill jobs
 which most Bahamians shun, illegal immigrants are subject to detention and depor-
 tation at any time. Children born in The Bahamas to illegal immigrants, if not reg-
 istered by the country of their parents, are considered stateless until they become
 eligible to apply for citizenship at the age of 18. Although they are eligible neverthe-
 less for free public education, there were reports of some children of Haitian illegal
 immigrants being denied enty to public schools in islands other than New Provi-
 dence because of imited school facilities. There is no instruction in Creole or in Eng-
 lish as a second language in the Bahamian school system. Many Bahamians, includ-
 ing some government officials, view the growing Haitian population as unwelcome
 guests who are a drain on the economy and who deserve no constitutional rights.
 To work legally, foreigners, including Haitians and a growing number of Jamai-
 cans, must obtain work permits through their employers. Even longtime residents
 of the Bahamas must renew these permits annually, at a cost of at least several
 hundred dollars per year, and can have renewal applications arbitrarily denied. If
 employment is terminated for any reason, the work permit becomes invalid and the
 foreigner loses his or her legal status. Work permits granted to Haitians and Jamai-
 cans do not normally include permission for a spouse to remain legally in The Baha-
 mas. Some Bahamians have expressed concern that this system tends to lead to eco-
 nomic exploitation of foreign labor by unscrupulous employers.
 People with Disabilities.-The Ministry of National Insurance and Social Develop-
 ment began work in June to formulate for the first time a national policy regarding
 the disabled, with a target of mid-1994 for the announcement of the new policy. A-
 though the 1973 National Building Code mandates certain accommodations for the
 physically disabled in new public buildings, this part of the code is rarely enforced.
 Assistance for the disabled is provided by several government ministries and private
 organizations. Approximately 150 children are enrolled in the public Stapledon
 School for the Mentally Retarded. The Special Services Division of the Ministry of
 Education provides speech therapy classes and the recently constructed Thelma Gib-
 son primary school includes facilities which can accommodate physically disabled
 children while keeping them in a mainstream educational institution. The State
 Home for Orphaned and Abandoned Children includes a residence for physically dis-
 abled children.
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifically grants labor unions the
 rights of free assembly and association. Workers may form or join unions without
 prior authorization, except for members of the police force, defense force, fire bri-
 gade and prison guards, all of whom are forbidden to organize by statutes author-
 ized by the Constitution. This right is exercised extensively, particularlyin the hotel
 industry, where approximately 80 percent of the employees are unionized.
 The two major labor organizations in The Bahamas, the 8,000-member Bahamas
 Hotel Catering and AlliedWorkers Union and the 12,000-member Trade Union Con-
 gress (TUC), function independently of government or political party control. All Ba-
 hamian labor unions are guaranteed the right to maintain affiliations with inter-
 national trade union organizations. The TUC, which groups 10 of the country's 44
 registered unions, is a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions and the Caribbean Congress of Labor.
 The right to strike is limited under the Industrial Relations Act, which requires
 that union members must vote to strike and that the motion must be passed by a
 simple majority before a strike can commence. The Ministry of Labor oversees the
 vote. The Ministry may also refer a dispute involving employees of an "essential
 service" to the Industrial Relations Board for settlement if the Ministry determines
 public interest requires such action. The Industrial Relations Act also states that
 a strike which has an object "other than or in addition to the furtherance of a trade
 dispute within the trade or industry in which the strikers are engaged" or "is de-
 signed or calculated to coerce the Government either directly or by inflicting hard-
 ship upon the community" is illegal.
 The Public Service Workers Union and the Taxi Union held peaceful leadership
 elections during 1993. Internal bickering among leaders of the Bahamas Hotel Ca-
 tering and Allied Workers Union lessened the union's effectiveness as a collective
 bargaining agent for hotel workers in a sector already beset by high unemployment
 and underemployment. Doctors at the public Princess Margaret Hospital occasion-
 al threatened to strike over salaries and working conditions.
 . The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers are free to organize,
 and collective bargaining is extensive for the 30,000 workers (25 percent of the work
 force) who are unionized. Collective bargaining is protected by law and freely prac-
 ticed, and the Ministry of Labor is responsible for mediating disputes. Wages are
 set in negotiations between unions and employers without government involvement.
 Both the Constitution and the Industrial Relations Act prohibit antiunion dis-
 crimination by employers. The Industrial Relations Act requires employers to recog-
 nize trade unions. The Industrial Relations Board within the Ministry of Labor me-
 diates and conciliates disputes between individual employees or unions and their
 employers. Mechanisms exist to resolve complaints: filing a trade union dispute with
 the Ministry of Labor, or bringing a civil suit against the employer in a court of
 law. The Industrial Relations Act requires the reinstatement of workers fired for
 union activities. Employers may dismiss workers in accordance with applicable con-
 tracts which generally require some severance pay. The Government seeks to en-
 force labor laws and regulations uniformly throughoutthe country; however, inspec-
 tions occur infrequently.
 Two small, but not particularly active, free trade zones exist in The Bahamas.
 Labor law and practice in these zones do not differ from those in the rest of the
 country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and such labor does not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Bahamian laws prohibit the em-
 ployment of chil ren under the age of 14 for industrial work, work during school
 hours, or work at night. There is no legal minimum age for employment in other
 concerns, however, and some children are employed part-time in grocery stores and
 gasoline stations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Fair Labor Standards Act limits the regu-
 lar workweek to 48 hours and provides for at least one 24-hour rest period. The Act
 requires overtime payment (time and a half) for hours in excess of the standard.
 The Act permits the creation of a Wages Council to recommend the establishment
 of a minimum wage; to date, no such council has been established. The Ministry
 of Labor, which is responsible for enforcing labor laws, has a team of several inspec-
 tors who make on-site visits to enforce occupational health and safety standards and
 investigate employee concerns and com plaints. The Ministry normally announces
 these inspection visits ahead of time. Employ er generally cooperate with inspec-
 tions in implementing safety standards. The Bahamian economy is service oriented,
 especially in tourism and offshore banking, and therefore does not have significant
 industrial and occupational health hazards. The national insurance program pro-
 
 
 360
 vides for compensation for work-related injuries. The Fair Labor Standards Act re-
 quires an employer to find suitable alternative employment for an employee who is
 injured on the job but is still able to work. While there is no legislated right for
 workers to remove themselves from dangerous workplace situations without jeop-
 ardy to their continued employment, there have no recently reported instances of
 such retribution.
