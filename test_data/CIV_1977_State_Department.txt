 IVORY COAST
 Ivory Coast is a one party state with a free enterprise
 economic system. Its economy has developed quickly,
 but has been characterized by widening income dispari-
 ties. Felix Houphouet-Boigny has been President since
 1960. He has been known for the use of "dialogue" to
 resolve internal and external issues. There are no
 known political prisoners. The National Assembly af-
 fords an opportunity for the free expression of politi-
 cal views within a single party system. President
 Houphouet-Boigny personally received a representative
 of Amnesty International in 1975. Amnesty International
 congratulated him for an amnesty which included some
 political prisoners. Ivory Coast has been elected to
 the UN Human Rights Commission.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There have been no reports of torture in the Ivory Coast.
 Torture is prohibited by law and is not condoned by the
 government.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The lower economic levels probably experience brusque
 handling by law enforcement authorities but this is not
 believed to be severe. Arbitrary deprivation of liberty
 or life is not permitted.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 This is generally not practiced. The government will
 take firm measures to suppress public protests or plot-
 ting against the government. The only recent instance
 was temporary detention of students in early 1977, all
 of whom to our knowledge were released. In October
 1975 Amnesty International wrote President Houphouet-
 Boigny to congratulate him on an amnesty for some 5,000
 prisoners, including some 85 political prisoners. The
 government states that there are now no political pris-
 oners and we are not aware of any.

 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to fair public trial, patterned after the
 French system, is to our knowledge observed. There is
 an active bar association in Ivory Coast.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Legal safeguards against arbitrary searches are to our
 knowledge respected.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Ivory Coast has a relatively prosperous and growing
 economy which is characterized by widening income dis-
 parities, but the government has numerous programs to
 uplift the urban and rural poor and has received assis-
 tance from multilateral organizations for this purpose.
 The government tends to emphasize capital and infra-
 structure development over social programs.
 Corruption is a matter of concern for the Ivory Coast's
 leadership since it diverts resources from the poor.
 There have been many rumors of corruption, some on a
 substantial scale, at high levels. Some of these re-
 ports are probably true. Stiff anti-corruption legis-
 lation was passed by the National Assembly in June 1977.
 In July 1977 many cabinet ministers were relieved of
 their positions. Some of these were rumored to be
 corrupt.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of thought, speech, and religion is generally
 observed, as is freedom of assembly uxless the assembly
 is perceived as leading to a disturbance, in which case
 temporary detention may be employed. The press is
 
 
 55
 government-controlled but many non-government publica-
 tions are available. Labor unions are closely tied
 to the government party but have a fair degree of
 freedom in representing worker viewpoints to the govern-
 ment and party. The government does not attempt to
 enforce ideological conformity or abridge intellectual
 inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within-the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The Ivory Coast exercises only minimal control over
 domestic travel. Foreign travel and emigration are
 free.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Ivory Coast is a one-party state. Felix Houphouet-
 Boigny has been President since 1960 and has regularly
 been reelected by overwhelming majorities. There are
 no constitutional or legal restrictions against opposi-
 tion parties, but they do not exist and there has been
 little or no organized political opposition since inde-
 pendence although there have been some instances of
 coup plotting. Both the President and the National
 Assembly are elected by universal adult suffrage. -
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-Governmental
 Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human
 Rights
 Ivory Coast has evinced a cooperative attitude toward
 inquiries into its human rights situation. In 1975
 President Houphouet-Boigny personally received a
 representative of Amnesty International. We are not
 aware that any other organization has inquired into
 the human rights situation in Ivory Coast.
