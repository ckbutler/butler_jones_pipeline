 DOMINICA
 A member of the British Commonwealth, Dominica has a system of
 parliamentary democracy which is a legacy of the pre-1978
 British colonial rule. Prime Minister Eugenia Charles was
 first elected in July 1980 and was reelected in free and open
 general elections in July 1985. The recently united
 opposition Labor Party of Dominica (LPD) improved its position
 in the hotly contested 1985 elections.
 The Dominica Defense Force was disbanded in 1981 following two
 violent coup attempts. the police are now the nation's only
 security force. A small Special Service Unit with some
 paramilitary training has been organized within the police
 force, and a Marine Wing established and trained to function
 as a coast guard.
 Dominica is one of the least developed countries in the
 Eastern Caribbean. The country has largely recovered from
 hurricane damage suffered in 1979 and 1980, allowing the
 Government to focus on encouraging foreign investment and to
 rehabilitate basic economic infrastructure with the assistance
 of foreign donors. Slow global recovery from the worldwide
 recession of the early 1980s, however, has hampered economic
 progress and the Government's development program.
 Dominica's excellent human rights record continued during
 1985, without reports of significant human rights violations
 of any kind.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the-Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of killing for political motives in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 There were no reports of torture or cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment in 1985. In August, six
 Dominican policemen were charged with manslaughter in
 connection with the 1981 death of John Rose Lindsay, whose
 body was found at the bottom of a cliff hours after he was
 arrested by police. According to press accounts, six other
 policemen were suspended for alleged misconduct in connection
 with the Lindsay affair. The charges resulted from an
 official inquiry.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that persons arrested be brought
 before a court within 72 hours and this is honored in
 practice. The Government adheres scrupulously to
 constitutional provisions prohibiting arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. There were no reports of arbitrary arrests, or
 summary exile in 1985.

 Although no legal provision is known to exist against it,
 forced or compulsory labor is not known to take place in
 Dominica.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Legal practice provides for public trials before an
 independent, impartial court. Criminal defendants are
 presumed innocent until proven guilty, are allowed legal
 counsel, and have the right of appeal on legal or procedural
 grounds.
 In October 1985, former Prime Minister Patrick John was
 brought to trial on charges of treason resulting from his
 alleged complicity in a 1981 coup plot. John was represented
 by legal counsel, and was free on bail before and during the
 proceedings. John was found guilty by the jury, and was
 sentenced to 14 years in prison. He is currently free on bail
 pending an appeal. Now a member of the opposition Labor Party
 of Dominica, John was elected to Parliament in the July 1985
 general elections. By law, his conviction forces him to give
 up his seat.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, and
 seizure. There were no reports in 1985 of arbitrary government
 intrusions into the private lives of individuals.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution establishes the right of free expression,
 which is affirmed in practice. The political opposition
 freely criticizes the Government. Dominica's only radio
 station is state-owned, and the principal newspaper is
 independent but generally favors the ruling Dominica Freedom
 Party. The opposition staged a boycott of Parliament in
 August 1985 to protest the Government's decision to end live
 radio broadcasts of parliamentary sessions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of association and the freedom to assemble peaceably
 are honored without exception, Opposition groups hold rallies
 and meetings without hindrance from the Government.
 Labor has the right to organize, to bargain collectively and
 to strike. Labor unions are independent, but are not a
 significant political force owing to small memberships. The
 Banana Growers Association is a strong trade association which
 plays a significant independent political role.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Dominicans are primarily Roman Catholic or Anglican, but a
 small Muslim community also exists. The 1979 "Dread Act,"
 which prohibits membership in the Rastafarian cult, was
 repealed, but allegations of harassment of Rastafarians
 continue.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are guaranteed by law and honored in practice.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Dominica has a freely elected parliamentary system of
 government in which citizens have a real choice of policies
 and candidates from the ruling and opposition parties. In the
 July 1985 general elections, the ruling Dominica Freedom Party
 won 15 seats in the House of Assembly, the Labor Party of
 Dominica won 5 seats, and an LPD affiliate, the United
 Democratic Labor Party, won 1 seat. Candidates from a broad
 political spectrum were elected, including two candidates
 educated in Cuba.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is responsive to complaints about any human
 rights violations.
 No international human rights organizations have branch
 offices in Dominica. The Dominica National Workers Union's
 Human Rights Committee, a Marxist-Leninist organization,
 occasionally has published allegations of human rights
 violations in Dominica. The Committee has recently alleged
 that six men condemned to hang for their participation in a
 December 1981 attack on police headquarters are imprisoned
 under inhumane conditions. The Committee claims to have
 brought this case to the attention of Amnesty International,
 without response to date.
 Freedom House rated Dominica as "free." Dominica is not
 mentioned in the 1985 Amnesty International report.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 A small, poor country with a population of 74,000, Dominica
 has traditionally had a high emigration rate. In 1985,
 population grew slightly (0.4 percent). The country relies
 heavily on banana exports and subsistence agriculture. Its
 estimated per capita gross national product is among the
 lowest in the Eastern Caribbean region: $707 in 1982.
 The Government emphasizes education. With the help of foreign
 donors, it has rebuilt many primary schools destroyed by
 hurricanes in 1979 and 1980. Adult literacy is estimated to
 be 94.1 percent.
 The legal minimum working age is 14. The standard working
 week is 40 hours in 5 days. Workers are given a minimum of
 two weeks annual leave. An occupational health and safety law
 in keeping with ILO standards was passed in 1984. The minimum
 wage established by law is arguably less than that on which a
 person can be reasonably expected to live.
 The Government has worked hard to improve health care by the
 construction of public health clinics. Restructuring the
 public health administration has improved the level of service
 in rural areas. At 19.6 per 1,000 live births, Dominica has
 one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the Eastern
 Caribbean.

 DOMINICA
 Dominican law does not restrict the role of women in the
 nation's public or social life. The traditional role of women
 limited to the home and family is changing rapidly, and
 improvement in educational opportunities for women, together
 with the example set by Prime Minister Eugenia Charles, are
 expected to lead to greater participation of women in
 Dominica's public life.
