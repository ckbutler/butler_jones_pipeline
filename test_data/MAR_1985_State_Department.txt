 MOROCCO*
 Morocco is governed by a monarchy which also has fully
 developed parliamentary, judicial, and governmental
 institutions. The King is both temporal Head of State and
 spiritual leader of the country's Muslim community, which
 comprises virtually the entire Moroccan population. The King
 can intervene in and set policy on any question if he so
 desires; but policy on most questions is formulated by the
 Government and in many cases requires the formal approval of
 Parliament.
 The Moroccan political system is open and very active. Eight
 of the country's 14 political parties are represented in
 Parliament, which was elected in September 1984. The lively
 Moroccan press offers a full range of viewpoints on matters
 from foreign policy through the economic and social situation,
 including human rights. There is a full range of private
 voluntary associations.
 The security apparatus is comprised of several overlapping
 police and paramilitary organizations, all of which have an
 important impact on the human rights situation. All of the
 organizations are under the King's ultimate control, although
 many are administered on a day-to-day basis by the Interior
 Minister.
 Private investment and private property play a large role in
 the economy, although a number of key industries are in
 government hands. Morocco remains a predominantly rural
 country with over 50 percent of the population living outside
 urban areas. The Government continues to place high priority
 on job creation and continued development of the agricultural
 sector to reduce income and social disparities. However, the
 country's tight financial situation and pressures from its
 international creditors have forced cuts in many plans. In
 September 1985 the Government reduced subsidies on basic
 foodstuffs, leading to price hikes on such commodities as
 flour, sugar, and cooking oil, the staples of the Moroccan diet.
 The human rights situation in Morocco was mixed in 1985. There
 were no major outbreaks of unrest such as occurred in January
 1984, and a number of those arrested and convicted in the wake
 of those disturbances were released during the year. However,
 there was continuing concern about the legal status and
 physical condition of political prisoners in Moroccan jails.
 Although the Government asserted, in response to domestic and
 international publicity about the hunger strikes of several
 prisoners, that all prisoners in Moroccan prisons were common
 law prisoners, certain prisoners in categories considered to be
 political continued to receive separate, more favorable
 treatment. There were also isolated reports of cruel treatment
 and torture of some detainees, especially those accused of
 Islamic fundamentalist tendencies.
 *A separate section on the Western Sahara is appended to this
 report.

 MOROCCO
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In 1985, there were no proven instances of political killing.
 Although 14 Moroccans convicted for involvement in Islamic
 fundamentalist activities were sentenced to death in August,
 none of the sentences has been carried out. Similar death
 sentences from trials in August 1984 also have not been carried
 out. Trials in these cases were public.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no'reported cases of disappearance for extended
 periods in 1985. Amnesty International continues to press for
 a report on the cases of some 100 persons reportedly taken into
 custody as far back as 1976 and who reportedly have
 disappeared, but the Government has not provided a status
 report. The Lawyers' Committee for International Human Rights
 reported in early 1985 that 50 other persons, including a
 number of student leaders, have disappeared in recent years.
 On January 22, 1985, the French daily Le Monde reported that
 two long-term detainees were released after prolonged periods
 of "disappearance". Local human rights sources report,
 however, that the locations of the two individuals were always
 known.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are frequent charges of prisoner abuse in Moroccan
 prisons. Lawyers, observers, and even government officials
 assert that prisoners are exposed to cold, damp, and crowded
 conditions, and some prisoners are allegedly subjected to cruel
 treatment at the hands of prison officials. On January 12,
 1985, the local press reported the suicides of two prisoners in
 the Kenitra prison, allegedly in part because of systematic
 beatings by prison guards. Human rights groups have reported
 the deaths of four prisoners in November and December,
 allegedly due to cold and damp jails. On November 12 the
 Government confirmed earlier reports from human rights groups
 that a detainee, Amine Tahani, had died November 6 in a
 Casablanca prison. Although there were charges by human rights
 activists in France that Tahani died as the result of torture,
 the Government rejected the charges and said his death resulted
 from asthmatic seizures.
 In 1985, there were repeated hunger strikes by prisoners to
 protest prison conditions. Nine prisoners fasted for several
 months to obtain political prisoner status. After several
 weeks the Government resorted to intravenous feeding.
 Several foreign groups charge that there is systematic use of
 torture in Morocco, and indeed there are persistent reports of
 torture by the security forces. Some observers claim to have
 witnessed various forms of physical and psychological torture
 by police to extract information or to intimidate detainees,
 especially in the pretrial period. Most observers agree that
 such practices are rare.
 
 
 1325
 MOROCCO
 The Government rarely responds to charges of torture. However,
 in April 1985, the Interior Ministry reacted vigorously to
 charges in the French daily Le Monde of inhumane conditions in
 what was described as a detention center in Casablanca. The
 Interior Ministry maintained, and local human rights activists
 concurred, that the center was actually an institution for
 orphans and elderly citizens.
 Amnesty International has continued to complain of the
 conditions of detention of approximately 100 military prisoners.
 arrested following the 1971 and 1972 attempts on the life of
 King Hassan. It reported that the individuals had been held
 since 1973 in "windowless, filthy, unventilated cells, (exposed
 to) extremes of temperature, solitary confinement, arbitrary
 punishments and beatings, inadequate food, and complete lack of
 medical care." Amnesty International indicated it has reports
 that "approximately 20 of the prisoners may already have died,
 many at least in part because of the very bad conditions." In
 1985 there was a reliable report that one of the prisoners
 appeared in good condition.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Moroccan Constitution requires that a detainee be brought
 before a judge within 48 hours of detention and informed of
 charges. The police can request a 48-hour extension of that
 period. This practice is, however, widely abused, and
 detainees are often held for up to several weeks before
 appearing before a judge. Most individuals are arrested in
 public view, but warrants are not always used. Although
 arrests are not usually arbitrary, they are often made only on
 the basis of suspicion. Moroccan law requires that a lawyer be
 present only after the initial presentation of the detainee
 before the review court, not during the prior period of policy
 custody. Morocco does not have an extensive system of bail,
 although defendents are sometimes released on their own
 recognizance. Moroccan law does not have specific provision
 for habeas corpus or its equivalent.
 The most frequent cases in which there was abuse of pretrial
 rights in 1985 were those involving Islamic fundamentalist
 activity. Sources estimate that several hundred were detained
 by authorities starting in April and continuing through
 August. In most cases, authorities released detainess after
 several days of questioning without charges.
 Under a separate code of military justice, a number of military
 personnel have been detained in past years without warrants or
 announcement of a trial.
 A number of Moroccan detainees, including many considered
 informally to be "political prisoners," are allowed to receive
 Moroccan newspapers, to have access to radio and television,
 and to pursue studies while in prison. Most prisoners are
 allowed family visits once a week and on religious holidays,
 and family members are permitted to bring food to supplement
 the prison diet. However, many of the prisoners convicted of
 involvement in the 1971 and 1972 coup attempts continue to be
 held without family visitation rights or the right to respond
 to mail received. Families of several prisoners on a hunger
 stri :e also asserted repeatedly in 1985 that they were denied
 access to their relatives.
 
 
 1326
 MOROCCO
 There have been allegations that prisoners have been held
 incommunicado fcr extended periods, but family or friends have
 been aware, most sources agree, of the detainees' general
 location.
 There are no known instances of political activists exiled by
 the Government. However, some activists prefer to remain in
 voluntary exile, including a number of leading Islamic
 fundamentalists. Of 57 Fundamentalists tried in 1985, 25 now
 live abroad. There are reports that a growing number of
 Moroccans, generally youths, have sought "asylum" in several
 Western European countries, but it is not certain that these
 students would be in jeopardy were they to return to Morocco.
 Although prisoners are regularly used on work crews, there were
 no other charges of forced labor in 1985.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Moroccan judicial system is generally considered fair and
 is in most respects independent of political control. Cases
 are brought before an initial review court, which can call for
 a hearing. The detainee is informed of charges and questioned
 by the judge to decide if they have merit, If not, or if the
 infraction is minor, the judge can release the detainee or
 impose a light sentence. If a lengthy investigation is
 required, the judge can release detainees on their own
 recognizance. In cases involving serious crimes, courts
 generally move quickly to bring cases to trial. If convicted
 by the court of first instance, a defendant has the right to
 appeal.
 Although most cases are handled by civilian/secular courts
 based in part on French legal tradition, Morocco has a parallel
 judicial system using Islamic law principles to deal with
 marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance for Muslim
 Moroccans. Although Western legal norms are not applicable in
 the Islamic courts, Koranic principles and the limited kinds of
 the cases heard reduce the possibility of abuse.
 There have been allegations of growing judicial corruption. In
 October 1985, four court officials, including one judge, in the
 northern city of Al Hoceima were tried and found guilty of
 illegal practices.
 Although the Government has stated that there are no political
 prisoners, most observers and Moroccan human rights groups
 estimate that there remain approximately 110 prisoners held for
 political activities dating as far back as the early 1970's and
 sentenced to terms up to life imprisonment. In addition, there
 are approximately 125 Moroccans convicted of Islamic
 fundamentalist activities, although some sources insist that
 the number held could be as high as several hundred. Human
 rights groups in Europe assert that nearly 1,600 persons were
 tried and sentenced following the riots in January 1984. Many
 of those have since been released after completing their terms,
 but estimates of those still in prison range from several
 hundred to over 1,000.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In general, the Government does not interfere greatly in the
 private lives of its citizens. The Constitution states that
 
 
 1327
 MOROCCO
 the home is inviolable and that no search or investigation may
 occur without a judicial warrant. This is not always observed
 in practice, however. It is widely accepted that the
 Government selectively monitors certain individuals, including
 their telephones and mail. At times of heightened agitation,
 the authorities are alleged to have searched homes and offices
 without warrants.
 The Government does not generally interfere in the private
 beliefs of the individual. There is no forced membership in
 political organizations. The Government is sensitive to the
 spread of fundamentalist religious beliefs, but there are no
 reported instances of interference with parents' teaching of
 religious beliefs to their children. Morocco does not jam
 foreign radio and television broadcasts, but officials have
 frequently seized banned publications entering the country from
 abroad through the mail.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech, including
 freedom of the press, except for criticism of the monarchy and
 Islam. There is lively debate of almost all other issues,
 including criticism of the Government, of government officials,
 and of political and socioeconomic problems in the press and in
 public. There is also a broad measure of academic freedom, and
 although there are strictures against the investigation of the
 monarchy and Islam, in fact there is growing research and
 publishing on Islam and Islamic fundamentalism.
 Arabic language daily Al Anbaa, as well as the Moroccan Press
 Agency Maghreb Arab Press, are government-owned. All other
 newspapers and journals are privately owned, although some are
 subsidized by the Government. Most are controlled by political
 parties or private groups. In 1985, the Government
 occasionally intervened to delay publication of newspapers
 carrying material which, it was feared, would inflame public
 opinion. The Communist Party of Progress and Socialism's
 French- and Arabic-language dailies asserted that they were
 regularly subjected to prior censorship. In July, an
 independent weekly, Al Kawaliss, was suspended for several
 months for unspecified reasons. Two new weekly newspapers
 appeared: Al Massaar, published by Socialist Party dissidents
 and focusing heavily on opposition and human rights themes, and
 Al Haraka, backed by the Berber-based Popular Movement.
 Television and radio are government-owned and the views
 expressed conform with the Government's.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are constitutional guarantees of peaceful assembly and
 association. Private associations are permitted, after
 registering with the Government, and professional, business,
 religious, and cultural associations are active. Groups seen
 as threatening the political stability of the regime, such as
 declared Islamic fundamentalist organizations, are outlawed.
 Permits are required for public meetings, but if the requesting
 group is a legally registered association, permission is
 normally granted.
 
 
 1328
 MOROCCO
 There are three major trade union federations: the Union
 Marocaine du Travail (UMT); the Confederation Democratique de
 Travail (CDT); and the Union Generale des Travailleurs
 Marocains (UGTM). The UMT is politically independent. The CDT
 is affiliated with the Socialist Party, and the UGTM with the
 Istiqlal Party. Approximately 1 million of 7 million Moroccan
 workers are unionized, mainly in the industrial and commercial
 sectors. The UMT annually represents Moroccan workers at the
 annual conferences of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO). The CDT and UGTM are also active internationally and
 participated with the UMT in the June 1985 International Labor
 Conference.
 Morocco's Constitution and laws provide full.protection to
 labor. These guarantees, including the right to be represented
 in the settlement of disputes and the right to protection
 against interference, are widely applied in the modern sector
 of the economy but are less well observed, and sometimes
 totally ignored, in the informal and underground economy. The
 right to strike is guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution
 but the detailed law defining this right, promised in Article
 14, has never been drafted. Legislation governing settlement
 of labor disputes was enacted in 1946, but the mandated
 procedures, which are lengthy and complicated as well as in
 conflict with later constitutional guarantees of the right to
 strike, are customarily ignored as each dispute is handled on
 an ad hoc basis by the Government. The August-September 1985
 strike at the Jerada coal mine, for example, was settled after
 3 weeks of police intimidation, the arrest and sentencing to
 prison terms of some two dozen strikers, and protracted
 negotiations involving worker representatives, the management
 of the government-owned mine, and local and regional
 officials. In this case, as in many others involving strikes
 and work protests, workers were prosecuted and convicted under
 criminal law statutes which outlaw picketing and damage to
 employers' property. Criminal law dating from the eve of World
 War II also outlaws strikes in sectors deemed to affect
 national security. This law is ill-defined and has been used
 in recent years to stop teachers' strikes, among others.
 Moroccan trade unions complain that workers are frequently
 dismissed or suspended for union activity and that the legal
 system too rarely punishes such illegal actions. The UMT has
 several complaints pending with the ILO on these and other
 alleged infractions of the ILO conventions on freedom of
 association and collective bargaining. Despite the fact that
 these cases have not been resolved to the unions' satisfaction,
 employers are often prosecuted and punished by the courts for
 labor law violations. A recent case involved an employer
 sanctioned for an illegal plant shutdown.
 The Constitution also guarantees the representation of workers
 in Parliament. Of 10 seats reserved for trade union
 organizations in the current 306-member Parliament, the UMT
 elected 5 members, the CDT 3, and the UGTM 2 in the 1984
 elections.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is over 99 percent Muslim, and Islam is the
 official religion. The King bears the title of "Commander of
 the Faithful" and is the religious as well as secular leader of
 the Moroccan population.
 
 
 1329
 MOROCCO
 The Constitution provides guarantees for freedom of worship,
 but proselytizing is forbidden. Conversion to another faith
 from Islam is not banned in the civil code, but the Islamic
 faith strongly discourages it.
 There are two nOn-Islamic religions with organized corynunities
 in Morocco: Judaism and Christianity. There are some 10,000
 Jews, living mainly in Casablanca and several other major
 cities. The Jewish community operates schools and social
 institutions, as well as 20 major synagogues. Publications in
 Hebrew are permitted, and rabbis serving the Jewish community
 are trained in Morocco. Moroccan Jews serve in leading
 positions in the business community. The President of the
 Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court is Jewish, as is
 one parliamentary deputy. In September 1985, King Hassan, in a
 gesture designed to show his continued support for the Jewish
 community, sent one of his sons to the Jewish community's Yom
 Kippur ceremony. The Jewish community has close ties to
 communities in other countries, including Israel. In October
 1985, a Congress of Jewish Communities of Moroccan-origin was
 held in Montreal with the Moroccan Government's endorsement..
 There are also institutional links between the Moroccan
 Government and the Roman Catholic Church. In August 1985, Pope
 John Paul II visited Morocco at the invitation of King Hassan,
 at which time he met with Morocco's Islamic leaders and
 delivered an address to 80,000 Muslim youths. In 1983, King
 Hassan pledged, in a letter to the Pope, to guarantee the
 Catholic Church's right to conduct both religious and
 charitable work. The letter also formally recognized the work
 of the Catholic clergy, who come exclusively from abroad, to
 minister to some 100,000 foreign residents with parishes in
 most cities.
 There were few incidents affecting the Protestant community in
 1985. Prior to the visit of Pope John Paul, a few Moroccan
 Christians were questioned by police, but the practice was
 quickly stopped. In October 1985, the Supreme Court overturned
 earlier administrative rulings which had closed a bookstore in
 Fez, owned by a Protestant minister, which carried a limited
 number of bibles and Christian literature. The Moroccan
 Protestant community is small, numbering less than a hundred.
 There are also several thousand expatriate Christians.
 There have been no further arrests in the Baha'i community
 since May 1984, nor has the small community been bothered in
 its activities. In October 1985, the case of the single Baha'i
 from Teouan still serving a prison sentence came before the
 Supreme Court in December. The Court rejected his request for
 a review of his conviction and 3-year sentence for activities
 related to his faith.
 The King and other religious leaders continue to counsel
 against radical Islamic beliefs. Interior Ministry officials
 monitor what is taught in the Mosques and report deviations
 from Orthodox Islam. Starting in early 1985, large numbers of
 suspected fundamentalists were detained and questioned,
 especially in northern Morocco. In August, the Government
 tried 26 Moroccans (9 in absentia), for plotting to overthrow
 the regime and membership in outlawed fundamentalist
 organizations. All were convicted, and 14 were sentenced to
 death. The group was accused of having been trained by
 Algeria. In October, 31 suspected fundamentalists (16 in
 
 
 1330
 MOROCCO
 absentia) were tried for belonging to an illegal association
 and plotting to overthrow the regime. All were convicted.
 Twenty received life sentences, and 4 received 30-year
 sentences. Death sentences handed down in the Casablanca
 fundamentalist trial of June and July 1984 have not been
 carried out.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is unrestricted throughout Morocco. As the
 administering authority in the Western Sahara, the Moroccan
 Government -restricts movement in areas of the territory which
 are militarily contested. There were no reported cases of
 restrictions on foreign travel for political reasons in 1985.
 There are no formal restrictions on emigration. Obtaining a
 passport, however, often takes several months. A woman is
 obliged to have the permission of her father or, if she is
 married, her husband to obtain a passport. A divorced woman
 must receive her father's permission for a passport. If she
 has custody of children, she must have the father's permission
 for the children's passports.
 There are no known instances of the Government depriving any
 citizen of Moroccan nationality. Moroccan law considers any
 person who acquires Moroccan nationality to be a citizen for
 life. Citizens who have left Morocco are guaranteed the right
 to return. There were no known instances of the Government
 refusing reentry in 1985. Morocco specifically encourages
 voluntary repatriation for Jewish community members who have
 emigrated from Morocco. It also encourages the return of
 Saharans who have opposed Morocco in the Western Sahara
 conflict. Returning former Polisario members deemed to pose no
 security threat have been reintegrated into either civilian or
 military life.
 Morocco adheres to the 1951 convention on refugee status. It
 currently has some 500 refugees, mainly from African countries
 and Eastern Europe. Most of the Eastern European refugees came
 to Morocco in the 1940's and 1950's. For a grant of refugee
 status, the Government requires that the requester be able to
 care for his needs. Although there were reports, denied by
 Moroccan authorities, of Libyan expatriates being forced to
 return to their country in 1984, there were no such reports in
 1985.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Morocco describes itself as a developing democracy. In
 practice, executive power is vested in the King and exercised
 by a government designated by him. The King generally takes
 the proportional strength of parties into account in naming the
 Government.
 Parliament participates in the formulation of overall policy,
 including the review of the annual budget and other major
 legislation. However, many measures of lesser importance are
 promulgated as government decrees or occasionally by royal
 proclamation. Several layers of directly or indirectly elected
 officials participate in formulating decisions, including
 members of Parliament, provincial assemblies, and municipal
 councils. More than a dozen political parties, representing a
 
 
 1331
 MOROCCO
 spectrum of political philosophies from far left to
 conservative, competed in the 1983 municipal elections and
 parliamentary elections in 1984. Local government and
 Parliament are generally considered representative, although a
 number of election results have been challenged. There is
 frequently lively debate on all subjects, and often split
 votes. While government proposals in Parliament are rarely
 rejected outright, specific measures are often modified.
 Political pressure on occasion has persuaded the Government to
 delay or withdraw legislation.
 The Government occasionally uses a direct referendum on major
 questions affecting the Constitution and the state structure.
 There were no such cases in 1985. In 1984 the voters were
 asked to approve the Moroccan-Libyan Treaty of Oujda. The
 Government announced that 97 percent of those casting ballots
 voted for the union.
 No group dominates, and virtually all points of view are
 represented in Parliament. Ethnic and tribal distinctions
 remain, fostered by the country's mountainous terrain.
 Although Berber spokesmen occasionally claim that Moroccan
 institutions do not reflect the Berber character of the
 population and that Berber identity is not sufficiently
 maintained, they continue to play a significant role in
 national and local affairs.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In recent years Morocco has not refused any formal international
 or nongovernmental investigation of human rights. However, the
 Government is sensitive to such investigations, and cooperation
 may be slow. An Amnesty International official informally
 visited Morocco in 1985, and Justice Ministry officials and the
 President of Parliament received human rights delegations on
 several occasions. The delegations expressed concern for
 prisoners on hunger strike. Most observers found the
 Government's reaction to such investigations tougher than in past
 years. The Interior Ministry formally rebutted a Le Monde
 article alleging use of a psychiatric hospital for detention.
 The Government also complained about international and domestic
 pressure in support of those on hunger strikes.
 There are two major human rights associations: the Moroccan
 Association of Human Rights (AMON) and the Moroccan League for
 the Defense of Human Rights (LDDH). The LDDH is affiliated to
 the Istiqlal Party (the major political party at the time of
 independence), while the AMDH has less clearly defined links with
 left-wing political parties. Both were active throughout 1985,
 particularly regarding prisoners on hunger strike and in calling
 for release of political prisoners. In 1985, several AMDH
 leaders were questioned by the police. Earlier, several AMDH
 leaders were detained for human rights activism.
 The Government is active on human rights issues in international
 organizations, although its interest is generally confined to the
 Arab world and Western Sahara. One external organization, the
 Paris-based Association for the Defense of Human Rights (ASDHOM),
 is particularly active. ASDHOM does not have active chapters in
 Morocco, but regularly informs the French press of Moroccan human
 rights developments.
 
 
 1332
 MOROCCO
 In its 1985 Report, Amnesty International noted that it had
 continued to work on behalf of more than 200 actual or possible
 prisoners of conscience and monitored thousands of arrests
 arising from country-wide disturbances in 1984 and that it was
 also concerned about extended periods of incommunicado detention;
 ill-treatment of detainees during interrogation;
 "disappearances"; and the imposition of death sentences. Freedom
 House rated Morocco as "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population is 23 million (53 percent under age 20) and is
 growing at approximately 2.4 percent annually, according to the
 World Bank. Per capita gross national product was $760 in 1983,
 while 1984 per capita gross domestic product was $557, with most
 of the slide due to exchange rate drops.
 In September 1985, Morocco signed a second standby agreement with
 the International Monetary Fund to bridge the balance of payments
 gap while the Government undertakes reforms for medium- and
 long-term structural adjustment. Although debt relief and
 economic reforms have allowed Morocco to make significant
 progress since 1983 in laying the basis for future growth, it
 faces continuing austerity and spending cuts have resulted in the
 postponement of health, education, and housing projects for the
 country's poorest citizens. There has been little if any growth
 in per capita income. Opposition parties charge that the
 Government's austerity measures place the burden of adjustment on
 poor and middle-income citizens. Slow growth will allow only
 gradual improvement in adult literacy (35 percent), life
 expectancy (at birth 54 years), infant mortality (93 per 1,000
 live births), and poverty (28 percent of the urban and 45 percent
 of the rural population in 1979).
 The Government is trying to reform the educational system.
 Thirty percent of the Government's operating budget is for
 education. The 160,000 teachers under the Education Ministry
 constitute half of Morocco's civil servants. Female school
 enrollment is growing faster than than of males. At least 38
 percent of all primary students, more than 40 percent of all
 secondary.students, and more than 25 percent of university
 enrollees are female. Only in rural areas is enrollment of women
 in schools unusually low, due to traditional attitudes and
 economic necessity.
 Morocco's basic legislation on working conditions dates from the
 1930's and 1940's and is fairly widely respected, at least in the
 modern sector of the economy. These laws provide for a maximum
 48-hour workweek with a full 24-hour rest day; for a specified
 annual paid holiday; and for minimum conditions for the
 protection of the-safety and health of workers, including
 prohibition of night work for women and children. Children may
 not be employed or apprenticed before age 12 and there are
 special regulations governing employment of children between the
 ages of 12 and 16. Minimum wage legislation also exists and
 minimum wages were raised twice in 1985 to take account of rises
 in the cost of living. In the traditional sectors of the
 economy, children are often apprenticed earlier than age 12,
 especially where school places are not available. Safety and
 health conditions in many enterprises are substandard. Labor
 inspectors do not have adequate resources to monitor compliance
 with the law, and occupational health inspectors, although
 
 
 1333
 MOROCCO
 mandated by legislation, do not exist because the Government has
 never allocated the resources to hire or train them.
 The Constitution reaffirms the legal equality of all Moroccans
 and provides that "men and women enjoy equal political rights."
 Women occupy responsible government positions, including at the
 ministerial staff level, as well as in the law, medicine, and
 teaching. Two women pilots are now flying regular routes for
 Royal Air Maroc. Progress in professional fields has not always
 been matched in the society at large. There are areas where
 traditional standards prevail, especially in the area of private
 law. Divorce is permitted, but a husband can repudiate his wife
 while she cannot repudiate him. A man is permitted four wives
 according to Islamic tradition, although multiple marriages are
 increasingly rare. Segregation of sexes is common, especially in
 social settings. However, in urban areas and among the urban
 poor, as well as increasingly among middle and upper class
 families, women are employed outside the home and contribute to
 family income.
 Women's role in public life remains restricted. No women hold
 seats in the 306-member Parliament, although women did run for
 the positions. Of 15,500 city council members in Morocco, only
 17 are women. Women serve on the executive committees of several
 of the major political parties and on the Saharan Consultative
 Council, a body created in 1981 to advise the King on Western
 Saharan issues. The Government actively supports labor and
 family planning projects designed to improve the condition of
 women and has organized employment programs for them. However,
 religious and social resistance to such efforts remains strong.

 THE WESTERN SAHARA
 Portions of the Western Sahara, now divided into four
 provinces, are administered by Morocco. Morocco assumed
 administration of the northern three provinces after the
 withdrawal of Spanish forces in 1975, and it asserted control
 over the southernmost portion in 1979 when Mauritania renounced
 its claim to the area and ceased administering the region over
 which its authority had been vested by the Madrid Accords of
 1975.
 Since 1977, the northern provinces of Al Ayoun, Smara, and
 Boujdour have participated in elections held throughout
 Morocco. Communal elections were held in the southernmost
 province of Oued Ed Dahhab in May 1981. The four Saharan
 provinces participated in 1983 elections and in all votes in
 1984, including the referendum on the Moroccan-Libyan Treaty of
 Union and direct and indirect elections to Parliament.
 Participation in both the referendum and the direct elections
 to Parliament tended to run higher than in almost all other
 areas of Morocco.
 Moroccan Saharan incumbents fill all 10 parliamentary seats
 from the Western Sahara provinces, and Western Saharan-origin
 politicians also fill seats from other provinces. The
 governors of the Saharan provinces, appointed by the King, are
 all native Saharans. In consultation with elected municipal
 and provincial councils, the four governors administer their
 provinces in the same manner as provinces and prefectures of
 Morocco proper. Most village and civil servants are also
 locally recruited Saharans. The governors are concerned
 primarily with accelerating development and the delivery of
 social services. Investment in the Western Sahara remains
 tax-free, in large part to encourage greater investment in the
 areas, which has the effect of raising the general standard of
 living. In March 1985, King Hassan spent 10 days in the
 Western Sahara region. During his visit, he met with the
 entire membership of Morocco's Parliament as well as with a
 number of local political leaders. Many Moroccans insist that
 the enthusiastic welcome the King received proved the
 population's loyalty to the Kingdom of Morocco.
 Ultimate sovereignty over the Western Saharan region remains a
 subject of international dispute, with sporadic fighting
 between Moroccan forces and the Polisario, an organization
 which seeks independence for the territory. At the June 1981
 summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in
 Nairobi, Morocco proposed that a referendum be held to decide
 the question. At a subsequent OAU meeting, specific measures
 seen as leading to a peaceful settlement of the Saharan problem
 were outlined by the member states. The OAU summit in 1983
 resolved that the referendum be held in December 1983 but also
 called for direct negotiations between Morocco and the
 Polisario, a request with which Morocco does not agree. The
 resulting stalemate has prevented progress to resolve the
 Western Saharan dispute in the OAU. Morocco walked out of the
 November 1984 OAU summit after the Saharan Democratic Arab
 Republic Delegation was seated. Morocco later called for the
 U.N. to administer the referendum to determine the population's
 wishes on independence or full integration into Morocco. In
 October 1985, King Hassan, in a message to the U.N., also
 announced a unilateral cease-fire by Moroccan forces in the
 region. He pledged that Moroccan forces would only defend
 themselves if fired upon.

 THE WESTERN SAHARA
 The civilian population in the portion of the Western Sahara
 under effective Moroccan control apparently enjoys the same
 civil liberties as other Moroccans .in areas of undisputed
 Moroccan sovereignty. However, in September 1985, 21 Saharan
 students studying in the northern city of Tangier fled Morocco
 and entered the Spanish enclave of Ceuta clandestinely. They
 requested political asylum in Spain and eventually traveled
 onward to Tunisia.
 There have been few opportunities to evaluate the human rights
 practices of the Polisario in areas outside the "Berm," the
 Moroccan forces' earthwork defense line. There continue to be
 Moroccan allegations of Polisario human rights abuses,
 including illegal detention, impressment into military service,
 and general infringement of the civil liberties of the
 inhabitants of the Western Sahara.
