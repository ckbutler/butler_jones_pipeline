 CYPRUS
 Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish military
 intervention of 1974, following a coup d'etat directed from
 Greece. Since that time, the southern part of the country has
 been under the control of the Government of the Republic of
 Cyprus. The northern part has been governed by an autonomous
 Turkish Cypriot administration supported by the presence of
 Turkish troops. In 1983 that administration proclaimed itself
 the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", which has-been
 recognized only by Turkey. It held a constitutional referendum
 and "presidential" and legislative elections in 1985.
 The internal political systems of the Republic of Cyprus and
 the Turkish Cypriot administration are democratic and based on
 free elections, and they provide basic human rights to their
 populations in both theory and practice.
 Both Cypriot economies are based on the free enterprise
 system, with stress on private initiative and the right to own
 property. The economy in the Republic has prospered in recent
 years, benefitting especially from tourism and manufactured
 exports. The economy in the Turkish Cypriot area is closely
 linked to that of Turkey, and has problems with high inflation,
 low investment, and significant underemployment. State
 enterprises play a large role in the Turkish Cypriot economy.
 The conflict between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities
 during the 1963-74 period, the Turkish intervention in 1974,
 and the ensuing presence of Turkish troops in the north have
 led to continuing charges of human rights violations. These
 events resulted in the uprooting of Greek Cypriots and Turkish
 Cypriots from the northern and southern parts of the island
 respectively, and the loss of lives, homes, and livelihoods.
 The United Nations Secretary General in 1984 launched a
 renewed initiative to achieve a resolution of the Cyprus
 problem. On August 24, 1988, the leaders of both communities
 announced that intercommunal negotiations would recommence the
 following month in Nicosia with the aim of reaching an
 agreement to the Cyprus problem by June 1, 1989. The talks
 began on September 15 and were continuing at year's end.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of persons abducted, secretly arrested,
 or held in clandestine detention during 1988. However, the
 issue of persons missing during the 1963-74 period remains a
 source of dispute between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
 Cypriot communities.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community specifically prohibit torture.
 
 
 1012
 CYPRUS
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is provided for by law and respected in practice in
 both communities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention is provided for by
 law and respected in practice by the Government of Cyprus and
 Turkish Cypriot authorities. Preventive detention is not
 legally authorized, nor has it been reported in practice. No
 one may be held for more than 3 days for investigation of a
 crime without referral of the case to the courts for extension
 of the period of detention. Most periods of investigative
 detention do not exceed 8 to 10 days before formal charges are
 filed. After sentencing, prisoners may be visited once a
 month, or more frequently where humanitarian needs exist.
 Attorneys may visit prisoners freely. No instances of exile
 were reported.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In both the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot area,
 fair public trial is ensured by law and exists in practice.
 The judiciary is independent of executive or military
 control. Defendants have the right to be present at their
 trials, to be represented by counsel (at government expense
 for those who cannot afford one), to confront witnesses, and
 to present evidence in their own defense. Cases are generally
 tried before a judge or panel of judges, although a request
 for a jury trial is usually granted. There are no special
 courts to deal with security or political offenses. Civilians
 are not tried by military courts. There are no political
 prisoners anywhere in Cyprus.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community contain provisions protecting
 the individual against arbitrary interference. A judicial
 warrant is required, for example, for a police official to
 enter a private residence. Abuses of privacy run counter to
 the democratic traditions of both communities. However,
 Turkish Cypriots continue to complain that mail coming through
 the Republic of Cyprus postal system is often delayed, opened,
 or not delivered.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are provided for by law and are widely and freely
 practiced throughout the island. The press is free and
 represents the entire political spectrum. There is no press
 censorship, but the authorities control radio and television.
 Legislation was passed by the Republic of Cyprus in 1986
 giving each party represehted in Parliament a seat on the
 board controlling the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation. In
 addition, the proliferation of party and independent
 newspapers in both communities enables ideas and arguments
 to circulate freely.
 
 
 1013
 CYPRUS
 Opposition papers on both sides of the island frequently
 criticize the authorities. A prominent politician in the
 Turkish Cypriot area, however, was ordered this year to pay a
 substantial fine for seditious libel charges because of an
 editorial he wrote in 1985 criticizing the chief executive of
 the Turkish Cypriot administration. The decision is currently
 under appeal.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to associate, organize, and hold meetings is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is respected in Cyprus. In the Republic,
 the vast majority of the population is Greek Orthodox; in the
 north, Sunni Muslim. The Greek Orthodox church in the Republic
 has the character of a state institution. Missionaries are
 permitted to proselytize in both communities. There is,
 however, some hesitation on the part of the Cyprus Government
 to allow such activities to go on in an unrestricted manner
 owing to the primacy of the Greek Orthodox church.
 Approximately 100 Turkish Cypriots, who still live in the
 Republic, are allowed to practice their religion freely. In
 the Turkish Cypriot area, non-Muslims include approximately
 700 Greek Cypriots, over 300 Christian Maronites, and some
 foreign residents--all of whom are free to practice their
 reIigions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 While Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots enjoy general
 freedom of movement within their respective areas, movement is
 constrained between those areas. Turkish Cypriot authorities
 regulate travel into or out of the Turkish Cypriot area. They
 bar Greeks and Greek Cypriots from entering the north and
 Turkish Cypriots from visiting the south, except when
 traveling for humanitarian, medical, or other special
 reasons. The applications of Greek Cypriot residents of
 enclaves in the north to visit the Republic are usually
 granted, but the applicants must return within a designated
 period or risk losing their right to return, along with their
 property; foreigners coming from the Republic must obtain
 permission to enter the north. At the same time, the
 Government of Cyprus bars the entry into the Greek Cypriot
 area of foreigners who arrive at Turkish Cypriot ports of
 entry. Those who enter through the Republic but wish to stay
 overnight in the north are discouraged from doing so by the
 Cyprus Government.
 The right to travel abroad and to emigrate is observed,
 although persons facing military service or legal action in
 either part of Cyprus may not be allowed to travel. Turkish
 Cypriots have difficulty in traveling to some countries
 because their travel documents, issued by the Turkish Cypriot
 authorities, are not widely recognized. Citizens may
 repatriate freely.
 
 
 1014
 CYPRUS
 The Government of Cyprus does not honor the principle of
 accepting third country persons as refugees, arguing that it
 has enough responsibilities for the care of the Greek Cypriot
 refugees as a result of the 1974 Turkish intervention. The
 Greek Cypriot authorities endeavor to remove or deport all
 such third country refugee claimants as soon as possible, even
 prior to a determination by the local representative of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that the claim
 is valid, or prior to acceptance for resettlement by a third
 country.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 Both the Government of Cyprus and the administration of the
 Turkish Cypriot community are democratically elected. In
 their lively multiparty political systems, parties compete
 actively and without restriction for popular support.
 Suffrage is universal, and elections are held by secret
 ballot. Elections for the office of President of the Republic
 of Cyprus are held every 5 years, and elections for the House
 of Representatives every 5 years or less. In the north, the
 chief executive of the Turkish Cypriot administration is
 elected every 5 years, and the legislative body every 5 years
 or less. Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north--
 the latter having chosen before independence in 1960 to be
 regarded as members of the Greek Cypriot community--do not
 participate in Turkish Cypriot elections but elect their own
 village officials. They are eligible to vote in Greek Cypriot
 elections but must make their way to the Republic in order to
 exercise that right.
 Women are by. custom less active in politics than men
 throughout the island. There are no women members of
 Parliament in the north and only one in the Republic.
 currently there are no women of ministerial rank in either the
 Republic's Government or the Turkish Cypriot administration.
 In the 1986 local elections in the Republic, however, 31 out
 of 228 city council seats went to women. The Government named
 a woman to the bench for the first time in 1986. A second
 woman was appointed in 1988. Two women currently serve as
 undersecretaries in the Turkish Cypriot administration. There
 are two female judges serving in the Turkish Cypriot
 administration, the first of whom was appointed in 1981.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The question of human rights in Cyprus is closely connected to
 the political differences that divide the two communities. In
 1986, a group of Greek Cypriots announced the formation of a
 "Committee for the Restoration of Human Rights throughout
 Cyprus." This committee ascribes the problem of human. rights
 on the island to the 1974 Turkish military intervention and
 the continued presence of Turkish troops in the north. The
 Turkish Cypriot human rights committee in turn denounced the
 Greek Cypriot charges, stating that the Turkish troops were
 present to protect Turkish Cypriot human rights. Such
 exchanges continued in 1988.
 Cyprus participates actively in the work of the U.N. Human
 Rights Commission (UNHRC). For several years, the question of
 human rights in Cyprus relating to the events of 1974 has been
 on the UNHRC's agenda. In March 1987, the UNHRC passed a
 
 
 1015
 CYPRUS
 resolution on Cyprus supported by the Government of the
 Republic of Cyprus. The United States opposed the resolution
 because it did not advance the efforts of the U.N. Secretary
 General to achieve a just and lasting settlement through his
 good offices mission, nor did it address the work of the
 Committee on Missing Persons. The Republic of Cyprus has
 applied to have the question of human rights in Cyprus placed
 on the agenda of the European Commission on Human Rights. In
 addition, the Government of Cyprus has repeatedly raised in
 international forums the question of persons missing since
 1974. Representatives of international human rights
 organizations have open access to both the Republic and the
 north. On September 5, 1988, the Government of Cyprus became
 the 21st member of the Council of Europe to sign the Human
 Rights Convention protocol granting the right of individual
 petition to the European Commission and Court of Human Rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race,,Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, education, and health care age available to
 members of both communities regardless of race, religion,
 ethnic background, or political opinion. Housing within each
 sector is adequate and is available for displaced persons.
 Cypriots living in one sector who would prefer to return to
 homes in the other sector in which they lived prior to 1974
 are generally unable to do so. Most Cypriots, both Greek and
 Turkish, are covered by national health service systems.
 There have been complaints, however, that the welfare of
 minorities in the north is impaired by Turkish Cypriot
 restrictions on housing, water, education, and movement. The
 United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) monitors the welfare
 of the Greek Cypriots and Maronites in the north, as well as
 that of the Turkish Cypriots in the Republic.
 Although members of the Latin, Maronite, and Armenian
 minorities cannot serve in the Greek Cypriot National Guard,
 this exemption is based on ethnic rather than religious
 considerations and is generally welcomed by the minorities
 themselves.
 Throughout Cyprus, women generally have the same legal status
 as men. In the north, legal provisions exist requiring equal
 pay for men and women performing the same job. In the
 Republic, government workers receive equal pay for equal work,
 but no such regulations apply to the private sector. However,
 legislation to this effect is currently pending. Despite such
 legislation, in both areas actual average wages earned by
 males substantially exceeds those earned by females. Local
 custom has also inhibited the full participation of women in
 public life. Politics, for example, has traditionally been a
 male preserve in all of Cyprus. As attitudes gradually
 change, women are receiving greater opportunities.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely on both sides of
 the cease-fire line which divides the two communities. Over
 80 percent of Greek Cypriot workers and 50 percent of Turkish
 Cypriot workers belong to independent trade unions. In both
 communities, trade unions freely and regularly take stands on
 public policy issues affecting the workers. Most unions are
 
 
 1016
 CYPRUS
 affiliated either with the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions or with the World Federation of Trade Unions.
 Unions in both parts of Cyprus freely take part in inter-
 national meetings. The Government of Cyprus has taken a
 particularly active role in the International Labor
 Organization. Labor unions, more than most other
 organizations on Cyprus, attempt to maintain contact and
 cooperation across the dividing line.
 All Cypriot workers have the right to strike. In general,
 however, strikes are rare and usually of short duration. Both
 the Government of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot authorities
 have the power to curtail strikes in what are deemed to be
 essential services.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under law and in actual practice, trade unions and
 confederations, both non-Communist and Communist, are free to
 organize and to bargain collectively in both parts of Cyprus.
 In both the north and the Republic, parties to a dispute may
 request mediation by the authorities. In both sectors
 legislation prohibits dismissal for participation in trade
 unions. There are no zones in either the Greek or Turkish
 Cypriot areas where the right to organize and bargain
 collectively are barred.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Government of Cyprus has set the minimum age of employment
 of children in an "industrial undertaking" at age 16. In the
 north, the age is 15. The law is effectively enforced in both
 sectors through labor inspection.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 In the Republic, minimum wage laws exist for apprentices
 between the ages of 16 and 18. The wage set for this group is
 equal to about $250 per month. Minimum wages for other groups
 are fixed through collective agreement. In the north, the
 minimum wage equals about $80 per month. It is effectively
 enforced, but by itself is not adequate to provide a decent
 living for workers and their families. The Government of
 Cyprus has set a 40-hour workweek as the maximum, except for
 shop workers and drivers who work no more than 42 1/2 hours.
 In the north, the maximum hours of work in the winter are 38,
 and in the summer, 36. Occupational safety and health
 regulations are effectively administered in both sectors.
