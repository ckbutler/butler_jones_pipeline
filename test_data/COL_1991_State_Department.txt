 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy in which the
 Liberals and Conservatives have long dominated the political
 scene. A coalition led by M-19; the former guerrilla movement
 that signed a peace accord with the Government and became a
 legal political party in 1990, has gained some support as an
 alternative to the traditional parties.
 Internal security is the primary responsibility of the Ministry
 of Defense, which includes the National Police. The Department
 of Administrative Security (DAS), which is responsible for
 national security intelligence, reports directly to the
 President. Security forces are responsible for significant
 human rights abuses.
 Colombia has a mixed economy, with private enterprise having a
 dominant role. The coffee industry, which accounts for 20 to
 25 percent of legal export earnings, is mainly in the private
 sector, as are most entities engaged in manufacturing,
 agriculture, and the service sector. State enterprises control
 participation in the oil and coal industries and play an
 important role in the electrical and telecommunication
 utilities. Privatization of certain public industries is
 continuing.
 In Colombia, strong democratic traditions and civilian
 governments have withstood extraordinary levels of violence for
 more than 40 years. The main sources of human rights
 violations are powerful narcotics terrorists, leftist guerrilla
 movements, and rightwing paramilitary groups that sometimes
 operate with the support or acquiescence of regional or local
 military and police officials. There are also significant
 abuses by members of the police and military themselves,
 usually in the context of efforts to quell narcotics-related or
 political violence.
 Narcotics traffickers control enormous illicit enterprises and
 use terrorism in an attempt to intimidate the Government and
 the judiciary, although narcoterrorism declined during 1991.
 Narcotraffickers sometimes propagated disinformation regarding
 official human rights abuses, hoping to undermine both domestic
 and international support for the Government. The guerrilla
 groups, which were responsible for increased political and
 economic violence at the outset of 1991, frequently murdered or
 kidnaped local government officials and civilians as part of
 their continuing effort to overthrow the Government and to
 finance their operations. In some areas, the guerrillas
 cooperate with narcotraffickers; in others they are in violent
 conflict.
 Members and units of the army and the police participated in a
 number of human rights violations. Particularly in areas of
 guerrilla violence and little civilian government presence,
 members of the armed forces committed various abuses, including
 massacres, disappearances, and torture. The army is reluctant
 to distinguish between guerrillas and noncombatants during
 counterinsurgency operations, although its record in this
 respect appears to be improving. Targets of serious abuse by
 members of the security forces include leftist politicians,
 labor organizers, human rights workers, and peasants. Some
 persons and units have assisted or participated in rightwing
 paramilitary activity, which targets guerrillas and those
 believed to have leftist or guerrilla sympathies, among
 others. Some of these paramilitary groups have been linked to
 narcotraffickers. Paramilitary activity was lower in 1991 than
 
 
 585
 COLOMBIA
 in previous years, partly because of President Cesar Gaviria's
 commitment to ending support by officials for these
 organizations. In urban areas, the National Police committed
 human rights violations that typically included disappearances,
 arbitrary arrests, and threats of violence.
 In 1991 President Gaviria led several notable efforts to
 identify and address human rights problems in Colombia. In
 September the Procuraduria, an independent government watchdog
 institution, presented its first official report on the human
 rights situation in Colombia. It termed the situation
 "alarming" and called for immediate corrective measures by all
 organs of the State, particularly those that are part of the
 problem. The report praised the adoption of a new Constitutio.
 in 1991, the first in over 100 years, and highlighted
 provisions in it regarding political and judicial reform,
 strengthened individualrights, and the establishment of a
 public defender's office to protect and publicize those
 rights. Peace negotiations between the Government and the two
 remaining guerrilla groups began in June and continued at
 year's end. The Procuraduria continued to conduct a number of
 investigations into allegations of government human rights
 abuses; by year's end, the Procuraduria had levied sanctions
 against 349 members of the security forces from April 1990 to
 March 1991 for a variety of human rights violations.
 Nevertheless, sanctions for human rights abuses are rarely
 carried out within the military and very few security forces'
 personnel have been prosecuted for human rights abuses in a
 court of law.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial killing
 Colombia has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Due
 to insufficient police and judicial resources and expertise to
 investigate and prosecute most killings, it is difficult to
 separate political and nonpolitical murders. Nevertheless, the
 Center for Investigations and Popular Education (CINEP),
 Bogota's Jesuit-affiliated human rights and social research
 institution, gives a credible figure of 398 confirmed political
 killings in Colombia through October 1991, an increase'from the
 313 political killings recorded by CINEP in 1990-. CINEP
 labeled an additional 1,029 murders as presumably politically.
 motivated, compared to 1,694 during 1990. These numbers
 exclude deaths in combat.
 Narcoterrorism. continued to decline during 1991, due in part to
 the surrender provisions of the Gaviria Administration's
 decrees providing immunity from extradition and, under certain
 circumstances, significant reductions in the sentences for '
 persons who turned themselves in and confessed. There were,
 however, still significant instances of narcoterrorism during
 the year. In January killers employed by narcotics overlord
 Pablo Escobar brutally murdered kidnap victim Marina Montoya de
 Perez, the sister of former President Barco's chief of staff.
 In February a car bomb, almost certainly planted by
 narcotraffickers, exploded in the midst of a Medellin crowd
 leaving the bull ring, killing 21 people, including 9 police
 officers, and injuring some 150 persons. The murder on April
 30 of former Minister of Justice Enrique Low Murtra was also
 almost certainly ordered by traffickers. Low had been
 
 
 536
 COLOMBIA
 repeatedly threatened by narcotraffickers due to his
 proextradition stance. In.one of Colombia's worst massacres of
 1991, 20 Paez Indians were murdered in an opium-growing area of
 Cauca Department on December 16; An investigation of possible
 ties between narcotraffickers and the murderers is going
 forward. By the end of the year, no one had been detained for
 any of these crimes.
 During a January police raid on a house belonging to the
 Escobar organization, Diana Turbay, a prominent journalist and
 daughter of a former president, was killed months after she was
 kidnaped by guerrillas and turned over to Pablo Escobar. A
 subsequent investigation by the Procuraduria found evidence
 that members of the police who participated in the raid had
 extrhjudicially executed one to three persons they believed to
 have been connected with Turbay's captors. The Procuraduria
 filed formal'administrative charges against three police
 officers--a captain, a lieutenant, and a sublieutenant.
 Rightwing paramilitary groups, sometimes with the cooperation
 or acquiescence of local military and police officers,
 continued to operate in rural areas. In 1991 there was a sharp
 increase in the number of murders of members of the small
 leftwing'Patriotic Union (UP  Party. Ninety UP members were
 killed for political or apparently political reasons during
 this period. Many of these killings are generally thought to
 have been carried out by paramilitary groups. Activists in
 Colombia's two major political parties have also been
 assassinated, although losses in those parties are in no way
 proportional to UP losses. According to CINEP statistics
 through October, 16 Liberal and 6 Social Conservative party
 activists were killed for political or apparently political
 reasons in 1991. Major abuses attributed to paramilitary
 groups appear to have declined, however, partly because of
 government pressure on the trafficking operations that financed
 some paramilitary groups and continuing government efforts to
 sever the connections between these groups and individual
 military units and officers.
 In December members of Colombia's most infamous paramilitary
 group, the Magdalena Medio Peasant Self-Defense Movement, began
 to surrender to Colombian authorities, taking advantage of the
 same surrender decrees used by narcotraffickers Pablo Escobar
 and the Ochoa brothers. Over 225 members of the paramilitary
 group had surrendered to authorities by year's end. In August,
 13 paramilitary group members were convicted in absentia by a
 public order judge for the murder of 21 peasants in the Uraba
 region. Among those found guilty were Fidel Castano and Henry
 Perez, both sentenced to 20 years in prison. Shortly after the
 verdict was handed down, Perez was killed by unknown assailants.
 Members and units of the military carried out political
 killings. In August, eight members of the Thirteenth Army
 Brigade attacked the home of a Communist Party member in the
 rural community of Fusagasuga near Bogota. The evidence in the
 case cl~arly indicates that five members of the family were
 roused from sleep in the early morning hours and murdered in
 cold blood. Criminal charges have been filed against all eight
 soldiers, and the Procuraduria has filed administrative charges
 against the lieutenant and sergeant responsible for the
 operation. On December 9, the Procuraduria announced that
 there would be no charges filed against the general in command
 of the Thirteenth Brigade.
 
 
 537
 COLOMBIA
 Members of the police, frustrated by the ineffectiveness of the
 judicial system, participated in extrajudicial killings of
 suspected drug traffickers and young residents in poor urban
 neighborhoods. Members of the police, apparently hired by
 narcotraffickers or local merchants, have probably been
 responsible for increasing numbers of,"cleanup" killings in
 Medellin and elsewhere. During 1991 significant numbers of
 such executions occurred in Medellin, Barranquilla, Cali,
 Bogota, Pereira, and Manizales. In November, in response to
 charges made in 1990 by the Archbishop of Pereira, a special
 commission of the Procuraduria tied at least 50 policemen in
 Pereira and Risaralda Department to "cleanup killings" and
 mistreatment of indigents, prostitutes, street children, and
 drug addicts. Most of the policemen involved were either
 dismissed or confront criminal charges.' "Popular militias,"
 probably linked to the guerrillas, have become active in
 Medellin. There, too, groups appear to be involved in
 "cleanup" campaigns, which include multiple executions of
 delinquents and other criminal elements (or rival criminal
 elements) from neighborhoods where the militias are powerful.
 Statistics from the human rights groups Justicia and Paz and
 the Andean Commission of Jurists indicate that there were 289
 "cleanup" killings through September 1991, compared to 267 for
 all of 1990 and 364 for 1989.
 Nationwide, policemen continue to be murdered by the
 narcotraffickers, the guerrillas, and common criminals at the
 alarming rate of more than one per day; according to official
 statistics, 329 members of the National Police were killed in
 the line of duty between January 1 and October 7.
 Leftist guerrillas were responsible for numerous extrajudicial
 killings, including of those who refused to submit to
 extortion, those who they thought had helped the Government,
 and those, including some UP leaders,,whom they declared guilty
 of "crimes against the people." They also executed some within
 their own ranks who tried to leave or who questioned the
 leadership~s political line Two police officers were found
 assassinated in Palmira, Valle del Cauca Department, in early
 February; they had been kidnaped the previous day by Colombian
 Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) guerrillas. In June a
 vegetable merchant was killed while attending his market stall,
 guerrillas of the Army of National Liberation (ELN) faction
 were implicated in the crime. In April the army uncovered an
 unmarked graveyard in territory long controlled by the FARC
 guerrilla group. Some of the dead appeared to have been
 executed. In the second worst blow to Colombia's judicial
 system in recent years, seven judicial officials (including a
 judge) and one policeman were killed November on 26 in Usme,
 outside of Bogota, by FARC guerrillas.
 A disproportionately high number of victims of violence are
 peasants and workers. In his first official annual human
 rights report, the Procurador pointed out that peasants are the
 primary victims of human rights violations, followed by
 independent workers and laborers in the informal sector. In
 his annual report the Procurador noted that he had files on
 more than 68 reported massacres by security forces. In July
 Colombia's Supreme Military Tribunal overturned an October 1990
 investigative judge's finding acquitting 3 noncommissioned
 officers of the murder of 11 residents of rural Macaravita in
 Santander. In early May, the Procuraduria filed charges
 against two agents of DAS (the equivelent of the U.S. Federal
 Bureau of Investigation) for the murder in Barranquilla of
 Jesus Santrich Nunez, a local Communist youth leader, in
 
 
 538
 COLOMBIA
 November 1990. Fifty-two union activists and 278 peasants were
 killed in the first 6 months of 1991, according to CINEP
 figures. In the same period, 32 schoolteachers associated with
 FECODE (the national teachers' association) were assassinated.
 FECODE leaders have stated that teachers were targeted by both
 political extremes. Between January and April, the president
 and three other leaders of UNDUPALMA (cooking oil union), one
 of Colombia's largest labor organizations, were assassinated
 following mock trials in which the FARC's Simon Bolivar popular
 militias accused them of treason for surrendering their arms to
 the Government. In October a union leader of the banana
 workers previously associated with the formerly
 guerrilla-affiliated Esperanza, Paz y Libertad party (EPL) was
 shot Xo death in Uruba after having been targeted by a
 dissident EPL group that is opposed to the peace process.
 Due in large part to an ineffective criminal justice system,
 very few of those who commit extrajudicial killings are ever
 brought to justice. During the 16 months covered by its
 1990-91 report, the Procuraduria noted 560 reported murders by
 the security forces, but indicated that only 4a security forces
 personnel had been administratively disciplined thus far.
 Under the new Constitution, a "Defender of the People" will,
 unlike the Procuraduria, also concern himself with violations
 by private parties and, in certain circumstances, can intervene
 in judicial proceedings related to human rights violations.
 b. Disappearance
 Both disappearances and kidnapings increased in 1991. In its
 report, the Procuraduria noted that disappearances caused by
 the security forces are a disturbing and chronic problem in
 Colombia. The report noted that, in the 465 reported
 disappearances attributed to the security forces, only 5
 policemen and 5 members of the military had been
 administratively sanctioned by the Procuraduria thus far. Most
 disappearances take place in areas of active guerrilla
 insurgency with limited civilian governmental presence. They
 may be attributed as follows: to the security forces; to forced
 recruitment by the guerrillas and flight from such recruitment;
 to extrajudicial killings, particularly by guerrillas or
 rightwing paramilitary groups; or to kidnaping for political or
 nonpolitical motives. The victims are usually workers,
 students, union members and activists, and peasants. There is
 credible evidence linking the police to the disappearance in
 Bogota of Alvaro Moreno Moreno. Moreno, a former university
 student suspected of ties to the guerrillas, was subsequently
 found dead. The inability to resolve most of these cases
 reflects the inadequacy of judicial processes and the lack of
 cooperation with the Procuraduria shown by police and
 military. Fear of retaliation on the part of witnesses,
 investigators, and judges are further inhibiting factors.
 Kidnapings carried out by guerrillas, common criminals, and
 narcotraffickers appeared to increase in 1991. Kidnaping the
 wealthy for ransom is an important source of revenue for the
 guerrillas, who also kidnap for political reasons, sometimes
 executing victims after mock trials (see Section l.a.). Three
 United States citizens kidnaped by guerrillas in late 1990 were
 released in November. Another U.S. citizen was kidnaped by
 guerrillas in late December and remains in their hands.
 
 
 539
 COLOMBIA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although torture is prohibited by law, the police and security
 forces frequently beat and torture detainees, especially in the
 period immediately following detention. In its report, the
 Procuraduria noted that it had 272 cases on file involving 664
 persons alleging torture by members of the security forces; the
 national police were implicated in nearly half of the cases.
 About one-half of the victims were peasants, followed by
 workers and prisoners. Thus far, according to the report,
 administrative sanctions have been levied against just 12
 policemen, 9 military personel, and 3 prison employees.
 Rightwing paramilitary groups operating in the countryside
 frequently torture victims before killing them. Torture is
 also a common guerrilla practice. The body of Gabriela White,-
 a prominent local politician of the Department of Antioquia,
 was found displaying signs of torture. She had been kidnaped 4
 weeks before, most likely by leftwing guerrillas.
 According to the Procuraduria, physical assault is the most
 common human rights violation committed by the security forces
 941 persons filed such complaints, and the national police were
 implicated in about 76 percent of the cases. Victims included-
 primarily workers, students, peasants, and the unemployed.
 Thus far, the Procuraduria has levied administrative sanctions
 against 155 of the perpetrators.
 Early in the year the military followed the police lead and
 agreed to grant representatives of the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) unlimited access to all persons
 detained on security charges. While the ICRC is able to see
 some prisoners held by the army, more progress is needed.
 There is no evidence of systematic abuse of prisoners in
 long-term detention facilities, although some does occur, as
 indicated in the Procuraduria's report. Prison conditions are
 seriously affected by the lack of adequate resources and
 overcrowding.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The new Constitution includes several mechanisms designed to
 prevent illegal detentions. A detainee now must go before a
 judge within 36 hours and has the right to seek, before any
 judge, a petition of habeas corpus which must be acted upon
 within 36 hours. Despite these new safeguards, numerous
 instances of arbitrary arrest or detention continued in 1991.
 The Procuraduria reported that it was investigating 611 files
 involving 677 alleged victims of arbitrary arrest and
 detention; the National Police were implicated in 71 percent of
 these cases. The Procuraduria had levied administrative
 sanctions against 87 members of the security forces by year's
 end. Workers and peasants were the major victims of these
 arrests, followed by union members, indigenous peoples, and UP
 members.
 Persons are not subject to exile.
 
 
 540
 COLOMBIA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to due process is specifically provided for in the
 Constitution. The accused have the right to representation by
 counsel, but in practice representation for indigents is
 grossly inadequate. An overburdened judiciary and a
 traditional reluctance to grant bail results in many detainees
 never coming to trial; they simply serve the minimum sentence
 applicable to the crimes which they are alleged to have
 committed. According to one study, a majority of the prisoners
 in Colombia have never been convicted of a crime.
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative
 branches in both theory and practice but has long been subject
 to intimidation when dealing with serious narcotrafficking or
 paramilitary group cases. Many magistrates, judges, and
 attorneys have been suborned, threatened with death, killed, or
 had family members killed because they were investigating or
 trying such cases. Since January 1991, however, the Government
 has taken some extraordinary steps to try to alleviate these
 problems. The special system of "public order" courts, which
 began functioning in January, was approved as permanent
 legislation in October. These special courts are designed to
 protect certain highly threatened judges involved in narcotics
 and terrorism cases, to process such cases more rapidly, and to
 improve the conviction rate, which has risen dramatically.
 Trials in these courts are closed to the public, although
 representatives of the Procuraduria must be present during most
 proceedings. The legislation also strengthens the powers of
 the security forces to conduct judicial investigations without
 direct judicial supervision. Under the reformed system, the
 Procuraduria is charged with closely monitoring police
 investigations in order to prevent abuses. Defendants before
 the public order courts enjoy all the procedural rights
 guaranteed by the Constitution. Defense attorneys do have
 several complaints about the faceless judge and anonymous
 witness structure of the public order courts. The new
 Constitution mandates that judges and witnesses be protected
 from violence but does not outline the specific means to be
 taken to protect them. Some defense attorneys intend to mount
 a constitutional challenge to the public order system. Under
 that system, a defense attorney may not impeach a witness due
 to the witness's anonymity, nor may a defendant make copies of
 some of the evidence to be used against him or her because that
 evidence may only be viewed within the confines of a specific
 room. Also, under the public order scheme, a defense attorney
 will be unable to bring charges of malfeasance or incompetence
 against the faceless judge. Some fear that the public order
 system could be used against political activists or other
 persons and do not believe that the Procuraduria's presence is
 sufficient protection for the defendant.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 A judicial order is generally required for authorities to enter
 a private home, except in cases of hot pursuit. There are
 widespread violations of legal norms regarding searches in
 remote regions, but in urban areas the sanctity of the home is
 generally respected. Peasants frequently charge that they are
 forced to leave their farms by military counterinsurgency
 operations, guerrilla conscription and confiscations, and by
 rightwing paramilitary groups. The Procuraduria reported that
 it is studying 321 cases of illegal searches, and that 25
 agents of the State had been administratively sanctioned
 
 
 541
 COLORBIA
 as of year's end. The National Police are implicated in half
 of the cases; victims are usuallypeasants and workers.
 Telephone taps and the interception of mail are normally
 allowed only when authorized by-a judge.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Although there was a decline in reports that military aircraft
 and helicopter gunships had bombed and strafed villages, some
 local human rights groups continued to charge that civilians
 were deliberately targeted. The military responded that
 noncombatant civilians were not deliberately fired on and that
 any resulting injuries or damage was incidental to combating
 guerrillas and narcotraffickers. Relatively few casualties
 were reported, although these incidents produced significant
 numbers of temporarily displaced persons.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These constitutionally assured rights are respected. The-press
 often vigorously criticizes the Government and its leaders, and
 the privately owned print media publish a wide spectrum of
 political views.
 Television frequencies and facilities are owned by the State,
 which leases air time to private production companies. The
 Government imposes some restrictions on the coverage of
 terrorism, and during a crisis it reserves the right to
 prohibit broadcast media from covering certain news events.
 During 1991 journalists continued to be a special target of
 violence. Julio Daniel Chaparro and Jorge Enrique Torres, a
 reporter and a photographer working for the Bogota daily El
 Espectador, were murdered on April 24 in the violence-plagued
 municipality of Remedios, Antioquia Department, where the two
 were working on a story. The crime remains unsolved. On
 December 28, El Tiempo reporter Henry Rojas Monje was murdered
 in front of his family in Arauca. Two soldiers were arrested
 in early January 1992 and charged with the crime.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly is respected. Public meetings and
 demonstrations are normally held without interference.
 Permission is required for demonstrations and is usually
 granted, except when the Government concludes that there is
 imminent danger to public order. Any organization is free to
 associate with international bodies in its field.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and there is
 little religious discrimination in practice. The overwhelming
 majority of Colombians are Roman Catholic, and the predominant
 position of the Catholic Church is established by a treaty with
 the Vatican. The Government permits proselytizing among
 Indians as long as the Indians welcome it and are not induced
 to adopt changes that endanger their survival on traditional
 lands.
 
 
 542
 COLOMBIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are free to travel domestically and abroad. In areas
 where military operations against guerrillas are under way,
 civilians can be required to obtain safe conduct passes from
 the military; guerrillas reportedly use similar means to limit
 travel in areas under their control. Emigration is
 imrestricted and expatriates may, by law, repatriate. The
 Government uses accepted United Nations standards to determine
 the status of refugees and asylum seekers.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have exercised this right for the past 30 years in
 elections that have generally been conducted fairly and
 openly. Persons are enfranchised at age 18. Public employees
 are forbidden to participate in political campaigns but, except
 for military personnel, may vote. There are no restrictions on
 the participation of women or minorities in politics. All
 parties operate freely without government interference.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government cooperates with investigations by local and
 interiational human rights groups. CINEP is one of the most
 respected domestic human rights organizations, and information
 compiled by it has been used by private international human
 rights organizations. Local human rights groups, universities,
 and the Government itself regularly sponsor conferences to
 analyze violence and human rights violations. One function of
 the presidential Human Rights Adviser and of the newly created
 Defender of the People is to assist human rights groups. These
 and other government officials maintain close contact with
 prominent local human rights groups. The members of these
 groups are sometimes the target of violence by rightwing
 paramilitary groups or members of the police or military forces.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Article 43 of the new Constitution declares that "men and women
 have equal rights and opportunities. Women may not be
 subjected to any form of discrimination." Article 40
 specifically requires the authorities to "guarantee adequate
 and effective participation by women at the decisionmaking
 levels of public administration." Long before the
 implementation of .the new Constitution, however, Colombian
 legislation had guaranteed women extensive rights.
 Despite these constitutional guarantees, discrimination against
 women still exists. Women are entitled to remuneration equal
 to that of men, but this l'aw is more respected by the
 Government than the private sector. Reliable statistics
 indicate that women earn approximately 66 percent of what men
 earn with comparable educition4 backgrounds. This evaluation
 does not include data for women\living outside metropolitan
 areas on whom there are no avail'ble statistics. Although no
 official Labor Department statistics are available, estimates
 indicate that while women comprise about 41 percent of the
 country's economically active population, men still dominate
 top positions in government and industry. Nevertheless,
 
 
 543
 COLOMBIA
 approximately 40 percent of the university population is
 female, and, over the past several years, women have increased
 their participation in a variety of professions, particularly
 in government. There are active private associations working
 for women's rights in the workplace and in public life.
 Violence directed against women appears to be common, but a
 lack of reliable statistics makes it difficult to gauge its
 full extent. A social welfare organization in Bogota estimates
 that only 20 percent of sexual assaults are even reported by
 women to authorities. According to Pro Mujer, an organization
 that assists female victims, at least five rapes a day are
 reported in Colombia. Victims of domestic violence are usually
 reluctant to file reports or press charges. The Government,
 through the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare, provides
 education in domestic relations and personal behavior,
 primarily to lower income families. However, domestic violence
 is not usually treated as a serious crime in Colombia, and
 rapists, even when convicted, generally receive suspended
 sentences.
 Several million blacks form a large racial minority in
 Colombia. They enjoy all the legal rights of other citizens,
 but they suffer some discrimination. Indians legally enjoy all
 the rights and privileges of full citizenship but also
 experience discrimination. Late in 1990 three leaders of the
 Arauca tribe were kidnaped while on their way to Bogota to
 present constitutional reform proposals to the Government. The
 three were subsequently murdered. Two army officers and the
 director of Indian affairs for Cesar Department were convicted
 of the crime and are awaiting sentencing. Both blacks and
 Indians are significantly underrepresented among government and
 business leaders. Indians form I percent of Colombia's'
 population. The new Constitution mandates two seats for
 Indians in the 102-seat Congress, and, in fact, a third Indian
 was elected to an at-large seat in the Congress. Blacks,
 although forming 4 percent of Colombia's population, at present
 have no representatives in Congress.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of workers to organize unions and strike is
 recognized by law. Labor Law 50, enacted in January, provides
 for automatic legal recognition of unions that have obtained 25
 signatures from a workplace and strengthens the penalties for
 interfering with workers' freedom of association. The Labor
 Code assures the independence of labor organizations in
 determining their internal rules, electing their officials, and
 administering their own activities. It also forbids the
 dissolution or suppression of trade unions by administrative
 fiat. Nearly three-fifths of the country's 880,000 organized
 workers belong to the Unitary Workers Central (CUT). Unions
 are free to associate internationally and do so.
 Article 56 of the new Constitution extends the right to strike
 to nonessential public employees and authorizes the Congress to
 enact implementing legislation. Before carrying out a legal
 strike, unions must negotiate directly with management and
 engage in conciliation procedures if no agreement results. By
 law, public employees must go to binding arbitration if
 conciliation talks fail: in practice, public service unions
 decide by membership vote if they phoose to arbitrate or not.
 
 
 544
 COLOMBIA
 Peasant leaders and labor union activists continue to fall
 victim tQ serious human rights abuses. Dozens of teachers have
 been assassinated, and former rebel leaders of some
 CUT-affiliated unions have been slain by guerrillas opposed.to
 the peace process.
 In its 1991 report, the International Labor Organization's
 (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) commended the improvements
 made to the Labor Code in the area of freedom of association,
 collective bargaining, and maternity leave. It objected to .the
 nationality requirement for election to union office and to
 other provisions that constitute interference in the internal
 administration of trade unions-and interference with the right -
 of unions to further and defend the interest of workers,
 including the continuing authority granted the President to
 terminate strikes that are believed to harm the national
 economy. At its November 1991,session, the ILO Committee of
 Freedom of Association (CFA), while recognizing government
 efforts to address the deadly violence in Colombia, expressed
 deep concern over the Government's failure to protect trade
 unionists in the country and to prosecute the perpetrators of
 violence directed at trade union leaders. The CFA also
 criticized the Government for declaring a national strike
 illegal, suspending a union's legal status without due process,
 and firing strikers from their jobs.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of workers to organize and engage in collective
 bargaining enjoys constitutional protection. Unions have been
 successful in organizing the larger firms and public services,
 which include less than 8 percent of Colombia's economically
 active population. High unemployment and weak union
 organization have limited the bargaining power of workers in
 the private sector. Antiunion discrimination or the
 obstruction of union association is illegal and enforced by
 administrative labor inspections. The new Labor Code increases
 the fines for restricting freedom of association. The use of
 strikebreakers is legally prohibited.
 The revised Labor Code eliminates mandatory mediation in
 private labor-management disputes and extends the grace period
 from 40 to 60 days before the Government may intervene in an
 effort to resolve conflicts. Confederations and federations
 are now empowered to assist their affiliates in collective
 bargaining. Colombian labor law is applied in the export
 processing zones (EPZ), of which there are seven in Colombia.
 There is no restriction against union organization in the
 EPZ's. Several public employee unions have collective
 bargaining agreements in the duty free zones of Barranquilla,
 Buenaventura, Cartagena, and Santa Marta. Some EPZ unions
 include both government and contract workers. There are no
 private unions because all EPZ firms are based on public
 investment and, as such, are treated as "official" enterprises.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is legally.prohibited, and this
 prohibition is respected in practice. The 1991 Constitution
 specifically forbids slavery or any treatment of human beings
 resembling servitude.

 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Constitution makes education compulsory between the ages of
 5 and 15, and the law prohibits the employment of children in
 most jobs before the age of 14, particularly when such
 employment might interfere with schooling. This provision is
 respected in larger enterprises and major cities. However, the
 extensive informal economy is effectively outside government
 control. According to 1991 surveys by the National Statistics
 Department, approximately 800,000 children under 15 years of
 age work in the informal sector for low pay under poor
 conditions with little protection from the Labor Code.
 e. 'Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government annually sets a national minimum wage which
 serves as an important benchmark for wage bargaining. In
 December the National Labor Council, a tripartite advisory
 board, failed to reach an agreement between government, labor,
 and private sector representatives. The Government
 subsequently raised the monthly minimum wage to a level which
 fits anti-inflation policies but falls short of providing an
 adequate standard of living for a worker and family. Labor
 experts estimate that at least half of-the work force is paid
 the minimum wage or less. Lax enforcement is partly due to the
 small number of Labor Ministry inspectors and to fear on the
 part of unorganized workers of losing their jobs. The law
 provides for a standard workday of 8 hours and a 48-hour
 workweek. These standards are enforced by Ministry of Labor
 infspectors and judicial labor courts.
 Workers' occupational safety and health are extensively
 regulated, but many such regulations are difficult to enforce
 for workers in the informal sector who are not covered by
 social insurance systems. Employees have the right to ask the
 Ministry of Labor to intervene in cases of suspected
 occupational hazards. Overall enforcement is lax, although the
 Government is trying to improve regulatory enforcement and
 expand public information programs to create greater awareness
 and voluntary compliance with labor and occupational health
 norms.
