 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a tradition of
 democratic parliamentary rule. Queen Margrethe II is titular
 Head of State. The Cabinet, accountable to the unicameral
 Folketing (parliament), leads the Government. A minority
 coalition led by Prime Minister Poul Schlueter has ruled since
 1982.
 Denmark has a unified national police. Its higher ranks are
 often filled with lawyers on internal rotation from the civil
 service. It is fully controlled by and responsible to civilian
 authorities.
 An advanced industrial state, Denmark has a mixed economy
 combining private and public ownership. The Government is
 seeking ways to reduce the public sector's share of the economy.
 Personal freedoms and the right to pursue private interests and
 to hold private property are protected by law and respected in
 practice.
 Deeply rooted democratic principles, an egalitarian tradition,
 a lively press, and highly developed educational and social
 welfare systems have made Denmark a leading defender of human
 rights in the world. There is an Ombudsman, established by the
 Folketing as mandated by the Constitution, to whom anyone may
 protest if he or she feels wrongly treated by any national or
 municipal authority.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Such killings did not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Such practices are prohibited by law. Torture does not occur.
 Allegations of inhuman treatment are rare, and there are legal
 means of redress when it occurs. Two cases alleging excessive
 use of police force against African tourists were being
 investigated in 1991.
 An innovative Center for Torture Victims at a Copenhagen
 hospital, supported by the Foreign Ministry, treats patients,
 assists torture victims, and studies ways to hinder the use of
 torture worldwide.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No person may be deprived of personal liberty without due
 process of law. Arrestees must appear before a judge within 24
 hours. A judge may order that they be held in pretrial
 detention, including detention in isolation, for a period up to
 the length of the prison sentence for the crime for which they
 were arrested. All accused have the.right to obtain their own
 attorney or a public attorney. Bail is allowed. There is no
 exile.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Danish judicial system consists of a series of courts,
 local and regional, up to the Sdpreme Court. Trials are
 usually public; judges may make exceptions, e.g., in paternity
 and divorce cases. In criminal cases, trials are closed when
 necessary to protect a victim's privacy, such as in rape cases,
 or to safeguard a witness' identity.
 The rights of the accused are carefully protected. Defendants
 have the- right to be present, to confront witnesses, and to
 present evidence. They enjoy the presumption of innocence.
 Both the defendant and the prosecution may appeal a sentence.
 The judiciary is fully independent. Judges appointed by the
 Minister of Justice serve until age 70. They may not be
 dismissed but may be impeached for negligence or criminal acts.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 A constitutional prohibition against searching homes, seizing
 papers, and breaching the secrecy of commuiications without a
 court order is respected.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a democratic
 political system ensure freedom of speech and press. There is
 one large state-owned radio and television company. Editorial
 control is exercised by a board independent of the Government.
 A second national television channel is one-third government
 subsidized. In both cases, management decides programming
 content, but operational.decisions are restricted by government
 mandate. Programs critical of the Government appear on both
 channels. The growing popularity of cable television and
 satellite dishes has greatly increased access to foreign news
 broadcasts.
 The state radio operates the only normal wattage stations. The
 Government has said it will favorably consider an independent
 nationwide radio station. Private stations are otherwise
 restricted to transmitters of 10 watts for radio or 100 watts
 for television. Direct relay transmission of foreign radio
 broadcasts such as those of the Voice of America and-the
 British Broadcasting Corporation is prohibited.
 Publications, including books and newspapers, reflect a wide
 variety of political opinion. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Danes may freely assemble and'form associations. Public
 meetings require permits, which are routinely given. Any
 organization may affiliate with international bodies in their
 fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is guaranteed to all. The Evangelical
 Lutheran Church, which is the state church, receives large
 subsidies. No religion is banned or discouraged; conversion is
 unrestricted. No one may be discriminated against for religious
 
 
 1096
 DENMARK
 beliefs. Nevertheless, many Danes are clearly uneasy with
 57,000 Muslims, mostly from the Middle East, in their midst.
 Though there have been few instances of overt anti-Muslim
 action, letters to the editor and articles in the popular press
 regularly warned that Denmark is in danger of being taken over
 by Muslims.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Danes have full freedom of travel and movement. Persons
 determined'to be political refugees are never repatriated
 against their will. However, the Government decided recently
 to start repatriating Palestinians who had been unsuccessful in
 claiming political asylum. Over 100 of those affected took
 refuge in a state church to protest the decision. The situation
 was still unresolved at year's end.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Danes have the right-to change their government peacefully.
 Ministers are responsible to the Folketing and may be removed
 by a vote of no confidence. The Prime Minister is appointed by
 the Queen after consultation with parties in the Folketing.
 Parliamentary elections must take place every 4 years, or by
 decision of the Prfme Minister, a parliamentary vote of no
 confidence, or the Government's resignation. The Folketing's
 179 members are chosen in free and open elections under a
 complex system of proportional representation designed to help
 small parties and to reflect the popular vote. Twelve parties
 ran in the 1990 election; eight, with a wide range of political
 views, achieved the minimum 2 percent of the vote needed to
 obtain seats. The current Government is a two-party minority
 coalition. Danes over 18 years of age may vote. Resident
 foreigners may participate in local elections. They hold 13
 city council seats nationwide. Women head 4 ministries and
 hold 56 seats in Parliament. There are no restrictions, in law
 or in practice, on the participation of women in government or
 politics.
 The territories of Greenland and the Faroe Islands have
 democratically elected home rule governments with broad powers
 encompassing all but foreign and security affairs.
 Greenlanders and Faroese are Danish citizens and enjoy the same
 human rights as in Denmark. Each territory elects two
 representatives to the Folketing.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights organizations operate freely. The Danish
 Human Rights Center, a government-funded institution, conducts
 research and provides information on human rights. Denmark is
 party to various international human rights conventions that
 promote and protect human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Denmark provides food, shelter, health care, and education to
 all inhabitants, regardless of race, religion, sex, or ethnic
 background.

 DENMARK
 The rights of the people in Greenland and the Faroe Islands are
 well protected. Greenlandic law is specially designed for Inuit
 customs. It includes local untrained judges rather than outside
 professionals, and there are holding centers, rather than
 prisons, whose inmates are encouraged to work, hunt, or fish
 during the day. Despite a recent high level of violence and
 murders in Greenland, the Government rejected suggestions that
 the treatment of criminals be made more severe.
 The inflow of ethnically and racially dissimilar refugees and
 immigrants (mostly Iranians, Palestinians, and Sri Lankans) has
 provoked tensions between Danes and immigrants. Incidents of
 random racially motivated violence occur regularly. In a major
 case, the Supreme Court rejected racial and ethnic quotas in
 public housing. Towns may no longer limit the number of
 immigrants who can live in a building. Proponents had claimed
 the policy prevented ghettos, while opponents thought it was
 discriminatory.
 Denmark places no restrictions on the participation of women in
 the civilian work force. Women hold positions of authority
 throughout society, including in politics, though they are much
 less represented at the top of the business world. Some 73
 percent of all women work, and 46 percent of the work force is
 female, while only 15 percent of all supervisors are women.
 Inequality in wages is mitigated by the generally high wage
 rates-women earn an average $11 an hour, and men $12.75.
 Danish authorities do not tolerate, in law or in practice,
 violence or abuse against women. Crimes against women are
 considered serious and are vigorously investigated. Experts
 estimate, however, that very few cases of domestic violence are
 reported. Denmark has no rape and domestic violence pieventipn
 programs, though there are 30 crisis centers for counseling and
 housing victims, supported by local governments, volunteer
 workers, and donations. In addition, Denmark's first center
 for abused men and its first shelter for abused-families opened
 in 1991.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a." The Right of Association
 The law states that all workers, including military personnel
 and the police, may form or join unions of their choosing.
 Approximately 80 percent of Danish wage earners belong to
 unions, which are independent of the Government and political
 parties. The Danish Federation of Trade Unions (LO), which
 includes about half of the country's work force, remain closely
 associated with the Social Democratic Party. Over the years
 there have been a few--but widely reported--incidents in which
 workers who joined trade unions not affiliated with the LO were
 harassed or rejected by members of the mainstream unions in the
 workplace. All but civil servants have the right to strike.
 The number of workdays lost due to labor conflicts in 1990
 reached 97,600. Unions may freely affiliate with international
 organizations. Greenland and the Faroes have the same respect
 for worker rights, including full freedom of association, as
 Denmark.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers and employers acknowledge each other's right to
 organize. Collective bargaining is widespread. In the private
 sector, salaries, benefits, and working conditions are agreed
 
 
 1098
 DENMARK
 upon in biennial negotiations between the various employers'
 associations and the union counterparts. In the event of a
 stalemate, the Federation of Danish Employers' Associations and
 the LO will conduct these negotiations. If the negotiations
 fail, a national conciliation board tasked with mediating labor
 contracts mediates, and its proposal is voted on by both
 management and labor. If the proposal is turned down, the
 Government may force a legislated solution on the parties
 (usually based upon the mediators' proposal). The agreements,
 in turn, are used as guidelines by the rest of the labor market,
 including the public sector. Collective bargaining in the
 public sector is conducted between the public sector employees'
 unions and government representatives, led by the Finance
 Ministry. There are no export processing zones.
 Labor relations in Greenland, a beneficiary of the Generalized
 System of Preferences, are conducted in the same manner as in
 Denmark. Working conditions are negotiated through collective
 bargaining, usually led by the largest Greenlandic union, SIK,
 which has 8,000 members, virtually the entire indigenous work
 force. In disputes, Greenlandic courts are the first recourse,
 but Danish mediation services or the Danish labor court may
 also be used.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age. for full-time employment is 15. The law
 prescribes specific limitations on the employment of those
 between 15 and 18 years of age, and it is enforced by the
 Agency for Supervision of Labor Standards, an autonomous arm of
 the Ministry of Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legally mandated national minimum wage, but the
 lowest wage in any national labor agreement is sufficient for a
 decent standard of living for a worker and his or her family.
 Danish law provided for 5 weeks of paid vacation and a 37-hour
 workweek. Danish law prescribes conditions of work, including
 safety and health; duties of employers, supervisors, and
 employees; work performance; rest periods and days off; and
 medical examinations. The Labor Inspection Service ensures
 compliance with labor legislation.
 Similar conditions of work are found in Greenland and the
 Faroes, except that their workweek remains at 40 hours and
 there is no publicly supported unemployment insurance
 available. Unemployment benefits in both places are either
 contained in the labor contract agreements or come from the
 general social security system. Sick pay and maternity pay, as
 in Denmark, fall under the social security system.
