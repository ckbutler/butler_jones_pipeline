 BENIN
 A small West African country of three and a half million
 people, Benin is among the world's poorest nations. African
 traditionalism and tribalism remain strong, although there
 has been considerable social modernization, particularly in
 the two decades since independence. Since 1972, the country
 has been governed by a radical Marxist-Leninist regime which
 subordinates political and personal liberties to "revolu-
 tionary" goals -- development, mobilization of the popula-
 tion, vigilance against "imperialist" efforts to "recolonize"
 Africa -- decided upon by the sole political party, the
 People's Political Party. The military officers who have
 directed the regime since 1972 adopted a constitution in
 February 1980 which gives a more civilian hue to the govern-
 ment, sets up a parliament and other political institutions,
 provides in principle for a panoply of political, civil, and
 economic rights, but leaves all real power in the hands of
 the party and the small number of people (mostly military
 officers) who are concurrently the party leaders and key
 governmental officials.
 The government gives high priority to economic development,
 with emphasis on the rural areas where the majority of the
 population lives. Some civil liberties, such as freedom of
 religion and movement, are well respected. Government
 policy aims at even-handed treatment for minorities and
 women. Historic inequalities, however, have not been
 overcome.
 Major threats to human rights in recent years have been
 episodic, rooted largely in tensions connected with real and
 alleged plots to overthrow the government. The political
 atmosphere was stable in 1980, and there were no large-scale
 political trials or mass arrests. However, there are no
 real restraints, either in theory or in practice, on arbi-
 trary use of power by the government, so the potential for
 serious human rights abuses remains high.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The new constitution does not specifically address the
 question of torture, although it does state that Benin
 subscribes to the principles of the Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights. While there is no organized or systematic use
 of torture, there are indications that the police and
 military treat suspects harshly and sometimes with physical
 violence, particularly during arrest and interrogation. In
 some instances foreigners have been beaten for minor immigra-
 tion infractions.   Gathering facts concerning mistreatment
 is extremely difficult, since law enforcement authorities
 are not accountable to the public or subject to its scrutiny.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Conditions are believed to be poor in Beninese jails and
 other places of detention. Beninese student associations
 abroad have alleged that conditions for some prisoners are
 
 
 extremely degrading. There is no evidence of summary
 executions. Prisoners are generally treated the same
 regardless of race, sex, type of conviction, except that
 those with financial means are able to buy preferred
 treatment.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no known instances of "disappearance" in Benin.
 The secretiveness of the regime and the lack of any official
 accountability makes knowledge of such matters limited.
 Nevertheless, in such a small country if disappearances or
 clandestine arrests were a widespread practice, it would
 have come to public attention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 According to Jeune Afrique, a periodical specializing
 in Francophone African affairs, there are 25 political
 prisoners in detention. Some local observers believe this
 is a low-range estimate. No new political arrests are
 known to have occurred during 1980. Those under detention
 have been held for several years on vague charges of having
 supported previous regimes or of posing a political threat
 to the government. A few, including three former presidents,
 have been under house arrest since 1972. The 1980 Amnesty
 International Report claims that a number of students and
 teachers arrested in the 5 day strike to protest the arrest
 of students on June 13, 1979, are still held without trial
 in prisons-and police headquarters. Preventive detention
 has been practiced primarily in periods of high political
 tension, but has not been widespread. Under this procedure
 prisoners may be held indefinitely. Habeas corpus or its
 equivalent does not exist.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary has no independence, since under the new
 constitution as well as in practice magistrates are appoint-
 ed by and are under the control of the political party.
 Qualifications for judges include, most importantly, their
 "revolutionary political conviction." Accused criminals
 normally have public trials, with the right to defense
 counsel, under the established judicial system. Secret
 trials have been conducted, however, particularly for
 security and political offenders. The 1980 Amnesty Interna-
 tional Report alleges that many prisoners are not informed
 of the charges against them and are prevented from attend-
 ing their trials. In 1979, the Supreme Revolutionary
 Council condemned 100 persons to death in absentia for
 having been implicated in the 1977 mercenary attack on
 the capital city of Cotonou, but none have been apprehended
 and the sentences have not been carried out. In corruption
 cases, special commissions of inquiry appointed by the
 President or Council of Ministers make judicial decisions
 and mete out sentences, but usually only brief periods of
 detention are involved.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution provides for the "inviolability of the
 home." This principle appears to be respected in practice.
 Again, however, it must be recognized that no practical
 
 
 restraints exist on the arbitrary exercise of government
 power.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The new constitution specifically guarantees such economic
 and social rights as decent working conditions, old age
 benefits, education, and free medical care. Over the
 years the regime has sought to improve the lot of the poor.
 Hundreds of new schools have opened, health care has been
 extended further into rural areas, and economic policy has
 given priority to development of the agricultural sector.
 These policies have produced some positive results, including
 an average gross domestic product growth of close to five
 percent in the past few years. However, because of rapid
 long-term population growth (2.8 percent annually according
 to the World Health Organization), dislocations associated
 with expropriations and the imposition of Marxist-Leninist
 economic structures, mismanagement of parastatal enterprises,
 and a host of other problems, general living standards in
 Benin have barely held their own over the last decade.
 During 1980, economic problems have mounted, primarily owing
 to mismanagement, and the government's ability to maintain
 even current living standards is coming into question.
 Some 50 percent of the rural population is below the
 absolute poverty level as defined by the World Bank,
 i.e., the level of income necessary to provide a minimal
 nutritionally adequate diet plus essential nonfood require-
 ments. Per capita gross national product is about $200.
 There are only five hospitals in the country, and one doctor
 per 36,000 inhabitants. Life expectancy is 37 years.
 In spite of the deteriorating economic situation, the
 regime has raised the portion of the budget devoted to
 defense from 10.1 percent in 1976 to 15.3 percent in
 1980.
 The new constitution guarantees the legal equality of
 women. At the same time, however, it recognizes current
 realities by stating that the "revolutionary state" will
 work "to create progressively the conditions for exercising
 this right" to equality. Women are hampered by traditional
 attitudes and social structures, even though they have equal
 legal status.
 The constitution established private property rights
 on the one hand and takes them away on the other by stating
 they must be used only in the "national interest" (as
 defined by the party) and providing for expropriation
 without indemnification. In practice, there is a flourish-
 ing private economy, much of it associated with the black
 market trade with Nigeria, but the clear thrust of government
 policy is to collectivize the economy as rapidly as possible
 and to limit private property holdings.
 
 
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedoms of speech, press, and assembly do not exist in
 Benin. The fundamental basis of the regime's Marxist-
 Leninist ideology is that the interests of the state, as
 defined by the sole political party, take precedence over
 individual rights. The press is totally under state control.
 Organized political opposition is not tolerated. Free labor
 unions and artistic expression must, according to the
 constitution, be *based on our national Marxist-Leninist
 orientation."
 With regard fo freedom of religion, however, there are
 constitutional guarantees which are also respected in
 practice. Christianity, Islam, and animism are all flourish-
 ing (although in past years there have been sporadic
 efforts to suppress the latter). Missionaries are active
 although they are forbidden to operate schools. The only
 sect against which serious action has been taken is Jehovah's
 Witnesses. In 1976, when they refused to acknowledge the
 legitimacy of the revolutionary government, church property
 was confiscated and foreign members were expelled.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on the movement of Beninese
 within the country. Foreign travel is possible in principle
 but difficult in practice, particularly for people with
 needed skills (whose travel under government practice is
 restricted) and for those without the resources to pay
 substantial bribes for passports. Repatriation is possible,
 although the question is rarely raised since few Beninese
 residing outside the country wish to return. There is no
 discrimination against women or other groups with regard to
 freedom of movement.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The 1980 constitution established various political and
 administrative organisms, including a National Assembly
 elected by universal adult sufferage. However, all political
 activity is in the context of a Marxist-Leninist, one-party
 system. Candidates are selected by the single political
 party and ratified by popular vote with no opposition
 permitted.
 At the local level, political participation on a limited
 scale has been organized since 1975. Mass meetings select
 precinct delegates, who then select commune representa-
 tives, who in turn elect a mayor. However, the party
 controls this process and in any case the mayor and the
 local delegates are obliged to carry out the orders of the
 government-appointed district chief.

 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Amnesty International Report 1980 states its concerns
 are detention of political offenders without trial, political
 imprisonment after unfair trials and the death penalty. An
 appeal by Amnesty International to President Kerekou to
 release students and teachers held after a strike in 1979
 has remained unanswered.
