 BOTSWANA
 Despite severe external and internal pressures,
 Botswana has maintained its fundamental principles
 of political democracy, the rule of law andrespect for
 human rights. Although exposed to threats stemming
 from the civil war in neighboring Rhodesia, it has not
 suspended civil liberties on grounds of national
 security. It has continued to permit political dissent,
 has held its officials and military forces strictly
 accountable to an independent judiciary for official
 behavior, and has enforced legislation protecting the
 rights of its white and Asian minorities despite rising
 racial tension elsewhere in southern Africa. At
 the same time, by straining its resources it has
 provided for the security and needs of refugees
 from several nearby countries seeking asylum in
 Botswana. Botswana has consistently demonstrated
 a strong commitment to political liberties and civil
 rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There have been no allegations of torture in Botswana.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 Such practices are forbidden by law and virtually
 unknown in practice. In the one case where improper
 official behavior allegedly resulted in such treatment,
 the Government conducted an exhaustive investigation
 which led to the filing of criminal charges against a
 Government official (see below, l.c.).
 c. Abritrary Arrest of Imprisonment
 
 
 16
 There are no political prisoners in Botswana and
 its constitution contains provisions which effectively
 protect its citizens against arbitrary arrest. In
 the one case in 1978 where an arbitrary arrest of
 three foreigners was alleged (see above, l.b.) the
 Government conducted an exhaustive investigation
 which resulted in the indictment of an official,
 who was later acquitted.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Botswana's judiciary is independent and impartial.
 The Government has upheld the separation of executive
 and judicial authority, even in controversial and
 politically sensitive cases. All trials are held in
 public and accounts by foreign news sources indicate a
 scrupulous adherence to established procedures including
 the rights of the accused.   Problems in administration
 of justice include difficulty in recruiting enough
 qualified magistrates and lack of adequate compilation
 of Botswana's law reports.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There are effective legal safeguards against arbitrary
 invasion of the home.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Government of Botswana is committed to development
 with equity and has shown considerable sensitivity
 to the basic human needs of its population. Preparation
 of its 1979-1985 development plan has led to a lively
 and constructive debate among Government planners over
 how to distribute equitably among a fundamentally
 pastoral population the proceeds from a modern economy
 based on mineral extraction. Among options being
 considered is a shift from past emphasis on provision
 of physical and social infrastructure to greater
 Government support for directly productive activities
 
 
 (arable agriculture, commerce, and small scale rural
 industry). The goal of this effort would be greater
 employment creation, which President Khama has identi-
 fied as the primary objective of Botswana's second
 decade of development. Programs such as the Accele-
 rated Rural Development Program of 1974-76, which
 achieved considerable success with a crash effort to
 bring classrooms, sanitation facilities, health posts
 and water supplies to the countryside, will be con-
 tinued. However, the Government is now seeking to
 insure that development projects are more carefully
 planned, that they stress employment creation wherever
 possible, and that they take into account the Govern-
 ment's ability to fund the recurrent costs necessary to
 maintain the new facilities.
 Botswana has a progressive income tax and a turnover
 tax on the revenues of the Botswana Meat Commission at
 Lobatse which is borne by cattle producers. Botswana
 has avoided regressive sales taxes. Tax burdens thus
 tend to fall on those most able to bear them. Corruption
 is not a serious problem, and senior officials seek to
 ensure that there is no improper use of public funds.
 Recent isolated cases of corruption have been investigated
 and prosecuted where possible. Government workers
 are granted periodic raises to offset inflation,
 and employers of urban workers in the private sector
 key their wage scales to those of the Government. The
 survey completed in 1978 did not satisfy urban workers
 because the Salaries Commission held down raises to
 avoid further expansion of the gap between urban and
 rural-incomes.
 Women are finding increased employment in the modern
 sector. In Government jobs, women receive equal pay
 for equal work. Labor unions are permitted to organize,
 bargain collectively and strike.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 
 
 The people of Botswana are free to form independent
 political ideas and express them in speech and peaceful
 assembly. Opposition political parties exercise these
 rights by sharply criticizing the Government and the
 ruling Botswana Democratic Party. Women have full
 political rights. There are no restrictions on freedom
 of religion. Botswana's information media are owned by
 the Government but run by editoral staffs who enjoy
 considerable independence. They often print articles
 severely critical of Government officials and policies,
 and there is heavy coverage of the activities and
 statements of the political opposition.
 Botswana has a nearly homogeneous ethnic population.
 Three minorities remain distinct. While racial
 tensions occasionally manifest themselves, the Govern-
 ment has vigorously pursued a policy of non-racialism
 which gives all citizens the same rights and responsi-
 bilities regardless of color. As a result, race relations
 are quite harmonious.
 The Kalanga Tribal Group in northeast Botswana makes up
 less than five percent of the country's population but
 is well represented in the central Government and
 private sector. Tensions persist between Kalangas and
 Tswanas, who comprise ninety percent of the population,
 but there is no legal discrimination against the
 Kalanga minority.
 The Basarwas (or Bushmen) who inhabit the Kalahari
 desert region have presented a difficult problem.
 The steady incursions of modern agriculture have
 caused many Bushmen (some five percent of the popula-
 tion) to abandon their traditional life as hunter-
 gatherers. Faced with the dilemma of the Bushmen's
 desire to maintain their traditional existence and the
 economic necessity to make efficient use of all the
 nation's land, the Government has favored policies
 which would cause Bushmen to abandon their traditional
 life style. A Government project is designed to ease
 their integration into modern life.
 The white and Asian minorities in Botswana, although
 less than two percent of the population, remain signifi-
 
 
 cant because of their importance in the economy. Many
 whites and Asians are now citizens. Their personal and
 property rights are protected by the same laws which
 protect all Batswana. There are white members in both
 Parliament and the Cabinet. They do not represent the
 white minority as such but are selected on a non-racial
 basis.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on movement within Botswana,
 emigration or travel abroad. The Department of State
 is aware of only one case in 1978 in which a group of
 Batswana were denied foreign travel passports; this was
 because of improper procedures by a foreign government
 and allegations that the purpose of the trip was to
 receive training in subversive activities.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Botswana is a multi-party parliamentary democracy
 based on constitutionally guaranteed universal suffrage.
 Its citizens enjoy complete freedom to participate
 in politics by voting, party activities and public
 advocacy of policies. Three opposition parties
 challenge the ruling Botswana Democratic Party in
 free elections in which secret ballots are cast.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Botswana welcomes outside attention to, and investiga-
 tion of, its human rights situation including its
 treatment of refugees. Investigations into refugee
 conditions by outside groups including the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Interna-
 tional Red Cross resulted in President Khama receiving,
 in May 1978, the Nansen Award for his country's humani-
 tarian reception of persons displaced from the fighting
 in Rhodesia.
