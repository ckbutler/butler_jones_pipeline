 KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
 The Kyrgyz Republic became an independent state in 1991. Although the 1993
 Constitution defines the form of government as a democratic republic with substan-
 tial civil rights for its citizens, the President, Askar Akayev, dominates the Govern-
 ment. Akayev was reelected in December 1995 in an open, multicandidate presi-
 dential election, which was marred, however, by deregistration of three rival can-
 didates immediately prior to the vote. Also in 1995, a two-chamber Parliament was
 elected for a 5-year term. The Constitution was amended by referendum in Feb-
 ruary 1996 to strengthen substantially the Presidency and define the role of Par-
 liament. However, the February referendum was marred by serious irregularities.
 On October 17, the Government held a constitutional referendum that, among other
 things, reformed the structure of the Parliament and the national budget process.
 The referendum passed by over 90 percent, but there were again a number of seri-
 ous irregularities. Although Parliament has become increasingly active, it still does
 not check the power of the President effectively. The judiciary is dominated by the
 executive branch.  .
 Law enforcement responsibilities are divided among the Ministry of Internal Af-
 fairs (MVD) for general crime, the Ministry of National Security (MNB) for state-
 level crime, and the procurator's office for both types of crime. Both the MVD and
 MNB deal with corruption and organized crime. These ministries inherited their
 personnel and -infrastructure from their Soviet predecessors. Both appear to be
 under the general control of the Government and generally conform their actions
 to the law. Kyrgyz Republic's border with China and one of its two international
 airports are manned by Russian border troops under an agreement with the Rus-
 sian Federation. Border guards are under the full control of the Government. As of
 January 1, 1999, responsibility for border control lies with the Government, except
 for the Sino-Kyrgyz border where Russian guards operate under joint Kyrgyz-Rus-
 sian agreement. Final withdrawal of Russian border guards is scheduled for 2003.
 Some members of theapolice committed human rights abuses. Police patrols are
 poorly supervised, not always paid promptly, and sometimes commit crimes. Super-
 vision of conditions for pretrial detainees is also poor, and abuses sometimes occur.
 The Kyrgyz Republic is a poor, mountainous country with a rough balance of agri-
 cultural and industrial production. Cotton, tobacco, and sugar are its primary agri-
 cultural exports. The country also exports hydroelectric power, antimony, mercury,
 and uranium. The Government has carried out progressive market reforms. The
 moderate growth apparent in most sectors has increased, and the public generally
 supports economic reform. Gross domestic product for the first half of 1998 in-
 creased by 5 percent compared with the same period of 1997; however, the level of
 hardship for pensioners, unemployed workers, and government workers with salary
 arrearages continues to be very high. The average annual salary is $152 (4,641
 som). Foreign assistance plays a significant role in the country's budget.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens in many
 areas, but serious problems remained. The Government limited citizens' ability to
 change their government, and there were serious irregularities in the October con-
 stitutional referendum. There were credible reports of police abuse and brutality.
 Prison conditions are very poor, and there were some cases of arbitrary arrest and
 detention. Executive domination of the judiciary limited citizens' right to due proc-
 ess, although the judiciary is undergoing reform. Although government supervision
 of "village elders' courts" remains uneven, abuses such as stoning and death sen-
 tences have abated. Although sanctioned by the Government, elders' courts are not
 
 
 1341
 art of the regular judicial structure, and the Government has made efforts to cur-
 their activities. The Government at times infringed on freedom of speech and
 of the press. Authorities at times pressured journalists who criticized individual
 members of the Government. Unlike the previous year, the Government did not use
 libel laws against the press; however, the Government on occasion apparently used
 tax laws and registration requirements to intimidate the opposition press or to sus-
 pend newspapers. The Government at times inhibited freedom of assembly and as-
 sociation. The Government deregistered the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights
 (KHRC) prior to the October referendum. The Government at times infringes on
 freedom of religion. Violence against women is a problem that authorities often ig-
 nore, and trafficking in women also is a growing problem. Child abuse is a problem,
 and there is a growing number of street children. Discrimination against ethnic mi-
 norities persisted.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 In January police officers in Tamga beat to death Muratbek Sulaimanov while he
 was in their custody on suspicion of cattle theft. Officers returned Sulaimanov's
 body to his relatives hours after he was taken into custody. The officers claimed that
 they did not kill Sulainanov and released him in good health, but that he later fell
 down a flight of stairs. An autopsy determined that the cause of death was the nu-
 merous injuries that resulted from a serious beating. At year's end, the officers in-
 volved had not been brought to trial.
 In February police officers in the Lenin region severely beat 17-year-old Sergei
 Skromnov and then buried him alive in ashes at the city heating plant. Skromnov
 died of suffocation, according to the autopsy. The investigation into Skromnov's
 death still was ongoing at year's end, but there has been no resolution of the case.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices; however, there were credible reports of
 police violence against detained suspects to obtain confessions while the suspects
 were in pretrial detention. There were also a small number of credible reports of
 police brutality in criminal cases, according to the KHRC.
 Prison conditions (including overcrowding, food shortages, and lack of heat and
 other necessities) are very poor, due to limited budget resources. Those detained by
 the MNB rather than the MVD are kept in an MNB facility; after conviction, they
 go to a regular prison. The Criminal Procedure Code of 1994 is based on the Soviet-
 era Criminal Procedure Code and established the right for attorney-client visits of
 unlimited number and duration. In practice, however, an attorney must obtain offi-
 cial permission for every visit. Prison visits by family members are at the discretion
 of the investigator during the investigation phase. After conviction family members
 may visit regularly.
 In principle nonfamily visitors seldom are permitted. However, some citizens, in-
 cluding local human rights activists, claim that they usually can obtain official per-
 mission for a visit through personal connections with the MVD.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The judicial system continues to operate,
 in many cases, under Soviet laws and procedures, and authorities generally respect
 these provisions in practice; there were a few cases of arbitrary arrest and deten-
 tion. The procurator's office determines who may be detained, arrested, and pros-
 ecuted. The MNB, the MVD, and the General Procurator carry out investigations.
 Since 1990 persons arrested or charged with crimes have the right to a defense
 counsel, who is required to visit the accused within the first 3 days of incarceration.
 However, sometimes the accused first sees the defense counsel only at the trial.
 The Criminal Code permits the procurator to detain suspects for 72 hours before
 releasing them or accusing them of a crime. The procurator must issue an arrest
 warrant before a person can be detained. If a suspect is charged, the procurator
 must advise defense counsel immediately. The accused usually remains in detention
 while the procurator investigates and prepares the case for trial. The procurator has
 discretion to keep the accused in pretrial detention for up to 1 year, but there are
 conditions for provisional release before trial. After 1 year, the procurator must re-
 lease the accused or ask Parliament to extend the period of detention. Since inde-
 pendence, there have been no known instances in which Parliament has been asked
 to extend a detention.
 In January authorities arrested opposition political leader Kubanichbek Apas
 upon his arrival in the country from Russia, where he was living to avoid ongoing
 
 
 1342
 
 government harassment. Police arrested Apas on outstanding libel charges and for
 insulting the honor and dignity of the President. However, police released Apas not
 long after his arrest through application of the 1997 amnesty law.
 The MNB monitors the Uighur community closely. They sometimes arrested
 Uighurs on ill-defined charges, including use of falsified identification and on weap-
 ons charges (see Section 2.d.).
 In October a policeman was tried and convicted for raping a foreigner in Bishkek
 in November 1997. He was sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment.
 Topchubek Turgnnaliyev, an opposition party leader, was arrested in April 1996
 for disseminating anonymous leaflets containing libelous material against President
 Akayev. In May the Supreme Court upheld the original July 1996 verdict against
 Turgunaliyev, despite the fact that two opposition newspapers reported that the
 procurator and local authorities pressured witnesses during the original trial. The
 Court later modified the sentence and applied a 1997 amnesty to his case, a formal-
 ity, since Turgunaliyev already had served his sentence. Turgunaliyev also had been
 arrested for embezzlement in December 1997, while he was participating in a rally
 in front of the Government Building in Bishkek. In May the Supreme Court upheld
 the second conviction as well, but reduced the sentence from 4 to 3 years.
 Turgunaliyev already had served much of his second term and was released due to
 the amnesty. However, after Turgunaliyev participated in demonstrations to support
 the Asaba newspaper in August (see Section 2.a.), he was detained again. Authori-
 ties sentenced him to prison but released him on parole after approximately 2
 weeks. Authorities initially required Turgunaliyev to report to a "halfway house" in
 the evenings as, a condition of his parole, although the law provides no grounds for
 such a requirement. During his probation of approximately 1 year, Turgunaliyev
 may not vote or run for office, which prevents him from running in the 1999 par-
 liamentary elections and may effectively prevent him from competing in the 2000
 presidential elections, due to insufficient time to campaign after his probation ex-
 pires.
 The Government does not employ forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, despite extensive ,reforms in the court system and a large body of
 new law, court operations have not yet become- independent of the executive branch,
 which continues to dominate the judiciary.
 Cases originate in local -courts; they may move to appeals courts on the district
 or regional level, and finally to the Supreme Court. Separate courts of arbitration
 handie civil disputes, and traditional elders' courts handle low-level crime in rural
 area.
 The procurator brings cases to court and tries them before a judge and two peo-
 ple's assessors (pensioners or citizens chosen from labor collectives). The accused
 and the defense counsel have access to all -evidence gathered by the procurator.
 They attend all proceedings, which are generally public, and-are allowed.to question
 witnesses and present evidence. All members of the court have equal rights. Anyone
 in the courtroom may question witnesses. Witnesses do not -aways recapitulate
 their evidence in court; instead they affirm or deny their statements in the-procu-
 rator's files.
 The court compares the facts as presented by the procurator 'and the defense, and
 in most cases makes its decision after receiving all available information in each
 case. The court may render one of three decisions: Innocent; guilty; or indetermi-
 nate, that is, the case is returned to the procurator for further investigation. In 1996
 the Constitutional Court ruled that only the defense has the right of appeal. The
 decision of a court to return a case to the procurator for further investigation may
 not be appealed, and accused persons are returned to the procurator's custody,
 where they may remain under detention.
 The procurator, not the judge, is in charge ofcriminal proceedings. Thus the
 courts are widely perceived as a rubber stamp for the procurator and for high-rank-
 ing government officials-and not as the protectors of citizens'orights. In addition very
 low judges' salaries have led to a 'well-grounded view among- lawyers and -itizens
 that all but a very few scrupulously honest judge&are open to bribes.
 Local elders' courts are found in almost every oblast and -region. They exercise
 their authority by trying petty crimes, such as robbery, _hooliganism, or theft. In the
 past, local elders',courts had exceeded their authority-by trying major crimes, using
 torture to extract confessions or even-levying capital punishment. However, abuses
 such as stoning and death -sentences have abated, and there were no reports of such
 -action during the year. Local elders' courts are under the supervision of the procu-
 rator's office, but they may not receive close oversight due to the fact that many
 such courts are located in remote regions, which makes monitoring them difficult.
 
 
 1343
 The Government has introduced several judicial reform measures, including a pro-
 posal to establish an independent judicial budget, creation of judicial judgment en-
 forcement procedures, and independent judicial training. Generally accepted inter-
 national practices, including the presumption of the innocence of the accused, have
 been introduced. Judges do not hold positions for life. As provided in the Constitu-
 tion, terms for judges range from 15 years for Constitutional Court judges to 3 years
 for first-term local judges. A new system of court administration is being instituted,
 and sitting judges are being tested on their knowledge of the law and new civil
 codes. The first round of testing was completed in the fall of 1996; the next will be
 carried out in the fall of 1999 when new judicial appointments occur. If judges fail
 these tests, they may be disqualified from holding office. The process appears to
 have increased judicial professionalism, and a number of judges have been removed
 due to poor performance on the exams. Some removals appear to have been subjec-
 tive, but most lawyers and judges consider the system to be a fair measure of com-
 petence. In what may be an indication of growing judicial independence, the Con-
 stitutional Court ruled in November 1996 that the speaker of the legislative lower
 house had been elected unconstitutionally, since mandated parliamentary procedure
 had not been followed. The legislature accepted the Court's ruling and elected a new
 speaker.
 The appointment of ethnic Kyrgyz to key positions in the judicial system has led
 to charges by non-Kyrgyz that the system is arbitrary and unfair and that the
 courts treat Kyrgyz more leniently than members of other groups. Although system-
 atic discrimination is not clearly evident, it is credible in some cases. There are also
 complaints by Uzbeks, and even by ethnic Kyrgyz, that the southern portion of the
 country is underrepresented in the judiciary.
 Economic crimes such as tax evasion, embezzlement, and theft of government
 property, including that of electric power, are common. Prosecution for these crimes
 is relatively rare and sometimes appears to be directed at opponents of the Govern-
 ment. Recently, however, officials with a close relationship to the Presidency have
 been fired because of fraud and malfeasance while in office. Legislators in the past
 have used their parliamentary immunity to avoid being brought to court. The Gov-
 errnent recently initiated investigations into allegations of fraud and malfeasance
 by government officials. In addition, the October referendum included an amend-
 ment that limited immunity to official acts only.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits unlawful entry into a home against the wishes of the occu-
 pant and states that a person's private life, privacy of correspondence, and tele-
 phonic and telegraphic communications are protected. The law and procedures re-
 quire the General Procurator's approval for wiretaps, searches of homes, intercep-
 tion of mail, and similar acts. A change in the law in 1995 weakened these protec-
 tions by allowing the procurator to give approval for searches over the telephone;
 thus no written proof exists to verify that the search was approved. Furthermore,
 in certain cases, law enforcement officers may first carry out a search and then get
 approval within 24 hours. If approval is not given, any evidence seized is inadmis-
 sible in court.
 Organizational structures responsible for violations during the Soviet era have re-
 mained largely in place; however, there were no reports of violations of citizens' pri-
 vacy. There were concerns by citizens active in politics or human rights issues that
 the privacy of their communications was violated, but evidence to that effect is not
 available.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for certain freedoms of speech
 and of the press; however, the Government at times infringed on these rights.
 The 1992 law on the mass media provides for freedom of speech and the mass
 media, and outlines registration procedures. It identifies prohibited material: Gov-
 ernment and commercial secrets; material advocating war, violence or intolerance
 toward ethnic or religious groups; desecration of national norms, ethics, and sym-
 bols, such as the national seal, flag, or anthem; pornography; and encroachment on
 the honor and dignity of a person. Two new laws, "On Guarantees and Free Access
 to Information" and "On the Protection of the Professional Activities of Journalists,"
 were adopted in December 1997.
 One newspaper was closed by the Government during the year, but no electronic
 media were closed. No journalists were arrested or imprisoned as a direct result of
 journalistic activities, although several faced civil "honor and dignity" charges in
 court cases brought by parliamentarians or other public figures.
 
 
 1344
 Libel is a criminal, not a civil action. The Government attempted at the end of
 1997 and early this year to amend the Criminal Code to remove libel; however, its
 efforts were defeated in Parliament by an overwhelming majority. As a result of the
 October 17 referendum, the Constitution now includes language that precludes Par-
 liament from passing laws that infringe on free speech. However, it remains unclear
 whether there will be implementing legislation for this amendment.
 There are approximately 40 to 50 independent newspapers and magazines, includ-
 ing some with local, not national, standing. There are also several hours daily of
 independent television and radio broadcasting. However, state television, radio, and
 government newspapers receive government subsidies, which permit the Govern-
 ment to influence media coverage. Additionally, the State's printing house, Uchan,
 is the only newspaper publisher in the country. Thus, the Government could be in
 a position to control or pressure the independent newspapers, although there were
 no reports of such pressure during the year.
 Yrysbek Omursakov, a journalist for Res Publica, who had been sentenced in 1996
 for libeling President Akayev, was sentenced for libel again in May 1997, after writ-
 ing a series of articles on privatization. He was released on bail in June 1997, but
 the charges remained in force. He was sentenced in September 1997 to 6 months
 in a prison colony; he appealed the verdict but was found guilty in November 1997.
 He was then released under a presidential amnesty. The Supreme Court found him
 guilty on January 20, according to the Civil Code, not the Criminal Code and sen-
 tenced him to pay a fine equal to 100 times the minimum monthly salary (about
 $600), but the provision of amnesty exempted him from having to pay. Omursakov
 returned to work at Res Publica during the year.
 In March 1997, the newspaper Kriminal was closed as the result of a trial initi-
 ated by the then Prime Minister: The newspaper was sued after publishing an arti-
 cle that accused the Prime Minister of constructing a huge house for himself. In
 May 1997, Zamira Sadykova, Aleksandr Alyanchikov, Bektash Shamshiyev, and
 Marina Sivasheva of Res Publica were convicted of libel against Dastan Sarygulov,
 the head of the gold mining concern, Kyrgyzatyn. Sadykova and Alyanchikov re-
 ceived 18-month sentences; Shamshiev and Sivasheva were fined and barred from
 working as journalists for 18 months. After an appeal, the court suspended
 Alyanchikov's sentence, although his 18-month ban on journalistic activity remained
 in effect and overturned Shamshiyev's and Sivasheva's sentences. The court did not
 overturn Sadykova's sentence but had her moved to a more lenient place of deten-
 tion.
 All media must register with the Ministry of Justice and wait for ministry ap-
 proval before beginning to operate. The media law states that the registration proc-
 ess will take 1 month. During the year, there was one report concerning a media
 organization that could not register in a timely manner. The owners of Asaba, hav-
 ing filed documents in June to register another newspaper in Russian, were unable
 to do so until December.
 During the first half of the year, all television and radio stations were to be reg-
 istered (licensed) with the newly established National Agency for Communications
 (NAC) or reregistered if they had a registration with the NAC's predecessor, the
 Committee on Frequencies under the Prime Minister. The NAC requires extensive
 paperwork for registration, including copies of documents on education and training
 received by the staff, and specifications of the equipment used.
 Many independent television and radio stations have received licenses. Among
 them were Pyramid, Independent Bishkek Television (NBT), Vostochnaya Strana
 (VOSST), Asia Center, Open Channel, and Europa Plus. The registration fee ranges
 from approximately $500 to $1,000 (10,000 to 20,000 som). Licenses issued are valid
 for 3 to 7 years (the duration of validity was determined by the NAC based on its
 evaluation of a company's viability). Other independent television and radio compa-
 nies are in the process of reregistration, including Osh Television, Mezon Television,
 Radio Almaz stations in Bishkek and Osh, and several others.
 There are two television stations in Osh that broadcast in Uzbek: Osh Television
 (some programs) and Mezon Television (all programs). The latter was founded by
 the Mezon Uzbek Ethnic Center to serve the needs of the large Uzbek population
 of Osh.
 Licensing has been complicated for nongovernment broadcasters. In August the
 NAC notified licensees of a new government provision. Entitled "Provisions on Li-
 censing Activities in the Area of Communications in the Kyrgyz Republic, Article
 33," it provides that those holding licenses pay for all expenses connected with car-
 rying out supervisory functions under the license agreements. Additionally, since
 mid-August the nongovernment electronic media began receiving standard notices
 from the NAC, signed by its director Orozaly Kaiykov, stating that the obligation
 to broadcast in the state language was not being fulfilled and that broadcasters
 
 
 1345
 were relying mainly on foreign music and programming. Despite an extended series
 of meetings since September between the NAG and media officials, these issues,
 which the media view as a form of censorship, were not resolved by year's end.
 On August 15, with only 1 month's notice, the independent Kyrgyz language
 news p aper Asaba was evited from its offices after renting space there for 32 years.
 The building now belongs to the MVD. According to reports in other independent
 newspapers, Res Publica and Vecherniy Bishkek, the primary reason for the eviction
 was that Asaba (an opposition newspaper) had published articles critical of the Gov-
 ernment. The staff and supporters of Asaba organized a peaceful demonstration on
 August 15 to protest the Government's action, but the MVD did not change its deci-
 sion to evict Asaba. The newspaper continued to publish from the editor's home
 until moving into new offices at the end of September. Asaba also reported ongoing
 problems with the tax authorities that were not resolved by year's end.
 On September 21, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Parliament, Ishenbay
 Kadyrbekov, brought suit in the Laninsky regional court in Bishkek against a jour-
 nalist, Kalen Sydykova. Sydykova was charged under Article 18 of the Civil Code
 for her publication of an article entitled "Crime in Parliament or Ventures of Pre-
 sumptuous Members of Parliament" in the newspaper Kylmysh Jana Jaza (Crime
 and Punishment) on June 11. She was accused of harming the dignity and honor
 of a Member of Parliament (M.P.) and the statements in her publication were con-
 sidered to include "rude insinuations and defamation." The M.P. claimed $50,000 (1
 million soms) in compensation. At year's end, the rayon court found Sydykova not
 guilty, but the case was being a ppealed to a higher court.
 In September Bermet Bukasheva, the chief editor of the newspaper Litsa, was
 charged with defaming Minister of Finance, Talaibek Koichumanov. Bukasheva was
 found guilty in September, fined $500 (10,000 soms), and ordered to print a retrac-
 tion. She intended to appeal this decision to the city court; however, Koichumanov
 (who is no longer Finance Minister) agreed not to press for the fine and retraction,
 if Bukasheva did not appeal the case.
 On October 19, the Minister of Justice suspended three newspapers: Kartama-Di-
 gest (the successor to Kattama); Limon; and Pajshamba (a supplement to Asaba) for
 porography as a result of pressure from an M.P. and from the public. Kartama-
 Digest had published only one issue and was closed before the case was filed. A re-
 cently established Morals Commission accurately charged that these newspapers
 contained material that was pornographic or offensive to the public taste. However,
 other equally pornographic publications were left alone, suggesting that the case
 against Limon (linked to Akipress) and Pajshamba (linked to Asaba) may have been
 politically motivated. Both Limon and Pajshamba have reached an accommodation
 with the Ministry of Justice. Limon will continue to publish, although it will elimi-
 nate its pornographic content. Pajshamba published one more issue before going out
 of business at the end of the year. Asaba attempted to revise Pajshamba and in-
 tended to establish a new journal (Juuchu) in 1999.
 The Morals Commission, a presidentially appointed body of newspaper editors,
 university rectors, religious leaders, and public figures, was tasked with reviewing
 the print and broadcast media as well as videos and other activity to determine
 whether the content is pornographic or violent in nature. Upon finding that an item
 was pornographic, -the Commission was charged with requesting legal action be
 taken against organizations and individuals violating its 'decency precepts." The
 Morals Commission was closed by presidential decree in January 1999.
 In December Parliament passed a new law on advertising which limits the
 amount of advertising to 20 percent in the print media and to 25 percent in the
 broadcast media. This legislation will affect the revenue of the independent media;
 therefore, a lawsuit is being prepared to test its constitutionality.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides citi-
 zens with the right to assemble freely; however, while the Government generally re-
 spect this right, officials, including those at local levels, sometimes use regulations
 that require registration of rallies and demonstrations to inhibit this right.
 Permits are required for public marches and gatherings but are routinely avail-
 able. Rallies and demonstrations are held regularly in front of the Government
 Building and in other places. In the summer, while adopting changes to the pension
 law, elderly persons held several demonstrations to protest a proposed increase of
 the pension eligibility age for both men and women. This proposal was coupled with
 cuts in payments to working pensioners. In 1997 and 1998, some peaceu protests
 took place outside the President's office, mostly consisting of pensioners protesting
 late pension payments and market venders protesting tax enforcement.n August
 supporters of the Asaba newspaper demonstrated for several hours at the White
 House (the central facility for the operation of the executive branch) without inci-
 
 
 1346
 
 dent to protest the eviction of the newspaper from its quarters in an MNB-owned
 building. The newspaper successfully located new facilities and is still in operation.
 The law requires official written permission for holding assemblies, rallies, and dem-
 onstrations. Persons who seek -permission to demonstrate against the wrongful ac-
 tions of authorities always must ask permission from those same authorities.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association; however, while the Govern-
 ment generally respects this right, at times local authorities have inhibited it in
 practice.
 The 1991 Law on Public Organizations, which includes labor unions, political par-
 ties, and cultural associations, requires registration of these organizations with the
 Ministry of Justice. Excessive caution by some officials is a contributing element for
 the delay some organizations are experiencing in registering. Ultimately, all organi-
 zations have been able to register, with the exception of a Uighur organization with
 the stated goal of creating an independent Uighur state in northwest China.
 In October the Ministry of Justice revoked the registration of the KHRC on the
 grounds that its registration application contained falsified documents. The revoca-
 tion came while the chairman of the KHRC was lobbying against the October ref-
 erendum. Subsequently, the KHRC was invited to reregister, but its chairman has
 declined to do so. The group continues to operate despite its unregistered status (see
 Section 4).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution and the law provide for freedom of reli-
 gion and the right of all citizens to choose and practice their own religion; however,
 the Government at times infringes on these rights. The Government does not sup-
 port any one religion and expressly forbids the teaching of religion (or atheism) in
 public schools.
 In 1996 the Government created a State Commission on Religious Affairs, offi-
 cially in order to promote religious tolerance, protect freedom of conscience, and
 oversee laws on religion. The Commission quickly became active and has overseen
 the registration of 224 religious institutions of which 188 are Christian denomina-
 tions. In 1997 the President signed a decree that required all religious organizations
 to register with the Commission. Under the new regulations, each congregation
 must register separately. As previously, if a group wishes to own property, open
 bank accounts, and otherwise engage in contractual activities, it must become a
 legal entity by registering with the Ministry of Justice. In practice the Ministry has
 never registered a religious organization without prior registration by the Commis-
 sion. There were no known instances during the year of the Commission refusing
 attempts by religious groups to register although registration has been slow on occa-
 sion.
 The Church of Jesus Christ resubmitted registration papers to the Commission.
 Previously, registration with the Commission was denied because the Church did
 not have a street address or a building to carry out its activities. At the beginning
 of September, it received a letter from the procurator's office informing it of criminal
 charges against the Church for "long-term noncompliance with the law on registra-
 tion of religious organizations." The Commission of Religious Affairs initiated the
 charge. After church leader Vasily Kuzin explained to the procurator's office that
 all the papers for registration had been filed with the Commission at an earlier
 date, the procurator requested clarification from the Commission. The Church was
 registered with the Commission in November, and it purchased a building to be
 used for its office, which is now being renovated.
 According to the Commission on Religious Affairs and the main office of the Sev-
 enth Day Adventists, the Naryn Baptists and the Kyrgyz Seventh Day Adventists
 both are now registered with the Commission. The Baptists have been since 1997
 and the Seventh Day Adventists in December 1997.
 Religious leaders note with concern that the Commission frequently uses the term
 "national security" in its statements. The MVD often plays a leading role on various
 religious questions. They also worry that traditional religious groups could use ref-
 erences to "preserving interconfessional accord" to prevent smaller churches from
 registering. Both Christians and Muslims have expressed concern about the State's
 apparent intention to play a more intrusive role in religion. Ethnic Kyrgyz Christian
 congregations appear to face special barriers, as do some Muslim congregations with
 foreign support. A small Jewish congregation meets in Bishkek without a rabbi. The
 group also organizes informal cultural studies and humanitarian services, chiefly
 food assistance for its elderly.
 A Roman Catholic Church in Bishkek functions unhindered. The Seventh Day Ad-
 ventist Church operates six churches in Bishkek, as well as several elsewhere in the
 country, without apparent hindrance.
 A Russian Orthodox Church in Chaldovar in the northern Chuy-Tokmok region
 was closed for failure to register. The state Commission on Religious Affairs claimed
 
 
 1347
 to have requested the necessary documents nine times from the Church's head,
 Vladimir Klipenshteyn, but he purportedly did not comply with the registration re-
 quest. Subsequently, Klipenshteyn was dismissed by Russian Orthodox Church au-
 thorities, who cited religious differences. Following his dismissal, church authorities
 sent a letter of apology to the Commission, which then registered the Church.
 Muslim leaders complain that the Commission on Religious Affairs makes deci-
 sions about religious events without consulting them. The Government considers
 radical Islam, whose followers it labels "Wahhabis," a threat to the country's stabil-
 ity. In late 1997 and throughout 1998, the Government intensified its campaign
 against orthodox Islamic believers. In April and May, approximately three ethnic
 Uighurs were arrested for possession of illegal weapons and Wahhabi video-
 cassettes; two were acquitted at trial and the third convicted and sentenced to pris-
 on. In December 1997, the MNB created special units to control the activities of
 Wahhabis and other religious sects.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Countr, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In general Government policy allows free travel within and outside the
 country; however, certain Soviet-era policies continue to complicate internal migra-
 tion, resettlement, and travel abroad. Under the Soviet-era law still in force, citizens
 need official government permission (a "propiska") to work and settle in a particular
 area of the country. Strictly speaking, the propsiska affords the right to reside in
 a given city or region. In addition home and apartment owners legally can sell their
 property only to buyers with such permission. In practice many employers tradition-
 ally have refused to provide employment to any applicant residing illegally. How-
 ever, this law has not been enforced recently. People now move within the country,
 purchase homes, and sell businesses without hindrance.
 There is no law on emigration. Administrative procedures permit movement of
 people; however, citizens who apply for passports must present a letter of invitation
 from the country they intend to visit or to which they intend to immigrate. They
 also need an exit visa. However, there were no reports that citizens, after presenting
 such a letter, were denied a passport or an exit visa. A Soviet-era law prohibits emi-
 gration within 5 years of working with "state secrets." No one is believed to have
 een barred from emigration under this statute during the year.
 Emigrants are not prevented from returning to the country, and there is report-
 edly a small but steady flow of returnees.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. During 1997 the International Organization for Migration opened a regional
 headquarters in Bishkek, in part because of the cooperative attitude of government
 officials. The issue of first asylum did not arise in 1998.
 There were no reports of the forced return of persons to countries where they
 feared persecution or expulsion of those having valid claim to refugee status, except
 in the 1997 case of Uighur nationalists who fled from China. At that time, 20 or
 more Uighurs were detained and returned to China (or remanded to the Chinese
 embassy) for alleged visa or passport irregularities, without being processed as refu-
 gees. Clearly, at least some of these Uighurs considered themselves to be refugees
 since they applied for refugee status. However, the authorities regarded only a few
 of them to be refugees, and all of those were refused on technicalities. The UNHCR
 is continuing to study the Uighur situation but has taken no public position. During
 the year, the MNB sometimes arrested Uighurs on ill-defined charges.
 The UNHCR has assisted two groups of Tajik refugees to return to Tajikistan
 during the year.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, but in practice citizens' ability to do so is limited.
 The Constitution mandates presidential elections every 5 years. There is a two-
 term limit. The President was reelected to a second term in 1995 in a multi-
 candidate election marred by irregularities. Parliamentary elections also are held
 every 5 years. In 1995 citizens elected a new Parliament in elections marred by
 irregularities. In 1996 a referendum was held that amended the Constitution to re-
 distribute power within the Government. The referendum violated the Constitution
 in force at the time and the Law on Referendums. Voter apathy was high, and turn-
 out was low. The results were reminiscent of the Soviet era with a reported turnout
 of 98 percent. Ballot stuffing was rampant, and family voting apparently was wide-
 spread.
 The October constitutional referendum on land privatization, the structure of the
 Parliament, and the budget process also was marred by serious irregularities. The
 
 
 1348
 Government's claim that 96 percent of voters participated in the referendum was
 not in accord with participation rates witnessed by local and international observ-
 ers. Observers also noted the persistent problem of family voting. The Government
 designed the ballot so voters had to vote either in favor of all five amendments or
 against all five. This procedure created a dilemma for voters who were opposed to
 the provision for the privatization of land, which was very unpopular, but favored
 the other four, less controversial amendments. The referendum further enhanced
 the power of the executive at the expense of the legislature.
 The amendments approved in the 1996 referendum further strengthened the for-
 mal power of the President and his advisers, who dominate the Government. The
 Parliament and the judiciary tend to be subordinate to the executive branch but
 show increasing signs of independence, such as the Parliament overriding presi-
 dential vetoes. In comparison with 1996, when the Parliament passed 66 laws, it
 passed 158 laws in 1997 (of which the President signed only 143), and in 1998 it
 passed 159 laws, all of which the President signed. The President signed 131 (some
 were left over from 1997.) In April 1997, the Parliament overrode a presidential veto
 on a bill allowing a no-confidence vote on any government minister (not just the
 Prime Minister). In December 1997, the Parliament delayed passage of the 1998
 budget bill until reaching a compromise with the executive branch, but there was
 no comparable confrontation this year. The overwhelming majority of local govern-
 ment officials are not elected but are appointed by the President.
 Political parties remain weak. There were 18 registered political parties; some,
 such as the Ata Meken and Asaba, were inactive. None of the winners of four par-
 liamentary seats in 1997 by-elections or those in the spring by-elections had a party
 affiliation. Likewise, parties nominated very few candidates. Of the members of Par-
 liament, fewer than half (46 of 105) claims party affiliation. There are 12 parties
 represented in Parliament, but voting seldom proceeds along strict party lines.
 Women and most ethnic minorities are underrepresented in government and poli-
 tics. Only 3 of 105 parliamentary deputies are women. In 1997 the Deputy Prime
 Minister for Social Issues as well as the Ministers for Labor and Justice were
 women, but following a reorganization in the spring, the position of Deputy Prime
 Minister was abolished. A man was appointed Minister of Labor, and a woman was
 appointed Minister of Justice. This woman is the only senior female executive
 branch official. The Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court is also a woman. A
 women's group has been formed to recruit, advise, and campaign for female can-
 didates in the next parliamentary election. Russians and Uzbeks are underrep-
 resented in government positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups generally operated without government restric-
 tion, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases, and Govern-
 ment officials sometimes were responsive to their views. However, the KHRC, a vig-
 orous organization that began protest activity during the campaign prior to the Oc-
 tober 17 referendum, found itself deregistered immediately before the referendum.
 The Ministry of Justice reported that it deregistered this group at the General Proc-
 urator's request because of irregularities in the group's initial registration. The Min-
 istry later invited the group to reregister (see Section 2.b.). At year's end, the KHRC
 had not reregistered but continued to operate.
 Activists sometimes allege that harassment originates within government circles.
 The fact that such harassment sometimes is featured prominently in the govern-
 ment press, or announced by the President's press secretary, lends credence to such
 claims.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for the rights and freedom of individuals and prohibits
 discrimination, including on the basis of language. The Government expresses a
 strong commitment to protecting the rights of members of all ethnic, religious, and
 linguistic groups, as well as those of women, but in practice has a mixed record.
 Women.-Research conducted in 1996 on violence against women showed a notice-
 able increase in such incidents since independence. Activists note that rape is be-
 coming more common, with authorities often ignoring such attacks. Government sta-
 tistics indicate that annually there are 400 to 450 crimes against women, but many
 crimes never are reported due to psychological pressures, cultural restrictions, and
 apathy by law enforcement officials. The Government has not devised a program to
 deal with this problem, and the number of shelters for battered women is not in-
 creasing to meet the need. One shelter of relatively long standing in Tokmok is
 
 
 1349
 searching for appropriate funding or a sponsor. The Umut (Hope) Center opened in
 January 1997 to provide women and children with basic protection as well as with
 psychological, legal, and medical counseling. In March 1997, at the initiative of the
 Damond Association, the Shans crisis center for women opened in Bishkek, provid-
 ing a crisis hotline and personal psychological, legal, and medical counseling for bat-
 tered women and girls. In June 1997, the NGO Tendesh opened a crisis center in
 Naryn with a hotne to support women affected by violence. It provides psycho-
 logical, legal, and medical assistance. Another center (Sezim) opened in April in
 Bishkek with a staff of lawyers, psychologists, and doctors, and operates a crisis hot-
 line for the public. Staff members conduct training, debates and seminars on wom-
 en's rights, and family planning.
 For example, during the 2 years of its activity, the Umut Center has organized
 biweekly discussions and training for women to advise and counsel them of their
 rights. It provides 10 days of emergency shelter, clothing, and meals for battered
 women as well as employment counseling and legal services. The director attributed
 the rise in numbers of women visiting the shelter to the country's severe economic
 crisis that has led to increased violence toward women; 62 percent of women visiting
 the shelter are unemployed.
 Trafficking in women and girls, mostly to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates,
 is a growing problem. Several media articles have raised public awareness. After
 consultation with tourist companies and security officials, the Government issued a
 decree to attack the problem. The Ministry of Tourism and Sports is monitoring all
 reported cases of trafficking in women. However, there are reports that officials may
 receive bribes in exchange for forged travel documents for the women. Russian bor-
 der guards operating on the Tajik border also allegedly were complicit in trafficking.
 The law gives equal status to women, and they are well represented in the work
 force, in the professions, and in institutions of higher learning. Women are promi-
 nent in law, medicine, accounting, and banking. They also play an active role in the
 rapidly growing nongovernment sector. Nonetheless, recently deteriorating economic
 conditions have had a severe effect on women, who are more likely to lose their jobs.
 It is estimated that women account for 58 percent of the unemployed, and women
 with children under the age of 16 account for 67 percent of unemployed women.
 Women make up the majority of pensioners, who are also in worse condition than
 previously as inflation has eroded pensions, which often are paid late. Women's
 groups express general concern about the situation of rural women. There are ap-
 proximately 100 women's advocacy NGQ's operating in the country with 20 located
 in rural areas. With the end of Communism, traditional attitudes toward women are
 reassertin themselves strongly in the countryside, where women are relegated to
 the role of ife and mother, and educational opportunities are curtailed. The declin-
 ing status of women is supported by general date from donor organizations working
 in this sector. Data indicate women are becoming less healthy, more abused, less
 represented in government, less able to work outside the home, and less able to dis-
 pose of their earnings independently.
 Family law prohibits divorce during pregnancy and while a child is younger than
 1 year. A special expert counsel under the State Commission on Family, Women,
 and Youth Issues reviewed all legislation for a gender perspective and submitted his
 recommendations to Parliament. The findings demonstrate that while women s
 rights are supported by legislation, the principle of women's equity is not always
 observed. Family law legislation was passed in a  summer; however, by year's end,
 the law had not been implemented.
 Children.-iThe socioeconomic situation does not effectively ensure decent living
 conditions for children. Basic needs for shelter, food and clothing are seldom met.
 After independence vaccine-preventable diseases such as diphtheria, polio, and mea-
 sles reemerged. A range of serious nutrition-related problems affects a large number
 of children, especially in rural areas. Traditional social safety measures are now in-
 adequate to cope with the social pressures affecting families, and in major cities,
 children regularly are observed begging or selling cigarettes. There are increasing
 reports of abandonment due to parents' lack of resources to care for children.
 Education is compulsory for the first 9 years, and the country has 97 percent lit-
 eracy rate. However, the education system has suffered material and financial hard-
 ships, and conditions continue to deteriorate due to an acute shortage of budgetary
 and material resources.
 Human rights groups and the Kyrgyz Children's Fund (KCF) monitor the condi-
 tion of children. Human rights groups note the children who are arrested usually
 are denied lawyers. Police often do not notify parents of the arrest, and neither par-
 ents nor lawyers generally are present during questioning, despite laws to the con-
 trary. Children often are intimidated into signing confessions, and sometimes are
 placed in cells with adult criminals to frighten them.
 
 
 1350
 In practice children have restricted rights to travel abroad until the age of 16. Be-
 fore that age, they are not entitled to their own passports and usually travel only
 when accompanying a parent in whose passport the child's data are recorded.
 The KCF is concerned about the growing number of street children, many of
 whom have left home because of abusive or alcoholic parents. Although numbers are
 hard to estimate, a 1-day sweep in 1997 through Bishkek led to a count of 700 chil-
 dren of school age working during school hours. Similar conditions also occur in
 other urban centers, as well as in the countryside. The KCF has opened 2 shelters,
 1 in Bishkek (for approximately 30 children) and 1 in Osh, to provide food, clothing,
 and schooling to such children. The "Ak Zhol" (Bon Voyage) center founded by a
 Dutch organization and UNICEF in 1996 was closed in August, due to a lack of
 funds. (The Ak Zhol center provided shelter and meals to homeless children in
 Bishkek, accommodating approximately 40 at any given time.)
 The forced marriage of underage girls has become more common, and the authori-
 ties often ignore this practice. Cultural traditions and social structures discourage
 victims from going to the authorities.
 Children in rural areas commonly are called upon to pick crops as needed on their
 family farms.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government passed the Law on Social Protection
 of Invalids in 1991 and adopted amendments on October 7. The newly adopted
 amendments provide for convenient access to public transportation and parking for
 the disabled; subsidies for mass media sources that make their services available
 to the hearing or visually impaired; and free plots of land to construct a home.
 Social facilities for the mentally disabled are strained severely, as budgets have
 fallen and workloads remain heavy. In one program facilitated by foreign volun-
 teers, local high school students have begun to visit special institutions, such as
 those for the mentally disabled.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-There are reported complaints of discrimina-
 tion in the treatment of citizens who are not ethnic Kyrgyz. The most recent statis-
 tical data reflect the following ethnic percentages: 61.2 percent are Kyrgyz; 14.9 per-
 cent are Russians; 14.4 percent are Uzbeks; 1.1 percent are Tatars; .3 percent are
 Germans; and others are 8.1 percent. Members of the minorities allege discrimina-
 tion in hiring, promotion, and housing. They complain that government officials at
 all levels favor ethnic Kyrgyz.
 Russian speakers (those who do not speak Kyrgyz) also allege that a ceiling exists
 in government employment that precludes their promotion beyond a certain level.
 The representation of ethnic Kyrgyz atsenior and intermediate levels of government
 is disproportionately high. This fact gives credence to perceptions that career oppor-
 tunities in government are limited for those who are not ethnic Kyrgyz.
 The Constitution designates Kyrgyz as the. state language, but it provides for
 preservation and equal and free development of Russian and other languages used
 in the country. In 1996 Russian also was declared, by presidential decree, an "offi-
 cial" language for some purposes. However, lawyers and other officials noted that
 no legislation referred to official languages, so the status of Russian was no clearer
 than previously. In 1997 a draft law declaring Russian an official language was de-
 clared constitutional by the Constitutional Court. To date, however, the law has
 been stymied in Parliament. Nevertheless, as a result of these efforts to improve the
 status of Russian, as well as difficult economic conditions in Russia, Russian emi-
 gration has ,declined significantly, with some ethnic Russians returning. University
 education is carried out largely in Russian (although Kyrgyz instruction is available
 in some departments in some universities, where textbooks are available), so that
 Russian-language capability~remains an important skill for those who wish to pur-
 sue higher learning.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 Labor Law provides for the right of all
 workers to form and belong to trade unions, and. there is no evidence that the Gov-
 ernment has tried to obstruct. the formation. of independent unions. The Federation
 of Trade Unions of the Kyrgyz Republic (The Federation), successor to the former
 official union, remains the only trade union umbrella organization in the country,
 although unions are not required to~belong to it. The Federation forms one part of
 a bilateral commission, along with the Cabinet. Each year the two parties sign an
 agreement on "cooperation." The Federation leadership is changing, and some prop-
 erties are being sold; however, there were no significant changes in membership or
 property sales during the year. There is one small independent union, the Union
 of-Entrepreneurs and Small Business Workers, whose membership reached approxi-
 mately 80,000. Precise numbers for the Federation's membership are not available,
 but it is significantly larger than other unions.
 
 
 1351
 
 The Federation has been critical of government policies, especially privatization,
 and their effect on working class living standards. The Federation still regards itself
 as being in a process of transition, during which it is adjusting its relations with
 the Government, with other unions in the countries of the former Soviet Union, and
 with other foreign unions. Growing numbers of smaller unions are not affiliated
 with the umbrella organization.
 The law calls for practices consistent with international standards.
 While the right to strike is not codified, strikes are not prohibited. There were
 no retaliatory actions against strikers, nor were there instances of abuse generally
 directed at unions or individual workers. There were small strikes of short duration
 by miners, teachers, doctors, and nurses over unpaid salaries. Each of the strikes
 was resolved when the Government agreed to pay a portion of the arrears.
 The law permits unions to form and join federations and to affiliate with inter-
 national trade union bodies. Since independent unions are still in their infancy, no
 meaningful affiliation with international trade union bodies has taken place.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law recognizes the right
 of unions to negotiate for better wages and conditions. Although overall union struc-
 ture and practice are changing only slowly from those of the Soviet era, there is
 growing evidence of active union participation in state-owned and privatized enter-
 prises. The Government sets the minimum wage, and then each employer sets its
 own wage level.
 The law protects union members from antiunion discrimination, and there were
 no recorded instances of discrimination against anyone because of union activities.
 There are Free Economic Zones (FEZ's) that can be used as export processing
 zones. The minimum wage law does not apply to the approximately 3,000 workers
 in ordinary FEZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law forbids forced or compul-
 sory labor, as well as forced or bonded labor by children, and it is not known to
 occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for employment is 18 years. Students are allowed to work up to 6 hours
 per day in summer or in part-time jobs from the age of 16. The law prohibits the
 use of child labor (under the age of 16); the Ministry of Education monitors enforce-
 ment. However, families frequently call upon their children to work to help support
 the family (see Section 5). Forced and bonded labor by children is prohibited and
 is not believed to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government mandates a national mini-
 mum wage at a level theoretically sufficient to assure a decent standard of living
 for a worker and family. The legal minimum wage is about $16.50 (365 soms) per
 month. In practice even the higher median wage is considered insufficient to ensure
 a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The Federation is responsible
 for enforcing all labor laws, including the law on minimum  wages. Minimum wage
 regulations largely are observed. However, enforcement of labor laws is nonexistent
 in the growing underground economy. Market forces help wages in the unofficial
 sector to keep pace with official wage scales.
 The standard workweek is 41 hours, usually within a 5-day week. For state-
 owned industries, there is a mandated 24-hour rest period in the workweek.
 Safety and health conditions in factories are poor. Despite the recent improvement
 in economic growth, the previous deterioration in enforcement of existing regula-
 tions continued to hamper investment to improve health and safety standards. A
 1992 law established occupational health and safety standards, as well as enforce-
 ment procedures. Besides government inspection teams, trade unions are assigned
 active roles in assuring compliance with these measures, but the previous economic
 deterioration in the country has made the compliance record of businesses uneven.
 Workers have the legal right to remove themselves from unsafe working conditions,
 and workers who choose not to work in an unsafe environment may find employ-
 ment elsewhere. In practice, refusal to work in situations with relatively high acci-
 dent rates or associated chronic health problems could result in loss of employment
 but only if informal methods of resolution failed.
