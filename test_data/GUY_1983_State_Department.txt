 GUYANA
 Guyana is ruled by President Forbes Burnham and his People's
 National Congress Party, which came to power through the
 British-supervised elections of 1964, the last free elections
 in the country. Constitutionally, Guyana is a republic with a
 president, parliament, independent judiciary, and multiparty
 system. Since independence, the ruling party has consolidated
 political power in the hands of Afro-Guyanese, who constitute
 some 43 percent of the population, compared with 51 percent who
 are Indo-Guyanese. Race is one of the most important factors
 in determining a person's position in Guyana.
 The survival of the Burnham government is based on the security
 forces composed of the Guyana Defense Force, the People's
 Militia, and the police, which are 95 percent Afro-Guyanese.
 Since independence the political scene has been marked by
 fraudulent elections, wholesale emigrations, frustration of the
 educated and politically aware middle class, and repression of
 the political opposition.
 Since 1974 when Burham declared the supremacy of his party over
 all other Guyanese institutions, there has been little
 distinction between the ruling party and the Government. The
 two main opposition parties are the People's Progressive Party,
 which has a rural Indo-Guyanese base, and the Working People's
 Alliance. The Burnham Government has harassed the opposition
 and kept it weak, fragmented, and ineffective by arrests,
 police searches, and other legal procedures.
 A developing country, Guyana has a population of about
 800,000. Approximately 90 percent of the population is crowded
 into 10 percent of the land along the fertile coastal strip.
 The Guyanese economy includes private, public, and cooperative
 sectors; the last two are dominated by the governing party
 through political patronage. The economy is dependent upon the
 export of bauxite, sugar, and rice. During 1983, shortages of
 essential food imports resulted from a decline in foreign
 exchange earnings and the Government's subsequent policy of
 restricting imports.
 In 1983, Guyana's human rights record did not improve. Major
 areas of concern to observers of human rights were police
 harrassment and misconduct, use of the security forces for
 political control, and infringement of the freedoms of press
 and of assembly.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1  Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 No political killings occurred in Guyana in 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no politically motivated disappearances, clandestine
 detentions, or abductions in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Beatings by the police to elicit confessions in criminal cases
 are common, but beyond this torture is not a tool of political
 
 
 593
 control. The authorities have generally not responded publicly
 to allegations of torture and mistreatment. The frequency and
 detail of the allegations of those involved suggest that there
 has been a serious decline in discipline and standards in the
 Guyanese police force.
 As a result of Guyana's economic crisis, the physical
 conditions within prisons have deteriorated in recent years.
 Jails are filthy and overcrowded. Short term detainees in
 Guyana's prisons are not fed; long term prisoners are poorly
 fed.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Burnham Government continued'arbitrarily to detain for
 brief periods both ordinary citizens and members of the
 political opposition without stating charges or upon charges
 that appeared flimsy. The National Security Act authorizes
 searches without a warrant and preventive detention for up to
 three months without charges. The police also detain
 opposition leaders on charges of doubtful validity for short
 periods of time. The detentions and ensuing litigation are
 time-consuming and expensive. The courts have frequently
 dismissed charges with obviously political motivations, but
 this has not prevented the Government from attempting to use
 the legal system, including the police, for political
 purposes. There are no secret detainees in or summary exiles
 from Guyana.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As a former British colony, Guyana-maintains the common law
 system and legal procedures used by the British, and almost all
 the Guyanese judiciary were.trained in the United Kingdom.
 Guyana has a functioning bail system, and defendants are
 accorded fair public trials and are represented by counsel.
 Timely charges are presented and appeals can be made to higher
 courts. There are no special courts for political security
 cases nor any political prisoners.
 The Guyanese Bar, most of whose members are Indo-Guyanese, has
 criticized the Burnham Government for ignoring ethical
 standards in the administration of justice. The Indo-Guyanese
 have also complained that relatively few of them have been
 raised to the Bench. The Government through political
 patronage has instead appointed as judges mainly its
 Afro-Guyanese supporters. Still, judges of high integrity
 continue to sit on the Bench.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Wiretaps, mail interception, and physical surveillance are used
 by the security forces to monitor and intimidate political
 opponents of the Government. Authorities have also harassed
 the opposition under the provision in the National Security Act
 which allows searches without warrants. Public sector
 employees, who constitute 40 percent of the work force, are
 required to attend certain ruling party functions. School
 children are required by school supervisors, acting on the
 ruling party's orders, to participate in mass games, an
 activity originated by visiting North Korean advisers several
 years ago.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government controls the media both directly through
 ownership and indirectly through control of the importation of
 newsprint. The Government presents its views in the newspapers
 owned by it and the ruling party. There are also several
 independent weekly papers opposed to Burnham's Government which
 express their views without prior censorship. The Government,
 however, allocates to its papers a disproportionate amount of
 the scarce foreign exchange available for the importation of
 newsprint. Although the shortage of newsprint has affected
 both the Government-owned Chronicle and opposition press, the
 Government's refusal to permit the Catholic Standard to accept
 donated newsprint from overseas suggests that political motives
 are the true reason for restricting the importation of
 newsprint. In a similar case, the Government refused to turn
 over to the Guyanese Council of Churches a quantity of paper
 which the Council had properly imported into the country.
 Guyanese may receive printed materials from abroad, but no
 foreign exchange is available for subscriptions to foreign
 publications. The Caribbean Contact, a monthly regional
 newspaper with an anti-Burnham slant, published in Barbados, is
 sold locally without restriction.
 The only radio station in Guyana is owned by the Government.
 It broadcasts the BBC World News Service twice daily. Foreign
 stations can be heard on shortwave or mediumwave. The Guyana
 News Agency edits items which the Government media receive from
 wire services. Some radio interview programs allow criticism
 by the public of the Government.
 The Government holds that state-owned media should serve
 "developmental" needs. As a result, the Government media run
 few items unfavorable to it, they distort the news, and they
 limit their news gathering efforts.
 Several Working People's Alliance leaders teach at the
 University of Guyana, and opposition parties have organized
 student groups there. Some teachers critical of Government
 education policies, however, have been summarily fired without
 explanation.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government has prevented both the Working People's Alliance
 and some trade unions from exercising their constitutional
 right to assemble freely. Permission to hold public meetings
 has been denied the Working People's Alliance on at least six
 occasions in 1983. Leaders of this opposition party have been
 arrested numerous times for taking part in peaceful protests.
 The Trade Union Congress (TUC) is the umbrella organization for
 the Guyana labor movement with responsibility for centralized
 collective bargaining. The majority of unions affiliated with
 the Trade Union Congress who thus control the decisions of the
 TUC, are highly sympathetic to and responsive to policies and
 wishes of the Government. Although workers are free to join
 unions, a factor which dampens normal trade union activity has
 been the Government's authority to declare any strike a
 "political" strike and therefore illegal.
 
 
 595
 Individual unions have responded to pressures from the rank and
 file, most notably in May 1983. Two bauxite unions sponsored
 demonstrations to protest sporadic food shortages. The
 demonstrations soon spread to unions in the sugar industry.
 The union leaders hastily endorsed the action initiated by the
 rank and file. During the demonstrations, 24 workers, mainly
 officials of the bauxite union, were arrested. After a
 demonstration by 2,000 women who surrounded the police station,
 the workers were released. The state-owned bauxite company
 responded by cutting the work week to three days, which in time
 led to a six-week strike. When this ended, the company laid
 off 1,721 workers, including some of the union leadership.
 C. Freedom of Religion
 There is full religious tolerance in Guyana, 57 percent of
 whose population is Christian, 33 percent Hindu, and 9 percent
 Muslim. The Guyana Constitution guarantees freedom of thought
 and religion, including the right to change one's religion.
 There is no state religion. Foreign missionaries are permitted
 to enter the country to proselytize although some churches,
 especially the Roman Catholic Church, have expressed concern
 that not enough foreign clergy are allowed to enter the country
 to serve believers.
 The House of Israel, a para-military religious organization run
 by an American, David Hill, alias Rabbi Washington, has
 actively and sometimes violently participated in pro-Government
 demonstrations, while disrupting those of the opposition.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Guyana is guaranteed by the
 Constitution and in practice generally permitted by the
 Government. Travel to certain AmerIndian (aboriginal
 inhabitants of Guyana) reservations requires Government
 permission, which has sometimes been withheld from oppositon
 political figures, Catholic missionaries, foreign diplomats,
 and scholars, apparently'on political grounds. Opposition
 politicians in disproportionate numbers have also been stopped
 and searched at police roadblocks and upon entering and leaving
 the international airport.
 Guyanese are free to travel abroad and emigrate and to return
 to Guyana from abroad. During 1983 no Guyanese had his
 citizenship revoked or his passport taken away for political
 reasons.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 President Forbes Burnham and a small circle of associates rule
 Guyana in Cabinet sessions or closed meetings of the ruling
 party's inner leadership. In almost all matters, the President
 himself makes the final decision. The Burnham Government has
 ruled Guyana for nearly 20 years, using the form of a
 parliamentary democracy but not the substance. The party has
 employed the government apparatus to advance its aims and to
 maintain tight political control over many'activities of
 society. In the security forces, judiciaryand public service
 party loyalty is the road to advancement. Nearly half of the
 work force is employed in the public sector, which contributes
 
 
 596
 to their reluctance to criticize the ruling party in public,
 although most public sector employees voice their opinions
 freely in private.
 Ordinary Guyanese who do not support the ruling party are
 denied an electoral voice because no fair elections have been
 held since 1964. The several subsequent elections have been
 marked by chicanery, intimidation, and violence on the part of
 the ruling party. Opposition parties are able, albeit with
 some difficulty, to hold public political rallies, to organize,
 and to publish their papers. The majority of the people are
 frustrated by the lack of political and economic change.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigations of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights.
 Guyana is a signatory to international human rights agreements
 and conventions, including the U.N. Convenant on Civil and
 Political Rights. The Burnham Government is not active in
 international human rights forums. It allowed Amnesty
 International to send an observer to the treason trial in 1982
 of Ivan Sookram, a case which was dismissed. The Burnham
 Government is sensitive about its human rights image and does
 not admit to any violations. The government media have paid
 little attention to human rights matters, except for South
 African apartheid. The Government's domestic record on human
 rights is frequently criticized by opposition papers and
 broadsides.
 The Guyana Human Rights Association is a nongovernmental
 organization formed in late 1979 with support from trade
 unions, professional organizations, and churches. The
 Association monitors human rights violations and publishes
 periodic press releases and an annual report on human rights
 observance in Guyana. It gathers information from members,
 victims of human rights abuses, trade unionists, churchmen,
 other interested parties, official documents, and newspapers.
 The Association has been quite effective in drawing
 international attention to the human rights situation in Guyana.
 Some of the Association members are opponents of the Burnham
 Government, but to preserve the Organization's objective of
 neutrality political activists are discouraged from holding
 executive positions. The Association has been criticized in
 the Government media, but there has been no physical violence
 against human rights activists in Guyana. One prominent
 non-Guyanese member was fired from his teaching job at the
 University of Guyana.
 In its 1983 report, Amnesty International stated that it had
 sent observers to the political trials of Donald Rodney, who
 was accused in the death of his brother, a leading member of
 the Working Peoples Alliance, and Ivan Sookram, who was charged
 with training and arming a group for the overthrow of the
 Government. Rodney was convicted, and his case is pending
 further appeals. Sookram's case was dismissed by the courts
 and subsequently reinstituted several times before he was
 finally acquitted. In 1983 Freedom House rated Guyana "partly
 free."

 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 In 1981 Guyana's per capita Gross Domestic Product was $723.
 Its population estimated at 833,000 was growing at the rate of
 only 0.5 percent per year. Guyana's chronic foreign exchange
 shortage continued in 1983, forcing the Government to maintain
 its severe import controls and other measures such as
 propaganda to discourage the consumption of imported goods.
 The Burnham Government's attempt to "build socialism" in Guyana
 has led to negative growth; Government policies have inhibited
 the private sector, frightened both foreign and domestic
 investors, and discouraged the repatriation of Guyanese with
 skills, capital, and new technology. The cooperative sector is
 weak and dominated by the ruling party's bureaucracy. The
 heavily subsidized public sector is highly inefficient.
 Guyana is dependent on the export of rice, bauxite, and sugar
 for its foreign exchange. It has been hurt by lower prices for
 these exports, declining productivity, and high prices for
 essential imports.
 The dominant public issue in Guyana during 1983 was the
 shortage of food. In an attempt to conserve foreign exchange,
 the Burnham Government severely restricted imports, including
 many food items such as wheat. Despite official efforts to
 stop black market activities, imported banned food items remain
 available at steep prices. Opponents of the Burnham Government
 charge that food shortages have exacerbated the problem of
 widespread chronic malnutrition in Guyana. A study by the
 International Fund for Agricultural Development stated that
 there would have to be a three fold increase in the production
 of root vegetables to meet the caloric needs previously
 provided by imported foods such as wheat flour. Periodic
 shortages of milk, cooking oil, and margarine made their prices
 volatile. There were few wage increases during 1983, and most
 Guyanese have seen their purchasing power decline; many have
 become more dependent on low-priced rice for their daily diet.
 The provision of essential services such as water, electricity,
 sanitation, and health care also deteriorated considerably in
 1983. Although Guyanese have a life expectancy at birth of 70
 years, the infant mortality rate is 40.60 per 1,000 live
 births. The water and sewerage system in Georgetown breaks
 down frequently, as the city can not afford the capital
 investment needed to maintain it.
 Although the Government has been providing free education from
 nursery school to university since 1975, it has not allocated
 enough funds to maintain the standards of what was previously
 the best educational system in the region. Many school
 buildings are in poor condition, text and exercise books are in
 short supply, and the number of teachers has declined. In 1979
 the adjusted primary school enrollment rate was 100 percent for
 males and 98 percent for females. Guyana has an estimated
 adult literacy rate of 90 percent. The Government has been
 accused of politicizing the educational system, which critics
 cite as the principal cause of declining educational
 standards. Guyanese scores on standardized tests used in the
 Anglophone Caribbean were the lowest in the region, according
 to the Guyanese Human Rights Association. Ethnically, the
 Guyanese are 51 percent East Indian, 43 percent African and
 mixed origins, four percent Amerindian, and two percent
 
 
 598
 European and Chinese. For the most part, the Government
 provides social services in a nondiscriminatory fashion.
 However, the opposition has charged that the People's National
 Congress distribution outlets give preferential treatment to
 the party's Afro-Guyanese supporters. It has also accused the
 Government of discriminating in favor of Afro-Guyanese in the
 allocation of Government housing and loans from
 Government-owned banks. Most jobs in the large public and
 cooperative sectors are allocated through political patronage
 to the Afro-Guyanese who support the ruling party.
 Although the Government has emphasized the role of women in its
 developmental propaganda, and Burnham has appointed many women
 to prominent positions in politics and government, most
 continue to occupy the traditional Guyanese role of
 homemakers. Guyana remains a male-dominated society.
