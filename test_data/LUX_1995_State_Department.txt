 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy with a democratic parliamentary form
 of government. The role of the Grand Duke is mainly ceremonial and administra-
 tive. The Prime Minister is the leader of the dominant party in the popularly elected
 Parliament. The Council of State, whose members are appointed by the Grand
 Duke, serves as an advisory body to the Parliament. The judiciary is an independent
 branch.
 The Government effectively controls the security apparatus, which consists of po-
 lice and gendarmerie.
 Luxembourg has a prosperous market economy with active industrial and service
 sectors. The standard of living and level of social benefits are high.
 The Constitution and laws provide for the full range of human rights, and the
 Government respects these rights in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them. Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Govern-
 ment permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 The law stipulates that* jdicial warrants are required for arrests except in cases
 of hot pursuit. Within 24hours of arrest the police must lodge charges and bring
 the suspect before a judge. Suspects are not held incommunicado. They are given
 immediate access to an attorney, at government expense for indigents. The presid-
 ing judge may order release on hail.
 Exile is never imposed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. The independent judiciary is head-
 
 
 938
 ed by the Supreme Court, whose members are appointed by the Grand Duke. De-
 fendants are presumed innocent. They have the right to public trial, and are free
 to cross-examine witnesses and to present evidence. Either the defendant or the
 prosecutor can appeal a ruling; appeal results in a completely new judicial proce-
 dure, with the possibility that a sentence may be increased or decreased.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and
 press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. Print media are pri-
 vately owned. The privately owned national radio and television company has exclu-
 sive television broadcasting rights within the country. A new permit system allows
 establishment of other private radio stations. Radio and television broadcasts from
 neighboring countries are freely available.
 Academic freedom is fully respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Peligion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. There is no state religion, but the State
 pays the salaries of Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish clergy, and several
 local glvernments maintain sectarian religious facilities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees and does not expel those
 having a valid claim to refugee status. It has also allowed more than 1,800 persons
 from the former Yugoslavia who do not qualify for refugee status to remain in a
 temporary protected status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Luxembourg is a multiparty democracy. Suffrage is universal for citizens aged 18
 and above, and balloting is secret. National parliamentary elections are held every
 5 years.
 Women are active in political life. Ten of 60 Members of Parliament and 3 mem-
 bers of the Cabinet are women. The mayors of several major municipalities, includ-
 ing the capital, are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groupa operate without government restriction. Government offi-
 cials are cooperative aid responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits racial, sexual, or social discrimination, and the Government en-
 forces these provisions. Blatant societal discrimination occurs only rarely.
 Women.- Neither society nor the Government iz tolerant of violence against
 women, and the government prosecutes persons accused of such. The organization
 that assists women in distress reports an average of 300 calls, 160 walk-ins, and
 38 residential admissions per year in recent years. In addition, there are 150-200
 cases of sexual abuse in an average year.
 Women enjoy the same property rights as men. In the absence of a prenuptial
 agreement, property is divided equally upon dissolution of a marriage.
 The law mandates equal pay or equal work. To date there have been no work-
 related discrimination suits. Working women constitute 36.2 percent of the work
 force (1994 data). Since 1988 the average annual increase in employment for women
 has been 4.6 percent, compared to an increase of 3.1 percent per year for males, but
 the rate is not =table across age groups. In January 1995, the Government created
 a new Ministry for the Promotion of Women in order to encourage a climate of equal
 treatment and opportunity in fact as well as law.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates in strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. The Ministry of Youth and the Ministry of Family oversee implementation of
 the Government's programs for children. Child abuse does not appear to be wide-
 
 
 939
 spread, and laws against child abuse are enforced. The Association for the Preven-
 tion of Child Abuse, a government organization created in 1984, estimates there
 may be some 300 cases a year. The Association works closely with other social serv-
 ice organizations and maintains a hot line for victims or witnesses.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the prvision of other state services. The law does not
 directly mandate accessibility for the disabled, but the Government pays subsidies
 to builders to construct "disabled-friendly" structures. Despite government incen-
 tives, only a modest proportion of buildings and public transportation have been
 modified to accommodate people with disabilities.
 The Government helps disabled persons obtain employment and professional edu-
 cation. By law, businesses and enterprises with at least 25 employees must fill a
 quota for hiring disabled workers an must pay them prevailing wages. The quota
 is fixed according to the total number of employees, and employers who do not fulfill
 them are subject to sizable monthly fines. There have been no known complaints
 of noncompliance.
 NationalIRaciallEthnic Minorities.Although foreigners constitute over 30 per-
 cent of the total population, antiforeigner incidents remain infrequent. Local and na-
 tional councils for foreigners were elected to promote the integration of foreigners
 under a 1993 law and to advise on issues concerning foreigners.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association All workers have the right to associate freely and
 choo-e their representatives. About 65 percent of the labor force is unionized. Mem-
 ber iip is not mandatory. Unions operate free of governmental interference. The
 two largest labor federations are linked to, but organized independently of, major
 political parties. The law prohibits discrimination against strikes and strike leaders,
 and a labor tribunal deals with complaints on these matters.
 The Constitution provides all workers with the right to strike except for govern-
 ment workers providing essential services such as police, armed forces, and hospital
 personnel. Legal strikes may occur only after a lengthy conciliation procedure be-
 tween the parties; the Government's National Conciliation Office must certify that
 conciliation efforts have ended for a strike to be legal. A legal 4-week strike by tilers
 over collective contract disputes was ended following personal mediation by the
 Prime Minister, averting a general strike by construction workers. This was the first
 legal labor strike in over 2 years. There have been no illegal strikes since 1979.
 Unions maintain unrestricted contact with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for and pro-
 tects collective bargaining, which is conducted in periodic negotiations between cen-
 tralized organizations of unions and employers. Enterprises having 15 or more em-
 ployees must have worker representatives to conduct collective bargaining. Enter-
 prises with over 150 employees must form joint works councils composed of equal
 numbers of management and employee representatives. In enterprises with more
 than 1,000 employees, one-third o the membership of the supervisory boards of di-
 rectors must be employees' representatives.
 The law provides for adjudication of employment-related complaints, and it au-
 thorizes labor tribunals to deal with them. A tribunal can impose a fine on an em-
 ployer found guilty of antiunion discrimination, but it cannot require the employer
 to reinstate a worker fired for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and neither occurs.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits employment of
 children under age 15 andrequires children to remain in school until age 16. Ap-
 prentices who are 15 or 16 years old must attend school in addition to their job
 training. Adolescent workers under age 18 receive additional legal protection, in-
 cluding limits on overtime and the number of hours that can be worked continu-
 ously. The Ministries of Labor and Education effectively monitor the enforcement
 of national child-labor and education laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-The law provides for minimum wage rates at
 levels that vary according to the worker's age and number of dependents. The mini-
 mum for a single worker over age 18 is approximately $8.22 per hour (Lux F
 246.69). Supporting a family is difficult on the minimum wage, but most employees
 earn more than the minimum.
 National legislation mandates a workweek of 40 hours. Premium pay is required
 for overtime or unusual hours. Employment on Sunday is permitted in continuous-
 process industries (steel, glass, and chemicals), and for certain maintenance and se-
 curity personnel; other industries have requested permission for Sunday work,
 
 
 940
 which the Government has granted on a case by case basis. Work on Sunday, al-
 lowed for some retail employees, must be entirely voluntary and compensated at
 double the normal wage; and employees must be given compensatory time off on an-
 other day, equal to the number of hours worked on Sunday. The law requires rest
 breaks for shift workers and limits all workers to a maximum of 10 hours per day
 including overtime. All workers receive at least 5 weeks of paid vacation yearly, in
 addition to paid holidays.
 The law mandates a safe working environment. An inspection system provides se-
 vere penalties for infractions. The Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labor, and
 the Accident Insurance Agency of the Social Security Ministry, carry out their in-
 spections effectively.
 No laws or regulations specifically guarantee workers the right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment,
 but every worker has the right to ask the Labor Inspectorate to make a determina-
 tion, and the Inspectorate usually does so expeditiously.
 THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
 The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), which became independ-
 ent in 1991 following the breakup of Yugoslavia, is a parliamentary democracy. The
 first postindependence multiparty elections were held in October 1994. International
 monitors judged them to be generally free and fair despite numerous procedural
 irregularities and complaints by the opposition parties. In October President Kiro
 Gligorov was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt by car bomb. Constitu-
 tional mechanisms for appointment of an acting President functioned smoothly after
 the attack.
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs oversees a security apparatus that includes uni-
 formed police, border police, and the state intelligence service. A civilian minister
 controls the ministry, and a parliamentary commission oversees operations.
 FYROM was the poorest of the Yugoslav republics, and its economy was closely
 tied to the other republics, especially Serbia. Conflict in the region and sanctions
 imposed on Serbia-Montenegro, along with the problems of transition to a market
 economy, have led to severe economic difficulties. In February 1994, Greece imposed
 a trade embargo in a dispute over the country's name, flag, and constitution, vhich
 contributed to a sharp drop in the gross domestic product. The two Governments
 agreed in September to resolve some of their differences, leading to a lifting of the
 trade embargo.
 The Constitution provides for fundamental human rights and the Government
 generally respects them in practice. There are occasional reports of police abuse of
 prisoners.
 The Government closed a number of independent media outlets in the second half
 of 1995, saying that it was simply introducing order in a chaotic broadcast milieu.
 However, it has not yet set up a proper regulatory framework.
 Minorities, including Albanians, Turks, and Serbs, raised various allegations of
 human rights infringements and discrimination. Ethnic Macedonians fill a dis-
 proportionate number of positions in state institutions, including formerly state-
 owned companies. Government promises to boost the number of minorities in these
 institutions have not been implemented, except for the conscript ranks of the armed
 forces. An attempt by the ethnic Albanian community to open an Albanian-language
 university was declared illegal by the Government.  e overnment's use of police
 in February to close one university building resulted in a violent clash that left one
 demonstrator dead and nearly 30 demonstrators and policemen inured. Several peo-
 ple, including the rector of the university and the head of the I-Ielsinki Committee
 in Gostivar, were arrested after the incident, charged, and convicted with inciting
 to riot, despite a lack of evidence linking them directly to the disturbance. The Gov-
 ernment has agreed in principle to most minority demands, but has done little to
 implement them, citing resource constraints as the reason.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government officials.
 On February 17, a demonstrator was killed in a violent clash between ethnic Al-
 banians and police who were sent in to close a private, "unauthorized" Albanian-
 language university (see Sections I.e. and 2.b.). The Ministry of Internal Affairs
 
 
 941
 claimed after an investigation that the demonstrator was hit by a bullet from a
 handgun fired by someone in the crowd, not from a police AK-47 assault rifle. How-
 ever, a credible report from a nongovernmental organization (NGO) concluded that
 the wounds on the body were probaly from an AK-47.
 On October 3, a remote-controlled car bomb seriously injured President Kiro
 Gligorov. Two persons died in the attack, and a number were injured. By yearls end,
 President Gligrv was reovering from his injuries and had resumed a limited offi-
 cial schedule. The investigation continued at year's end.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punshment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such treatment and punislment. Informed sources report
 that mistreatment in prisons is rare. However, police occasionally use excessive
 force during and following the arrest of criminal suspects.
 Prison conditions are generally acceptable. Prisoners complain about unpalatable
 food and lack of exercise, but there are few if any reports of abuse by prison authori-
 ties (who are separate from the police).
 In March following a prison takeover, television footage-including that broadcast
 by state television--showed prisoners being led by police officers from the prison
 roof. Out of sight of the cameras, the sounds of beatings were audible- thereafter,
 bloodied prisoners were led out by the police, once again in full view of the cameras.
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs apologized after a September incident in which
 police used excessive force to break upa late-night party in Skopje.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or E xle.-There were no confirmed reports of arbi-
 trary arrest. Opposition political. parties alleged police harassment of their mem-
 bers, but there have not been any clear, confirmed cases. There is no systematic use
 of detention as a form of nonjudicial punishment. Incommunicado detention is not
 practiced, although the 24-hour dea  ne for filing of charges and notification to
 courts after arrests is not always met.
 The Constitution states that a person must be arraigned in court within 24 hours
 of arrest and sets the maximum duration of detention pending trial at 90 days. The
 authorities must inform detainees of their legal rights and the reason for the arrest
 or detention. The accused is entitled to contact a lawyer at the time of arrest and
 to have a lawyer present during police and court proceedings. Indigents are provided
 with legal counsel
 According to human rights observers and criminal defense attorneys, police often
 violate the 24-hour requirement and deny immediate access to an attorney. Al-
 though the law requires warrants for arrests, this provision is also sometimes ig-
 nored, and the warrant issued only some time after the arrest.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Z-Constitutionally the courts are autonomous and
 independent. Municipal courts district courts and a supreme court form a three-
 tiered system. A Constitutional Court deals with matters of constitutional interpre-
 tation. Almost all trials appear to be uninfluenced by political considerations, al-
 though there is a credible perception that bribery is not uncommon in the courts.
 The Constitutional Court has a mandate to protect human rights, but has not taken
 action in any case in this area. Parliament has yet to pass implementing legislation
 to establish a people's ombudsman to defend citizens' constitutional and legal rights.
 Ten ethnic Albanians who were convicted in the politically charged Albanian
 Paramilitary case in mid-1994 were all released in August. Two of them were par-
 cloned and the other eight released after having served at least one-third of their
 sentence with good behavior.
 After the Mala Rechica (Albanian university) incident in which a demonstrator
 was killed in February, six people were tried administratively and sentenced to 30
 days for disturbing the public order. Three others were charged with "calling on the
 people to resist" or "interfering with the police in the performance of their official
 duties." Albanian university =retor" Fadil Suleimani was convicted on the first
 charge and sentenced to 30 months in jail on the basis of a statement he made 2
 days before the incident. He had called on ethnic Albanians to demonstrate in favor
 of the university 2 days before the disturbance occurred. He had not called for any
 violent action and was not on the scene. His codefendant, a human rights activist,
 received a 6-month sentence on the same charge. Ethnic Albanian political leader
 Nevzat Halili was convicted and sentenced to 18 months for interference with the
 police despite a lack of strong evidence that he had done anything more than ob-
 serve the events in Mala Rechica. All those convicted were eventually released on
 bail pending appeal.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to privacy of person, home, and correspondence is provided for in the Constitu-
 tion. Although no instances of abuses were substantiated, officials of an ethnic Ser-
 
 
 bian political party charged that their telephones were tapped and their privacy vio-
 latedby the state security service. They also complained about an incident in which
 police entered the party offices and demanded that a portrait of Serbian leader
 Slobodan Milosevic be taken down.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution forbids censorship and pro-
 vides for freedom of speech, public access, public information, and freedom to estab-
 lish private media outlets. However, a number of private broadcast stations were
 shut down by the authorities, including local affiliates of the Voice of America and
 the British Broadcasting Corporation. The Government maintains that it is merely
 closing unlicensed stations to bring order to a chaotic broadcasting scene. However,
 it has not set up a proper regulatory mechanism for the broadcast media. Members
 of the media, and the political opposition believe that the Government is shutting
 private outlets to restrict the flow of information and opinion. Members of national
 minorities charge that minority-language stations are targeted disproportionately.
 While there is no clear pattern of government suppression of the private media, it
 is difficult for the Government to refute such charges in the absence of a trans-
 parent regulatory regime.
 In July the Government said that it would not renew the accreditation of the local
 correspondent for the VOA's Albanian service, alleging that she had engaged inpo-
 litical and even criminal activities incompatible with er status as a journalist. The
 Government did not detail its charges beyond stating that the journalist was in-
 volved in promoting the Albanian-language university in Tetovo, which the Govern-
 ment considers illegal. There were other cases in which journalists working for Al-
 banian-language media were taken into custody by police, harassed, and in one case
 deported. A correspondent for an opposition weekly and a correspondent for an inde-
 pendent Turkish-language paper also had their credentials rescinded.
 There are several daily newspapers in Skopje, and numerous weekly political and
 other publications, including weeklies published by opposition groups. An Albanian
 and a Turkish newspaper are distributed nationally and subidizedby the Govern-
 ment. The bulk of newspapers and magazines published in the country are govern-
 ment owned and government oriented. Opposition parties have made alleged *ov-
 ernment control and manipulation of the media a major theme of their complaints
 about the present Government. The state-owned media report such charges, and in
 general do give some coverage to the statements and press conferences of opposition
 parties. The overall balance of coverage, however, is in favor of the Government.
 The leading newspaper publisher is a government company that owns the only
 modern, high-speed printing plant in the country, as well as most newspaper kiosks.
 Opposition groups complain that they are charged high prices for the services of the
 printing plant. N    apr can be imported from Bulgaria, Serbia, Albania, and
 Greece only with the permission of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
 The former Ministry of Information has been downgraded from a ministry to a
 secretariat, but it continues to decide on accreditation of journalists and to be in-
 vlved in closing independent media outlets.
 Academic freedom is respected in theoryand practice. However, an attempt by the
 ethnic Albanian community to open an Albanian-language university was declared
 illegal by the Government (see Sections L.a., i.e., and 2.b.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights. Advance notification to the police is required, but the authorities do
 not appear to abuse the requirement. Opposition rallies occur on a regular basis.
 Political parties and NGO's are required to register with the Interior Ministry in
 compliance with a comprehensive political party registration law. Some 44 political
 parties are registered, including ethnically based parties of Albanians, Turks, Serbs,
 and Roma.
 An attempt by the ethnic Albanian community to open an Albanian-language Uni-
 versity was declared illegal by the Government. On February 17, police action to
 close a university building resulted in a violent clash that left 1 demonstrator dead
 and nearly 30 demonstrators and policemen injured, after police opened fire in re-
 sponse to rocks and lumber thrown by members of the crowd.
 Several people, including the rector of the university and the head of the Helsinki
 Committee in Gostivar, were arrested after the incident and charged and convicted
 with inciting to riot (see Section i.e.). In October the Government publicly
 reaffirmed its position that the university is illegal by refusing to grant its students
 conscription deferments (available to state university students).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution specifically provides for freedom of reli-
 gion for "the Macedonian Orthodox Church and other religious communities and
 groups."
 
 
 The Government does not generally interfere with the practice of religion. How-
 ever the refusal of the Serbian Orthodox Church to recognize the independence of
 the Macedonian Orthodox Church has led to difficulties for Serbs who wish to wor-
 ship in their own church. On a number of occasions the Government has refused
 Serbian Orthodox priests permission to enter the country.
 While only the Macedonian Orthodox Church is mentioned by name in the Con-
 stitution referring to freedom of religion, it does not enjoy established status. How-
 ever, members of other religious communities credibly charge that the Government
 favors it based on the ease with which it can obtain property and building permits
 for new construction. During 1995 at least two or three houses that did not have
 such permits and were being used as mosques were destroyed by the authorities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are permitted free movement within the country as well as the
 right to leave and return. These rights may be restricted for security, public health,
 and safety reasons, but are fully respected in practice.
 The law on citizenship is highly restrictive, requiring, for example, 15 years of
 residence for naturalization. This has left some people who were living legally in
 the country at the time of independence without citizenship. This particularly af-
 fects ethnic Albanians who had moved from other parts of Yugoslavia before mde-
 pendence. As citizens of the predecessor state living in the territory of the FYROM
 at the time of independence, they believe that they have a right to citizenship.
 Ethnic Albanian political leaders also charge that Ministry of Internal Affairs offi-
 cials responsible for making citizenship determinations discriminate against ethnic
 Albanian applicants. The officials are said to make more demanding documentary
 requirements and to fail to act on applications expeditiously. There are also credible
 charges that officials demanded bribes in return for a favorable decision. However,
 the same kinds of citizenship problems also affected many ethnic Macedonians.
 While the country accepted a number of refugees from Croatia and Bosnia at the
 start of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, it restricted entry of additional refu-
 gees in 1992, and now accepts only citizens and other former residents for repatri-
 ation. There was one report that the Government had deported refugees approved
 by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees during_1995, but the Government says
 that they were sent on to asylum states in Western Europe.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens elected a president by popular vote for the first time in October 1994.
 At the same time they chose a new Parliament in the second multiparty elections
 in the country's postwar history, the first since independence. Opposition groups
 charged the Government with massive fraud and boycotted the second round. Inter-
 national monitors, under the auspices of the Council of Europe and the Conference
 on Security and Cooperation in Europe, found the elections to be generally free and
 fair despite widespread irregularities attributed largely to careless organization.
 Ethnic minorities, including Albanians, Turks, Serbs, and Roma, have political
 parties to represent their interests. Minorities complained that the political struc-
 tures were biased against them. Albanian-majority districts had far more voters
 than Macedonian ones, thus calling into question the "one-person, one-vote" prin-
 ciple. The ethnic Turkish and Serbian communities were disappointed because the
 failure of the previous Parliament to pass a new election law providing for 20 seats
 to be elected by proportional representation meant that their dispersed members
 could not elect a candidate on an ethnic basis. Despite such shortcomings, access
 to the political process was available to all citizens. However, ethnic Albanians com-
 plained that discrimination against them in citizenship decisions effectively
 disenfranchised a large portion of their community (see Section 2.d.).
 The 120-member unicameral Parliament governs the countiy. The Prime Min-
 ister, as head of government, is selected by the party or coalition with a majority
 in the assembly. He and the other ministers may not be members of Parliament.
 The Prime Minister is formally appointed by the President, who is Head of State,
 chairman of the Security Council, and commander in chief of the armed forces.
 The opposition party boycott of the second round of parliamentary elections in Oc-
 tober 1994 resulted in a dominant role in Parliament for the government coalition
 parties. The composition of the Parliament limits the ability of the opposition par-
 ties, and their constituencies, to make their views known concerning matters before
 Parliament. There is little or no use of public hearings or public commissions on
 pending legislative matters.
 No formal restrictions exist on the participation of women in politics and govern-
 ment. There are 2 female ministers (out of 20) and 4 female Members of Par iament
 (out of 120).
 
 
 944
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups and ethnic community representatives meet freely with for-
 eign representatives without government interference. The Forum for Human
 Rights, a nongovernmental group, operates freely. The Government does not oppose
 visits or investigations by international human rights groups. The mediator on eth-
 nic issues of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia has visited the
 country frequently to discuss various issues with representatives of minority groups
 and with the Government.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for all citizens regardless of sex, race,
 national or social origin, political or religi ous beliefs, property, or social status.
 Women.-Women's groups report that there is widespread violence against
 women. Cultural norms work against the reporting of such violence: there has not
 been a single case of criminal charges being brought on these grounds for 15 years.
 A hot line established in 1994 received some 900 calls during 1995.
 Women enjoy the same legal rights as men. Macedonian society, in both the Mus-
 lim and Christian communities, remains traditionally patriarchal, and advancement
 of women into nontraditional roles is limited. Some prominent professional women
 are nevertheless now visible. Women's advocacy groups include the Union of Mac-
 edonian Women and the League of Albanian Women in Macedonia.
 Children.-The Government is committed to providing education and health care
 for children. Its ability to provide social services is under resource constraints, and
 the provision of schooling beyond eighth grade and modern medical care is further
 hampered by poor transportation infrastructure in mountainous rural areas. There
 is no pattern of societal abuse against children.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The population of 2.2 million is composed of
 a variety of national and ethnic groups, mainly Macedonans, Albanians, Turks,
 Roma, Serbs, and Vlakhs. All citizens are equal under the law. The Constitution
 provides for the protection of the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity
 of minorities, including state support for primary and secondary (but not university
 level) education in minority languages.
 Ethnic tensions and prejudices are evident. The Government is committed to a
 policy of peaceful integration of all ethnic groups into society but faces political re-
 sistance and the persistence of popular preju dices in the lower levels of administra-
 tion. Moreover, the economic crisis makes it difficult for the Government to find re-
 sources to fulfill minority aspirations, such as mre education in minority lan-
 guages. The main political opposition is more ethnocentric than the governing coali-
 tion and has objected to some modest steps to meet the educational needs of minori-
 ties.
 Popular prejudices can affect the relationship that ethnic minorities have with the
 Government. For example, in a village in the Skopje area, Macedonian and Serbian
 parents prtested the use of the local school building for teaching children in Alba-
 nian as well as Macedonian despite the fact that the Albanian-language classes
 were on a separate shift.
 Representatives of the ethnic Albanian community, by far the largest minority
 group with 22.9 percent of the population, are the most vocal in charging discrimi-
 nation. Expressing concern about government manipulation of the data, the ethnic
 Albanian community boycotted a 1990 census. A census held during the summer of
 1994 to correct the situation was marred by thethhreat of a boyctt. A group of ex-
 perts from the Council of Europe monitored the census and were satisfied that it
 was carried out fairly an accurately, and that virtually all of the ethnic Albanian
 community took part. According to the census, Turks are 4 percent of the opu-
 lation, Rma 2.3 percent, and Srbs 2 percent. About 8,500 citiz ens declared them-
 selves as Vlakhs.
 Ethnic Albanians complain that there are not enough Albanian-language media
 outlets. Therare also complaints about the small amount of broadcast time in the
 Albanian language on state television (1 2 hours daily), although this represents an
 increase over the past year. The Government is seeking international financing to
 open a third state-owned television channel for inry-anguage broadcasts. In the
 meantime, the growth of private media outlets has helped fill some of the gap.
 Underrepresentation of ethnic Albanians in the military and police is another
 grievance of the community. Even in areas dominated by ethnic Albanians, the po-
 lice force remains overwhelmingly ethnic Macedonian, with only 4 percent ethnic Al-
 banians. The Ministry is making efforts to recruit ethnic Albanian police cadets, but
 maintains that it is very difficult to attract qualified candidates.Ethnic Albanian

 leaders allege that there is continued discrimination against those who do apply.
 There has been more improvement regarding the proportion of ethnic Albanians re-
 cruited into the military. Military service is a universal male obligation and it ap-
 pears that most young men, whatever their ethnic origin, now fulfill it. he propor-
 tion of ethnic Albanians in the ranks is now estimated at 25 percent, although in
 the officer corps it is lower. A plan to take in minority members as 25 percent of
 the first military academy class this year was not realized, according to the Ministry
 of Defense, because there was an insufficient pool of qualified applints. The first
 ethnic Albanian was promoted to general in mid-year.
 Albanian-language education is a crucial issue for the ethnic Albanian commu-
 nity: it is seen as vital to preserve Albanian heritage and culture. Almost all ethnic
 Albanian children receive 8 years of education in Albanan-language schools. Only
 about a third of them go on to high school, partly because of the lack of available
 classes and partly because the traditional nature of ethnic Albanian society means
 that many families in rural areas see no need to educate their children, especially
 girls beyond the eighth grade.
 Ethnic Turks also complain of governmental, societal, and cultural discrimination.
 Their main complaints center on Turkish-language education, and media. One long-
 running dispute has been over the desire of parents who consider themselves Turk-
 ish to educate their children in Turkish despite the fact that they do not speak
 Turkish at home. The Education Ministry refuses to provide Turkish-language edu-
 cation for children who do not speak Turkish. The parents have banded together to
 hire teachers of their own, but this kind of private education is not legally author-
 ized.
 Serbs also complain of discrimination, alleged censorship of the Serbian press, and
 an inability to worship freely in the Serbian Orthodox Church (see Section 2.c.).
 Little tension is evident between Roma and other citizens of the country. There
 has been some progress on providing supplementary Roma-language education, but
 no call for a full curriculum is apparent. There is some Roma-language broadcast-
 number of Macedonian Muslims and Bosnian Muslims are also present in the
 country.
 The Government has established a 13-member Council on Ethnic Relations with
 representatives of the country's main ethnic groups. The Council has not, however,
 played an active role. Despite underlying ethnic tensions, few incidents have oc-
 curred apart from the February 17 university confrontation.
 People With Disabilities.--Special programs to meet the needs of the disabled
 exist, to the extent that government resources allow. Discrimination on the basis of
 disability is forbidden by law. There are no laws or regulations mandating acces-
 sibility for disabled persons.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Constitution provides citizens with the
 right to form trade unions. There are restrictions on this right for the military, po-
 lice, and civil service. The Council of Trade Unions of Macedonia (SSM) is the suc-
 cessor organization to the old Communist labor confederation. It maintains the as-
 sets of the old unions and is the Government's main negotiating partner on labor
 issues. While its officers may tend to oppose strikes because ofthe legacy of the
 past, they appear to be independent of the Government and committed to the inter-
 ests of the workers they represent. An Association of Independent and Autonomous
 Unions was formed in 1992, and independent unions have been allowed to organize
 without harassment by the Government or official unions. The disastrous economic
 situation in the country led to many brief strikes in 1995. These were undertaken
 mainly by employees of state-owned companies, many of whom were receiving their
 pay months late or were being laid off as the companies were privatized. The compa-
 nies, cut off by the Greek embargo from the new markets they had begun developing
 since the collapse of Yugoslavia, often simply did not have the money to pay their
 workers. In most cases, the workers and unions understood these  iculties and
 showed great restraint.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution implicitly
 recognizes employees right to bargain collectively. Collective bargaining is still in
 its infancy. Legislation in this area has yet to be passed by parliament.
 Official unemployment is about a third of the work force, and many people who
 are ostensibly employed are in fact furloughed. Even employed workers routinely re-
 ceive their salaries several months late.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Legal prohibitions against forced
 labor are observed in practice.

 d. Minimum Age of Employment of Children.-The constitutional minimum age
 for employment of children is 15 years. Younger children, however, are often seen
 peddling cigarettes or other small items or working in family-owned shops or on
 amily farms. Children may not legally work nights but are permitted to work 42-
 hour weeks. Education is compulsory through the eighth grade. The Ministries of
 Interior and Labor are responsible for enforcing laws regulating the employment of
 children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The average monthly wage in July was about
 $225 (denars 8,546). The minimum wage is, by Iaw, two-thirds of the average wage.
 The economic crisis meant that few workers could support a family on their wages
 alone and had to do additional work in the informal economy or draw on savings.
 Yugoslavia had extensive laws concerning acceptable conditions of work, including
 an official 42-hour workweek with a minimum 24-hour rest period and generous va-
 cation and sick leave benefits. FYROM adopted many of these provisions, including
 the workweek and rest period.
 The Constitution provides for safe working conditions, temporary disability com-
 pensation, and leave benefits. Laws and regulations on worker safety remain from
 the Yugoslav era. However, credible reports suggest that the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Work which is responsible for enforcing regulations pertaining to working
 conditions does not enforce them strictly.
 If workers have safety concerns, employers are supposed to address the dangerous
 situations. Should they fail to do so, employees may leave the dangerous condition
 without forfeiting their jobs.
