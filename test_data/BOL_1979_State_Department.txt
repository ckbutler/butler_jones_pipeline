 BOLIVIA
 Bolivia's past political instability has been an impedi-
 ment to economic and social progress and, therefore,
 at least partially responsible for the country's uneven
 record in terms of human rights observance. In 1977
 then President Banzer initiated a liberalization of
 virtually all major restrictions on human rights, releas-
 ing all reported political prisoners, allowing exiles
 to return, and scheduling elections for July 1978.
 This positive human rights momentum was not checked
 by the Pereda coup (August 1978) or the Padilla take-
 over (November 1978). While the first represented
 a brief interruption in the democratization process
 and the second was designed to put it back on track,
 both governments contributed to the improving human
 rights situation: General Pereda by abrogating the
 feared State Security Law, and General Padilla by over-
 seeing in July 1979, possibly the most democratic elec-
 tions in Bolivia's history.
 As none of the eight presidential hopefuls achieved
 the needed majority of the popular vote in the July
 1979 elections, the issue went before the Congress
 where, similarly, none of the three leading candidates
 succeeded in obtaining a majority. Finally, the Congress
 selected Senate President Walter Guevara Arze to serve.
 as interim president with new elections scheduled for
 May 1980.
 Guevara's interim Government came to an abrupt end
 November 1, 1979, when a group of military officers
 and civilians under the leadership of Army Colonel
 Alberto Natusch Busch seized the government. The Natusch
 Government responded to strong popular reaction against
 the coup and its interruption of the democratic process
 with the implementation of press censorship, a state
 of siege, and martial law. Protesting but unarmed
 civilians were confronted by undisciplined soldiers
 resulting in the death of approximately 200 persons,
 the wounding of some 200 others, and the unaccounted
 for disappearance of about 125 citizens. Popular dis-
 content, a seven-day strike by the Confederation of
 Bolivian Workers (COB), and Natusch's repressive measures
 hastened the demi'se of his regime.
 After Natusch's resignation on November 16, an agreement
 was reached between the Congress, the COB, and the
 Armed Forces appointing Chamber of Deputies President
 Lydia Gueiler as interim President. President Guevara,
 who had become a resistance symbol in hiding during
 the Natusch regime, returned to his former Senate posi-
 tion. Ms. Gueiler is to be Bolivia's interim president
 until the inauguration on August 6, 1980 of the winner
 of the 1980 elections, which are scheduled to be held
 on June 29.

 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The Bolivian Constitution prohibits torture and other
 forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The
 Padilla and Guevara administrations apparently respected
 this Constitutional guarantee; there were no reports
 of torture during their brief governments or during
 President Gueiler's administration. Allegations of
 torture during the short-lived Natusch regime are current-
 ly being investigated by the Permanent Assembly on
 Human Rights (PAHR), Bolivia's principal non-govern-
 mental organization promoting respect for human rights.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 No reports of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 were received during the Padilla or Guevara governments
 nor during the Gueiler government. There are allegations
 of beatings of political and labor leaders detained
 during the Natusch regime.
 The Bolivian Congress requested the PAHR on November 19
 to document all cases of persons killed, wounded, or
 missing as a result of Natusch's repressive meaures.
 The findings are expected to be made public.
 Although the Bolivian Constitution prohibits cruel,
 inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, PAHR
 representatives indicate that infractions occur. Accord-
 ing to the PAHR, policemen sometimes beat persons accused
 of common crimes during interrogation to force confes-
 sions. Most such detainees do not file complaints,
 however, presumably either because they are unaware
 of their civil rights or because they fear reprisals.
 The PAHR believes that only a few police officials
 engage in such practices, and it is attempting to docu-
 ment cases of mistreatment so that offending policemen
 can be punished.
 Most prisons in Bolivia are old and overcrowded. Sani-
 tary conditions are poor, and prisoners' diet is inad-
 quate. These conditions result in part from Bolivia's
 low level of economic development. Many prisoners,
 however, receive supplementary money, food, clothing
 and medicines from relatives or friends. Others manu-
 facture small items for outside contractors in exchange
 for money or food to supplement prison fare.
 Prisoners have no opportunity to become rehabilitated
 through learning job skills or improving their education
 while in prison. Prison officials recognize the problems
 in the present system, but indicate that lack of adequate
 funding precludes early improvement.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Padilla, Guevara, and Gueiler governments have
 not imprisoned persons for their political beliefs
 or activity. During the Natusch coup before press
 censorship was imposed, newspapers and the radio reported
 
 
 258
 the arrest of several labor leaders and politicians
 in various parts of the country. These people were
 held only briefly. Additional reports of similar short-
 term detentions appeared in the press after censorship
 was lifted. There have also been reports that as many
 as 125 people disappeared during this two-week period,
 the majority of whom are unaccounted for. There were
 no known political prisoners in Bolivia at the end
 of November, 1979.
 Persons are frequently arrested and held for brief
 periods without charge in Bolivia. Habeas corpus exists
 and is respected in practice. Occasionally, especially
 in serious criminal cases, a suspect is held longer
 than the 24 hours stipulated in the Constitution before
 being brought before a judge.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 I
 Persons arrested in Bolivia are entitled by law to
 a fair public trial. However, the judicial process
 moves slowly, with some criminal cases taking years
 to complete because of inherent faults in the judicial
 system -- antiquated procedures, shortage of qualified
 personnel, etc. Defendants may hire their own counsel,
 and may confer with them in private. Civil courts
 are independent of the military and civilians are not
 tried in military courts.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is constitutionally protected.
 There were no reports of invasions of the home during
 the Padilla, Guevara, or Gueiler governments. During
 the Natusch coup, however, illegal searches were made
 of the houses of some persons opposed to his takeover
 -- mainly labor leaders and politicians -- for weapons
 and for members of the Guevara "government in hiding".
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Bolivia remains an underdeveloped country. Nevertheless,
 despite recurring serious macroeconomic problems, the
 Government of Bolivia has succeeded in significantly
 improving the quality of life of its citizens. Since
 1975, successive governments implemented a five-year
 Economic and Social Development Plan emphasizing a
 rapid-growth, export-oriented strategy. The Plan's
 original goals included improving national income distri-
 bution (an OAS study indicates that 5 percent of the
 Bolivian population controls 31 percent of the national
 income), incorporating the rural (mostly Indian) popula-
 tion into the modern life of the country, and improving
 overall welfare through education, health, and agricul-
 tural programs. While Bolivia's worsening economic
 situation prevented the fulfillment of major elements
 of the Plan, World Bank figures showed that by 1979
 per capita GNP had reached $510 in 1978 dollars, up
 from $360 in 1975. The Gueiler Government in its first
 weeks implemented an economic stabilization program
 
 
 259
 which, if well carried out, can provide the basis for
 resumption of soundly-based long-term economic growth.
 Average life expectancy is 52 years. The nationwide
 annual death rate is estimated at 18.5 per thousand
 and the infant mortality rate for children under one
 year of age in rural areas at 235 per thousand. These
 figures are partially the results of communicable,
 respiratory, and gastrointestinal diseases and malnutri-
 tion among the population. These health problems persist
 largely because of inadequate financing and direction
 to improve the quality and distribution of health ser-
 vices. Of the rural population, 11 percent lives in
 areas which have adequate sewage disposal; 12 percent
 have access to potable water.                 ?
 An estimated 40 percent of the Bolivian population
 over the age of 15 is illiterate. In an effort to
 overcome this problem the Government provides a free
 public education system through the university level.
 Unfortunately, rural poverty forces many children to
 neglect their studies in favor of working to help support
 their families. Also, school sessions are often inter-
 rupted by labor strife or political activity.
 The lack of adequate housing is a serious problem.
 The majority of housing units in the major cities are
 substandard. Ruial families typically live in adobe
 dwellings without basic sanitary facilities. The poor
 environmental conditions accompanying such housing
 exacerbate sanitation and nutrition problems and other
 impediments to health.
 Government programs to fulfill basic human needs are
 hampered primarily by the lack of financial, human,
 and material resources. Although there have been oc-
 casional reports of corruption in the administration
 of some of these programs, it does not appear that
 corruption has been a major factor impeding their ef-
 fective implementation.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Under the Padilla and Guevara governments, there were
 no reports of violations of any of these freedoms,
 which are constitutionally guaranteed. Soon after
 assuming power, however, Colonel Natusch imposed press
 censorship, a state of siege, curfew, and martial law.
 After a crippling seven-day general strike called by
 the COB, Natusch agreed to lift these measures in ex-
 change for an end to the strike. The National Press
 Association (ANP), and the Vice President of the Bolivian
 Ecumenical Conference, among others, protested the
 press censorship and the silencing of several radio
 stations during the two week military take-over. Before
 the Natusch coup, the press in Bolivia exercised a
 degree of "self-censorship", ostensibly to avoid poli-
 tical controversy that could jeopardize the democratiza-.
 tion process.
 
 
 260
 Freedom of speech, the press, and assembly were restored
 by the Gueiler government. There are no restrictions
 on religious freedom.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement, travel, and emigration is constitu-
 tionally protected. Only under the two-week Natusch
 regime were there any new restrictions on travel and
 these were eliminated when President Gueiler took office.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political parties and labor unions have been able to
 operate freely since early 1978. In July 1979, eight
 political parties or coalitions participated in the
 general elections; none was the official party. Despite
 some allegations of electoral fraud by the contending
 parties and coalitions, it is generally accepted that
 the electoral court did its job well and that actual
 fraud in these elections was minor. All citizens 21
 years of age and older may vote.
 Traditionally, women have not enjoyed equal opportunity
 in Bolivia. However, this is changing. For example,
 before becoming interim President, Lydia Gueiler had
 been elected President of the Chamber of Deputies and
 awarded the Order of the Condor, Bolivia's highest
 decoration, for her political activities. Two women
 presently serve in the Congress, and two in the Cabinet.
 Labor unions exercise considerable power in Bolivian
 society, as evidenced by the general strike in early
 November, 1979 which contributed to the demise of
 the Natusch regime. Trade unions profess to maintain
 neutrality among political parties.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Permanent Assembly on Human Rights (PAHR) is Bolivia's
 principal non-governmental organization promoting respect
 for human rights. It maintains close contact with
 international human rights organizations, whose members
 often travel to Bolivia for consultations on the state
 of human rights. The PAHR is working for the ratifica-
 tion of UN human rights agreements to which Bolivia
 is not yet a party.
 Bolivia is the only Latin American country whose Parlia-
 ment has a Human Rights Committee in each House. As
 part of its effort to improve human rights observance,
 Bolivia became a party to the American Convention on
 Human Rights in 1979.
