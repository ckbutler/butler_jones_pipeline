 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a constitutional democracy with a federal _parliamentary form of gov-
 ernment and an independent judiciary. Citizens choose their representatives in peri-
 odic, free, and fair multiparty elections.
 The police are subordinated to the executive and judicial authorities. The national
 police maintain internal security. The army is responsible for external security.
 Austria's highly developed, market-based economy, with its mix of technologically
 advanced industry, modern agriculture, and tourism affords its citizens a high
 standard of living.
 The Government fully respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and
 judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse.
 There were occasional reports of abuse by police. The Government is taking serious
 steps to address violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kidling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits such practices, government statistics for 1995
 showed 615 complaints against police officials for illegitimate use of force, a de-
 crease of 61 compared with 1994. In six cases, police officials were convicted and
 required to pa fines. In nine cases, officers faced disciplinary proceedings, and in
 one case, the disciplinary proceeding was terminated. Of the people who filed com-
 plaints against the police, 23 were sued for slander and 15 were sued for resisting
 arrest.

 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards. The Government is a
 garty to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fun-
 amental Freedoms, which includes a provision for human rights monitoring mis-
 sions. In individual cases, investigating judges or prison directors have jurisdiction
 over questions of access to the defendant.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 In criminal cases the law provides for investigative or pretrial detention for up
 to 48 hours, except that in cases of charges of "aggressive behavior" an investigative
 judge may within that period decide to grant a prosecution request for detention up
 to 2 years pending completion of an investigation. The grounds required for such
 investigative detention are specified in the law, as are conditions for bail. The inves-
 tigative judge is required to evaluate an investigative detention at 2 weeks, 1
 month, and every 2 months after the arrest.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. There were no reports of political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice, although strin-
 gent slander laws tend to discourage reports of police brutality. Publications may
 be removed from circulation if they violate legal provisions concerning morality or
 public security, but such cases are extremely rare.
 Television and national radio are government monopolies, but they present di-
 verse points of view. A law passed in 1993 permits regional private radio stations,
 but implementation of the law was delayed due to legal challenges by unsuccessful
 applicants for licenses. After the Constitutional Court ordered the revision of radio
 frequencies and after complaints against the law were dropped in Styria and Salz-
 burg, two stations opened. The text of the law, with rewritten radio frequency rules,
 is under revision.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, except for Nazi organizations and activities (an
 exception stipulated also in the Austrian State Treaty of 1955). The law on the for-
 mation of associations states that permission to form an organization may be denied
 if it is apparent that the organization will pursue the illegal activities of a prohib-
 ited organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution generally provides for freedom of reli-
 gion of individuals, as laid down by the Treaty of St. Gormain. The status of reli-
 gious organizations, however, is governed by the 1874 "Law on Recognition" of
 churches. Religious recognition has wide-ranging implications, e.g., the authority to
 participate in the state-collected religious taxation program, engage in religious edu-
 cation, and import religious workers to act as ministers, missionaries, or teachers.
 Officially, 75.3 percent of the populace is Roman Catholic, and there are 12 other
 recognized religious organizations. For non-European Union missionaries or pastors,
 recognition is the key to residence and work. Some foreign Protestant churches have
 not qualified for religious recognition and have had to withdraw or scale back their
 services.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict movement, including emigration.
 Citizens who leave the country have the right to return at any time.
 Austria has signed the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees and its 1967
 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, but it subscribes to the "safe country"
 concept. Asylum seekers who have entered illegally are required to depart and seek
 refugee status from outside the country (a provision which is not always enforced).
 Individuals found to be true refugees by government authorities are not sent back
 to the countries from which they have fled.
 According to one NGO report, conditions in refugee detention centrs are very
 poor. Suicide attempts and hunger strikes have been reported in tese centers
 where detainees may sent up to 6 months in custody. The Government cooperates
 with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees n  CR)
 relying on UNHCR information to determine "safe" countries." Before the 1992 legal
 reforms the UNHCR played a more direct role in Austrian refugee decisions; today
 
 
 838
 the UNHCR has withdrawn to a more advisory and monitoring role. In this role
 the UNHCR continues to chide the Government over the safe country concept and
 the legal applicant rules, both of which appear to represent diversions from the Con-
 vention and its Protocol.
 At present Austria provides a "temporary protected status" which, although lim-
 ited in scope by time and nationality, could be considered "first asylum.n"
 Refugees from the former Yugoslavia arriving between April 1992 and July 1993
 were granted protected status, but this window has now closed. Since 1992 the Gov-
 ernment has granted refugee status only to several hundred individuals from the
 former Yugoslavia. The rest have remained under protected status, been absorbed
 through the normal immigration process, or remained illegally. Outside the influx
 from the former Yugoslavia, since passage of the 1992 law, the Government has
 granted refugee status to an average of 600 applicants yearly.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right peacefully to change their gov-
 ernment. Citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elec-
 tions held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Approximately 26 percent of the members of Parliament and 4 of 16 cabinet mem-
 bers are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. In some cases, they
 have been dissatisfied with the information authorities have supplied in response
 to specific complaints.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law provides for protection against any of these kinds of discrimination in
 employment, provision of welfare benefits, and other matters, and the Government
 generally enforces its provisions effectively.
 Women.-Official data for 1995 (the latest statistics available) show 12,554 re-
 ported cases of violence against women, of which 500 were rapes and 279 other sex-
 ual assaults. Police and judges enforce laws against violence; however, only about
 10 percent of abused women file complaints. The Government plans to expand police
 authority to enforce measures banning an abusive spouse from a previously jointly
 owned home or other places where the victim might be stalked.
 Most legal restrictions on women's rights have been abolished. Women are still
 prohibited by law from night work in most occupations. Although this ban is some-
 times used as a pretext for not hiring women, itis supported by the Women's Affairs
 Ministry and women's organizations. (Nurses, taxi drivers, and a few other occupa-
 tions are exempted from this ban.) According to a 1994 ruling by the European
 Court of Justice, a sex-based prohibition of nighttime work is not permissible. The
 Government has been granted a transition period until 2001 to adapt its legislation
 to gender-neutral European Union regulations and is due to report in 1997 on its
 progress.
 In addition to the federal Women's Affairs Ministry, a federal Equality Commis-
 sion and a federal Commissioner for Equal Treatment oversee laws prescribing
 equal treatment of -men and women. Sixty percent of women between the ages of
 15 and 60 are in the labor force. Despite substantial gains in women's incomes, they
 average 20 percent lower than those of men. Women are not allowed in the military.
 Although labor laws providing for equal treatment extend to women in the civil
 service, they remain underrepresented there. To remedy this, a 1993 law requires
 hiring women of equivalent qualifications ahead of men in civil service areas in
 which less than 40 percent of the employees are women; but there are no penalties
 for failure to attain the 40 percent target.
 Women may be awarded compensation of up to 4 months' salary if discriminated
 against in promotions because of their sex. The Labor Court can also award com-
 pensation from employers to victims of sexual harassment.
 Women's rights organizations are partly politically affiliated, and partly autono-
 mous groups. In voicing their concerns, they receive wide public attention.
 Children.-Laws protect the vast majority of children's rights established in inter-
 national conventions and in some respects go beyond them. Each provincial govern-
 ment and the federal Ministry for Youth and Family Affairs has an "Ombudsperson
 for Children and Adolescents" whos main function is to resolve complaints about
 
 
 839
 violations of rights of children. There is no societal pattern of abuse against chil-
 dren.
 Allegations concerning a suspected Austrian-Slovak child pornography ring in Au-
 gust led to strong public and political pressure to further tighten Austrian legisla-
 tion on child pornography. Pertinent legislation was last amended in 1994, when
 possession of child pornography videos was made a criminal offense.
 People With Disarbities.-isabled individuals are protected by law from discrimi-
 nation in housing, education and employment. The law requires all private enter-
 prises and state and federa government offices to employ 1 disabled person for
 every 25 to 45 employees, depending on the type of work. Employers who do not
 meet this requirement must pay a fee to the Government, and the proceeds help
 finance services for the disabled such as training programs, wage subsidies, and
 workplace adaptations. No federal law mandates access for the physically disabled;
 some public buildings are virtually inaccessible for those unable to climb stairs.
 NatonallRacial[Ethnic Minorities.-The Interior Ministry issued a report on
 rightwing extremism, which showed that in 1995 the number of complaints and re-
 ports of incidents of rightwing extremism, xenophobia, and anti-Semitism rose to
 621, which was 20 cases higher than in 1994. Eighty-nine cases resulted in court
 sentences.
 Small, loosely organized, rightwing groups are increasing their use of computers
 and international electronic networks. In 1995 criminal investigations were
 launched against three Austrians for spreading fascist and extreme rightwing prop-
 aganda through the Internet. At year's end, the cases are still pending with no ar-
 rests, prosecutions, or convictions. In late 1995, the Justice and Interior Ministries
 developed a joint proposal for legislation to expand the use of investigative tools,
 such as electronic eavesdropping and merging of databases, and to introduce protec-
 tion for defendants and witnesses who cooperate with investigative authorities. The
 proposal was controversial, and it is estimated that changes in the law will not
 occur before mid-1997.
 Religious Minorities.-In May a Jewish cemetery in Rechnitz was vandalized. In
 November unidentified vandals desecrated a Jewish cemetery in Hollabrunn. On
 December 18, "Wolfgang T' was convicted of desecrating the Jewish cemetery in
 Eisenstadt in 1993. A second suspect remains at large.
 Jewish community leaders praised the Government's auction of the "Mauerbach"
 collection, a compilation of art works originally owned by Austrian Jews, then seized
 by the Nazis, and later held by the Government. Following efforts to find the origi-
 nal owners, the Government auctioned about 8,000 art works with 88 percent of the
 proceeds going to the Austrian Jewish community for use in social projects.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to form and join unions
 without prior authorization, under general constitutional guarantees of freedom of
 association. In practice, trade unions have an important and independent voice in
 the political, social, and economic life of the country. Fifty-two percent of the work
 force was organized in 14 national unions, all belonging to the Austrian Trade
 Union Federation (0GB), which has a highly entralized leadership structure. Indi-
 vidual unions and the 06B are independent of government or political party control,
 although formal factions within these organizations are closely allied with political
 parties.
 Although the right to strike is not explicitly provided for in the Constitution or
 in national legislation, it is universally recognized. Historically, strikes have been
 comparatively few and usually of short duration. There were no strikes during the
 year. A major reason for the record of labor peace is the unofficial system of "social
 partnership" among labor, management, and government. At the center of the sys-
 tem is the Joint Parity Commission for Wages and Prices, which has an important
 voice on major economic questions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively. Almost all large companies, private or state-owned,
 are organized. Worker councils operate at the enterprise level, and workers are enti-
 tled by law to elect one-third of the members of the supervisory boards of major
 companies. Collective agreements covering wages, benefits, and working conditions
 are negotiated by the OGB with the National Chamber of Commerce andits associa-
 tions, which represent the employers. Wage and price policy guidelines are set by
 the Joint Parity Comnmission. A 1973 law obliges employers in enterprises with more
 than five employees to prove that job dismissals are not motivated by antiunion dis-
 crimination. Employers found guilty of this are required to reinstate workers. Labor
 and business representatives remain in disagreement over how to comply with the
 obligation under the International Labor Organization's Convention 98 to provide
 
 
 840
 legal protection to employees against arbitrary dismissals in firms with five employ-
 ees or fewer.
 Typically, legal disputes between employer and employees regarding job-related
 matters are bandled by a special arbitration court for social affais. The 0GB is ex-
 clusively responsible for collective bargaining. The leadership of the Chamber of
 Labor, the Chamber of Commerce, and the 0GB are elected democratically.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum legal working age
 is 15 years. The law is effectively enforced by the Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry
 of Social Affairs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated national minimum wage.
 Instead, nationwide collective bargaining agreements set minimums by job classi-
 fication for each industry. The generally accepted unofficial minimum gross income
 is $14,000 per year. Every worker is entitled to a variety of generous social benefits.
 The average citizen has a high standard of living, and even the minimum wages
 are sufficient to permit a decent living for workers and their families.
 Although the legal workweek has been established at 40 hours since 1975, more
 than 50 percent of the labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements
 that set the workweek at 38 or 38Y hours.
 Extensive legislation, regularly enforced by the Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry
 of Social Affairs, provides for mandatory occupational health and safety standards.
 Workers may file complaints anonymously with the Labor Inspectorate, which may
 bring suit against the employer on behalf of the employee, but this option is rarely
 exercised, as workers normally rely instead on the Chambers of Labor, which file
 suits on their behalf.
 The Labor Codeprovides that workers have the right to remove themselves from
 a job if they fear 'serious, immediate danger to life and health" without incurring
 any prejudice to their job or career.
