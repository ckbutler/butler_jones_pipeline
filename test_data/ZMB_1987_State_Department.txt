 ZAMBIA.
 Zambia has a one-party system of government with the President,
 Kenneth KaUnda, exercising predominant executive authority.
 He is advised by a Central Committee of party leaders and
 governs through a cabinet and a parliament. There is strong
 competition for parliamentary seats within the single-party
 structure, but all candidates for political office at any level
 must be members of the United National Independence Party
 (UNIP). Since 1964 a state of emergency has been in effect,
 under which the President has broad discretion to detain or
 restrict the movements of people, and law enforcement personnel
 have extraordinary powers to detain suspects and search homes.
 The Constitution also allows the National Assembly to suspend
 basic constitutional rights.
 Security forces are divided into three main groups. The
 Zambia Police, operating under the Ministry of Home Affairs,
 is generally responsible for maintaining law and order. It is
 divided into regular and paramilitary units. In 1986 laws
 creating a volunteer vigilante force composed primarily of
 party activists were enacted. The Zambian Intelligence and
 Security Service (ZISS) is charged with intelligence gathering
 and counterespionage responsibilities. Finally, the armed
 services are used increasingly for internal security,
 especially at checkpoints and roadblocks. Urban crime and
 smuggling are widespread and growing, severely taxing the
 limited capabilities of Zambia's police and military forces.
 Vigilantes and army units manning roadblocks have been the
 subject of frequent criticism by the public and press for
 their use of excessive force.
 Zambia's economy continues to be severely depressed due to
 factors such as high debt servicing, long-term low prices for
 the country's mineral exports, low agricultural production,
 and internal management problems. Also, the rapid rate of
 population growth is outstripping increases in productivity.
 There has been a continuing decline in the standard of
 living. For a number of years, Zambia has attempted to
 restructure its economy with the support of the International
 Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. In May President
 Kaunda cancelled the IMF program and announced Zambia's own
 interim plan which, among other features, placed a cap on
 servicing Zambia's $5.8 billion debt and proposed to address
 economic problems with the country's own resources.
 The human rights situation remained basically unchanged in
 1987. Individual rights, basic freedoms, and due process are
 generally respected, while some political rights are
 restricted. Continuing fears of South African efforts to
 destabilize Zambia have also affected the human rights
 situation. The external headquarters of the African National
 Congress (ANC) is located in Lusaka, and there are a number of
 South African and Namibian refugees in Zambia. On April 25,
 South African commandos raided alleged ANC targets in
 Livingstone. Several persons, mainly white foreigners, were
 detained as suspected South African agents.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no killings for which there was evidence of
 political motivation or government instigation.
 The South African commando raid on alleged ANC targets in
 Livingstone killed several persons and destroyed property.
 The Zambian Government reported that the dead were Zambian
 citizens who had no connection with the ANC.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of politically motivated
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, but there are credible
 allegations that police and military personnel have resorted
 to excessive force when interrogating detainees or prisoners.
 Alleged abuses reported during 1987 include beatings, the
 withholding of food, pain inflicted on various parts of the
 body, long periods of solitary confinement, and threats of
 execution.
 The courts have ordered investigations to ascertain if
 confessions or statements were made after torture or physical
 or mental mistreatment. In one documented case during 1987, a
 Lusaka High Court Commissioner threw out a statement in an
 espionage case which he said was obtained through torture. In
 the past, detainees have successfully sued the State for
 damages as a result of prison abuses.
 Zambian prisons are severely understaffed and unsanitary.
 Medical facilities are meager, but prisoners with serious
 medical problems are treated in public hospitals. Several
 foreigners who had been imprisoned for brief periods in Zambia
 have reported various abuses, including beatings, substandard
 food, and the absence of beds. One person also reported that
 juveniles were incarcerated with adults.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 A state of emergency has been in effect since independence in
 1964. Under the Preservation of Public Security Act, during a
 state of emergency the President has broad discretion to detain
 or restrict the movements of persons, and can order that
 persons be arrested and detained indefinitely. By law,
 presidential detainees are entitled to formal notification of
 the reasons for their detention within 14 days of arrest;
 publication of their detention in the government gazette;
 access to counsel; frequent visitation by family and
 colleagues; immediate representation to the detaining
 authority; and the right to seek judicial review of the
 detention order by an independent and impartial tribunal after
 1 year. The President is not legally bound to accept a
 tribunal's recommendation of release, if he still believes
 that the detainee poses a threat to national security.
 
 
 351
 ZAMBIA
 In practice, detainees have been released if the judicial
 tribunal so recommends.
 A few of.those detained in 1986 under presidential authority
 remain in detention along with an'additigonal*36 persons
 detainedfduring 1987. The'new detainees include 16 persons
 accused of edonomic sabotage.  (On November'19, the Zambian
 Supreme Court ruled that "economic sabotage" such as
 smuggling, hoarding, or black marketeering was a crime which
 threatened' ubliC security and therefore fell under the
 purview of the Preservation of Public Security Act.) Most of
 the detainees were seeking their release through court
 actions; 'but this'is a slow procesg which could take as long
 as several years- Detainees'can sue the State for unlawful
 detention and false imprisonment.
 The 23-year old state of emergency also gives law officers and
 defense personnel extraordinary powers. Police officers of
 assistant inspector rank and above may arrest without a
 warrant and detain a person for up to 28 days if the officer
 has reason to believe that grounds exist to.justify~a
 presideitial detention order. In theQry, police must provide
 the detainee ith'th6 ;easons for his detention within 14 days
 of arrest. 'S'cutity officers have broad powers to search
 suspects and their homes and sometimes act without warrants
 when lookini for:smugglers or illegal aliens.
 Slavery, involuntary servitude, and forced labor are
 prohibited by the Constitution. These prohibitions are
 observed in practice."
 ï¿½: -'Dexial of Fair Public Trial
 The Zambian judi 6al system c6nsists of a'Supreme Court with
 appellate powers and a series of lower courts, of which the
 High Court.is'the most important. Presidential detainees are
 not guaranteed public trials,'but the majority have been tried
 in public. The saf6girds of English.common law apply in
 cases not involving.presidential detainees. The Zambian
 judiciary has maintained its independence'from executive
 branch influence. Although the President has the power to
 appoint 'and -trahsfer judges, there appears to be no evidence
 that such ppwer has swayed court decisions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference wzith Privac', Family, tome, or
 Correspondence,
 The sanctity of the home is generally respected, except in
 isolated incidents relating to the state of emergency or to
 roundups of illegal aliens, In such cases, security forces
 often.enter the homes of suspects without search warrants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civ l Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 People speak openly on most subjects, and there is lively
 debate in Parliament on a wide range of political, economic,
 and social issues. However, direct negative comments
 concerning the Head of State, ,the concept of the one-party
 state, or the national philosophy, "Humanism," generally are
 not expressed in public, the Parliament, or the media.
 
 
 352
 ZAMBIA
 The media regularly report criticism of government activities
 expressed by sources ranging from elected officials to average
 citizens. The two national dailies are owned by the Government
 and the party, respectively, and television and radio are state
 owned. However, they carry substantial commentary critical of
 party and government performance. An independent biweekly
 paper, which is sometimes critical of official policies, is
 published by an association of churches, and two other
 independent papers focus on mining and financial subjects.
 While the possibility of censorship of foreign publications
 and news items exists, it is seldom invoked.
 Academic freedom is highly respected in Zambian society, and
 educators are outspoken in their commitment to an educational
 system free of government influence. There is little or no
 government influence in matters relating to curriculum,
 student selection, or faculty assignment.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There is a ban on all political activity outside the one-party
 structure. Police permits are required for meetings, rallies,
 or marches. These permits are issued routinely, unless the
 Government believes the proceedings are likely to be directed
 against local authorities. Zambia has a profusion of
 associations and professional groups which serve as unofficial
 pressure groups on various economic, political, and social
 subjects.
 Zambia has a history of strong labor union organizations,
 dating from the establishment of large copper mines during the
 1930's. Zambia's 18 national labor unions, which are organized
 by industry or profession, are all members of the Zambia
 Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU). Member unions defend worker
 interests, especially regarding wages and conditions of work,
 and have the right to bargain collectively with employers.
 Under existing legislation, strikes are permitted only after
 all other recourse has been exhausted. Virtually all strikes
 are illegal, since they almost always commence before the
 mandatory process of mediation has run its course. The
 Government normally has relied on persuasion and continued
 mediation to end strikes once they have begun. However, in
 April 1987, after a series of wildcat strikes, President
 Kaunda declared the Government would not tolerate further
 illegal strikes. He announced that workers in essential
 industries who went on strike would be arrested, while
 nonessential strikers would be fired. However, no action was
 actually taken against the workers.
 The ZCTU is not controlled by the party or Government, and
 union leaders frequently criticize government policy on such
 subjects as wages, economic policy, conditions of service, and
 labor representation in party and government organs. The ZCTU
 is democratic and regularly conducts open elections to select
 its leadership. It is active in the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) and is a member of the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution and
 has been publicly supported by President Kaunda. Zambia has
 no state religion, and adherence to a particular faith does
 not confer either advantage or disadvantage. Christian
 missionaries from a wide variety of faiths operate in the
 
 
 353
 ZAMBIA
 country. Jehovah's Witnesses are prohibited from
 proselytizing, but the sect functions openly, and its freedom
 to refrain from participating in various secular activities
 such as voting, singing the national anthem, and saluting the
 flag has been upheld-in the courts and supported by senior
 party leaders. Lay associations and religious youth groups
 operate independently of.party control or influence.
 d. Freedom of.Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Under the emergency legislation, the President may restrict
 the movement of persons within Zambia, although this authority
 is seldom used and was not used in 1987. The Goyernment also
 reservds the right'not to issue or to withdraw, passports to
 prevent foreign travel by persons whose activities are
 considered inimical to Zambian interests. In 1987 the
 Government withdrew the passports of two senior trade union
 leaders, Newstead Zimba and Frederick Chiluba. (The ILO
 Workers' Group criticized the withdrawal of Zimba's passport,
 alleging that it prevented his participation as a Deputy
 Worker Delegate on the ILO Governing Body.)
 Zambia hosts a large refugee/displaced person population that
 originates in several strife-torn southern African countries.
 The United Nations.High Commissioner for Refugees estimates
 that there are approximately 140,000 refugees and displaced
 persons in Zambia. The largest group of refugees totals more
 than 90,000 and is from Angola. Nearly 30,000 Mozambican
 refugees have also entered in recent years. In 1987 the
 Zambian Government began moving Mozambicans from border areas
 to a resettlement center in the Eastern Province. The Zambian
 Government operates two other large refugee resettlement
 centers, and the Southwest African People's Organization
 (SWAPO) operates one camp for Namibian refugees. The
 government policy is to offer refugees who arrived after
 September 1985 the option of moving to a resettlement center
 or returning to their country of origin. Although there have
 been allegations, there have not been any substantiated
 reports of forcible repatriations under that policy.
 Late in 1987, a few Angolan refugees were reportedly detained
 for suspicion of sympathy with the Angolan opposition force,
 the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
 (UNITA)'.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 Under the Constitution, Zambian citizens cannot change the
 party in power. That party, UNIP, has an estimated membership
 of less than 10 percent of the adult population. Power is
 concentrated in the hands of the President as leader of the
 party and Head of State. He plays a dominant role in
 determining the membership of Zambia's top executive
 institutions, the party Central Committee, and the Cabinet,
 although traditionally both bodies contain a general balance
 of regional and tribal representation.
 Candidates for political office at any level must be members
 of the party and are subject to close examination for
 suitability by senior party authorities. In practice, the
 political system is open to persons of somewhat divergent
 opinions, provided they are willing to work within the
 one-party structure and not challenge the President's
 
 
 354
 ZAMBIA
 preeminent position. In the latest parliamentary elections in
 1983, 760 candidates contested 125 seats; 40 incumbents were
 defeated, including 7 ministers of state.
 The National Assembly generally reflects constituent interests
 and sometimes thwarts or modifies executive branch policies
 and programs. A number of times in 1987 Members of Parliament
 spoke out against government expenditures, poor services, and
 economic reforms. The President and the Prime Minister
 publicly urged Members of Parliament to avoid confrontation
 with the Government, warning that appropriate action would be
 taken against those who made antiparty statements.
 Presidential and general elections are by universal suffrage.
 The numbering of ballots, which can be cross-checked against
 voter registration numbers, could potentially undermine the
 secrecy of the ballot.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There is no public record of the Zambian Government having
 been subject to such investigations during 1987. The
 Government neither encourages nor hinders inquiries or visits
 by human rights organizations. When Amnesty International
 urged the Government in 1986 to investigate allegations of
 torture, President Kaunda replied that no torture or
 ill-treatment had been inflicted on the South Africans and
 that their cases would be reviewed in accordance with the
 law. The Zambian Law Association is active in the human
 rights field.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The 7.0 million population comprises more than 70
 Bantu-speaking tribal groupings. Economic and social needs
 are met on a generally nondiscriminatory basis in Zambia.
 Under statutory law, women generally enjoy full equality with
 men, and women participate increasingly in Zambia's social,
 economic, and political life. They hold some senior positions
 in the party, Government, and judiciary and are gaining
 increasing representation in the professions and higher
 education. In 1987 there were 4 women on the party's
 25-member Central Committee. Nevertheless, the majority of
 Zambian women still occupy traditional roles. Customary law
 and practice are sometimes in conflict with Zambia's
 Constitution and codified laws in rural areas. Customary law
 places women in subordinate or unequal status with respect to
 property, inheritance, and marriage. The Law Development
 Commission is seeking ways to remove such anomalies. In
 Zambia's traditibnal society, women's primary role is bearing
 and raising children. They also make a major contribution to
 food production. Female students can be admitted to secondary
 school with lower passing marks than male students as part of
 Zambia's "affirmative action" program.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 While the majority of Zambians are subsistence farmers, about
 47 percent of the people live in urban areas, and the migration
 to cities is increasing. The modern economy is therefore
 large and growing. Zambian law regulates minimum health and
 safety standards and worker rights in any industrial
 
 
 355
 ZAMBIA.
 undertaking, and the Government generally attempts to enforce
 the regulations. Boards appointed by the Government, which
 include, worker and employer representatives, fix minimum
 wages, overtime pay rates, and conditions of employment. (An
 average minimum wage in the mining industry, for example, is
 $38 per.month at the current official fixed exchange rate,
 sufficient to provide an adequate standard of living by
 Zambian standards.) Thenormal workweek is 40 hours. Women
 are legally excluded from night work and a variety of
 hazardous occupations. Age restrictions apply to the
 industrial sector, and there are'only'a few cases of employees
 under age 16. .-However, persons under age 14 are often
 employed in the commercial and agricultural sectors.
