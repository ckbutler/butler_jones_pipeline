 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a parliamentary democracy. Elections are free and
 participation is high. The coalition Government (Socialist
 Party and Freedom Party) formed after the 1983 national
 election continued in office in 1984 while the People's Party,
 a conservative party with connections to the Roman Catholic
 Church, remained in opposition.
 The human rights situation in Austria in 1984 was good--
 essentially unchanged from the situation in previous years.
 No charges of human rights violations were brought by
 international or non-governmental organizations during 1984.
 Austria has a developed economy and enjoys a high standard of
 living. It has a strong Christian (Catholic) tradition, but
 does not discriminate against other religious faiths. Recent
 governments have made a conscious effort to eliminate legal
 provisions which tend to discriminate against women. In the
 postwar era, women have entered the work force in increasing
 numbers and made substantial progress toward equality.
 Since World War II, Austria has served as a country of first
 asylum for refugees from Eastern Europe. Since then,
 approximately 2 million refugees have passed through Austria.
 During 'normal' years, an average of 5,000 to 6,000 Eastern
 European refugees arrive in Austria (in calendar year 1983 the
 total was 5,657). Austria spent $30 million on refugee
 reception, care, and maintenance in 1983, and a similar amount
 is budgeted for 1984.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports in 1984 of politically motivated
 killings by either government authorities or opposition
 groups. However, two Turkish diplomats were killed in Vienna
 by terrorists. A Turkish Embassy attache lost his life on
 June 20, 1984 when a bomb exploded in his car in front of the
 Turkish Embassy. A senior Turkish U.N. official was shot on
 November 19 while driving to work. The Armenian Liberation
 Front claimed credit for both attacks. None of those
 responsible has yet been captured.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no abductions by authorities in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is banned by the Constitution. There is no evidence
 of any violation of this provision.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Austrian Constitution prohibits arbitrary detention or
 exile. The law provides for investigative detention for 72
 hours, by which time an investigative judge must decide on the
 legality of the detention. Provided the investigative judge
 agrees, the accused can be held in detention pending
 
 
 916
 AUSTRIA
 completion of an investigation for up to a maximum of 2
 years. Grounds for investigative detention are enumerated in
 the law, as are conditions for release on bail. Detention for
 minor infractions of administrative law can be imposed by
 administrative authorities, but is subject to court appeal.
 The number of such cases has been declining in recent years.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed by the Constitution. Austrian
 law provides for an independent judiciary and specifies the
 principle of public trials. There has been some criticism of
 a provision which requires public prosecutors to act on
 instructions of the Ministry of Justice. Some feel that this
 provision must lead to the polarization of the prosecution
 process. However, there have been no reports of abuses.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by the
 Constitution. A judge may issue search warrants for entry
 into a private residence. No warrant is needed in case of
 public hazard or of a fugitive from justice.
 Constitutional provisions also protect the privacy of the mail
 and telephone. A 1978 law provides for the protection of
 personal data collected, processed, or transmitted by
 government agencies, public institutions, and private entities.
 There is no effort by the Government to monitor or control
 family life.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed by the Constitution
 and respected in practice. Austria has a free, independent,
 and multifaceted press, ranging from conservative to Communist.
 Publications may be banned if they violate legal provisions
 concerning morality or public security. Such cases are
 extremely rare. Austria's well-established democratic
 political system, its active and independent press, and its
 effective judiciary combine to assure continued freedom of
 speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Austrian Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. The Austrian State Treaty of 1955 provides an
 exception to this principle in the case of Nazi organizations
 and activities. The constitutional law of 1945 prohibits Nazi
 organizations. The law on the formation of associations
 stipulates that permission to form an association may be
 denied if it is apparent that the organization will pursue the
 illegal activities of a prohibited organization. The large
 number of trade associations and other professional groupings
 testify to freedom of association in Austria.
 
 
 917
 AUSTRIA
 Public demonstrations require a permit by the police
 authorities which may consider only the public safety aspect
 of the proposed demonstration and not its political purpose.
 Permits are routinely issued.
 Trade unions in Austria have an important voice in political
 life due to their role in the "social partnership,' an
 unofficial system by which Austria's economic policies are
 determined by labor and management representatives. Nearly 60
 percent of the work force is organized in 15 national unions,
 each of which is a member of the Austrian Trade Union
 Federation. This organization has a strong, centralized
 leadership structure. Individual unions and the Federation
 are independent of government or political party control.
 Unions have the right to organize workers, to negotiate wage
 agreements, and to strike, although as a practical matter
 strikes in Austria have been rare. Two members of the present
 Cabinet are presidents of national unions, and the current
 president of the lower house of Parliament is also the
 president of the Federation. The Federation is a member of
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 By law, most employees must be members of the Chambers of
 Labor. This organization, which is unique to Austria,
 represents workers' interests vis-a-vis the Government whereas
 the unions represent the workers vis-a-vis the employers. The
 leadership of the trade unions as well as of the Chambers of
 Labor is elected through democratic balloting.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 This right is guaranteed by the Constitution, although the
 Treaty of St. Germain contains a provision which restricts
 this freedom to the practice of religions which are compatible
 with public safety and morality. Eighty-five percent of the
 Austrian population is Roman Catholic.
 In order to qualify as a recognized religious organization
 under Austrian law, religious groups register with the
 Government. Most of the world's major religions are
 represented in Austria. Despite its dominant position in the
 country, the political influence of the Catholic Church has
 steadily diminished since 1945 and is no longer considered a
 major political force. Although anti-Semitism has practically
 disappeared from public view, several recent surveys suggest
 it is still latently present among significant numbers of
 Austrians. A study by a Vienna sociologist published in
 September 1984 indicates that approximately half of the
 Austrian population holds some anti-Semitic beliefs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Austrian residents are free to travel, change residence, or
 emigrate. Citizens who leave the country have the right to
 return. Austria serves as a country of first asylum for
 refugees from Eastern Europe and as a transit point for Soviet
 Jewish emigrants on their way to Israel or other third
 countries. The Government has drastically limited the
 issuance of work permits to non-Austrians in an effort to
 reduce domestic unemployment. Austria's guest worker

 AUSTRIA
 population, which averaged 226,400 in 1973, stood at 140,200
 as of June 1984.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Austria is a constitutional parliamentary democracy. All
 citizens of 19 years of age or over may participate in
 elections which must be held at least every 4 years. The 1983
 national election resulted in a change of government in
 Austria. The Socialist Party lost its absolute majority in
 the Parliament and went into coalition with the Freedom
 Party. Several splinter groups also contested the elections,
 including the Communist Party, but did not receive sufficient
 support to elect candidates to the Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No charges of human rights violations were brought by
 international or non-governmental organizations during 1984.
 Austria recognizes the competence of the European Human Rights
 Commission in Strasbourg and concerns itself extensively with
 international human rights matters. Austria will host a
 Council of Europe conference on human rights in March 1985.
 Amnesty International is the major non-governmental human
 rights organization active in Austria. Austrians also provide
 financial support for the "Bruno Kreisky Foundation,' which
 was formed in 1976 to honor distinguished human rights
 activists. Amnesty International did not mention Austria in
 its 1984 report. Freedom House rates Austria as 'free.w
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Austria has an extensive public welfare program, the benefits
 of which are available to all citizens on a nondiscriminatory
 basis. These programs provide pensions for the retired,
 health benefits, and payments during periods of unemployment.
 The literacy rate of Austria's 7,544,000 (1984) population is
 nearly 100 percent. The work force is highly skilled,
 producing a per capita gross national product of $9,877
 (1982). Life expectancy at birth was 73 years in 1984. The
 infant mortality rate in 1984 was 11.9 per 1,000 live births.
 Women participate fully in the electoral process and
 constitute 53 percent of the Austrian electorate. De facto
 discrimination against women still exists in the political,
 social, and labor fields despite legislation enacted in 1977
 and 1979 to reform family law, thereby improving the
 conditions of mothers and wives, and the equality law, which
 outlaws discrimination against women through unequal pay. In
 1983, 40 percent of the work force was composed of women.
 Overall, however, women earned 49 percent less than men.
 Among men and women with equal training and education, men
 earned one-third more than women. The women's organizations
 within the established political parties remain the most
 important forums for women activists. Since 1983, a state
 secretary, a woman in the Chancellor's office, has been
 responsible for women's issues within the Government.

 AUSTRIA
 Although economic and social benefits are available to all
 citizens without discrimination, Austria's small (20,000)
 Slovene minority has criticized the Government for offering
 services only in German in some areas where Slovenes reside.
 During the 1984 provincial elections, the Freedom Party's
 leader in Carinthia appealed to Austrian nationalist sentiment
 by supporting a popular initiative calling for a separation of
 German- and Slovene-language instruction in Carinthian
 schools. Slovene-speaking students presently receive
 instruction in both languages if they desire, even in schools
 with large German-speaking majorities. But the initiative
 proposes that students choose between German and Slovene
 schools. The minority language thus would disappear from most
 schools, since the Slovene community is too small and diffuse
 to support many all-Slovene schools. Despite the opposition
 of the national organizations of all three major parties,
 supporters of the initiative gathered enough signatures to
 bring their proposal up for consideration in the Carinthian
 legislature.
