FRANCE
 France is a democracy with full and effective constitutional
 guarantees of human rights, freely functioning political
 parties, and regular elections. Voter participation (with
 universal suffrage) is high. Elections at the local as well
 as national level are occasions for ideological and topical
 debate.
 France has a highly developed industrial economy comprising a
 mixture of public and private enterprise. The public sector
 was increased significantly during the first year and a half
 of the Mitterrand Government when, in fulfillment of Socialist
 Party campaign promises, a number of important private
 industrial enterprises and most of the remaining private banks
 were nationalized. Most of the economy is still privately
 controlled, however, and no firms or banks were nationalized
 in 1984. The Government is now committed to an austerity
 program designed to reduce inflation and the costs of the
 public sector.
 Human rights is perhaps the single most consistent tenet of
 the Mitterrand Government's foreign policy. French leaders
 speak out frequently on worldwide abuses of human rights and
 make frequent reference to the protection of these rights
 within France. In January 1984, the Government established a
 Consultative Committee on Human Rights to advise the Minister
 of External Relations on all matters relating to French
 defense of human rights as an essential element of French
 foreign policy. During 1984, Justice Minister Badinter
 proceeded with additional legal reforms and proposed measures
 to expand individual liberties, protect victims' rights, and
 increase judicial discretion, particularly in individual
 sentencing.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Government does not engage in or condone political
 killing. Political murders by terrorists continued to be
 carried out in France in 1984, most notably against the United
 Arab Emirates Ambassador and two prominent Shah-era Iranians.
 In total, some 200 terrorist incidents resulted in
 approximately 16 deaths as of October 1984, about the same
 level as in 1983. Most acts of terrorism were carried out or
 claimed by non-French groups with ties to Middle Eastern,
 including Armenian, terrorist groups.
 In March, the U.S. Consul General in Strasbourg was the target
 of an assassination attempt claimed by the so-called Lebanese
 Armed Revolutionary Faction (LARF). This group, or persons
 using the LARF name, had claimed several other attacks against
 U.S. and Israeli diplomats since 1981. The threat level
 against U.S. officials in France remains very high and attacks
 against private U.S. citizens cannot be ruled out.
 Terrorism by indigenous groups and reprisals against Basque
 separatists resident in France were France's principal
 political/security problem in 1984. An anarchist terrorist
 group, 'Direct Action," claimed several bombings of French
 Government installations and private concerns with purported
 
 
 974
 FRANCE
 defense and NATO connections. French authorities have jailed
 several suspected leaders of 'Direct Action,* although most of
 its members are still at large. In October, some wDirect
 Action" members held for questioning began a hunger strike to
 protest their detention. Separatist groups took credit for
 several bombings in Martinique and Guadeloupe, mainly against
 French Government and tourist targets, and in the French
 Pacific territory of New Caledonia.
 The Front for the National Liberation of Corsica (FLNC), a
 Corsican separatist group which has traditionally limited its
 attacks to mainland French-owned property, continued to bomb
 property in Corsica and on mainland France. One of its goals
 is to pressure the French Government to treat jailed FLNC
 members as political prisoners.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence that French security services have
 engaged in abduction or secret arrests.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. There have been no credible allegations of the use
 of torture.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 French law guarantees freedom from arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. There is no direct equivalent of habeas corpus
 in the French legal system, but a suspect can be held only for
 up to 2 days--4 for drug cases--before being transferred to a
 magistrate for investigation.
 The French judiciary plays an important, determining role in
 the detention process. Government authority to hold a person
 beyond the prescribed periods is severely restricted and must
 be ordered by the competent court. In an effort to contain
 violence and in response to Spanish Government requests, the
 French Government in 1984 embarked on a program of "assigned
 residence," placing Spanish emigre Basques suspected
 separatist/terrorist connections in northern France, and
 expelled nearly 30 other suspected Spanish emigre Basque
 terrorists to Latin America and Africa. Three Spanish emigre
 Basques facing murder charges in Spain were extradited in
 September, following a favorable court ruling and exhaustion
 of all legal and administrative appeals.
 France has for many decades been home to thousands of persons
 fleeing political or religious persecution. There are no
 substantiated allegations of persons being exiled from
 modern-day France, although the expulsion of Basques from
 France, justified by the French Government on public security
 grounds, has raised concerns that, given enough accepting
 states, this practice might be expanded.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Suspects have the right to legal
 counsel as soon as their case is transferred from the police
 to the magistrate. For misdemeanors, pretrial confinement is
 
 
 975
 FRANCE
 limited normally to 4 months, with possible extensions in
 special circumstances not to exceed 8 months. For felonies,
 pretrial confinement is not limited. French law provides for
 the right of appeal, except in jury trials of felony cases.
 Trials in France are normally open and public, though
 provisions exist for the defense to request a closed
 proceeding. The press has free access to records of court
 proceedings, but under French law the prosecutor may not
 disclose information about cases being tried or investigated.
 Though the judiciary is independent, the courts are not immune
 from subtle political or public pressure in certain cases.
 There is no indication that the Government detains any person
 solely for political reasons. There are no serious charges of
 political motivation in the detention of persons.
 Pending completion of legislative reforms, legal proceedings
 have been suspended against individuals whose requests for
 conscientious objector status were rejected. There are still
 some individuals, however, who are now serving prison terms
 imposed prior to 1983 by the now defunct Permanent Tribunals
 of the Armed Forces because they did not present such a
 request and refused military service.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 French law guarantees freedom from invasion of privacy and
 this is respected in practice. The search of a private
 residence requires a search warrant and must take place
 between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. except in special cases, such as
 drug offenses, when the search can be undertaken at any time.
 Telephone conversations may be monitored in conjunction with
 criminal proceedings with a court order and in national
 security cases with administrative approval from the agency
 conducting the investigation. The Government has occasionally
 opened correspondence to enforce currency regulations, though
 this is not a widespread practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Newspapers and magazines are free from
 government control and carry views ranging across the
 political spectrum. Major radio and television stations are
 publicly owned, though the Government is not directly involved
 in their daily operation. These media are subject to the
 jurisdiction of a "High Authority* whose members are appointed
 by the President, the National Assembly, and the Senate.
 Since 1983, private "free" radio stations have been in
 operation, many of which are sympathetic to the current
 political opposition. Allegations of government pressure on
 television and radio continue to be heard and denied. In
 practice, government controls on the audiovisual media do not
 seem to represent a limitation of press freedoms. A
 government-sponsored law designed to reduce monopoly holdings
 in the printed press was passed by the legislature in mid-1984
 despite strenuous opposition. In mid-October the retroactive
 provisions on existing press conglomerates were found
 unconstitutional in several areas.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is
 constitutionally guaranteed and respected in practice. Labor
 unions have the right to organize free from government
 control. Though only one-fifth of labor is unionized, trade
 unions exercise significant economic and political influence.
 They are present and active in numerous tripartite
 (Government, employers, and labor) bodies dealing with social
 matters, including labor courts and the Economic and Social
 Council, a constitutionally mandated consultative body.
 French unions range across the political spectrum. All unions
 are technically independent of the political parties, but many
 of the leaders of France's largest union, the General
 Confederation of Labor, belong to the Communist Party (the
 General Secretary traditionally is a member of the Communist
 Party Political Bureau). Leaders of most other unions are
 members of one or another faction of the governing Socialist
 Party although members of other parties are also active in the
 labor movement. Despite this, all unions claim to be
 non-political. Both unions and employers associations are
 very active in the International Labor Organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholics comprise by far the largest religious group in
 France. Separation of church and state is guaranteed by law,
 though in Alsace and a portion of Lorraine, for historical
 reasons, the Catholic Church enjoys a favored status. All
 other religious groups function freely without persecution or
 restrictions. In the face of strong public opposition to
 proposals to reduce state subsidies to private (largely
 Catholic) schools, the French Government in late 1984 withdrew
 from consideration a compromise education reform bill which
 would have provided for the transfer of authority for primary
 and secondary education to the local level.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 French lawprovides for freedom of internal movement, foreign
 travel, emigration, and repatriation. Arriving refugees,
 intending emigrants, and intending repatriates can undertake
 foreign travel and, in most instances, return to France. New
 measures to control immigration announced in October 1984
 could, among other things, sharply restrict the right of some
 aliens to settle their families in France. France has an
 extensive record of refugee aid and resettlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The French Constitution guarantees the equality of all
 citizens before the law, without regard to origin, race, or
 religion. All French citizens of both sexes who have reached
 majority may vote. These provisions are fully respected in
 practice. A wide variety of political parties compete freely
 in elections. In addition to national, presidential, and
 legislative elections, there are regularly scheduled local
 elections. The-Government is in the process of transferring
 selected powers from the executive branch to the locally
 elected assemblies. A wide range of special interest
 groups--business, labor, veterans, consumer advocates,
 ecologists, and others--organize freely and regularly run
 
 
 977
 FRANCE
 candidates for elective office. Legislation over the past
 year has been enacted to broaden civil liberties. While
 isolated incidents of racial, religious, or political
 discrimination occur, particularly against the large immigrant
 community, they are not condoned by the Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 France has traditionally been a leader in the human rights
 area and has long been a member of the UN Human Rights
 Commission. Human rights organizations operate freely in
 France, including Amnesty International, the International
 Federation for Human Rights, and the International Institute
 for Human'Rights. The 1984 Report of Amnesty International
 expresses concern over the status of conscientious objectors.
 Freedom House rates France *free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 France has an advanced industrial mixed economy accompanied by
 a system of social assistance to needy members of the
 population, regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion. France's population is
 54,872,000, and its per capita gross national product was
 $11,681 in 1982. Life expectancy at birth is 74.7 years, and
 the infant mortality rate 8.8 per 1,000 live births. The
 adult literacy rate is 99 percent.
 Women have equal status under the law, but they remain engaged
 in the continuing effort to maintain and strengthen their
 rights. A cabinet-level ministry is charged with promoting
 women's rights. The French Government in 1984 took steps to
 close loopholes in French legislation on sex discrimination in
 the workplace and to eliminate sexist advertising.
