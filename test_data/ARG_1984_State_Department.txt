 ARGENTINA
 In 1984 Argentina continued to consolidate the dramatic
 improvements in its human rights situation stemming from the
 successful 1983 transition of a military government to a
 freely-elected civilian government. Argentina is once again a
 constitutional democracy with an executive branch, an
 independent bicameral legislature, and an autonomous judicial
 system. Political debate was free and open, and all parties
 had access to the media. There was a high level of public
 participation in discussing the issues of the day.
 Full respect for civil rights returned to Argentina in 1984.
 Press restrictions ended and controls on the largely
 government-owned electronic media were the least restrictive
 since the 1976 military coup. Freely-elected national and
 provincial legislatures reopened. An independent judiciary
 functioned normally by the end of 1984. Trade union freedom
 was greater than at any time since 1976; strikes occurred,
 including one national strike on September 3, and most unions
 completed leadership elections by the end of the year.
 There were also improvements in respect for individual rights
 and, for the fourth year in a row, there were no
 disappearances. Human rights groups continued to demand a
 complete accounting for past disappearances and punishment for
 those responsible. President Raul Alfonsin appointed the
 National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons, which
 completed its report in September. He also created a special,
 permanent human rights office in the Ministry of the Interior
 to continue the work of the commission. Among other steps to
 institutionalize human rights were new laws strengthening the
 right of habeas corpus and making torture a crime, signing and
 ratifying the Inter-American Human Rights Convention, and
 supporting the United Nations Convention on Torture. The
 provincial government in La Rioja began mandatory human rights
 courses at all schools and for all provincial policemen.
 During 1984 Argentina continued to be beset by a number of
 severe economic problems, including a 688 percent annual rate
 of inflation and foreign debt-servicing difficulties. The
 Government has taken steps to address those problems,
 including the negotiation of an agreement with the IMF.
 Argentina's population of 30.2 million had a per capita gross
 national product of $2,520 in 1982.
 There were very few human rights problems in Argentina during
 1984. These arose largely from the problem of how to deal
 with trying and punishing those responsible for the abuses of
 the late 1970's.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no outstanding charge by human rights groups of any
 death occurring during 1984 that was politically motivated or
 instigated by the Government. At the end of December, one
 Argentine press report noted that 1984 was the first year
 since 1968 in which no political killings occured in Argentina.

 ARGENTINA
 b. Disappearance
 In 1984, for the fourth consecutive year, there was no
 evidence of disappearances. Accounting for the large number
 of persons who disappeared between 1973 and 1980 and punishing
 those responsible continued to be major issues, however, and
 courts continued to investigate cases of unmarked graves.
 Some exhumed corpses were identified as individuals who had
 disappeared. President Alfonsin declared at a year-end press
 conference that his Government had not found any disappeared
 persons alive. Some hunan rights groups have documented cases
 of children of disappeared parents being raised by adoptive
 parents, in some cases former security officers. In at least
 one case, a child has been reunited with its grandparents.
 On December 15, 1983, just five days after his inauguration,
 President Alfonsin ordered the creation of a National
 Commission on the Disappearance of Persons to help clarify
 what happened to the people who disappeared. The commission's
 tasks included: receiving charges and evidence concerning
 cases of people who disappeared for submission to the courts;
 investigating the whereabouts of missing persons; establishing
 the whereabouts of missing children; and denouncing in the
 courts any attempts to conceal, steal, or destroy evidence
 related to disappearances. The commission, which gave its
 report to President Alfonsin on September 20, also compiled a
 carefully documented list of missing persons containing 8,961
 names. The President promised to submit the findings to the
 courts, which will decide if there is sufficient evidence for
 trials to be held. Punishing those responsible for
 disappearances is a controversial issue in Argentina. Human
 rights groups charge that a number of bombings and other
 violent attempts to obstruct justice occured in 1984.
 Alfonsin also created a special, permanent office in the
 Ministry of the Interior to replace the commission and to
 continue its work. That office will also receive any future
 reports of rights violations, file court cases, enforce human
 rights laws, produce new draft human rights legislation, and
 launch relevant education and information campaigns about
 human rights.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits the use of torture. In at least
 two cases, judges sentenced police officials to prison terms
 of at least three years for having tortured prisoners in years
 prior to 1984. In one of those cases, a judge also sentenced
 police medical officers to two years in prison for covering up
 torture and for producing falsified reports. Some allegations
 of torture by police officials, mostly of beatings, were made
 in 1984. During 1984 judges increased their efforts to curb
 the use of torture. For example, a judge in Cordoba city made
 an unexpected visit to that city's sixth provincial police
 precinct, interviewed prisoners individually, and found six
 prisoners who claimed to have been tortured in April. The
 judge then had twelve provincial policemen, including the
 precinct chief, detained and indicted for torture.
 Incidents of violence by unknown assailants, generally
 believed to be non-governmental, occurred during 1984 and
 became more numerous in the last quarter of the year. Some
 appeared to be related to the political or labor activities of
 the people involved. For example, in October a Buenos Aires
 
 
 406
 ARGENTINA
 neighborhood Peronist party council member was kidnapped at
 gunpoint, allegedly tortured for four hours (with cigarette
 burns and beatings), and interrogated about the activities of
 Peronist party leaders. The Government is investigating the
 attack.
 In December 1983, President Alfonsin submitted a proposal to
 Congress to make torture a crime, liable to the same
 punishment as murder, i.e., life imprisonment, and in 1984
 Congress approved a criminal code reform punishing torture
 with the same penalties applied for homicide. Torture (where
 no death resulted) can now be punished by prison sentences
 ranging from eight to 25 years, plus permanent exclusion from
 public office; life imprisonment is an automatic punishment in
 all cases where the victim was tortured to death.
 The Alfonsin Administration appointed a new Director of the
 National Prison Service who immediately instituted reforms
 designed to improve prison conditions. Moreover, Argentine
 senators and congressmen visited prisons and pushed for
 improved conditions and reforms, with success. Prisoners and
 their relatives told the press that prison conditions improved
 after the civilian Government took office. Journalists were
 allowed to interview prisoners and to visit inside the
 prisons, a practice that had not been in effect previously.
 Despite the improved conditions, there were protests, hunger
 strikes, and riots in some of the prisons during 1984, and
 three prisoners committed suicide, one supposedly because his
 request for release had been denied. The prison protests
 resulted from prisoners' demands for better food and work
 conditions and a reduction in their sentences. In June,
 hundreds of prisoners at Caseros Prison in Buenos Aires,
 infuriated by the news that one of their fellow inmates had
 died following an operation in the prison hospital, created
 one of the worst riots in the annals of Argentine penal
 history.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Argentina has a well-developed legal code containing
 provisions such as habeas corpus and controls on police arrest
 and investigatory powers. In 1984 Congress passed a law that
 strengthened the right of habeas corpus by giving judges
 greater authority. The Argentine penal code, however, gives
 the police and courts authority to detain persons
 incommunicado for up to eight days. Even in the case of minor
 offenses, holding of suspects incommunicado for a few days is
 common. The Constitution also confers power on the executive
 branch to detain persons indefinitely under a State of Siege,
 which was lifted on October 29, 1983.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 For the judiciary, 1984 was a year of transition. By the end
 of the year it was functioning normally after having overcome
 such problems as slow Senate approval of judges. The major
 backlogs in cases now being handled continue to be a serious
 problem.
 At the beginning of 1984, some Argentine human rights groups
 claimed there were still 147 so-called political prisoners in
 Argentina. The Government disagreed and said those prisoners
 had been convicted of crimes by either civil or military
 courts and the Government could not summarily overturn those
 
 
 407
 ARGENTINA
 verdicts. Instead, the Government suggested that the
 prisoners request a judicial review of their cases. Many
 prisoners did, and some of these were released during 1984.
 In July, a law took effect shortening the sentences of
 prisoners who were sentenced between March 24, 1976, and
 December 10, 1983 (the period of military rule). By December
 the number used by human rights groups had dropped from 147 to
 15, most of whom had been convicted of violent crimes under a
 civilian, constitutional government before the 1976 military
 takeover. President Alfonsin stated in December that 'There
 are no political prisoners. . . but criminal prisoners with
 political connotations.'
 The Argentine penal code provides for open trials, and all
 rulings by lower courts, civilian and military, may be
 appealed to the Supreme Court. In its first decision since
 being appointed by President Alfonsin, the new five-member
 Supreme court in January ruled unconstitutional the trial of
 civilians by military tribunals. The court simultaneously
 annuled a prison sentence given by the Supreme Council of the
 Armed Forces to an alleged terrorist, and in May quashed the
 prison sentence given to a conscript soldier in 1974.
 President Alfonsin, in December 1983, ordered the Armed Forces
 Supreme Council to try the nine leaders of the military
 governments in power from 1976-82 for homicide, illegal
 imprisonment, and torture of prisoners. However, numerous
 human rights cases against military personnel were pressed in
 civilian courts, which sometimes only relinquished
 jurisdiction after considerable publicity and, on occasion,
 appeal to higher courts. Human rights leaders wanted civilian
 judges to try military personnel charged with human rights
 abuses. In June the Supreme Court overruled lower courts and
 ordered the trial of former President and retired army Major
 General Reynaldo Bignone by the Armed Forces Supreme Council
 in the case of three conscripts who disappeared in 1976. That
 Supreme Court decision confirmed the constitutionality of the
 amendment to the code of military justice passed by Congress
 earlier in 1984, which provided for military trials of all
 military and security personnel involved in crimes related to
 the suppression of subversion prior to mid-1982, subject to
 final appeal in civil appellate courts. Nevertheless, when
 the Armed Forces Supreme Council did not complete the trials
 of the junta members by October, a civil appellate court
 decided to take over the trials, based on a suit brought
 before the court by civilians. The appellate court, however,
 took over only the cases against the junta members, and left
 all other trials involving alleged human rights violations by
 military and security personnel to the Supreme Council of the
 Armed Forces.
 In late December, the Supreme Court ruled against an appeal by
 the Junta members and upheld civil jurisdiction of the cases.
 The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces resigned en masse in
 November, at least partially to protest the Ministry of
 Defense's alleged failure to defend the Council from the
 criticism which followed its announcement that it could not
 complete the junta members' trials by the assigned deadline.
 However, the Council continued to function throughout
 December, pending government action on the resignations and
 possible replacements.

 ARGENTINA
 President Alfonsin also ordered in December 1983 that legal
 action be taken against seven terrorist leaders for their
 crimes during 1976-1982. Mario Firmenich, allegedly a leader
 of the Montonero terrorists, was extradited to Argentina by
 Brazil in October of 1984 to be tried on several charges,
 including double homicide. Ricardo Obregon Cano, former
 Governor of Cordoba Province, was arrested and charged with
 illegal association (with the Montoneros).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or.
 Correspondence.
 There were few reported cases of arbitrary intrusion by the
 state into the private life of individuals in Argentina in
 1984. In September, however, a federal judge ordered Congress
 to return documents confiscated by a lower house investigative
 committee from the law offices of a former government
 official. The judge, responding to a complaint filed by the
 former official, said that he did not question the committee's
 investigative powers but ruled that the committee was not
 empowered to confiscate private documents in private homes and
 offices without a judicial warrant. The Buenos Aires Bar
 Association and some congressmen criticized these unauthorized
 searches and impounding of documents. Other congressmen
 insisted on Congress' right to carry out such actions and the
 judge's ruling was appealed. The appellate court upheld the
 judges ruling, but the Congressional committee will carry its
 appeal to the Supreme Court, which will make the final
 decision.
 The Federal Criminal Court of Appeals acquitted a woman in
 August who had been charged with illegal possession of
 weapons, declaring illegal the police raid on her home during
 which the weapons were found. The court said the police had
 trespassed and should have obtained a judicial warrant first.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There were very few restrictions on freedom of speech and
 press in Argentina during 1984. Criticism of the Government
 is tolerated and opposition viewpoints are freely expressed.
 Congress, however, did have two people arrested and detained
 for several days for having made derogatory remarks about
 Congress and some of its members. An independent press offers
 views that cover the entire political spectrum, and an
 independent judiciary and a functioning democratic political
 system work to insure freedom of speech and press.
 Some human rights leaders claimed that the Government would
 not let them appear on government-owned television; the
 Government denied the charge.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Since August 1982, all groups and parties, except subversive
 organizations outlawed for espousing violence, have been free
 to organize and assemble. Major rallies were held by
 political parties, including the Communist Party, during 1984.
 Tne labor movement is once again a major independent political
 and economic force. The new Government moved to restore
 organized labor's full rights, and there was extensive debate
 and action on trade union legislation in Congress. However,
 
 
 ARGENTINA
 the impact of the prolonged suspension of normal trade union
 activity under the previous military Government has
 complicated the process. For example, most trade unions have
 not been able to hold elections in ten years, and the
 incumbent leadership has been extended in office. To
 revalidate the authority of leadership at all levels of
 organized labor, elections are being held under legislation
 reflecting considerable input from labor itself. This process
 should be completed early in 1985. In the meantime, the de
 facto leadership of organized labor does speak to management
 and the Government on worker-related issues. Unions strike to
 support their demands. Wage settlements are generally decided
 by the Government, often after consultation with labor and
 management. In addition, the Government opened formal talks
 with labor and sectors of the business community on a social
 pact covering policies to be followed to meet the grave
 economic crisis facing the country.
 The previous military Government intervened in the affairs of
 many unions and their social welfare organizations and
 suspended collective bargaining. Some traces of those
 restrictions remain and will continue until the union election
 process is completed. Some unions still have officials
 appointed by the military Government who are continuing to
 work in a temporary capacity to assist the election process
 and transition to the newly-elected leaders. Many trade union
 social welfare organizations are still intervened with. In
 this case, the Government plans legislation redefining their
 operations and is pledged to discuss this legislation with
 organized labor.
 On September 29, 1984, Congress passed a law revoking the
 decree of the military Government that suspended collective
 bargaining. The law provides that normal collective
 bargaining procedures be fully restored within one year.
 Unions are free to maintain ties with international labor
 organizations as they see fit; they participated in
 international labor conferences during 1984. At the annual
 International Labor Organization conference in June, Argentina
 was singled out for praise because of the return to democracy
 and the progress made in improving trade union freedoms.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Argentina's Constitution states that everyone has the right to
 practice his religion, but it also states the Federal
 Government supports Roman Catholicism. The Constitution also
 requires the President and Vice President to be members of the
 Roman Catholic Church. Religions other than Catholicism must
 register with the Government to obtain the legal recognition
 required to operate freely in Argentina. In July the
 Government granted long-pending legal recognition to the
 Jehovah's Witnesses. About 300 Witnesses, all Argentine
 nationals, remain prisoners for refusal to accept compulsory
 military service. The usual penalty is three and one-half
 years of civilian service at military installations.
 Conditions are not onerous and the prisoners are given
 furloughs for as much as a month at a time. Judges have ruled
 that the punishment was excessive and ordered Witnesses
 released in a few individual cases in 1984. In December 1984
 the Alfonsin Government submitted to Congress legislation
 which would permit alternative service, probably lasting
 longer than conscripts' one year of military service, for
 conscientious objectors opposed to military service on moral
 or religious grounds.
 
 
 410
 ARGENTINA
 Argentina's Jewish community (about 250,000) practices its
 religion without restraint. Although occasional anti-semitic
 incidents occur, there were fewer such incidents in 1984 than
 in 1983. Recent military and civilian governments have
 publicly condemned religious prejudice. In September, the
 executive branch submitted to Congress a draft bill condemning
 racial, religious, and other forms of discrimination.
 Congress did not act on the bill by the end of the year.
 Missionaries are permitted to enter Argentina and to
 proselytize. The non-Catholic population is growing.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Internal and foreign travel and emigration are basically
 unrestricted. Several thousand former exiles returned to
 Argentina during 1984, many as a result of the Government's
 policy of encouraging such people to return, and about 3,000
 returned with financial assistance from the United Nations
 High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). In June, the Government
 created a national commission to facilitate the return of
 Argentines abroad. Also, the Executive Branch issued a decree
 in April that reestablished the citizenship of all Argentines
 who were deprived of their Argentine nationality by the
 previous military Government. In September, Congress amended
 Argentina's law concerning refugees to extend the status of
 refugee to any exiled foreigner seeking asylum in Argentina.
 Previously, only people of European origin could obtain
 refugee status. President Alfonsin signed the bill into law.
 The change is expected to benefit thousands of people, and
 will allow the UNHCR to provide more help to non-European
 refugees than in the past.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In October 1983 the President, Vice President, two senators,
 all 254 deputies of the lower house of the legislature,
 provincial governors and legislators, and mayors and municipal
 councils were elected directly in free and democratic
 elections. Another 44 national senators were elected by
 provincial legislatures in November 1983. Elections for
 one-half the national deputies in the lower house and for a
 proportion of the members of each provincial legislature will
 be held in 1985.
 Thirteen political parties covering the political spectrum,
 including the Communist Party, qualified as national parties
 and presented candidates. Other parties qualified in
 individual provinces. There is a large, politically
 important, active opposition that operates openly.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Argentina cooperates with both the UN Human Rights Commission
 and the Organization of American States Inter-American Human
 Rights Commission (IAHRC). The Executive Secretary of the
 IAHRC visited Argentina in March and praised the new
 Government's work in the human rights field. In October, the
 IAHRC's annual report praised President Alfonsin for his'
 dedication to strengthening the rule of law and consolidating
 
 
 411
 ARGENTINA
 a democratic system in Argentina. The Inter-American Human
 Rights Court convened in Argentina in October, its first
 session ever outside its seat in San Jose, Costa Rica.
 In 1984 Argentina signed and ratified the Inter-American Human
 Rights Convention. Congress' lower house also approved the UN
 Convention on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention
 on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights in February. The
 Senate was studying those conventions when it adjourned its
 ordinary session in October. The civilian Government also
 reversed its military predecessor's position on the draft UN
 Convention on Torture and supported the draft, the first time
 an Argentine Government had done so. The new Argentine
 position resulted in the completion, after six years, of the
 draft for presentation to the UN General Assembly which
 subsequently approved it.
 Two new private human rights organizations, the Association of
 Former Detained and Disappeared Persons and the Office of
 Solidarity for Argentine Exiles, were established in 1984,
 bringing to 11 the total of these groups in Argentina. Human
 rights organizations operated freely in 1984 despite some
 harassment from unknown sources. Various human rights
 activists reported receiving anonymous death threats. The
 homes of two and the office of a third were bombed.
 Nevertheless, human rights groups stepped up their activities
 and expanded their efforts in 1984, primarily by bringing
 cases to court either to account for the 'disappeared* or to
 seek punishment of those alleged to be responsible for the
 disappearances. They also urged that human rights instruction
 be included in school curricula. The active role of the
 Mothers' of the Plaza de Mayo in organizing demonstrations
 against the Government policy of trials initially by military
 courts prompted President Alfonsin to state that the group has
 political objectives which do not coincide with Argentine
 national interest.
 Amnesty International's 1984 report, covering 1983, stated
 that after a civilian Government took office in Argentina in
 December 1983, official efforts got under way to trace the
 fate of thousands who had "disappeared' in earlier years, and
 that by the end of 1983 more than 200 prisoners of conscience,
 some of whom had been detained without trial for seven years,
 had been released following the lifting of the State of
 Siege. Freedom House rates Argentina 'free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Notwithstanding 688% inflation in consumer prices during 1984,
 with 28 percent of the people living below a government-
 defined poverty level and the continued existence of a few
 pockets of abject poverty, most of Argentina's population of
 30.2 million continued to enjoy a relatively good standard of
 living.
 The rate of unemployment and underemployment fell during the
 first half of 1984 to a combined level of 9 percent. At the
 end of 1984 the Government introduced a system of unemployment
 compensation for up to six months (in some cases nine). Real
 wages increased for lower-income groups in 1984, while they
 decreased for middle-and high-income groups. The population
 growth rate in 1984 was 1.6 percent.
 
 
 412
 ARGENTINA
 Women in Argentina are active in government, the professions,
 politics, and private voluntary organizations, but they have
 to contend with a variety of discriminatory mechanisms that
 are rooted in cultural, economic, and social structures. For
 example, married women living in Argentina must have the
 permission of their husbands to travel abroad with their minor
 children if the husband is not accompanying them, although new
 legislation submitted by the administration in December 1984
 would require permission of both parents for minor children to
 travel abroad. The same proposed legislation would give equal
 inheritance rights to legitimate and illegitimate children.
 There is no divorce in Argentina. There is no official policy
 of discrimination, however, and the Alfonsin Administration
 addressed the issue in its first year in office. In March, a
 government ministry (Health and Social Action) organized a
 three-day forum to commemcrate International Women's Day.
 President Alfonsin closed the forum by stating that sex
 discrimination would be banned by law and a draft bill was
 submitted to Congress in September. The Government also paid
 homage to women on March 8 (International Women's Day) for the
 part they played in restoring democracy in Argentina. In
 July, Congress' lower house approved the UN Convention for the
 Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. The Senate was
 studying the convention when it adjourned its ordinary session
 in October.
 Women participate freely in politics in Argentina. There were
 scores of women candidates in 1983 for the National Congress
 (ten won: three senators and seven deputies), several women
 candidates for governor (none won) and vice governor of
 provinces (one won), and three women candidates for vice
 president (none won).
 In the largely middle-class Argentine society, 80 percent of
 the population lives in urban areas, and at least 65 percent
 own their homes (the same percentage as in the U.S.). The
 average Argentine enjoys a healthy, high-protein diet which
 provided 126 percent of the daily caloric requirement in
 1977. Sixty-six percent of the population had access to safe
 water (1975). In 1984, life expectancy at birth was 70.6
 years, and the infant mortality rate was 34.9 per 1000 live
 births.
 The adult literacy rate in 1971 was 93 percent for males and
 92 percent for females. The adjusted primary school
 enrollment ratio was 134 percent in 1982 (Male: 134; Female
 133). In the Province of Buenos Aires, where approximately
 one-third of the nation's population resides, 93.6 percent of
 the 12-year old population was attending school at the time of
 the 1980 census, 1.7 percent had already graduated, and less
 than one percent had never attended.
