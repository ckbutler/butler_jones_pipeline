 DJIBOUTI
 Now in its second year of independence, the Republic of
 Djibouti has yet to adopt a constitution. The Govern-
 ment continues to be organized on the basis of the
 political structure inherited from French rule, with a
 President in place of the former High Commissioner and
 a cabinet drawn from the National Assembly. The
 President was elected by the National Assembly on May
 16, 1977. Djibouti's legal system incorporates both
 French and Islamic laws and its organization reflects
 the French model.
 Djibouti's population is divided between the majority
 Somalis (Issa and Ishaak tribes) and the minority
 Afars or Canakils. The President is an ethnic Somali
 and the Premiers to date have been Afars. Nonetheless,
 ethnic tension continues in Djibouti, although the
 Government is committed officially to give each faction
 a representative voice at all levels. The conflict
 between Ethiopia and Somalia contributes to internal
 disturbances in Djibouti; in late 1977 and 1978 there
 were four serious bomb-throwing incidents partially
 inspired by outside groups. In response, the Govern-
 ment took strong measures against suspected terrorists
 and dissidents. These measures were taken within the
 framework of the legal guarantees inherited from
 French and civil and criminal statutes.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is proscribed by law. Some Afar elements
 alleged that suspects in the December 1977 bomb-throw-
 ing incident were tortured. These charges remain
 unproven. However, it is not believed that torture is
 commonly practiced in Djibouti.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 
 
 There have been no reports of such treatment of detainees.
 Prison conditions are adequate.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The judicial guarantees derived from the French penal
 code are systematically applied.
 d. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 Six individuals accused of direct involvement in the
 bomb-throwing incident in December 1977 still remain in
 jail without trial. The delay appears to reflect the
 Government's fears that a trial would further aggravate
 already serious political tension and its underlying
 ethnic rivalries. All other trials have been held in
 public pursuant to French legal practices.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Following the bombing incident, thousands of homes were
 searched. Few householders protested for they favored
 the apprehension of those responsible.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Committed to the betterment of the living conditions of
 all of its population, the Government is planning to
 undertake educational and health programs. The details
 of these programs are still being worked out. Foreign
 assistance may make possible some progress in industrial
 and agricultural development. The Republic of Djibouti
 has admitted over 20,000 refugees from nearby war-torn
 areas, the equivalent of about ten percent of its
 own population. The Government provides food, shelter
 and protection to more than half of these refugees in
 refugee camps. The rest have been absorbed by kinsmen
 in Djibouti. The Addis Ababa-Djibouti railroad opened
 in July and Djibouti authorities hope its return to
 service will alleviate much of the economic dislocation
 caused in Djibouti by the 1978 Ethiopian/Somali war.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 There is no censorship in Djibouti, although as was the
 case during the colonial period, nearly all of the
 public information sources belong to the Government. A
 largely Muslim country, Djibouti does not restrict the
 practice of other religions.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 In this basically nomadic country, there are no appar-
 ent restrictions on internal movement or travel abroad.
 Emigration is permitted.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Djibouti had a long history of intense pre-indepen-
 dence political activity. Nrw that independence has
 been achieved, the President has suggested that there
 be a single political party, but no action has been
 taken in this regard.
 No women are involved in politics at the national
 level. The labor laws in Djibouti provide for a full
 range of benefits including a generous minimum wage,
 extensive holidays and comprehensive medical coverage.
 These laws are rigorously applied by the Djibouti
 Government. Ethnic issues are very important in the
 political atmosphere of Djibouti, and the matter of
 equal access to jobs and advancement in the military
 and civil government by members of minority groups
 are probably the central political issues.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Amnesty International twice requested the Government of
 Djibouti to provide explanatory information, first
 
 
 51
 following the December 1977 bombing and again after the
 August 1978 trial of the student activists. On both
 occasions the Government complied. The Department of
 State is not aware of any other inquiries from inter-
 national or non-governmental organizations about the
 human rights situation in Djibouti.
