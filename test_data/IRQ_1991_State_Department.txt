 IRAQ
 Political power in Iraq is concentrated in a repressive
 one-party apparatus under the domination of Saddam Hussein.
 The provisional Constitution of 1968 stipulates that the Arab
 Ba'ath Socialist Party (ABSP) governs Iraq, with executive and
 legislative authority exercised by the Revolutionary Command
 Council (RCC). Saddam Hussein wields decisive power as
 President of the Republic, Chairman of the RCC, and Secretary
 General of the Regional Command of the ABSP.
 The Government's security apparatus, including militias
 attached to the President, the ABSP, and the Interior Ministry,
 have been responsible for widespread and systematic rights
 abuses; they continue to play a central role in maintaining the
 intimidation and fear on which government power rests.
 The Government exerts decisive control over Iraq's oil-based
 economy and owns all the major industries. Owing to severe
 economic dislocation in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War,
 unemployment and inflation rose dramatically. Iraq's economic
 problems were compounded by the Government's failure to comply
 with U.N. Security Council Resolution 687 which resulted in the
 continuation of U.N.-mandated economic sanctions against Iraq.
 Sanctions prohibited all exports (including petroleum) and
 imports other than food, medicine, and essential humanitarian
 supplies.
 The magnitude of Iraqi human rights violations in 1991 was
 shocking, even by the previous standards of the Saddam Hussein
 regime. Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait early in 1991 carried
 out mass arrests and abductions, rape, torture, and execution
 of hundreds of Kuwaiti citizens. They were also responsible
 for wanton destruction of Kuwait's urban infrastructure,
 systematic looting, the intentional discharge of a massive
 volume of crude oil into the Gulf, and demolition of more than
 700 oil wells, as well as missile attacks against population
 centers in Israel and Saudi Arabia.
 In brutally repressing a major domestic popular uprising in
 March and April, Iraqi forces resorted to sustained
 indiscriminate bombardment of population centers, resulting in
 casualties estimated in the tens of thousands. Many more
 perished in mass executions and from hardships encountered
 during a mass migration of over 1 million people.
 Human rights in virtually all categories continue to be
 systematically violated by the Iraqi regime. Political killing
 and torture continue, denial of due process, arbitrary
 detentions, and disappearances remain widespread, freedoms of
 speech and press and of assembly and association are
 nonexistent, and Iraqis do not have the right to change their
 government. The reader is referred to the report on Kuwait for
 details of human rights abuses committed by Iraqi forces in
 that country in the first 2 months of 1991.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The Iraqi regime has a well-established record of executing
 perceived opponents both inside and-outside the countiy.
 During 1991 summary execution was a primary tactic of Iraqi
 
 
 1420
 
 IRAQ
 military and security services in suppressing the popular
 uprising and, subsequently, in punishing citizens thought to
 have taken part in it. Prisoners in southern detention camps
 during the rebellion subsequently reported that a number of
 prisoners were executed by machinegun fire each day.
 Widespread public execution of civilians, including women and
 children, after Iraqi forces regained control was reported in a
 number of southern cities. Such incidents appear to have been
 at least as widespread during fighting in the north.
 Executions are reported to have continued since suppression of
 the uprising. There were credible reports that a number of
 Iraqis were arrested and executed upon returning to their homes
 in northern, and southern Iraq following an amnesty offer
 extended to Kurds in April and broadened to include all
 citizens in early May.
 In early October, a Western journalist in Sulaymaniyah
 witnessed the summary eAecution of at least 60 unarmed Iraqi
 soldiers by unidentified Kurdish elements during violent
 clashes in the area between Kurdish guerrilla fighters and the
 Iraqi military. The Kurdish leadership immediately denounced
 the killings and ordered an investigation. A Kurdish guerrilla
 commander was tentatively identified as the main perpetrator,
 but final results of the investigation had not been announced
 as of the end of the year.
 In past years, Iraqi opposition figures abroad have also been
 targets- of government assassination attempts.
 b. Disappearance
 As in previous years, there were credible reports from numerous
 sources, including the U.N. Working Group on Enforced or
 Involuntary Disappearances, that large numbers of persons
 "disappeared" while in the custody of Iraqi authorities.
 The total number of suspected government opponents who were
 arrested and who disappeared during and immediately after the
 March/April uprising is estimated in the thousands. Opposition
 sources report that several hundred Shi'a scholars and students
 of religion were arrested at that time and remain unaccounted
 for. In the north, many Kurds arrested as suspected dissidents
 or detained for use as "human shield" hostages during the
 uprising also disappeared. In addition, the Government has
 failed either to return or account for more than 2,000 Kuwaiti
 citizens transported to Iraq by occupation forces.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 Despite a constitutional prohibition against torture, reports
 of torture against suspected opponents of the regime,
 particularly alleged supporters of the popular uprising, were
 extremely numerous in 1991. Insurgents in the south reported
 liberating a number of long-term prisoners, as well as some
 Kuwaiti detainees, who showed the effects of extreme physical
 torture and privation. There were reports of systematic
 torture of prisoners in northern detention centers as well.
 Techniques of physical torture--including burning, electric
 shocks, beatings (to body, feet, and sensitive areas), breaking
 of limbs, and denial of food and water--are said to be
 routinely practiced by the Iraqi security services. The highly
 centralized authority structure of the Iraqi regime indicates
 
 
 1421
 IRAQ
 that torture, along with other egregious rights abuses, is an
 essential component of a policy for domestic control formulated
 at the highest levels of the regime.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Mass arrests were a common Iraqi tactic in repressing the
 popular uprising in March and April. In southern Iraq,
 house-to-house searches in Najaf, Karbala, Nasiriyah, and other
 cities led to the arrest of thousands suspected of taking part
 in opposition activities. The fate of most, including hundreds
 of Shi'a clerics, remains unknown. The 95-year-old Grand
 Ayatollah Abdul Qasim Khoei, a venerated Shi'a figure, is under
 house arrest in Najaf. Khoei was arrested in late March and
 taken to Baghdad, where he was compelled to make proregime
 statements. He is occasionally subjected to the humiliation of
 government-supervised visits by foreign visitors, during which
 he is obliged to express support for the regime. When Khoei
 became seriously ili late in the year, the Government delayed
 nearly 2 weeks before bowing to international pressure and
 allowing an international medical team to treat him. The
 whereabouts of Khoei family members and supporters originally
 taken into custody with him are unknown.
 In the north, Iraqi authorities carried out similar mass
 arrests of civilians during fighting with opposition elements.
 Some detainees were reportedly used as "human shield" hostages
 to deter attacks on government positions. A credible source
 reported that more than 5,000 males, ranging in age from 15 to
 60, were arrested in Kirkuk during March and were used as
 hostages in various areas of the north. Most were believed to
 have been released the following month, although some are
 thought to have been executed shortly after their arrest. Many
 similar incidents were reported during fighting in the south,
 with women and children placed atop tanks which subsequently
 bombarded residential areas. The fate of many detainees
 remains unknown.
 Although there were no known instances of Iraqi citizens being
 exiled abroad, the refusal of Iraqi authorities to-'allow tens
 of thousands of Kurds and Turcomans to return to their homes in
 Kirkuk amounts to a policy of internal exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Iraq maintains a dual judicial system: a system of
 "Revolutionary" and "special-" courts for security offenses, and
 a regular court system for all other charges. Civil, criminal,
 and religious courts which hear ordinary cases embody many
 internationally accepted legal norms. They provide for
 investigation by police and then by an inquiry judge who may
 refer a case to the courts or dismiss it. Trials are open to
 public view, and defendants are entitled to counsel--at
 government expense if the defendant is indigent. Charges and
 evidence are-available for review by the lawyer. Judges try
 criminal cases; there are no juries. Convictions may be
 appealed to the Court of Appeal and then to the Court of
 Cassation, the Supreme Court. There are no Shari'a (Islamic)
 courts as such in.Iraq; however, family courts administer
 Shari'a law according to Iraqi custom.
 Security cases are handled by the Revolutionary Courts, which
 usually conduct closed trials. Security cases include alleged
 espionage and treason as well as other political offenses
 (including peaceful dissent), smuggling, currency exchange
 
 
 1422
 IRAQ
 violations, and drug trafficking. The right of defense in such
 courts is severely restricted. The "special courts"
 constituted by the RCC for specific incidents are also closed.
 These special tribunals are exempt from constitutional
 safeguards of defendants' rights. Defendants are held
 incommunicado, and confessions extracted by torture are
 admissible and often serve as the basis for conviction. In
 theory, appeals may be taken only to the Chairman of the RCC,
 but there are reports of executions shortly after trial.
 Political "dissent" encompasses an extremely wide range of
 activities in Iraq, and thousands have been imprisoned without
 charge or trial, or after trials which do not meet
 international standards of fairness. Since public
 acknowledgement of arrest or imprisonment is rare, it is
 difficult to estimate the number of political prisoners in Iraq.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Iraqi Government's disregard for the right to privacy was
 typified by RCC decree 341 in late 1990, which declared that
 housing a foreigner for the purpose of concealing him or her
 from the authorities was a "crime of espionage" punishable by
 death. Constitutional guarantees of the inviolability of the
 home were totally disregarded by Iraqi military and security
 services in crushing the uprising. Iraq's traditionally broad
 definition of-security offenses" was, in effect, extended to
 exempt Iraqi authorities in virtually all circumstances from
 the legal requirement to obtain a search warrant before
 entering a suspect's home.
 The security services have been known to take reprisals against
 family members of dissidents operating inside or outside the
 country. Many Iraqi-expatriates have 6een intimidated or
 dissuaded from opposition political activity by threats
 against family members who remain in Iraq.
 Despite constitutional safeguards for the confidentiality of
 mail and telegraphic and telephone correspondence, official
 telephone monitoring and'censorship of private mail have long
 been common practice.
 Pervasive networks of informers maintained by the security
 services and ABSP serve to deter dissident activity and
 instill fear of the regime. The government-controlled public
 education system particularly encourages children to inform on
 their parents for suspected antiregime activities.
 g. Use of Excessive Force axid Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 The popular uprising against the Government during March and
 April demonstrated both the desire of the Iraqi people to
 change their government and the lengths to which the regime
 would go fo retain power. Republican Guard and regular army
 units wrought terrible destruction on population centers in
 the north and south with sustained, indiscriminate bombardment
 of residential areas by tanks, heavy artillery, and helicopter
 gunships.
 Civilian casualties were estimated in tens of thousands, with
 many attributed to attacks against masses of fleeing refugees
 in both the north and the south. International human rights
 authorities are investigating reports that hundreds of Kurds
 
 
 1423
 IRAQ
 were rounded up, executed, and buried in mass graves during
 the uprising. International human rights groups are also
 investigating reports that the Iraqi Government executed
 between 100,000 and 300,000 Kurds in a 1988 military campaign
 know as Operation Anfal. Victims were reportedly buried in
 mass graves in remote areas.
 In the south, many sites of unique religious and historical
 importance were heavily damaged by Iraqi attacks. In
 particular, historic Shi'a holy shrines in Najaf and Karbala
 were heavily damaged by artillery, the ancient Shi'a cemetery
 in Najaf was virtually destroyed, and Shi'a mosques and
 libraries were systematically looted. Thousands of
 irreplaceable manuscripts and historical religious texts are
 unaccounted for.
 The Government's response to periodic renewals of opposition
 activity during the year was similarly brutal and
 disproportionate. Minor clashes between Kurdish guerrilla
 fighters and Iraqi military units in northern Iraq in July and
 September led to renewed artillery bombardment of Kirkuk,
 Sulaymaniyah, and numerous other towns in the region.
 Independent observers reported that Iraqi ground units and
 helicopter gunships launched periodic attacks during the
 second half of the year against dissident positions in the
 southern marshes region, including the city of Nasiriyah.
 These military operations are known to have caused thousands
 of civilian casualties, although no precise estimate is
 available. In addition, after suppressing these uprisings,
 the Government took advantage of localized food shortages,
 particularly in the south, and diverted food stocks away from
 disadvantaged civilians as a tactic to increase its control.
 Iraqi government interference with food and fuel shipments
 into the north during the latter months of 1991 caused great
 hardship.
 U.N. authorities and other international observers estimate
 that up to half a million Shi'a remain confined by military
 blockade within the area of the southern marshes. Many are
 believed to be military deserters or persons who took part in
 the uprising.
 The Iraqi authorities failed to comply with U.N. Security
 Council Resolution 688. Adopted in April, the Resolution
 required Iraq to cease repression of civilians and facilitate
 international relief efforts in all parts of the country. A
 Memorandum of Understanding between the Iraqi Government and
 the United Nations on humanitarian relief operations in the
 country similarly provided for the establishment of aid
 centers throughout the country. Nevertheless, Iraqi
 authorities continued to deny relief workers of the U.N. and
 international aid organizations the required access to
 threatened populations in the southern marshes region and the
 northern city of Kirkuk.
 In response to shortages of food and medical care in some
 areas, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolutions 706 and
 712, authorizing a limited sale of Iraqi petroleum to finance
 the import of food, medicine, and essential relief supplies
 under strict international supervision to ensure equitable
 distribution to disadvantaged and vulnerable civilian
 populations and guard against diversion to the military. At
 the end of the year, Iraqi authorities had not yet accepted
 Resolutions 706 and 712, a decision which ensured continued
 deterioration of living conditions.
 
 
 1424
 IRAQ
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedoms of speech and press do not exist in Iraq, and
 political dissent in any form is not tolerated. The
 Government and the ABSP own all print and broadcast media and
 operate them as propaganda outlets for the regime. Opposition
 views are not reported, and the Government. periodically
 attempts to-jam news.broadcasts from outside Iraq (e.g., the
 Voice of -America, the British Broadcasting Corportation, and
 radio stations maintained by Iraqi opposition groups in
 neighboring countries). Some foreign journalists were allowed
 to operate in Iraq far brief periods during the year, but
 govern1ment censors strictly limited trave] and contact with
 the Iraqi people. During the second half of the year, senior
 officials repeatedly promised that new laws increasing press
 freedom would be forthcoming, but no action was taken.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 .Iraqi citizens may not assemble or organize for any political
 purpose other than to support the regime.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 While the ABSP has traditionally sought to submerge religious
 differences through the promotion of secular nationalism,
 affiliation with a religious community remains important for
 most Iraqis. The Government closely regulates Islamic affairs
 under a 1981 law giving the Ministry of Endowments and
 Religious Affairs authority over places of worship,
 appointment of clergy, publication of religious literature,
 and participation in religious councils and meetings. Sunni
 religious leaders function under particularly close official
 supervision and are considered salaried government employees.
 There are no penalties under Iraqi law for conversion from one
 religion to another, although there is a social stigma for
 Muslims who convert.
 International Shi'a organizations view the Iraqi regime's
 physical assault on ancient Shi'a holy sites, despoliation of
 religious libraries and archives, and detention of religious
 leaders as a serious threat to religious freedom and to the
 cultural institutions of Shi'a Islam.
 The Government has been less intrusive into the religious
 affairs of Iraq's Christians, who number more than 300,000.
 Their freedom of worship in churches of established
 denominations is legally protected, but they may not
 proselytize or hold meetings outside church premises.
 The Jewish community has decreased from 150,000 following
 World War II to an estimated 150, all in Baghdad, in early
 1991. There is no recent evidence of overt persecution of
 Jews, but'the regime restricts travel (particularly to Israel)
 and contacts with Jewish groups abroad. One synagogue in
 Baghdad still functions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Within the country, sensitive border areas and numerous
 designated security zones are off-limits to all travelers.
 There are police checkpoints on highways and outside major
 
 
 1425
 IRAQ
 towns. Only inspection teams of the International Atomic
 Energy Agency and the U.N. Special Commission (charged with
 shutting down Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programs and
 dismantling current stocks of such weapons) are authorized to
 travel to any site in Iraq without impediment, as stipulated by
 U.N. Security Council Resolutions 699 and 707.
 The Government has strictly controlled foreign travel by Iraqi
 citizens since the early 1980's. Overall travel controls were
 eased in mid-May, and thousands began leaving Iraq. The.
 unavailability of commercial air transport due to U.N. economic
 sanctions obliged all Iraqi travelers to go overland to Jordan,
 where there were more than 100,000 at year's end. There were
 numerous reports of Iraqi security personnel in Amman harassing
 Iraqi citizens seeking international refugee status or visas
 for onward travel.
 There is no legal ban on emigration or special restrictions for
 members of minority groups, although emigrants often must leave
 behind substantial property because of the difficulty of
 exporting assets. Currency exchange violations are considered
 security offenses, and penalties can be severe. The
 traditional'requirement that a married woman have the
 concurrence of her husband to travel abroad remained in effect.
 The largest population movement during the year was the exodus
 of more than a million refugees from northern and southern Iraq
 due to suppression of the popular rebellion in March and
 April. International intervention in the north-facilitated the
 return during the second half of the year of the vast majority
 of those who had fled to Turkey and Iran.
 However, the Government barred thousands of Kurds and Turcomans
 displaced by the fighting early in the year from returning to
 their homes in Kirkuk. Moreover, there are persistent reports
 that the Government is attempting to alter the ethnic character
 of the city's population by offering incentives to Arab
 families from central Iraq to move to the Kirkuk area and
 occupy land confiscated from Turcomans and Kurds.
 That policy perpetuates the discrimination of past years, in
 which mass forced relocations and government demolition of
 villages denied hundreds of thousands of Kurdish, Assyrian, and
 Turcoman residents of northern Iraq the right to choose their
 places of residence. In the aftermath of the uprising many
 began to reestablish residence on the sites of villages razpd
 by the Government over the past decade. Such resettlement
 efforts have occurred without government approval, particularly
 in the northern and northeastern areas of the country.
 In addition, thousands of Iraqis who fled at the time of the
 uprising--including about 4,000 Assyrians in Turkey and a much
 larger number of Kurdish and Shi'a refugees in Iran--had not
 returned to Iraq as of year's end, owing to fear of government
 reprisal.
 In late 1990, the Government decided to end financial support
 to Iraqi students overseas, resulting in a sharp decline in the
 number of young Iraqis leaving for foreign study and financial
 hardship for Iraqi students already studying abroad. A 1987
 RCC decree, requiring Iraqi students abroad who refused to
 return to Iraq-to reimburse the Government for all education
 received in Iraq or abroad at government expense, remained in
 effect. The decree is ,applicable retroactively to students who
 
 
 1426
 
 IRAQ
 have refused to return since May 16, 1983, when the Government
 began requiring employees leaving government jobs before 20
 years of service to reimburse the State for the cost of their
 education. Amounts due can be recovered by confiscation, and
 nonpayment may-result in imprisonment. Each student must
 provide a guarantor before traveling abroad. The guarantor and
 the student's parents may be held liable if the student fails
 to return.
 Non-Iraqi spouses of Iraqi citizens who have resided in Iraq
 for 5 years must take Iraqi nationality or leave Iraq. Many
 people.have thus been obliged to accept Iraqi citizenship and
 become subject to official travel restrictions. In March 1984,
 an order.by the-RCC reduced the residency period before
 naturalization to 1 year for the spouses of Iraqi citizens
 employed in government offices. The Iraqi spouse faces
 penalties for noncompliance, including loss of job, a
 substantial financial penalty, and repayment of the costs of
 education. Iraq does not recognize-the concept of dual
 nationality, and many Iraqi "dual nationals," especially the
 children of an Iraqi father and a mother of non-Iraqi birth,
 have been denied permission to leave Iraq to visit the country
 of their other nationality.
 Persons of Iraqi nationality with legal residence or
 nationality in another country have generally been permitted to
 enter and depart freely, although on a number of past occasions
 persons who emigrated after 1980 were denied permission to
 depart after entering Iraq for temporary.visits. Some,
 including U.S. citizens, were forcibly conscripted into the
 Iraqi armed forces.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 *to Change Their Government
 Iraqi citizens do not have the right to change their government
 peacefully. Full political participation is confined to
 members of the ABSP,.estimated to number 1 1/2 million, or
 about 8 percent of the population. The ABSP governs the
 country under the provisional Constitution of 1968, with
 legislative and executive authority vested in the RCC. The
 National Assembly and the legislative assembly of the Kurdish
 Autonomous Region are totally subordinate to the executive.
 General elections were last held for the 250-seat National
 Assembly in April 1989.
 Saddam Hussein wields decisive power over all instruments of
 government as President of the Republic, Chairman of the RCC,
 and Secretary General of the Regional (i.e., Iraq-wide) Command
 of the ABSP. He was unanimously reelected to the latter two
 positions during the 10th Congress of the ABSP in September. A
 personal relationship with Saddam Hussein is much more
 important for political advancement than is ABSP membership or
 ideological affiliation, as reflected in the fact that Iraq's
 most powerful officials are all members of the President's
 family or long-time family allies from his home town of Tikrit.
 Along with the ABSP, two small progovernment Kurdish parties
 constitute the Patriotic and Progressive National Front (PNF),
 essentially a vehicle of support for the Government. The-
 Communist Party was removed from the PNF and declared illegal
 in 1979. ABSP membership is not required for appointment to
 senior military or government positions or election to the
 National Assembly but is essential to attain political
 
 
 1427
 IRAQ
 influence. Members of the military or security services may
 engage in political activities only through the ABSP.
 Opposition political organizations are illegal and severely
 repressed.
 In early September the RCC adopted a law nominally authorizing
 the creation of political parties-other than the ABSP.
 Official media trumpeted the measure as a step toward greater
 freedom and democracy; in fact, it reinforced the preeminent
 position of the ABSP by prohibiting parties based on any
 organizing principle other than complete support for Saddam
 Hussein and the present Government. New parties can be based
 only in Baghdad and are barred from having any ethnic or
 religious character, effectively barring natural opposition
 constituencies such as the Shi'a of southern Iraq or the
 Assyrian, Turcoman, and Kurdish communities in the north from
 forming legal political organizations.
 In April the Government entered negotiations with the Kurdish
 leadership aimed at political autonomy for the predominantly
 Kurdish region of northern Iraq. The talks continued through
 the year, but results were inconclusive. Kurdish and other
 opposition sources have stated that negotiations became
 deadlocked over Kurdish insistence on internal democratic
 reforms which the Government rejected.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The one authorized human rights group in Iraq operates under
 official control and routinely corroborates official denials of
 any violations.
 U.N. authorities and human rights organizations sharply
 denounced the Government's flagrant record of human rights
 abuses in 1991. The U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) in
 March called upon Iraq to cease its violations and abide by its
 obligations under international covenants on human rights. In
 May the UNHRC formally appointed a Special Rapporteur to make a
 thorough study of Iraqi violations and report to the 1992 UNHRC
 session. Iraqi authorities promised to assist the Special
 Rapporteur's investigation but declined to give assurance of
 unimpeded access for on-site research in areas of Iraq where
 repression was taking place.
 An Iraqi report to the UNHRC Human Rights Committee in July
 denied any violations in Iraq but failed to address specific
 questions on torture, summary and arbitrary executions,
 disappearances, minority rights, and past use of chemical
 weapons. Later in the month Amnesty International (AI) issued
 a formal call for establishment of a permanent human rights
 monitoring presence in Iraq. The Government did not respond to
 this initiative. The Government also invited AI on April 30 to
 visit northern Iraq to assess the situation but subsequently
 failed to pursue the visit once AI requested broad access to
 government officials and records and to all regions of Iraq, as
 well as the ability to interview and medically examine
 detainees.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The striking cultural, religious, and linguistic diversity of
 Iraqi society is not reflected in the country's political and
 
 
 1428
 IRAQ
 economic structure. Sunni Arabs, who constitute only about 12
 percent of the country's population (excluding migrant Arab
 workers), have effectively controlled Iraq since independence
 in 1932. Shi'a Arabs, who make up. nearly 60 percent of the
 population and-live mainly in the south, have long been
 economically, politically, and socially disadvantaged, and the
 benefits of a decade of intensive government investment in the
 south were obliterated by brutal Iraqi military campaigns
 during the uprising.
 Iraq's 17-percent Kurdish population has traditionally suffered
 extreme political and economic discrimination, despite the
 presence of a small number as figureheads in the Iraqi
 Government. Kurds serve in the Iraqi military, including the
 officer'corps, but are excluded from senior command positions.
 The small but significant Iraqi Christian community has
 traditionally suffered little overt discrimination due to
 religious affiliation. Some churches were targeted by Iraqi
 forces during the uprising, however, and a number of Christians
 who fled to Turkey in the aftermath of the fighting cited both
 oppression by Iraqi authorities and discrimination by the
 north's Kurdish majority as factors in their decision to remain
 in Turkish refugee camps rather than return to an uncertain
 future in Iraq.
 The use of minority languages is unrestricted. Kurdish is an
 official language used by the media and schools in
 predominantly Kurdish areas, although the official curriculum
 disregards Kurdish history and culture. Turcomans publish in
 their dialect of Turkish, and Assyrian Christians often use
 Aramaic as well as Arabic. Citizens considered to be of
 Iranian origin carry special identification. They are often
 precluded from desirable employment.
 The ABSP is formally committed to equality for women, who
 comprise about 20 percent of the Iraqi work force. Laws have
 been enacted to protect women from exploitation in the
 workplace and sexual harassment; grant subsidized maternity
 leave; permit women to join the regular army, Popular Army, and
 police forces; require education for female children; and
 equalize women's rights in divorce, land ownership, taxation,
 suffrage, and election to the National Assembly. Nevertheless,
 married women may still travel abroad only with the permission
 of their husbands.
 Violence against women, such as wife beating and rape, is known
 to occur, but little is known about its extent. Such abuse is
 customarily addressed within the tightly knit Iraqi family
 structure. There is no public discussion of the subject, and
 there are no official statistics. Excessive violence against
 women would be grounds for divorce and criminal charges, but
 suits brought on these charges in Iraq are believed to be rare.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unions independent of government control do not exist in
 Iraq. The trade union organization law of June 2, 1987,
 prescribed a single trade union structure for organized labor.
 Workers in private and mixed enterprises and in
 cooperatives--but not public employees or workers in state
 enterprises--have the right to join a local union committee.
 The committees form trade unions which in turn are part of
 
 
 1429
 IRAQ
 provincial trade union federations. At the top is a single
 umbrella organization, the Iraqi General Federation of Trade
 Unions, which is organically linked to the Ba'ath Party and
 required to promote party principles and policies among union
 members. The General Federation is affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the
 Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions.
 Although workers legally have the right to strike after
 providing notice to the Labor Ministry, no labor strike has
 been reported over the past two decades.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to bargain collectively is not recognized. Salaries
 for public sector workers (i.e., the bulk of the employed) are
 set by the Government. Wages in the much smaller private
 sector are set by employers or negotiated individually with
 workers.
 The Labor Code does not protect workers from antiunion
 discrimination, a failure that has been repeatedly criticized
 by the Committee of Experts of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO).
 There are no export processing zones in Iraq.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Although compulsory labor is prohibited by law, the Popular
 Army (ABSP militia) used press-gang methods to draft recruits
 during and shortly after the war with Iran and again during
 Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
 ILO committees have noted that Iraq's Penal Code allows
 punishment of civil servants with imprisonment, including
 compulsory prison labor,"for breaches of labor discipline,
 including resignation from the job.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of children under age 14 is legally forbidden except
 in small-scale family enterprises, but children are frequently
 encouraged to work as necessary to support the family. The law
 stipulates that employees between the ages of 14 and 18 work
 fewer hours per week than adults.
