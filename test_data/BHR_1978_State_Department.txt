 BAHRAIN
 Historically the most prosperous and cosmopolitan of
 the Arab states in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain is
 governed by an amir and members of his family.
 Bahrain pioneered in devoting oil reserves to social
 welfare, although it is now less well-off than its oil-
 exporting neighbors. Bahrain is characterized by a
 tradition of religious tolerance. Although clashes
 between the roughly equal Shi'a and Sunni Muslim
 communities occurred in the past, the relative absence
 of confessional strife is remarkable.
 Bahrain's educated population includes the region's
 only indigenous industrial proletariat. Therefore,
 there is considerable political and labor activity.
 The Government's attitude toward human rights is a
 mixture of progressive social outlook and strong con-
 cern for state security. The Constitution provides
 strict safeguards for personal liberties and commits
 the state to advancing social welfare, but after a
 brief experiment with representative government the
 ruling Amir in 1975 suspended the elected National
 Assembly.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 In dealing with a small but well-organized radical
 opposition, which carried out a political assassination
 in late 1976, the authorities permitted the torture by
 the police of some persons whom they perceived to be
 involved in the assassination.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Government of Bahrain does not practice cruel,
 inhuman or degrading punishment.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Government of Bahrain employs pre-emptive
 imprisonment in cases involving what it views as
 serious and imminent threats to civil order, as well
 as personal threats to members of the ruling family,
 the diplomatic corps -r religious leaders, The
 Government has defined a threat to civil order to
 include non-violent public protests, but in such cases
 those arrested have been detained a few hours or days.
 In more serious cases, a few persons regarded as
 security threats have been detained for several years.
 These cases have been reviewed quarterly by the courts
 in conformance with provisions of the law. The court
 makes its judgment as to whether the individual must be
 released.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials are usually provided in Bahrain.
 Trials for treason are closed to the public. There
 have been no such trials in the past two years.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The Bahrainiauthorities have searched private premises
 without obtaining a warrant, or following a similar
 safeguard procedure, in extraordinary circumstances
 such as a perceived threat to the security of the
 state, or to the personal security of leaders, foreign
 diplomats or distinguished visitors. Constitutional
 prohibitions against arbitrary invasion of the home
 have been strictly observed in the last two years.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Beginning with the first receipt of oil income forty
 years ago, the Bahraini regime set an example in the
 region by adopting liberal policies in public health
 care and education. Free public health treatment is

 available to all citizens and residents of Bahrain as
 is education through the high school level. In 1975,
 the Government embarked on costly subsidies of basic
 items of consumption and public housing programs for
 low and medium income citizens. A commercial real
 estate boom has intensified the inequality of wealth
 in this essentially free-enterprise community. The
 Government allocates the bulk of its public resources
 (roughly$300 million of its $500 million budget) to
 providing the social welfare benefits guaranteed the
 citizens by the Constitution.
 Virtually no taxes are imposed, and public funds are
 quite equitably distributed. Bahrain takes pride in
 the lack of serious corruption in its public life;
 some does exist, but not to the extent of adversely
 affecting the poor.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and-Assembly
 Bahrainis are personally free to express views
 critical of the Government. However, from time to
 time the press is censored, particularly in discussion
 of Bahrain's relations with other countries. Recent
 examples include editorial comments harshly critical
 of other Arab governments. Religious, ethnic   and
 racial tolerance is characteristic of Bahraini social
 attitudes-and legal practice. The acceptance of
 Bahraini Jews in important roles in the community is
 an example. The status of women in Bahrain is quite
 advanced. Education has long been available to women.
 The Government encourages the participation of women
 in the professional and skilled labor force. A few
 women occupy senior government positions. Women now
 constitute approximately ten percent of the Bahraini
 work force. Although freedom of assembly is guaranteed
 by the Constitution, the Government has on several
 occasions in the past prohibited gatherings which it
 
 
 had deemed threatening to public order or internal
 security. There have been no recent instances of
 such prohibitions.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Bahrainis are free to move within the country, to
 travel abroad and to emigrate.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Representative government suffered a setback with the
 dissolution of the short-lived National Assembly in
 1975. The present lack of representative parliamentary
 institutions is, in part, counterbalanced by the
 relative ease of access of citizens to government
 leaders, particularly the Ruler, who holds regular
 morning meetings open to all citizens. The Cabinet
 traditionally is broadly representative of the
 community.
 For thirty years, Bahrain has had an active labor
 movement, which in the past represented a potent
 political force. Trade unions, however, are illegal.
 Workers are instead organized on an industry-by-
 industry basis into workers' councils. The councils,
 officially recognized by the Government, primarily
 perform social welfare functions for their members and
 maintain contact with management with respect to
 worker grievances.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Amnesty International has followed the cases of more
 than thirty people imprisoned in Bahrain. In
 September 1975, the organization wrote to the Amir
 advocating their release. Subsequently 27 or 28 were
 released. Some'of these have since gone through the
 process of re-arrest and release several times. A
 few remained in prison in 1978.
