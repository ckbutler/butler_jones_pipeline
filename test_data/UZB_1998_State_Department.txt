 UZBEKISTAN
 Uzbekistan is an authortrian state with limited civil rights. The Constitution
 provides for a presidential system with separation of powers between the executive,
 toslative, and judicial branches. In practice President Islam Karimov and the cen-
 tralized executive branch that serves him dominate political life. The executive
 branch dominates the Oly Mals (Parliament) which consists only of members of
 parties that support the President. Despite constitutional provisions for an inde-
 pendent judiciary, the executive branch heavily influences the cours icn both civil
 and criminal cases.
 The Ministry of Interior (MVD) controls the police. The police and other MVD
 forces are responsible f toriostrmal police functions. The National Security Serv-
 ice (NSS)-the former KGB--deals with a broad range of national security ques-
 tions, including corruption, organized crime, and narcotics. The police and the NSS
 committed numerous, serious human rights abuses.
 The Government made incremental improvements to the legislative framework for
 market reform. However, continuing restrictions on currency convertibility and
 other government measures to control economic activity led some international lend-
 ing organizations to suspend or scale back credits. The economy is based primarily
 on agriculture and agricultural processing; Uzbekistan is a major producer and ex-
 porter of cotton. It is also a major producer of gold and has substantial deposits of
 copper, strategic minerals, gas, and oil. The Government has stated that it is com-
 mitted to a gradual transition to a free market economy. It has succeeded in reduc-
 ing inflation and the budget deficit. However, privatization of the large state-owned
 enterprises that account for the bulk of gross domestic product continued to proceed
 slowly, and a host of formal and informal barriers continued to constrain the nas-
 cent private sector.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor, and the Government con-
 tinued to commit serious abuses in several areas. Citizens cannot exercise their
 right to change their government peacefully. The Government has not permitted the
 existence of an opposition party since 1993. Election laws were amended to restrict
 the possibility of any new opposition parties arising or mounting a campaign. Cho-
 sen president in a 1991 election that most observers considered neither free nor fair,
 Karimov had his stay in office extended to 2000 by a 1995 Soviet-style referendum.
 Parliament subsequently voted to make the extension part of Karimov's first term,
 thus making him eligible to run again in 2000. Police and NSS forces used torture,
 harassment, illegal searches, and wiretaps, and arbitrarily detained or arrested op-
 position activists and other citizens on false charges, frequently planting narcotics
 or weapons on them. Police often beat and otherwise mistreat criminal suspects and
 arbitrary arrest and detention are common. Detention can be prolonged and prison
 conditions are poor. Those responsible for documented abuses rarely are punished.
 In the wake of the April and December 1997 murders of several police officials in
 the city of Namangan, police in the Ferghana Valley arrested hundreds-perhaps
 thousands-of citizens suspected of being Islamic extremists or political opponents
 
 
 1609
 of the regime. Many persons were arrested for wearing beards or for other outward
 signs of Islamic piety, but later were released. The police planted contraband on oth-
 ers to justify arrest. Although the aim of the crackdown was clearly more than cap-
 turing those responsible for the crime, among those arrested and tried was the prob-
 able murderer. Defendants at subsequent trials claimed to have been beaten and
 tortured. Significant numbers of reigious beievers were tried and convicted on nar-
 cotics and firearms charges; authorities granted some of them amnesty.
 The judiciary does not always ensure due process and often defers to the wishes
 of the executive branch. The Government severely limits freedom of speech and the
 press, and an atmosphere of repression stifles public criticism of the Government.
 A new law increases government oversight of the media. Although the Constitution
 expressly prohibits it, press censorship continues and the Government sharply re-
 stricts citizens' access to foreign media. The Government limits freedom of assembly
 and association. The Government continues to ban unauthorized public meetings
 and demonstrations. The Government also continues to deny registration to inde-
 pendent political parties as well as to other groups that might be critical of the Gov-
 ernment. For example, the Government denied registration to the Human Rights
 Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU), citing technical deficiencies in its application. Unreg-
 istered opposition parties and movements may not operate freely or publish their
 views. The Government limits freedom of religion, and two new laws may further
 restrict this right. One requires all congregations and sects to reregister under tight-
 er criteria. The other imposes tougher penalties for groups that violate laws restrict-
 ing religious activities. The Government harassed and arrested Islamic leaders and
 believers on questionable grounds, citing the threat of extremism. While the Govern-
 ment tolerates large Christian denominations, it continues to inhibit the activity of
 smaller evangelical Christian sects, at times denying them registration. There were
 cases in which university authorities expelled female students for wearing Islamic
 dress. Despite a constitutional prohibition, there continues to be significant tradi-
 tional societal discrimination and domestic violence against women. There are some
 limits on worker rights.
 The Government continues to voice rhetorical support for human rights, but does
 not ensure these rights in practice. Although the election, religion, and media laws
 contain elements that theoretically support human rights, in reality the Govern-
 ment does not respect such provisions. The office of the human rights ombudsman,
 which was formed in 1997, reports that it is assisting hundreds of citizens in re-
 dressing human rights abuses; however, most of these appear minor. In September
 the ombudsman formed a Consultative Committee on Human Rights and invited a
 variety of Uzbek and foreign observers to join; a number accepted, but by year's end
 it had not met. After some hesitation, the Government permitted the opening of four
 private radio stations in January.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed reports of
 political or other extrajudicial killings.
 An outspoken Muslim cleric, Qobil Murodov, was arrested in early October and
 died in prison in Tashkent on October 30. Murodov's body showed severe bruising,
 his teeth were knocked out, and his collarbone and several ribs were broken. Offi-
 cials alternately claimed that he had accidentally fallen from a wall or that other
 prisoners had beaten him. He was arrested for possession of narcotics and for teach-
 ing religion without permission. He had not been tried at the time of his death. At
 year's end, there was no indication that the Government intended to investigate the
 circumstances of his death. Murodov was the deputy of Abidkhon Nazarov, who dis-
 appeared in March (see Section 1.b.).
 There were no reported developments in the 1995 killing of Bokhtiar Yakubov, a
 witness linked to an opposition activist.
 b. Disappearance.-A   leading independent Islamic cleric, Imam     Abidkhon
 Nazarov, has been missing since March 5, when dozens of police and NSS agents
 raided and searched his home. Although his family claims that the security services
 abducted him, the Government asserts that he fled to avoid arrest.
 There were no reported developments in the 1995 disappearance of Imam
 Abduvali Mirzaev, the 1997 disappearance of his assistant, Nematjon Parpiev, or
 the 1992 disappearance of Abdullah Utaev, leader of the Uzbekistan chapter of the
 outlawed Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP). Most independent observers believe that
 the three missing Islamic activists are either dead or in NSS custody.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law prohibits these practices, police routinely beat and otherwise mis-
 
 
 1610
 treat detainees to obtain confessions. Both police and the NSS used beatings and
 harassment against citizens.
 In trials during the summer of persons suspected of involvement in the murder
 of Namangan officials, at least four defendants claimed that their confessions had
 been extracted by torture or-beating. In a trial that ended on July 6, Nosir Yusupov
 stated that the police used electric shocks during questioning. Co-defendant Isroil
 Parpiboev told the court that in addition to using electric shocks, the police had de-
 nied him food, doused himwith cold water, and forced him-to stand naked outside
 in the winter cold.
 Family members of the ' Namangan 11," a group of young men who, evidence sug-
 gests strongly, were accused falsely of belonging to a Namangan city gang that com-
 mitted a murder and several robberies, continued to protest the court's conviction.
 Lawyers at the 1996 hearing presented evidence that the defendants' confessions
 were obtained by beatings. At year's end, the authorities had taken no further ac-
 tion.
 Prison conditions are poor, and worse for male than for female prisoners. Due to
 limited resources, prison overcrowding is a problem. Reportedly there are severe
 shortages of food and medicines. Political prisoners often are not allowed visitors or
 any othier direct form of contact with famiy and friends. The Government operates
 labor camps, but conditions of incarceration appear to be less severe than in prisons.
 The Government does not routinely permit prison visits by human rights monitors
 such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, although foreign diplomats
 occasionally have obtained access in specific cases.
 d. Arbitray Arrest, Detention, or Exile.--Security forces continued to arrest and
 detain citizens arbitrarily. A Soviet-era detention law provides that police may hold
 a person suspected of committing a crime for up to 3 days. At the end of this period,
 the suspect must either be charged officially or released. A prosecutor's order is re-
 quired for arrests but not for detentions. A court case must be scheduled within 15
 days of arrest and the defendant may be detained during this period. A defendant
 may not have access to counsel while in detention but only after formal arrest.
 Delays between arrest and trial can be lengthy. For example Oqihon Ziehonov, a
 practicing Muslim detained on January 18, was not tried until late September.
 In practice police arbitrarily stop and detain individuals, whether dissidents or
 not, without warrant or just cause. In the repression in the Ferghana Valley, arrests
 and detentions numbered at least in the hundreds and possibly in the thousands.
 Although it appeared that the vast majority of these persons were released, there
 was no reliable information about the number of individuals held at year's end. Ac-
 cording to a domestic human rights group, some were charged with crimes and are
 awaiting trial. The police routinely planted small amounts of narcotics or ammuni-
 tion on citizens to justify their arrest. The police also based dozens of arrests on
 the mere fact that the individuals wore beards, a traditional sign of Islamic piety.
 In a trial that ended on June 5, Rakhim Turgunov was convicted of involvement
 in the 1997 Namangan murder plots, although he had been in prison since 1995.
 Turgunov claimed the police beat him to obtain a confession.
 In a case in January, Abdulkhai and Murad Ergamberdiev were convicted of pos-
 session of marijuana and a grenade. The police allegedly had failed in one attempt
 to plant narcotics on one of the men when his trousers turned out to be missing
 a pocket. The drugs fell into the street and the police were forced to repeat the at-
 tempt, this time successfully, a few days later. There haye been dozens, if not hun-
 dreds, of similar cases in which individuals were arrested and convicted on the basis
 of allegedly planted evidence.
 In February the police detained approximately 110 women who were attempting
 to conduct a protest in front of the presidential office building. The women were re-
 leased quickly and one was fined.
 Islamic teacher Rahmatjon Otaqulov was charged and convicted of the illegal pos-
 session of narcotics and ammunition. in June 1997, despite his defense attorney's ef-
 fective questioning of the credibility of the arresting officers and witnesses. Otaqulov
 was released from prison on August 10 and the remainder of his 3 2-year sentence
 was converted into a fine. A second Islamic teacher, Olimjon Gafurov, received a 1-
 year prison term in 1997 for illegal possession of narcotics and arms; there was no
 further information available on his case.
 There were no public results of the internal NSS investigation into the August
 1996 detention of the local Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representative.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution provides for an inde-
 pendent judicial authority, the judicial branch takes its direction from the executive
 branch and has little independence in practice. Under the Constitution, the Presi-
 dent appoints all judges for 10-year terms. They may be removed for crimes or fail-
 
 
 1611
 
 ure to fulfill their obligations. Power to remove judges for failure to fulfill their obli-
 gations rests with the President, except for Supreme Court judges, whose removal
 must also be confirmed by Parliament.
 There is a three-tier court system: the people's court on the district level; the re-
 gional courts; and the Supreme Court. District and regional court decisions may be
 appealed to the next level within 10 days of a ruling. The Criminal Code reduces
 the list of crimes punishable by death to murder, espionage, and treason, eliminat-
 ing the economic crimes punishable by death in the former Soviet code. Officially
 and in recent practice, most court cases are open to the public but may be closed
 in exceptional cases, such as those involving state secrets, rape, or young defend-
 ants.
 Uzbekistan still uses the Soviet practice of trial by a panel of three judges: one
 professional judge and two "people's assessors" who are chosen by the workers' col-
 lectives for a period of 2Y2 years. However in practice, judges often defer to the Gov-
 ernment and its prosecutors on legal and other matters. The judge presides and di-
 rects the proceedings. Defendants have the right to attend the proceedings, confront
 witnesses, and present evidence. The State provides a lawyer without charge, but
 by law the accused also has the right to hire an attorney. The Ministry of Justice
 neither pays private lawyers nor provides them with facilities; it no longer super-
 vises private lawyers. Although law enforcement officials may impede access to law-
 yers and fail to inform defendants of their right to counsel, they do not deny access
 outright
 In the autumn trial of Oqihon Ziehenov and four other defendants in the
 Tashkent city court, defense lawyers challenged the impartiality of the professional
 judge and four times officially requested his replacement. They protested unfair tel-
 evision coverage of the defendants and received a formal apology from the television
 station. In court they vigorously cross-examined the State's witnesses. The defend-
 ants were Muslim believers allegedly associated with the missing Imam Abidkhon
 Nazarov (see Section 1.b.). All defendants were charged with participating in a con-
 spiracy subversive to the constitutional order (Article 159) as well as several lesser
 crimes. Despite the relatively vigorous defense, the judge's verdict accepted the pros-
 ecution's case without exception, making little mention of the defense witnesses and
 arguments. Sentences ranged from 4/ years in prison (reduced by presidential am-
 nesty to 2 years) to 12 years' imprisonment.
 Detainees deemed not to be violent may be released on their own recognizance
 pending trial. No money need be posted as bond, but in such cases the accused usu-
 ally must sign a pledge not to leave the city.
 In practice most defense lawyers are unskilled at defending their clients. Courts
 often do not allow all defense witnesses to be heard and written documents are
 given more weight than courtroom witnesses. In the Namangan trial that ended on
 June 5, defense attorneys limited their involvement to pleading for mercy for their
 clients, accepting at face value the confessions extracted by the police. The Supreme
 Court tried the main group of alleged Namangan conspirators, including the prob-
 able murderer. By selecting the Supreme Court as the court of first instance, the
 defendants were denied the right of appeal. Defense lawyers failed to challenge the
 Government's case by cross-examining any of the witnesses.
 The HRSU listed a total of 47 political prisoners of whom 5 died and "several"
 were released. Many were associated with the Birlik or Erk opposition parties of the
 early 1990's, or were involved in independent Islamic activities. Many were con-
 victed of nonpolitical offenses such as tax evasion, misappropriation of funds, or ille-
 gal possession of narcotics or firearms. It is widely believed that arresting officers
 planted the incriminating material. The authorities released nine individuals be-
 lieved to be political prisoners in 1996, but none has been released since that time.
 The Government granted amnesty to a number of Islamic activists arrested and
 convicted on narcotics or weapons charges. Abduraub Gafurov still remains impris-
 oned, after MVD officials illegally closed his trial in 1996. Foreign officials at-
 tempted unsuccessfully to observe the trial. Gafurov was scheduled for release in
 May, but his jail sentence was extended an additional 3 years based on testimony
 from fellow prisoners.
 The Government denies that it holds political prisoners.
 fE Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires that search warrants be issued by a procurator. There is no provision for
 a judicial review of warrants. In the search of Imam Abidkhon Nazarov's home (see
 Section 1.b.), police had no warrant. No legal mechanism exists for authorizing tele-
 phone wire tapping or monitoring. Security agencies routinely monitor telephone
 calls and employ surveillance and wiretaps in the cases of persons involved in oppo-
 sition political activities.
 
 
 1612
 Article 9 of the new religion law (see Section 2.c.) prohibits private teaching of
 religious principles. A number of students reportedly were expelled from school for
 wearing religious dress (see Section 2.c.). Police arrested dozens of men who wore
 beards, a traditional sign of Islamic piety (see Sections 1.d. and 2.c.). Several stu-
 dents from Tashkent's Institute of Oriental Studies brought suit in civil court
 against school officials to be reinstated, but were unsuccessful.
 The Government does not allow general distribution of foreign newspapers (with
 the exception of two or three very conservative Russian newspapers) and other pub-
 lications. However, limited numbersof foreign periodicals appear in Tashkent's two
 major hotels, and authorized groups can obtain foreign periodicals through subscrip-
 tion. The publication of local editions of Izvestia and Pravda and the sale of their
 Moscow editions remained suspended. The authorities jam Russian news broadcasts
 when they are critical of the Government. During the Taliban offensive in northern
 Afghanistan in August, the Government jammed Russian news broadcasts in south-
 ern Uzbekistan (see Section 2.a.).
 Opposition activist and former vice president Shukrullo Mirsaidov remained evict-
 ed from his home, following the Government's politically motivated confiscation of
 his property.
 Section 2. Respect for 'Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides-for "freedom
 of thought, speech, and convictions," the Government continues to limit these rights
 severely.
 A 1991 law against "offending the honor and dignity of the President" limits the
 ability to criticize the President. Ordinary citizens remain afraid to express views
 critical of the President and the Government in public. A new mass media law that
 came into effect in January provides-for freedom of expression, protects the rights
 of journalists, and reiterates the'ban on censorship. Nonetheless, several articles of
 the law, and the lack of due process provided for in their implementation, allow the
 Government to use the law to silence critics. One provision makes journalists re-
 sponsible for the accuracy of the information contained in their news stories, poten-
 tially subjecting them to criminal prosecution if a government official disagrees with
 a news report. Another permits authorities to close media outlets without a court
 judgement. Yet another prohibits stories that incite religious confrontation and eth-
 nic discord. Authorities have prosecuted dissidents for violating similar provisions
 in other laws. Finally, the law prohibits the registration of organizations whose pur-
 poses include subverting or overthrowing the constitutional order (see Section 2.b.).
 A resolution passed in July by the Cabinet of Ministers as part of the implemen-
 tation of the media law requires all media outlets to register by January 1, 1999.
 A 17-member interdepartmental government commission is empowered to grant or
 deny registration. A media organization must provide information about the in-
 tended content or programming, sources of funding, means of distribution, founders,
 and sponsors. In order to be registered, broadcasters must now pay higher annual
 fees and must conform to certain technical standards.
 Information remains very tightly controlled. Although the Constitution prohibits
 censorship, it is widely practiced and the Government tolerates little, if any, criti-
 cism of its actions. For example, by intimidating advertisers and newsstands, the
 NSS put the newspaper Suhbatdosh (from Shahrisabz near Samarkand) out of busi-
 ness, according to its editor. The journal had published articles critical of local lead-
 ers. The last opposition newspaper to be published was that of the Erk party. In
 1993 it was banned and has not been published since.
 There are no private publishing houses, and government approval is required for
 all publications.
 Newspapers may not be printed without the approval of the Committee for the
 Control of State Secrets. All newspapers are printed by state-owned printing houses,
 which refuse to print any newspaper whose editor does not confirm that the Com-
 mittee has cleared the issue a few hours before being submitted. Journalists who
 want to ensure that their work is published practice self-censorship.
 The Uzbekistan Information Agency cooperates closely with the presidential staff
 to prepare and distribute all officially sanctioned news and information. Nearly all
 newspapers are government owned and controlled; the key newspapers are organs
 of government ministries. Private persons and journalist collectives may not estab-
 lish newspapers unless they meet the media law's standards for establishment of
 a "mass media organ," including founders acceptable to the Government. Nonethe-
 less, two private newspapers (one in Samarkand and one in Tashkent) are per-
 mitted to operate without censorship. They have no editorial content and consist of
 advertisements, horoscopes, and similar features.
 
 
 1613
 Limited numbers of foreign periodicals are available, but the Government does
 not allow the general distribution of foreign newspapers (see Section 1.f.). The Gov-
 ernment does not permit rebroadcast of Russian news programming by private tele-
 vision stations. Four state-run channels that fully support the Government and its
 policies dominate television broadcasting. A cable television joint venture between
 the state broadcasting company and a foreign company broadcasts the Hong Kong-
 based Star television channels, including the British Broadcasting Corporation
 (BBC), Deutsche Welle, and Cable News Network world news, to Tashkent and a
 few other locations. Access to cable television is beyond the financial ability of most
 citizens.
 There are between 30 and 40 privately owned local television stations and 4 pri-
 vately owned radio stations. In January the first two radio stations opened, but the
 Government quickly closed them. However, at least in part in response to inter-
 national criticism of the closing, the Government allowed   to reopen a week
 later. Generally, broadcasters practice self-censorship and enjoy some leeway in re-
 porting criticaly on local government. Samarkand Independent Television, which
 operates four channels, is known for such reporting. It is clearly sensitive to political
 concerns from the Government and concentrates on nonpolitical news, yet it denies
 that it is censored formally.
 The Urench-based independent television station, repeatedly closed by local gov-
 ernmentbut reopened in 1997 after winning national court appeals, was licensed
 and is operating.
 Private radio and television broadcasters formed anrt dependent association in
 June (ANESMI). The association resisted both generous incentives and heavy pres-
 sure from the Government to elect the Government's candidate as chairman. Gov-
 ernment officials openiy threatened members of the group and the opposition can-
 didate who was elected. By year's end, the Government twice had denied ANESMI's
 application for registration as a professional association and Justice Ministry offi-
 cials reportedly advised the group privately that it never will be registered.
 ANESMI's ability to attract international funding and operate legally has been ef-
 fectively restricted.
 Many observers fear that some of the radio and television stations may not be
 able to meet the new mass media law's requirements for registration. In particular,
 observers fear that the new annual broadcasting fees and required technical stand-
 ards may force many of these stations out of business. The high fees have discour-
 aged several entrepreneurs who sought to open radio stations. The Commission
 issued no outright denials of registration to television or radio stations; however,
 delays in the burdensome registration procedure forced five commercial television
 stations to suspend operations. By year's end, two of them had been registered. The
 delays do not appear to have been politically motivated.
 Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Voice of America are not permitted to
 broadcast from within the country, despite the Government's 1992 contractual
 agreement to allow this activity. Permission for the British Broadcasting Corpora-
 tion radio to broadcast from within the country was reduced from 3 to 2 hours per
 day in December. Moreover, the Government informed the station that as of Janu-
 ary 1999, it would be required to broadcast on a very low FM frequency, that most
 radios would not be able to receive. One of the private Tashkent radio stations (My
 Town) began rebroadcasting BBC programming on December 15, but was closed by
 the authorities after 3 days.
 The Government has granted academic institutions increased autonomy, but free-
 dom of expression still is limited. Most institutions are modernizing their curricu-
 lums, but up-to-date textbooks are difficult to find.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly; however, it also states that the authorities have the
 right to suspend or ban rallies, meetings, and demonstrations on security grounds.
 The Government must approve demonstrations, but does not grant permits to dem-
 onstrators routinely. In January police detained and fined approximately 100
 women in Islamic dress who intended to march on the presidential office building.
 The women were protesting repression in the Ferghana Valley and government in-
 terference in Islamic religious teaching.
 The Constitution provides for the right of freedom of association, but the Govern-
 ment limits the exercise of this right by refusing to register opposition political par-
 ties and movements opposed to the established order. The Constitution places broad
 limitations on the types of groups that may form and requires that all organizations
 be registered formally with the Government in accordance with procedures pre-
 scribed by law. A 1996 analysis of the law on political parties by foreign legal ob-
 servers concluded that, while it provides protections for minority parties and per-
 mits a wide range of fund raising, it also gives the Ministry of Justice broad powers
 
 
 1614
 to interfere with parties and to withhold financial and legal support from those op-
 posed to the Government. Independent observers believe that the Government in-
 tends to make it more difficult to form and register parties. The process for govern-
 ment registration of NGO's and other public associations is also difficult and time
 consuming, with many opportunities for obstruction. Although unregistered organi-
 zations often can disseminate literature, hold meetings, and use letterhead station-
 ery without government interference, they have no real access to the media or gov-
 ernment since they do not exist legally.
 The Law on Public Associations as well as the Law on Political Parties prohibits
 registration of organizations whose purpose includes subverting or overthrowing the
 constitutional order, as well as organizations whose names already are registered.
 Officials used the latter provision to block human rights NGO's and independent po-
 litical parties from registering by creating another NGO or party with the identical
 name.
 The Government has refused to register two of the major independent human
 rights organizations. The Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU), a group
 with close ties to exiled opposition figures, has sought registration unsuccessfully
 since 1992. Independent observers believe that the Government's refusal to register
 the HRSU is politically motivated. The Independent Human Rights Organization of
 Uzbekistan (IHROU), headed by longtime human rights activist Mikhail Ardzinov,
 held its founding organization meeting (kurultai) and filed registration papers in
 1997, but the Government has not as yet acted on its application. In both cases,
 the Government claims that the registration applications had technical deficiencies
 in their paperwork. The Government has registered only one human rights NGO,
 the Committee for Protection of Individual Rights, which was formed with govern-
 ment support in 1996.
 In earlier years, the Government repeatedly denied the attempts of the Birlik
 movement and the Erk party to register. Most of the leaders of these organizations
 have gone into voluntary exile, and these organizations made no attempt to register
 during the year, reportedly because their remaining adherents were afraid of gov-
 ernment reprisais.
 The Constitution and a 1991 amendment to the law on political parties ban those
 of a religious nature. Authorities cite this principle in denying registration to reli-
 gious parties, including the IRP. Other opposition activists have announced the for-
 mation of the Adolat-True Path Party but never pursued formal registration, claim-
 ing that their members also are afraid of government reprisals.
 Nonpoitil associations and social organizations usually may register, although
 complicated rules and a cumbersome government bureaucracy often make the proc-
 ess difficult. Some evangelical churches (see Section 2.c.) found it difficult to obtain
 registration or reren tratio
 c. Freedom of Reigon.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and for
 the principle of separation of religion and state; however, in practice the Govern-
 ment perceives unofficial Islamic groups or mosques as threats and sharply restricts
 their activities. The Government permits Jewish groups, the Russian Orthodox
 Church, and several other Christian denominations, such as Catholics and
 Lutherans, to worship freely. Despite  e principle of separation of church and state,
 the government-controlled Spiritual Directorate for Muslims funds some Islamic re-
 ligious activities.
 On May 1, the Parliament passed two laws that have the potential to restrict reli-
 gious activity. The Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organizations re-
 places the previous religion law of the same name. It provides for the right to free-
 dom of worship, freedom from religious persecution, separation of church and state,
 and the right to establish schools and train clergy. However, the law also restricts
 religious rights that conflict with national security, prohibits proselytizing, bans re-
 ligious subjects in school curriculums, prohibits private teaching of religious prin-
 ciples, forbids the wearing of religious clothing in public by anyone except clerics,
 and requires religious groups to obtain a license to publish or distribute materials.
 The law also requires that all religious groups and congregations register or rereg-
 ister following stricter criteria. In particular each group must present a membership
 list showing at least 100 Uzbek citizen members. This provision enables the Govern-
 ment to ban any group simply by denying its registration petition. Government offi-
 cials designed the law to target Muslims worshiping outside the system of state or-
 ganized mosques. At year's end, the Government had registered approximately
 1,250 religious congregations and organizations 1,140 of which are mosques. In sev-
 eral instances, it granted exemptions from the requirement of having 100 Uzbek
 members to foreign Christian groups and other small congregations.
 The second law consists of a   series of revisions to the criminal and civil codes,
 which stiffen the penalties for violating the religion law and other statutes on reli-
 
 
 1615
 gious activities. It provides punishments for activities such as organizing a banned
 religious group, persuading others to join such a group, and drawing minors into
 a religious organization without the permission of their parents.
 Although authorities tolerate many Christian evangelical groups, the Government
 often harasses those that openly try to convert Muslims to Christianity. Although
 the distribution of religious literature by duly registered central offices of religious
 organizations is legal, missionary activity and proselytizing is not. Some evangelical
 churches found it difficult to obtaln registration and reregistration (see Section 2.b.).
 Evangelical leader Denis Podorozhny, head of the Word of Faith congregation, con-
 tinued to try to regain the registration his group lost in 1994, despite having twice
 been arrested in 1996 and spending 12 days in jail. Mission of Mercy head Olga
 Avetisova tried for 7 years to register her Christian Humanitarian Association de-
 spite receiving death threats from local officials in 1996. She finally left the country
 late that year. Pastor Rashid Turibayev of the Karakalpak Full Gospel Christian
 Church was sentenced to 2 years of hard labor in 1997 for leading illegal church
 services, but was granted amnesty and released in February.
 The Government seeks to control the Islamic hierarchy, the content of imams' ser-
 mons, and the volume and substance of published Islamic materials. The Govern-
 ment claims that such actions are necessary to counter the allegedly destabilizing
 influence of extremist Islamic forces. The Government is dedicated to preventing the
 spread of ultra-conservative varieties of Sunni Islam, which it labels "Wahhabism."
 President Karimov has spoken frequently and emphatically about the Governmenfs
 opposition to Wahhabism or anything that it perceives as extremist Islam. Dissident
 Islamic figures deny that they are extremists and claim that they are being per-
 secuted for their unwillingness to praise the Government's actions "slavishly." At
 the beginning of the year, the Government ordered the removal of loudspeakers
 from mosques in order to prevent the public broadcasting of morning and evening
 calls to prayer. The Government closed several hundred nonauthorized mosques
 during the year.
 The security services have detained and harassed Muslim leaders for perceived
 acts of insubordination and independence. Authorities have extended the sentence
 of imprisoned Islamic Muslim activist Abduraub Gafurov, although he was sched-
 uled for release in March based on "testimony" by fellow inmates. The government-
 appointed mufti has not reinstated several independent-minded clerics whom he
 fired in 1996. The Andijon Friday mosque, where missing Imam Abduvali Kori
 Mirzaev (see Section 1.b.) formerly preached, was closed by the Government in mid-
 1995 and remains closed.
 On December 29, the Supreme Court handed down sentences of from 5 to 16 years
 to a group of 15 alleged associates of missing Andijon Imam Mirzaev. Most con-
 fessed in full or part to the Government's charges of robbery, murders, terrorism,
 and conspiracy against the constitutional order, but human rights observers be-
 lieved that the Government persuaded some members of the group to confess to con-
 spiracy and terrorism in order to discredit Mirzaev.
 Human Rights Watch has compiled a list of 20 confirmed and 35 unconfirmed
 cases in which university and secondary school students have been expelled for
 wearing religious dress (see Section 1.f.). Several students from Tashkent's Institute
 of Oriental Studies brought suit in civil court against school officials to be rein-
 stated, but were unsuccessful. In the Ferghana Valley, numerous young men were
 arrested for wearing beards or showing other signs of conservative Islam (see also
 Sections 1.d. and 1.f.).
 There is no pattern of official discrimination against Jews. Synagogues fimction
 openly; Hebrew education (long banned under the Soviets), Jewish cultural events,
 and the publication of a community newspaper take place undisturbed. However,
 many Jews are emigrating because of the perception of bleak economic prospects
 and their connection to families abroad.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for free movement within the country and
 across its borders, and the Government generally respected these rights. The Gov-
 ernment requires citizens to obtain exit visas for foreign travel or emigration, but
 grants these permits routinely.
 The Government issues new passports in place of the old Soviet ones for citizens
 traveling overseas. For purely internal travel, the old passports remain valid until
 2000. The new passports serve as both internal identity cards and, when properly
 certified, as external passports.
 Movement within the country of foreigners with valid visas generally is unre-
 stricted. However, visitors require special permission to travel to certain areas, such
 as Termez, on the Afghan border.
 
 
 1616
 
 A number of Uzbek human rights activists were able to enter and leave the coun-
 try without encountering problems from the Government.
 The law on citizenship stipulates that citizens do not lose their citizenship if they
 reside overseas. However, since Uzbekistan does not provide for dual citizenship,
 those acquiring other citizenship lose Uzbek citizenship. If they return to the coun-
 try as foreign citizens, they are subject to foreign visa regulations. There is no evi-
 dence that anyone was denied permission to return.
 I There is no law concerning the rights of refugees and asylum seekers, and the
 Government does not recognize the right of first asylum. The Government considers
 asylum seekers from Tajikistan and Afghanistan to be economic migrants, and such
 individuals are subject to harassment and bribe demands when seeking to regular-
 ize their status. They may be deported if their residency documents are not in order.
 The country hosts populations of ethnic Koreans, Meskhetian Turks, Germans,
 Greeks, an Crimean Tartars deported to Central Asia by Stalin during World War
 II. These groups enjoy the same rights as other citizens. Although they are free to
 return to their ancestral homelands, absorption problems in several of those coun-
 tries have slowed that return. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) estimates that there are 30,000 Tajik and 8,000 Afghan asylum seekers,
 of whom 3,600 have filed asylum requests with the UNHCR and 1,050 have received
 mandate refugee status.
 - The Government forced two Afghan refugees to return to Afghanistan; however,
 another Afghan refugee (with the 'help of the UNHCR), successfully a ppealed in
 court the Government's decision to deport him. The court rescinded the deportation
 order and instead levied a fine, which the refugee also is appealing.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 While the Constitution provides for this right, in reality citizens cannot change
 their government, through peaceful and democratic means. The Government severely
 represses opposition groups and individuals and applies strict limits on freedom of
 expression. No opposition groups participated in government or were allowed to
 function legally.
 The Government is highly centralized and ruled by a strong presidency. President
 Karimov, formerly the first secretary of the Communist Party in Uzbekistan under
 Soviet rule, was elected in-a limited multicandidate election in 1991. A 1995 Soviet-
 style referendum and subsequent parliamentary decision extended Karimov's term
 until the year 2000- President  Karimov and the executive branch retain control
 through sweeping decree powers, primary authority for drafting legislation, and con-
 trol of virtually all government appointments, most aspects of the economy, and the
 security forces.
 Most government officials are members of the People's Democratic Party of
 Uzbekistan (PDP), formerly the Communist Party-and still the country's largest
 party. However, the party as such does not appear to play a significant role in the
 Government, and the President resigned his chairmanship of the party in 1996.
 The 1995 parliamentary elections were limited to candidates and parties (the PDP
 and one other government-sponsored party) that support the President. Since then
 two other government-sponsored parties have been created and entered Parliament
 through unchallenged by-elections and other arrangements. The Oliy Majlis is con-
 stitutionally the highest government body. In practice despite assistance efforts by
 international donors to upgrade its ability to draft laws independently, its main pur-
 pose is to confirm laws and other decisions drafted by the executive branch rather
 than to initiate legislation.
 New laws governing the conduct of parliamentary and presidential elections, as
 well as a law creating a Central Election Commission, came into effect during the
 year. These laws, combined with the 1997 law on political parties, make it ex-
 tremely difficult for opposition parties to come into existence, to nominate can-
 didates, and to campaign. The procedures to register a candidate are burdensome
 and the Central Election Commission has authority to deny registration. For exam-
 ple, a presidential candidate is prohibited from campaigning before being registered,
 but must present a list of 150,000 signatures in order to be registered. The Central
 Election Commission must deny registration of presidential candidates who are
 found to "harm the health and morality of the people." The new statutes, deleted
 a previous provision allowing recourse to the Supreme Court to candidates whose
 parties are denied registration. The Ministry of Justice has the right to suspend
 parties for up to 6 months without a court order. Candidates may meet with voters
 only in forums organized by precinct election commissions. The new laws repeal the
 right of parties to fund their candidates' campaigns directly. Instead, parties must
 turn over all campaign money to the Central Election Commission that then distrib-
 
 
 1617
 
 utes the funds equally among the candidates. Only the Central Election Commission
 may prepare and release presidential campaign posters.
 The Government does not officially forbid membership in any political organiza-
 tion. However, individuals whose names are linked with unregistered, opposition-
 connected organizations report that they are subject to telephonic and written har-
 assment and discrimination in the workplace. Harassment and surveillance of Is-
 lamic dissidents continue.
 The leading opposition activist still residing in the country, former vice president
 Shukrullo Mirsaidov, has been subject to severe harassment. He and his family
 have suffered abductions, eviction, and surveillance in recent years. Mirsaidov has
 not regained possession of his confiscated property and is living in other facilities.
 Authorities have announced no progress on the investigation of his 1995 abduction,
 or the 1996 abduction of his son, Hasan. However, the Government now ignores him
 because he is regarded as being uninterested in further political activity.
 Traditionally, women participate much less than men in government and politics.
 However, the number of female deputies in parliament grew from 13 to 40 (of 250
 deputies) from 1997 to 1998 through uncontested by-elections. There are 2 women
 (both with the rank of deputy prime minister) among 28 members of the Cabinet;
 1 is specifically charged with women's issues.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally disapproves of local nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's) working on human rights and restricts their operations. Local NGO's face
 many legal and bureaucratic obstacles.
 The Government has denied registration to the main human rights organizations
 (see Section 2.b.). Members of these organizations report that the Government con-
 tinues to harass and intimidate them even as individuals. The chairman of the
 HRSU, Abdumannob Polat, lives in voluntary exile outside the country. Despite ini-
 tially refusing in 1997 to grant a return visa to Polat, the Government has allowed
 him to visit and consult with officials twice in the past 2 years. Both trips were un-
 eventful.
 During the year, the Ministry of Justice twice refused to register the IHROU. The
 Government claims that the IHROU has not satisfied all registration requirements.
 After years of opposition and delay, the Government registered one human rights
 NGO in 1996. The registered NGO, the Committee for Protection of Human Rights,
 was formed with the support of the Government, but has ties to opposition figures
 as well. It reportedly has had some success in investigating abuses and persuading
 the Government to correct them. Some sources affiliated with other groups have
 questioned its independence from the Government.
 One international human rights group, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, has per-
 mission to operate in the country and has had an office in Tashkent since 1996.
 In the past, the Government sharply criticized international human rights groups
 and Western and Russian reporters for what it considered biased reporting on
 human rights in the country. The Government has continued to reject criticism from
 Moscow-based sources, but in 1996 announced its willingness to hold an open dialog
 with international human rights NGO's. Such a dialog has not yet materialized.
 Since 1997 there has been a human rights ombudsman's office affiliated with the
 Parliament The ombudsman may make recommendations to modify or uphold deci-
 sions of state agencies, but the recommendations are not binding. The ombudsman
 is prohibited from investigating disputes within the purview of the courts. The om-
 budsman replaced the parliamentary human rights commissioner, who had insuffi-
 cient trained staff to carry out in-depth investigations of human rights violations
 and did not vigorously pursue allegations against the police and security forces. The
 office of the ombudsman reports that it is assisting hundreds of citizens in redress-
 ing human rights abuses, most of which appear minor. Observers are aware of few
 cases satisfactorily resolved by the ombudsman. In September the ombudsman
 formed a Consultative Committee on Human Rights and invited a variety of Uzbek
 and foreign observers to join it. Many of those invited have agreed to join-at least
 provisionally-but the group has not met as of year's end.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Both the Constitution and the 1992 law on citizenship prohibit discrimination on
 the basis of sex, religion, language, or social status; however, societal discrimination
 against women persists.
 Women.-Spousal abuse is common, but both local activists and the police say
 they have no statistics. Wife beating is considered a personal family affair rather
 
 
 1618
 
 than a criminal act, and thus such cases are-usually handled by family members
 or elders within the community (mahalla) and rarely come to court.
 -Trafficking of women and girls for the purpose of prostitution occurs, particularly
 to the Persian Gulf and Turkey. However, there are no reliable statistics on this
 problem, and it does not seem to be carried out on a large scale.
 Due to tradition, women, particularly in rural areas, usually marry before age 20,
 bear many children, and confine their activities within the family. In rural areas,
 women often find themselves working arduously in the cotton fields. However,
 women are not formally impeded from seeking a role in the workplace. The barriers
 to equality for women are cultural, not legal,. and women who open businesses or
 seek careers are not hindered legally.
 Although the law prohibits discrimination against women, traditional cultural and
 religious practices limit their role in everyday society. For these reasons, women are
 severely underrepresented in high-level positions. In 1995 President Karimov issued
 a decree on measures to increase the role of women in society, particularly extend-
 ing their participation in state and social administration and coordinating the activi-
 ties of ministries and social organizations as they relate to women's issues. In this
 connection, a new deputy prime minister position was created and charged with fur-
 thering the role of women in society. The edict also created heads of women's affairs
 in the autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan, regions, cities, and districts. The
 Ministry of Finance was ordered to allocate the necessary funds to finance these
 new positions and working bodies. Government-controlled women's committees were
 formed in most regions, but most are underfunded successors to old Soviet women's
 committees and play only a minor role in improving the condition of women.
 Several dozen NGO's address the needs of women. The Businesswomen's Associa-
 tion, in addition to providing resources and information about developing small en-
 terprises, operates a store that sells clothing and crafts. A center in Tashkent con-
 ducts seminars on sexual harassment, domestic violence, and the legal rights of
 women. Another center in Samarkand operates a crisis hotline and provides edu-
 cational services on alcoholism, sexually transmitted diseases, and family- counsel-
 ing.
 Depressed because of their low social status, some women and girls resort to sui-
 cide by self-immolation. There ate no reliable statistics on the extent of this prob-
 lem, since most cases go unreported. After marriage many women or girls move into
 the husband's home, where they occupy the lowest rung on the family social ladder.
 A conflict with the husband or mother-in-law, who by tradition exercises complete
 control over the young bride, usually is the stimulus for suicide. Representatives of
 women's groups have observed an increase in self-immolation, which remains the
 most frequent form of suicide for women in desperate circumstances.
 A 1997 research study indicates that the number of women enrolling in higher
 education is diminishing; for example, women's enrollment in the finance and bank-
 ing institute dropped from 65 percent in 1991 to about 25 percent in 1997. Cutbacks
 in government funding to universities and the need for families to fund a higher
 percentage of educational costs leaves many families in the position of being able
 to fund the education of only one child, either a son or a daughter. The report states
 that university faculty "steer" women into occupations traditionally performed by fe-
 males and suggests that administrators may practice a policy of deliberately barring
 entrance to women in some fields.
 Children.-The Constitution provides for children's rights, stating that parents
 are obliged to support and care for their children until they are of age. In theory
 the State provides free universal primary education and health care. In practice
 shortages and budget difficulties mean that some services must be paid privately.
 The State gants monetary allowances to families based on their number of chil-
 dren. The country has a very high birthrate; over one-half of the population is under
 the age of 15,
 Nine years of formal schooling are compulsory, and the average length of school-
 ing is over- 11 years. The U.N. Development Program reports that 100 percent of
 children complete secondary school.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-One of the country's first laws, adopted only 2 months
 after independence in 1991, provided support for the disabled. This law was aimed
 at ensuring that the disabled have the same rights as other citizens. However, little
 effort is made to bring the disabled into the mainstream. The State cares for the
 mentally retarded in special homes. The Government has not mandated access to
 public places or transportation for the disabled.
 Religious Minorities.-While there is no pattern of anti-Semitism, a Tashkent syn-
 agogue's glass signboard was destroyed with a brick during Saturday prayers on
 
 
 1619
 June 6. Police subsequently identified a vagrant who denied any religious motive
 as the perpetrator.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Government statistics show that the popu-
 lation of approximately 23 million is about 71 percent Uzbeks, 8 percent Russians,
 5 percent Tajiks, 4 percent Tatars, and 3 percent Kazakhs, with many other ethnic
 groups represented. The statistics may underestimate the number of ethnic Tajiks.
 The figures also do not include many ethnic Tajiks whose mother tongue was Uzbek.
 Moreover, some Tajiks choose for a variety of reasons to declare themselves to be
 ethnic Uzbeks.
 The citizenship law, passed in 1992, does not impose language requirements for
 citizenship. Nonetheless, the language issue remains very sensitive. Uzbek has been
 declared the state language, and the Constitution requires that the President speak
 Uzbek. However, the language law provides for Russian as "the language of inter-
 ethnic communication." Russian is widely spoken in the main cities, and Tajik is
 widely spoken in Samarkand and Bukhara. The language law, passed in 1989, origi-
 nally required that Uzbek would be the sole method of official communication by
 1998, but subsequently was modified and now stipulates no specific date. The Gov-
 ernment also is in the process of replacing its Cyrillic alphabet with the Latin al-
 phabet. However, recognizing the difficulties for Uzbeks and minorities alike, the
 Government has delayed the full transition to both Uzbek and the Latin alphabet
 to 2005.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 law on unions specifically provides that
 all workers have the right voluntarily to form and join unions of their choice, and
 that trade unions themselves may voluntarily associate territorially or sectorally.
 Membership in trade unions is optional. The law also declares all unions independ-
 ent of the State's administrative and economic bodies (except where provided for by
 law), and states that trade unions should develop their own charters, structure, and
 executive bodies and organize their own work.
 In practice, however, the overall structure of trade unions has not changed signifi-
 cantly since the Soviet era. Independence has eliminated subordination to Moscow
 but has not altered the centralized trade union hierarchy, which remains dependent
 on the Government. No "alternative" central union structures exist.
 A few new professional associations and interest groups have been organized,
 such as a union of entrepreneurs, a union of renters, an association of private physi-
 cians and pharmacists. Registered professional associations for judges and lawyers
 formed in 1997; both organizations were quasi-governmental. The main activity of
 all registered associations is professional development. They do not license members
 and have no formal role in advocating the interests of members in relation to the
 Government.
 According to the law, the Council of the Federation of Trade Unions (CFTU) has
 a consultative voice in the preparation of all legislation affecting workers and is en-
 titled to draft laws on labor and social issues. Trade unions are described legally
 as organizations that defend the right to work and to protect jobs. They have lost
 their previous role in state planning and in the management of enterprises. The em-
 phasis now is on the unions' responsibility for "social protection" and social justice-
 especially unemployment compensation, pensions, and worker retraining.
 The trade union law does not mention strikes or cite a right to strike. However,
 the law does give the unions oversight for both individual and collective labor dis-
 putes, which are defined as those involving alleged violations of labor laws, worker
 rights, or collective agreements.
 There were few reports of strikes. This circumstance likely reflects the absence
 of truly representative trade unions, as the standard of living fell and growing un-
 employment raised social tensions. The absence of labor activism also reflects the
 communist legacy of docility in the face of authority. However, both union and gov-
 ernment officials assert that the lack of strikes reflects general support for the Gov-
 ernment's policies and common interest in social stability.
 The 1992 law on unions provides that unions may choose their own international
 affiliations; however, none have done so.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Trade unions may conclude
 agreements with enterprises. Privatization is still in its very early phase. As a re-
 sult, there is no experience with negotiations that could be described as adversarial
 between unions and private employers. The State is still the major employer, and
 the state-appointed union leaders do not view themselves as having conflicts of in-
 terest with the State.
 The Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Finance in consultation with the CFTU
 set the wages for various categories of state employees. In the small private sector,
 
 
 1620
 management establishes wages or negotiates them with those who contract for em-
 ployment.
 The law forbids discrimination against union members and their officers.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, except as legal punishment or as may be specified by law. The
 law does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such prac-
 tices are not known to occur.- However, large-scale compulsory mobilization of youth
 and students (by closing schools) to help with the cotton harvest continues. Student
 labor is poorly paid and students must sometimes pay for their food. Adults, includ-
 ing teachers and passersby in automobiles and busses, are similarly forced into the
 harvest effort.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum working age is 16 years; 15-year-olds can receive state permission to work, but
 have a shorter workday. In rural areas, younger children and the elderly often help
 to harvest cotton and other crops. The Labor Ministry has an inspection service re-
 sponsible for enforcing compliance with these and other regulations governing em-
 ployment conditions and enforces them effectively.
 The law does not specifically. prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, and
 such practices are -not known to occur, except for compulsory mobilization for the
 cotton harvest (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Labor, in consultation with the
 CFTU, sets the minimum wage. As of September 1, it was about $10 (1,100 som)
 per month. The minimum  wage is not sufficient to-provide a decent standard of liv-
 ing for a worker and family. The workweek is set at 41 hours per week and includes
 a 24-hour rest period. Some factories apparently have reduced work hours in order
 to avoid layoffs. Overtime pay exists in theory but is not always paid.
 Pay arrearages of 3 to 6 months are not uncommon for workers in state-owned
 industries. The problem appears to growing.,
 The Labor Ministry establishes occupational health and safety standards in con-
 sultation with the unions. There is a health and safety inspectorate in the Ministry.
 The local press occasionally published complaints about the failure of unions and
 government authorities to do enough to promote worker safety. Although written
 regulations may provide adequate safeguards, workers in hazardous jobs often lack
 protective clothing and equipment. Workers can leave jobs that are hazardous with-
 out apparent jeopardy to continued employment; but in practice high rates of under-
 employment make this step difficult.
