 GREECE
 Greece is a republic with a democratically elected parliament.
 Several political parties participate in periodic legislative
 elections, the most recent of which was in June 1985, and the
 leader of the party with the largest vote becomes Prime
 Minister. Elections for the Presidency of the Republic are by
 popular vote. All elections are vigorously and freely
 contested.
 The judiciary is independent of both the executive branch of
 government and Parliament and operates within a civil law
 framework with precedents from Roman law and French and German
 sources. Police practices respect detainees' rights.
 A member of the European Economic Community, Greece is
 classified as a developed country by United Nations standards.
 Nevertheless, it has some attributes of a developing country
 and a tradition of state intervention in the economy.
 The full range of universally acknowledged human rights is
 guaranteed by the Constitution, which includes many of the
 provisions of the United Nations Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights. The Government, many of whose members suffered
 abuses during the junta period .(1967-74), is sensitive to the
 protection of individual freedoms. Allegations of abuses fall
 in the area of religious expression, guaranteed within certain
 limits by the Constitution.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In general, the individual is secure in Greece. Nevertheless,
 the "November 17" revolutionary organization, whose earlier
 victims included U.S. officials, claimed responsibility for
 the February 21 murder of newspaper publisher Nikos
 Momferatos. The "Anti-Military Struggle" took responsibility
 for gunning down prosecutor George Theofanopoulos on April 1.
 On September 18, a resident Arab magazine editor was shot dead
 outside his office, for which Black September claimed
 respons.ibility. The Government has strongly condemned
 terrorist acts and implemented measures to prevent their
 recurrence.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abduction, secret arrest, or
 clandestine detention during 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. In November 1984, the Parliament
 passed legislation making the use of torture an offense
 punishable by sentences of from 3 years to life imprisonment.
 There were no reported allegations of torture in 1985.
 However, in its 1985 Report, Amnesty International states that
 in October 1984 in discussions with Greek officials it had
 raised "allegations that some criminal suspects had been
 ill-treated."

 GREECE
 Prison and detention facilities provide adequate health care
 and diet. No distinction according to social class, race,
 sex, religion, or type of conviction is made in the treatment
 of prisoners. Cases requiring medical treatment receive
 special attention. Once sentenced, prisoners may be visited
 by family members 3 times per week.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 the Constitution, and this provision is respected in practice.
 Preventive detention does not exist in Greece. A person
 arrested on warrant or while committing a crime must be
 brought before an examining magistrate within 24 hours and
 charged. This magistrate must issue a warrant of imprisonment
 or order the release of the detainee within 3 days of the
 examination unless special circumstances require a 2-day
 extension of this time limit. The Constitution further states
 that the maximum duration of detention pending trial may not
 exceed a period of 1 year in the case of felonies or 6 months
 in the case of misdemeanors. A decision of a judicial council
 is required to effect extensions of these maximum durations
 (by 6 or 3 months, respectively) in exceptional cases. In
 practice, trials generally take place within 4 months of the
 submission of charges. Exile as a judicial remedy or
 government practice does not occur in Greece.
 The Constitution expressly prohibits forced labor, and no
 violations are known to have occurred in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair and public trials are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 provided in practice. Defense lawyers are available to all
 accused. Court sessions are public unless, as provided in the
 Constitution, the court decides that privacy is required for
 the protection of victims, when juveniles or morals offenses
 are involved, or in matters of national security. This latter
 provision is not abused. There is also a legal provision
 permitting a closed hearing for the sensitive portion of cases
 dealing with public order. In such instances, none of which
 is known to have occurred during 1985, the court by law must
 publicly pronounce its "reasoned decision" on the matters
 heard privately. A defendant may appeal a court verdict to an
 appeals court. Military courts have no jurisdiction over
 civilians. A 1983 case involving the trial and sentencing of
 a U.S. serviceman in a manner which did not meet standards of
 due process set forth in the applicable status of forces
 agreement is still under review by Greek authorities.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home as well as of an individual's
 personal and family life are guaranteed by the Constitution.
 No house search may be made except when and as specified by
 law and always in the presence of representatives of the
 judicial power. Warrants, issued by a district attorney (who
 is considered a judicial officer in Greece), are required for
 an official to enter a private home. These constitutional
 guarantees are respected in practice. A constitutional
 provision requires punishment and "liability for full damages
 to the sufferer" for violations of the sanctuary of the home
 
 
 996
 GREECE
 and for the abuse of power. The Constitution further
 guarantees privacy of correspondence and communication, and
 this guarantee was respected in practice in 1985.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice.
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of the press and prohibits
 censorship. Opposition viewpoints are constantly ventilated
 in the active Greek press, and criticism of the Government is
 unhampered. Greece's television and radio stations are
 government-owned and operated. The political opposition
 states that news and information programming reflects the
 political perspective of the governing party while its own
 views are given short shrift. The government response is that
 it has opened television to the opposition. During elections,
 television time is given to all major political parties
 according to their electoral strength. The Constitution
 allows for seizure, by order of the public prosecutor, of
 publications which insult the President, offend religious
 beliefs, contain obscene articles, advocate a violent
 overthrow of the political system, or disclose military and
 defense information. No periodicals or newspapers were seized
 in 1985. Greece has strict libel laws. Violations of these
 laws are prosecuted under established legal procedures with
 the safeguards of due process..
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the Constitution. Limits
 on outdoor public meetings exist, however, if police
 authorities determine that a serious disturbance of social and
 economic life is threatened. In 1985 no public assemblies
 were prohibited.
 The right of association is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 6bserved in practice. Workers and employers are free to
 establish and join organizations of their own choosing without
 prior authorization, to draw up their own constitutions and
 rules, elect their representatives, and formulate their
 programs. They are also free to join in confederations and
 affiliate with international organizations. Both employer and
 trade union organizations maintain relations with the
 International Labor Organization. Trade union and employer
 organizations are protected against dissolution by
 administrative authority.
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is guaranteed
 by law. An estimated 35 percent of Greek wage and salary
 earners are organized in some 4,000 trade unions. As provided
 by a 1982 law, the purpose of trade unions is to safeguard and
 promote the occupational, economic, social, and trade union
 interests of their members. In practice, Greek unions
 vigorously represent their members in pursuit of those aims.
 There is one current potential constraint on collective
 bargaining. As part of its austerity program, the Government
 on October 18, 1985 issued a legislative act which prohibits
 through 1987 increases of any kind of compensation which
 exceed the increases provided by the Government's wage
 indexation policy.
 
 
 997
 GREECE
 The right to strike is guaranteed by the Constitution and by
 statute to both public and private sector workers with the
 exception of judiciary functionaries and those serving in the
 security services, who are prohibited from striking. Other
 employees of the State or public corporations whose operation
 is of vital importance in serving the needs of the society may
 strike only after 4 days' prior notice to their employer, the
 respective ministry, and the Ministry of Labor. Striking
 trade unions in such categories are:required to supply the
 necessary staff to meet the essential requirements of the
 population during the strike.
 The main political parties in-Greece maintain trade union
 .affiliates, and most Greek trade unionists belong to or
 support one of those affiliates. In general, the trade union
 affiliates follow the.uidanceof their respective political
 parties. All Greek wage earners by law contribute 0.25
 percent of their basic wage to a Ministry of Labor organ known
 as the Workers' Hearth (Ergatiki Estia). Employers make a
 matching contribution. The Workers' Hearth uses that fund to
 finance trade union activities, apportioning funds to the
 unions in accordance with membership figures. The Minister of
 Labor has discretionary control over 8 percent of those funds.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 .The prevailing religion is Eastern Orthodox. The Constitution
 guarantees freedom of religion and prohibits discriminatory
 practices against religious minorities, which in Greece
 include small communities of Muslims, Jews, and non-Orthodox
 Christians. Proselytizing is forbidden by the Constitution.
 Greece's small community of Jehovah's Witnesses was affected
 by the provision in the Constitution which states that "no
 person shall be exempt from discharging his obligations to the
 state or may. refuse to comply with laws by reason of his
 religious convictions." In deference to Jehovah's Witnesses,
 the Government in.1979. modified the compulsory military
 service law to provide for alternative, noncombat service.
 Although courts of first instance have, on occasion, handed
 down lengthy sentences to conscientious objectors who refused
 military or alternative service altogether, prison terms are
 sharply reduced in the appellate process. Under the law, a
 conscientious objector may work in conjunction with his prison
 sentence so that, in practice, he does not serve a sentence
 longer than his period of military obligation and could serve
 a shorter period. In its 1985 Report (covering the year
 1984), Amnesty International stated that it knew of some 300
 Jehovah's Witnesses imprisoned for conscientious objection to
 military service.
 Amnesty International also noted 285 instances of the arrest
 of Jehovah's Witnesses for "proselytism," an activity
 prohibited by the Constitution. Of the 81 cases brought to
 trial, 14 were given suspended sentences with parole, 58 were
 acquitted, and 9 were deferred to 1985 and are still pending.
 The December 1984 conviction of three Protestant missionaries
 sentenced on charges of proselytizing and causing involuntary
 abandonment of home by a minor is still pending appeal.
 The Muslim minority of approximately 120,000, made up largely
 of ethnic Turks, is principally located in Thrace in
 northeastern Greece. The Treaty of Lausanne (1923) includes
 provisions relating to the educational and political rights of
 
 
 998
 GREECE
 the Muslim minority, all of whom are.Greek citizens. Three
 Muslim members serve in the national Parliament, many villages
 in Thrace regularly elect Muslim mayors, and there are over
 250 mosques in Greece. Members of the Muslim community and
 Turkish-Muslim organizations located outside Greece have
 complained that Turkish-language teaching materials imported
 from Turkey are vetted by Greek officials, as are Turkish
 teachers assigned to Muslim schools. The Greek Government
 states that educational materials and teachers are examined to
 assure they meet Greek standards. Some Muslim leaders have
 complained that they are not allowed to purchase land from
 non-Muslims. Greek officials maintain that there is no
 impediment to the Muslim right to purchase land. There is no
 evidence that these difficulties reflect a deliberate
 government policy of political, religious, or cultural
 repression of the Muslim community. Tensions between Greece
 and Turkey have made each country's perception of the
 treatment of its coreligionists in the other country a highly
 emotional issue, and both countries have viewed human rights
 questions in light of historical and political differences.
 There does not, however, appear to be either a generalized
 pattern of abuses or a policy of official discrimination by
 the Greek Government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of movement within the
 country, foreign travel, and emigration. This right is
 generally respected in practice. Persons intending to
 emigrate and those returning to Greece experience no
 discrimination. The Greek citizenship code authorizes
 expatriation of a citizen of non-Greek ethnic origin who is
 residing abroad; some Greek citizens of ethnic Turkish
 background'have alleged that their Greek citizenship was
 revoked while they were studying in Turkey.  The Government
 states that the provision has been used very sparingly, and
 only after it has been determined that the citizen in question
 has severed material ties with Greece and established a
 permanent existence elsewhere. Refugees are not forced to
 return to homelands from which they have fled.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Greece is a multiparty democracy in which all citizens enjoy
 full political rights, without regard to race, sex, religion,
 or political persuasion. Greek citizens freely choose the
 laws and officials governing them. The opposition parties
 function freely, have access to the media, and hold public
 meetings.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not objected to visits and investigations
 by human rights organizations. Amnesty International in its
 1985 Report expressed concern about cases of conscientious
 objectors who had been imprisoned, and of Jehovah's Witnesses
 who had been detained and prosecuted for "proselytism."
 Freedom House rated Greece "free."

 GREECE
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 A country of just under 10 million people, Greece has a
 relatively high standard of living. Per capita gross national
 product (GNP) in 1985 was estimated at $3,400.
 The economy is experiencing problems of budget and current
 account deficits, and high inflation persists. The rate of
 inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, is
 expected to be about 20 percent for 1985, up from 18.5 percent
 in 1984. Greece has a tradition of state economic activities,
 and the public sector accounts for over 50 percent of GNP.
 The Government has established a wide range of controls on
 retail and wholesale prices, placed strict limitations on the
 transfer of private capital abroad, rationed credit, and
 restricted the ability of companies to lay off workers.
 Greeks are well-fed: the ratio of calorie supply relative to
 nutritional requirements is 139 percent. Life expectancy at
 birth is about 74 years. The adult literacy rate is 91
 percent for the population over 10 years old but almost 100
 percent for adults below 55 years of age. The infant
 mortality rate is 14 per 1,000 live births. The Government
 has a program for upgrading health services, but the quality
 and availability of medical care, particularly outside the
 major cities, is often substandard.
 The minimum age for work in industry is 15. However,
 legislation and regulations provide higher minimum ages for
 work in specified areas or specific jobs. For example, those
 performing loading or unloading work must be at least 18,
 while workers for the ports of Piraeus and Thessaloniki must
 be 21.
 The minimum daily wage in Greece as of September 1, 1985, is
 approximately $10. The work week is 40 hours in the private
 sector and 37.5 hours in the public sector. Minimum standards
 of occupational health and safety are provided for by
 legislation.
 Women are guaranteed by the Constitution the same individual,
 political, and social rights as men. Women play an active yet
 still minority role in the political life of the country. At
 present there are 11 women in the 300-member Parliament. One
 woman minister and 2 deputy ministers in the cabinet and 5 of
 the 44 regional governors are women. The position of women in
 Greek society has undergone rapid change in conjunction with
 the process of industrialization and modernization. The
 Government has given concerted attention to the role of women
 and instituted significant reforms in marriage, divorce, and
 property laws. Women comprise over one-third of the
 industrial labor force, and the percentage is increasing.
