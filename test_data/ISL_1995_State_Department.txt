 ICELAND
 Iceland is a constitutional republic and a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Its
 people participate in high percentages in regular, free, and fair elections which de-
 termine the distribution of power among political parties and leaders.
 Elected officials control the police force, which scrupulously observes and enforces
 the laws that ensure protection of human rights.
 Iceland has a mixed, open economy, in which citizens have the right to hold pri-
 vate property. It provides residents with a high standard of living. The leading ex-
 port, marine products, accounts for almost 80 percent of export revenues.
 The Government fully respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law and
 judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse.
 There is some societal discrimination against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are pro-
 hibited by law and do not occur. Prison conditions are good, but most prisons are
 full, and many are antiquated. The Government has begun a construction program
 to alleviate these difficulties.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial--The Constitution and law provide for an independ-
 ent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The Ministry
 of Justice administers the lower court system, while the Supreme Court guards its
 independence and fairness. Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common,
 especially in the appeals process. All judges, at all levels, serve for life.
 The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. Defend-
 ants are presumed innocent. They are guaranteed the right of access to legal coun.
 sel of their own choosing, in time to prepare their defense. For defendants unable
 to pay attorneys' fees, the State assumes the cost. Defendants have the right to be
 present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the pro-
 ceedings. No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike.
 Trials are public and are conducted fairly, with no official intimidation. Defendants
 have the right to appeal.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system
 combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Although the official state religion is Lutheran, the Con-
 stitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right
 in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee
 status.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their govermnent
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. The most recent elections to the
 Althing (unicameral Parliament) were held on April 8.
 There are no legal or practical impediments to women's participation in govern-
 ment and politics. Two of the four top governmental positions-the President and
 the Speaker of the Althing-are occupied by women (both positions are largely cere-
 monial, however). There is an active feminist political party, the Women's List,
 which won 3 of 63 seats in the 1995 parliamentary elections.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The culture of the ethnically homogeneous population is strongly egalitarian and
 opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors. Government legislation and
 practice generally reflect this attitude, but credible reports indicate that both the
 police and the court system are hostile or indifferent to rape victims (see below).
 Women.-Violence against women received increasing public attention, due largely
 to the efforts of the Women's List political movement, which continued to raise it
 in political debate. A public women s shelter offers protection to approximately 350
 women and 180 children per year;, these figures are virtually the same as in 1994,
 indicating a leveling off of an initial surge in demand for services of the shelter.
 There is also a rape trauma center sponsored and operated by women's organiza-
 tions; some 400 women and children annually seek assistance there. Both facilities
 are funded by national and municipal governments and private contributions. The
 Reykjavik City Hospital emergency ward now has an all-female staff to care for rape
 victims.
 Studies indicate that only a small percentage of cases involving domestic violence
 or sexual abuse (rape, attempted rape, or harassment) are reported to the police.
 Women's organizations assert that both the state investigative police and the court
 system are hostile or indifferent to victims of domestic violence or sexual abuse; that
 female victims who lodge charges of such offenses are often subjected to humiliating
 police interrogation; and that judges are unduly lenient with sex offenders (the typi-
 cal prison term for a convicted rapist is 1 or 2 years). The police have introduced
 a program to train officers in correct interrogation procedures, and other govern-
 ment agencies are paying closer attention to the problem of violence again3t women.
 In September an all-male committee, working under the auspices of the Social Af-
 fairs Ministry, launched a 2-week campaign, "en against Violence," highlighting
 -men's responsibility for the majority of domestic and sexual violence, and sponsoring
 seminars on the problem and ways to eliminate it.
 Major economic and political institutions remain male-dominated. Legislation re-
 quiring equal pay for equal work is evidently not being adequately implemented.
 Studies have consistently revealed an average difference of 40 percent in the earn-
 ings of men and women in comparable jobs; when allowance is made for the longer
 average working hours (and overtime) among men there remains a 20-poercent gap.
 Since 1991 complaints regarding the Equal Rights Law have been referred to a
 special committee under the Equal Rights Affairs Office of the Ministry of Social
 Affairs. The committee has only advisory powers, and its recommendations to any
 employer do not have the force of law. Only a few complaints have been made to
 the committee. Women's groups speculate that many women are reluctant to come
 forward with complaints in Iceland's small, intimate communities and traditionally
 stoic culture. Also, Iceland's largely male-led labor unions have not actively sup-
 ported individual women who wish to exercise their right to take action on such
 matters.
 Children.-Great respect for children's rights is evident in the law and in govern-
 ment policy. In 1994 the Government created the Office of the Children's Ombuds-
 man in the Prime Ministry, with a mandate to protect children's rights, interests,
 and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government
 decisions, and public attitudes. Some international custody cases involving Iceland-
 ers have been complicated by the fact that, although Iceland is a signatory to the
 Hague Convention on Child Abduction, it has not been brought into force. The For-
 
 
 895
 eign Minister opined that Iceland's practices in this area lay it open to criticism for
 possible violations of human rights. In 1994 the Foreign Minister submitted a bill
 in the Parliament to bring the Convention into force, but it was not voted on before
 the end of the session. The bill was reintroduced early in the new parliamentary
 term, which began in October.
 People With Disabilities.-Disbled individuals are not subject to discrimination
 in employment, education, or provision of other state services. The Government has
 legislated accessibility to public buildings for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers make extensive use of the right to establish
 organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders
 and policies, and publicize their views. The resulting organizations are not con-
 trolled by the Government or any single political party. Unions take active part in
 Nordic, European, and international trade union bodies. With the exception of lim-
 ited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public
 health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years. Some
 76 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are no impediments to
 union membership in law or in practice. Virtually all unions exercise t eir right to
 bargain collectively. The central labor and management organizations periodically
 negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set nationwide standards and spe-
 cific terms for workers' pay, workhours, and other conditions. The Government often
 plays a role in the negotiations, and sometimes undertakes commitments in order
 to bring the two sides together. Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over
 contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and In-
 dustrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.
 By law, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to rein-
 state workers fired for union activities. In practice, the charges are difficult to
 prove.
 In June 1993, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the Government
 had violated the 11th article of the European Human Rights Charter, concerning
 the right of free association, by obliging taxi drivers to be members of a union. The
 new Parliament is continuing to consider legislation to comply with this judgment.
 There are no export processing or other special economic zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law       ires children to at-
 tend school until the age of 16 and prohibits employment of chidren under that age
 in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor.
 This prohibition is observed in practice. Children age 14 or 15 may be employed
 part-time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work; their workhours
 must not exceed the ordinary workhours of adults in the same occupation. The Oc-
 cupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Although there is no minimum wage law,
 union membership is so extensive and effective as to ensure that labor contracts af-
 ford even the lowest-paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living
 for themselves and their families.
 Workers are protected by laws that effectively ensure their health and safety as
 well as provide for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reason-
 able working conditions and hours. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours.
 Worktime exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime. Work-
 ers are entitled to 10 hours of rest within each 24-hour period and to a day off every
 week. Under defined special circumstances the 10-hour rest period can be reduced
 to 8, and the day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has
 a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.
 Iealth and safety standards are set by the Althing and administered and en-
 forced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health
 Administration.
 ERELAND
 Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a long tradition of orderly transfer of
 power. The Government is headed by a president and a prime minister, and there
 is a bicameral parliament. The judiciary is independent.
 
 
 896
 The national police are under the effective civilian control of the Minister of Jus-
 tice, and have sole responsibility for internal security. Ireland's principal internal
 security concern has been to prevent the spillover of terrorist violence from North-
 ern Ireland. In February the Government lifted a 19-year-old state of emergency in
 response to cease-fires by   the Irish   Republican  Army   (IRA) and    loyalist
 paramilitaries. A 1976 law that gave the defense forces search and arrest powers
 under certain circumstances was also allowed to lapse. But the Special Criminal
 Court-a nonjury court set up in 1972 to address the problem of juiy intimidation
 in paramilitary cases-remains in place and continues to be used sporadically de-
 spite the cease-fires. Under the 1939 Offenses Against the State Act, the Director
 of Public Prosecutions can have any case tried by the Special Criminal Court simply
 by certifying that the ordinary courts are "inadequate" to deal with it.
 Ireland has an open, market-based economy that is highly dependent on inter-
 national trade. It is a large net recipient of funds from the European Union (EU)
 designed to raise per capita gross national product to the EU average. Despite
 strong economic growth over the past few years, unemployment remains high at ap-
 proximately 15 percent.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. Human
 rights problems arise primaily from: the continuation of emergency legislation and
 the non-jury court; prison overcrowding and substandard prison facilities; discrimi-
 nation and violence against women; abuse of children; occasional censorship of films,
 books, and periodicals, and; a lack of explicit antidiscrimination legislation, espe-
 cially in relation to persons with disabilities and "travelers" (Gypsies).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearancs.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them.
 Ireland has a low incarceration rate (65 inmates per 100,000 population), and the
 prison regime is generally liberal. However, the physical infrastructure of many
 prisons is barely adequate: facilities are plagued by chronic overcrowding, requiring
 doubling up in many single-person cells. Almost all of the country's 12 prisons are
 housed in very old  uildings that were built originally for other uses; as a result
 less than half the cells have toilets and running water. The medical facilities and
 the standard of hygiene at Mountjoy prison, the country's largest prison, were re-
 cently described by the prison's visiting committee as "totally unsatisfactory." There
 is no separate prison facility for the small number of women inmates, and no seg-
 regation of ju'veniles (persons 17 to 20 years of age) from adult prisoners. The law
 also allows those ages 15 and 16 to be sent to adult prison if a court determines
 that they are "unruly," although in practice, that happens infrequently.
 Since last year's cease-fire by the IRA, the Governnent has granted early release
 to 36 "Republican" paramilitary prisoners. Some 42 "subversive" prisoners remain
 in custody at a special facility in Portlanise prison. Conditions for these inmates are
 the same, if not better, than those for the general prison population. A handful of
 prisoners who belong to a fringe Republican group (the Irish National Liberation
 Army-INLA) conducted a short hunger strike to protest what they considered to
 be unequal treatment compared to other Reptblican innates, but this was quickly
 defused. Even if most of the remaining Republican prisoners are released early as
 part of the Northern Ireland peace process, the number involved is too small to have
 an appreciable impact on the prison overcrowding problem.
 In July the Government ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Trans-
 fer of Sentenced Persons, which could actually exacerbate the overcrowding problem.
 The number of potential transfers to Ireland is far higher than the number of poten-
 tial transfers out. While there are about 180 foreign nationals in Irish jails, there
 are an estimated 600 Irish nationals eligible to return to Ireland under the Conven-
 tion.
 In June 1     P94, the Government published a 5-year plan for dealing with the prison
 overcrowding problem, entitled "T'he Management of Offenders." But human rights
 observers are skeptical that the Government's plan will lead to the end of the
 e         rnic overcrowding or to any radical improvement. Due to a budget short-
 fall, the Governmentin July postponed plans to build two new prisons to address
 these problems.
 
 
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution stipulates that no per-
 son shall be deprived of personal liberty without due process under the law. A de-
 tainee has the right to petition the High Court, which is required to order release
 unless it can be shown that the person is being detained in accordance with the law.
 Under the 1984 Criminal Justice Act, the maximum period of detention for ques-
 tioning in most cases is 12 hours-plus a possible extension of 8 hours overnight
 to allow a detainee to sleep.
 Detention without charge is permitted for up to 48 hours, however, in cases cov-
 ered by the 1939 Offenses Against the State Act. This Act allows police to arrest
 and detain for questioning anyone suspected of committing a "scheduled offense,"
 i.e., one involving firearms, explosives, or membership in an unlawful organization.
 Although the stated purpose of the Act is to "prevent actions and conduct calculated
 to undernine public order and the authority of the state," it is not restricted to sub-
 versive offenses. Therefore, the police have broad arrest and detention powers in
 any case involving firearms.
 he Act also provides for the indefinite detention, or internment, without trial of
 any person who is engaged in activities which are "prejudicial to the preservation
 of public peace and order or to the security of the state.' While this power has not
 been invoked since the late 1950's, the Government could do so by simply issuing
 a proclamation.
 There are no provisions for the 1939 Offenses Against the State Act to be renewed
 annually; it continues indefinitely. The Government, however, has pledged to "care-
 fully review all legislation and court arrangements associated with the management
 of the conflict in the last 25 years."
 At the same time, the Government is moving to broaden the circumstances under
 which extended detention without charge is allowed. In July it approved counter-
 narcotics proposals which include a provision for detenon n for up to 7 days in cases
 involving drug trafficking. To hold a suspected drug trafficker for more than 48
 hours, however, the police would have to seek a judge a approval. Legislation imple-
 menting this new measure is expected in early 1996.
 The authorities do not impose exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the courts are independent in practice. The Constitution also provides for
 a fair public trial, and this is honored by the legal system.
 Jury trial is the norm. The accused generally may choose his or her attorney. For
 indigents, the State assumes the cost of counsel. Judges are appointed by the Presi-
 dent on the advice of the Government. The judicial system includes 23 district
 courts, 8 circuit courts, the High Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the Su-
 preme Court. Most criminal cases are prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecu-
 tions, a State official with semiautonomous status.
 However, the Constitution explicitly allows "special courts' to be created when
 "ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and
 the preservation of public peace and order." In 1972, under the 1939 Offenses
 Against the State Act, the Government set up a nonjury "Special Criminal Court'
 (SCC) to try the 'scheduled offenses," i.e., ones involving firearms, explosives, or
 membership in an unlawful organization. Largely a reaction to the spillover of para-
 military violence from Northern Ireland, the SCC has been justified over the years
 as addressing the problem of jury intimidation in cases involving defendants with
 suspected paramilitary links.
 Despite the cessation of paramilitary violence in 1994, the SCC remains in place
 and continues to be used. Far fewer cases are handled by the SCC than during the
 "troubles,' but it has been used in 1995 to deal with narcotics traffickers and other
 offenses deemed threatening to the State. In 1995 at least nine persons have been
 convicted by the SCC. In addition to the "scheduled offenses," the Director of Public
 Prosecutions can have any case tried by the Special Criminal Court by simply cer-
 tifying that the ordinary courts are "inadequate" to deal with it. In October the High
 Court rejected a challenge to the continued existence of the Special Criminal Court
 and upheld the Director of Public Prosecution's discretion to bring any case it choos-
 es before the Court.
 In lieu of a jury, the Special Criminal Court usually sits as a three-judge panel.
 Its verdicts are by majority vote. Rules of evidence are essentially the same as in
 regular courts, except that the sworn statement of a police chief superintendent
 identifying the accused as a member of an illegal organization is accepted as prima
 facie evidence. In 1994, for example, Paul Walsh was convicted of IRA membership
 by the Court on the basis of a chief superintendent's opinion and his possession of
 fteely available posters and books and a notebook in which he had written: "Hi ho,
 hi ho, I am a Provo. I work all day for the IRA." Sessions of the SCC are usually
 
 
 898
 ublic, but the judge may exclude certain persons other than journalists. Appeals
 RUm the SCC are only allowed on points of law or against the sentenced imposed.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. ArbitraryInterference wit Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The Su-
 preme Court has affirmed that, although not specifically provided for in the Con-
 stitution, the inviolability of personal privacy, family, and home must be respected
 in law and practice. This is fully honored by the Government.
 The Constitution currently provides that the State shall enact no law permitting
 divorce, but a referendum to remove this ban passed by a narrow margin on Novem-
 ber 24. The High Court is to consider a challenge to the validity of the referendum
 in 1996. If the results are upheld, the Government plans to introduce legislation in
 1996 allowing courts to grant divores.
 Article 40 of the Constitution requires the State to"... respect . . defend and
 vindicate .. ." the right to life of the unborn, "with due regard to the equal right
 to life of the mother. But in 1992, following the controversial case of a 14-year-old
 rape victim who was barred from traveling to the United Kingdom for an abortion,
 voters approved constitutional amendments specifying that the State, in protecting
 the unborm, could not limit travel to other countries, or limit access to information
 relating to services lawfully available in other countries. An abortion information
 bill implementing the new constitutional provision became law in 1995. The law
 draws a distinction between "information" and "referral," prohibiting any doctor or
 agency from making an appointment at a foreign abortion clinic on behalf of a
 woman. The law also prohibits the provision of abortion information by billboards,
 public notices, or unsolicited leaflets.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Pess.-The Constitution provides individuals with the
 right to "express freely their convictions and opinions. Freedom of the press, how-
 ever, is subject to the qualification that it not "undermine public order or morality
 or the authority of the state." Publication or utterance of "blasphemous, seditious,
 or indecent matter" is prohibited. While the press, in practice, operates freely, the
 1961 Defamation Act (which puts the onus on newspapers and periodicals accused
 of libel to prove defamatory words are true) and the 1963 Official Secrets Act (which
 gives the State wide scope to prosecute unauthorized disclosures of sensitive govern-
 ment information) are believed to result in some self-censorship. In December a
 newspaper was found guilty by the Dublin district court of breaching the Official
 Secrets Act. The newspaper and its reporter were fined for publishing confidential
 police information concerning a planned bank robbery after the crime had been com-
 mitted. The newspaper planned to appeal the verdict.
 Mordthan 70 libel actions against newspapers and other publications were pend-
 ing before the courts; the National Newspapers Association of Ireland estimated
 that libel awards and related legal bills cost its members about $8 million (5 million
 Irish pounds) peryear. The Government has proposed a freedom of information act
 to address some ofthese problems.
 Broadcasting remains mostly state controlled, but under the 1988 Radio and Tele-
 vision Act, private sector broadcasting is growing. There are now several flourishing
 independent radio stations, and a franchise for an independent television station is
 under negotiation. A Broadcasting Complaints Commission oversees standards and
 investigates complaints about programming. The 1960 Broadcasting Act empowers
 the Government to prohibit the state-owned radio and television network from
 broadcasting any matter that is "likely to promote or incite to crime or which would
 tend to undermine the authority of the state." It was on this basis that the Govern-
 ment banned Sinn Fein (the legal political front of the IRA) from the airwaves from
 1971 to 1994.
 Films and videos must be screened and classified by the Office of the Film Censor
 before they can be shown or sold. Distributors must pay a fee averaging about
 $1,600 (1,000 Irish pounds) per film, which is used to finance the censor's Office.
 Under the 1923 Censorship of Films Act, the censor has the authority to cut or ban
 any film that is "indecent, obscene or blasphemous" or which tends to "inculcate
 principles contrary to public morality or subversive of public morality." There has
 en a diminishing use of this broad power in recent years: in 1994 only 3 of the
 343 films reviewed by the censor were banned. A similarly small number of films
 were prohibited in 1995. Decisions of the censor can be appealed to a nine-member
 appeal board, but neither the censor nor the appeal board is required to hear argu-
 ments or evidence in nublic or to state reasons for its decisions.
 Books and periodicals are also subject to censorship. The 1946 Censorship of Pub-
 lications Act calls for a five-member board to examine publications referred to it by
 the customs service or a member of the general public. They can also examine books
 
 
 899
 or periodicals on their own initiative. The board can prohibit the sale of any publica-
 tion that it judges to be indecent or obscene. In 1994, 16 books and 2 periodicals
 were prohibited. However, the ban on Playboy magazine, which had been in effect
 since the early 1960's, was lifted in 1995.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides citi-
 zens with the right to 'assemble peaceably and without arms" and to form associa-
 tions and unions. However, it also allows the State to "prevent or control meetings"
 which are "calculated to cause a breach of the peace or to be a danger or nuisance
 to the general public." Under the 1939 Offenses Against the State Act, it is unlawful
 to hold any public meeting on behalf of, or in support of, an illegal organization.
 In practice, however, the Government has been liberal in allowing public meetings
 and assemblies, even by groups associated with illegal terrorist organizations, such
 as the IRA.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government does not hamper the teaching or practice of any faith. Even though Ire-
 land is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, there is no state religion. However, almost
 all primary and secondary schools are denominational, managed and controlled by
 the Catholic Church. Religious instruction is an integral part of the curriculum, but
 there are provisions for parents to exempt their children from such instruction. The
 Minister of Education published a white paper in 1995 proposing sweeping edu-
 cational reforms, including that schools be brought under state ownership and that
 the number of religious trustees on school boards be reduced.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is complete freedom of movement within the country, as well as
 freedom to engage in foreign travel, emigration, and voluntary repatriation.
 Ireland currently has no domestic law dealing with the status of refugees or the
 procedures to be followed when a person applies for asylum. As result, the legal
 rights and protections for asylum seekers and refugees are tenuous. Ireland imple-
 ments its obligations under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
 on an administrative basis. Specific administrative procedures for the determination
 of refugee status were drawn up in 1985 in consultation with the U.N. High Com-
 missioner for Refugees; in 1992 the Supreme Court ruled that these procedures
 were binding on the Minister of Justice. But as the number of asylum seekers has
 increased (from only 31 in 1990 to 259 in the first 9 months of 1995), these adminis-
 trative procedures have proved inadequate. In particular, there have been com-
 plaints of long delays and a lack of transparency in decisions concerning refugee sta-
 tus. The Government, however, has moved to address these shortcomings by intro-
 ducing legislation that would put provisions for dealing with refugees on a statutory
 basis.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The constitutional requirement that parliamentary elections be held at least every
 7 years has always been met. Suffrage is universal for citizens over age 18, and bal-
 loting is secret. Several political parties have seats in the bicameral Parliament.
 Members of the Dail (House of Representatives)-the chamber that carries out the
 main legislative functions--are popularly elected; in the Seanad (Senate), some
 members are elected and some are appointed by various bodies. The President is
 popularly elected for a 7-year term and is limited to two terms. An appointed Coun-
 cil of State serves as an advisory body to the President.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics. Although a woman is
 President, only 22 of the 166 deputies in the Dail and 8 of the 60 Senators are
 women. Of the 22 legislative committees, the only one chaired by a woman is the
 Joint Committee on Women's Rights. Two of the 15 government ministers are
 women, as are 4 of the 17 junior ministers. While women participate in all depart-
 ments of government, they are underrepresented at senior levels. Women hold about
 30 percent of all public-sector jobs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The principal independent organization monitoring domestic human rights prob-
 lems, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, operates without hindrance from the Gov-
 ernment. The Government is open to investigation of human rights abuses by inter-
 national or other nongovernmental organizations.
 
 
 900
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Except as regards employment, neither the Constitution nor the law prohibits dis-
 crimination on the basis of disability, race, sex, language, or social status. To ad-
 dress these and other shortcomings in Irish civil law, the Government in 1993 cre-
 ated the Department of Euality and Law Reform. The Department is currently
 drafing an equal status bill to prohibit disrmination in employment, education,
 and in the p rovision of goods, facilities, and services; once adopted into law, this leg-
 islation will allow Ireland to ratify the U.N. International Convention on the Elihn-
 nation of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Constitution, as amended, already
 forbids state promotion of one religion over another and discrimination on the
 grounds of religious profession, belie, or status.
 Women.-There have been no systematic studies of violence against women, but
 indications are that it is significant. Women's Aid, a private organization, reported
 that from January to October it had received more than 8,000 p hone calls from
 -women claiming abuse compared to 6,000 calls for all of 1994. The Rape Crisis Cen-
 ter reported that it had received more than 1,000 phone calls in 1995 from women
 claiming they had been raped. The Center estimates that only 29 percent of rape
 victims report the crime to police, and that only 17 percent of those go to trial. A
 1990 act criminalized rape within marriage and provided for free legal advice to the
 victim.
 Another indication of the extent of violence against women is the number of appli-
 cations for barring orders. In 1994 there were approximately 4,400 applications for
 orders to bar the husband from the family home. The Government in 1995 intro-
 duced a domestic violence bill that would strengthen barring and protection orders
 and that would give the police new powers of arrest to deal with these cases.
 Discrimination against women in the workplace is unlawfal, but inequalities per-
 sist regarding pay and promotions in both the public and the private sectors. Work-
 ing women are also hampered by the lack of adequate child-care facilities. In 1990
 the Government established the second Commission on the Status of Women, which
 published its recommendations in early 1993; the Government pledged to implement
 them, including a requirement that at least 40 percent of all publlc appointees be
 women. One orthe recommendations was achieved in 1994 when the Maternity Pro-
 tection Act was passed, providing a woman 14 weeks of maternity leave and the
 tiht fom retur to r ot  ithdreob.or        hn800      hn clsfo
 riTetnti riato.Pa)     of 1974 and the Employment Equality Act of
 1977 provide for protection  d     against discrimination based on gender. The
 Employment Equality Agency monitors their implementation. The number of cases
 brought to the agency has aen in recent years, but progress in eliminating the
 differential in earnings has been modest. In 1995 the hourly industrial wage for
 women was 60 percent of that received by men, and weekly earnings of women aver-
 aged 68 percent ofthe weekly pay of men.
 Children.-The Government is strongly committed to the welfare and rights of
 children, as demonstrated by its ongoing implementation of the 1991 Child Care
 Act, Education is compulsory for childe  age 6 to 15 years. Among other things,
 the Act places a statutory duty on government health boards to identify and help
 children who are not receiving adequate care and gives the police increased powers
 - to remove a child where there is an immediate and serious risk to health or welfare.
 The Minister of State (junior minister) for Health has special responsibility for chil-
 dren's policy, including implementation of the Child Care Act; by the end of 1995,
 only parts of the Act remained to be implemented. The Status of Children Act of
 1987 abolished the concept of illegitimacy and provided for equal rights for children
 in all legal proceedings.
 In recent years, sexual abuse of children has been receiving increased media at-
 tention; the number of reported physical abuem a s  is also riing. Surveys suggest
 that 12 to 15 percent of children experience physical, sexual, or emotional ause.
 In the wake orecnt revelations that the Cat olic Church did not inform authori-
 ties of several instances of sexual child abuse by clermen, the Government is con-
 sidering making the reporting of any suspected child abuse mandatory.
 People With Disabilities.-An estimated 15 percent of the adult population are dis-
 abled; 80 percent of those are unemployed. There is currently no legislation to pro-
 tect disabled persons from discrimination in employment or in other matters or to
 improve their access to buildings or transportation. Few public or private buildings
 have facilities for the disabled. A commission on the status of people with disabil-
 ities is scheduled to report in April, 1996. The Government is expected to draw on
 its recommendations in drafting the Equal Status Bill.
 National/Raial/Ethni Minorities.-There are some 25,000 nomadic people with-
 in Ireland who regard themselves as a distinct ethnic group called  travelers,

 roughly analogous to the Gypsies of continental Europe. The "traveling" community
 has its own history, culture, and language. The travelers' emphasis on self-employ-
 ment and the extended family distinguish them from the rest of Irish society. In
 1991 a European Parliament committee reported that in Ireland, "the single most
 discriminated against ethnic group is the 'traveling people.'" That remained true in
 1995.
 Travelers are regularly denied access to premises, goods, facilities, and services;
 many restaurants and pubs, for example, have a policy of not serving them. Despite
 national school rules which provide that no child may be refused admission on ac-
 count of social position, travelers frequently experience difficulties in enrolling their
 children in school. Of an estimated 3,500 traveler families, more than 1,000 are re-
 siding on roadsides or on temporary sites without toilets, electricity, or washing fa-
 cilities.
 Irish society's general hostility toward travelers is reflected in occasional acts of
 violence. In September 1994, a traveler family in county Cork had their caravan
 turned over and destroyed by a group of men who were reportedly hired by local
 citizens to drive the family out. In a similar attack in October 1994, a traveler fam-
 ily of 14 in county Wicklow had their car and trailers fire-bombed by local residents.
 In June 1995, residents in county Westmeath blocked one of the country's main
 roads to protest a decision to move a traveler family into their neighborhood.
 The tense relations between the traveling community and the rest of Irish society
 led the Government in 1993 to establish a task force to study the problem and make
 recommendations. One of the main recommendations of the task force, which issued
 its report in July 1995, was that "the distinct culture and identity of the traveler
 community be recognized and taken into account," especially in the context of the
 forthcoming equal status legislation. While the Government has consistently con-
 demned violence against travellers and urged local authorities to provide adequate
 halting sites as required under the 1988 Housing Act, it has been slow to enact laws
 prohibiting discrimination against travelers. The traveling community is specifically
 addressed in the 1989 Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, but to date, there
 have been no prosecutions under that law.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right to join a union is provided for by law, as
 is the right to refrain from joining.
 About 55 percent of workers in the private and public sectors are members of
 unions. Police and military personnel are prohibited from striking, but they may
 form associations to represent themselves in matters of pay, working conditions, and
 general welfare. The right to strike is freely exercised in both the public and private
 sectors. The Industrial Relations Act of 1990 prohibits retribution against strikers
 and union leaders; the Government effectively enforces this provision through the
 Department of Enterprise and Employment. In 1995 the number of strikes was sig-
 nificantly down from past years.
 The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) represents 66 unions (including 20 in
 Northern Ireland). Both the ICTU and the unions affiliated with it are independent
 of the Government and of the political parties. Unions may freely form or join fed-
 erations or confederations and affiliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions have full free-
 dom to organize and to engage in collective bargaining. The Anti-Discrimination
 (Pay) Act of 1974 and the Employment Equality Act of 1977 make the Employment
 Equality Agency responsible for oversight of allegations of antiunion discrimination.
 If the Agency is unable to effect resolution, the dispute goes before the Labor Court,
 which consists of one representative each for the employer and the union, plus an
 independent chairperson. The Unfair Dismissals Act of 1977 provides various forms
 of relief in cases of employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination, including the
 reinstatement of workers fired for union activities.
 Most terms and conditions of employment are determined through collective bar-
 gaining, in the context of a national economic pact negotiated every 3 years by "the
 social partners," i.e., representatives of unions, employers, farmers, and the Govern-
 ment. The current 3-year agreement, entitled "The Program for Competitiveness
 and Work," expires in 1996. As usual, it establishes standard pay increases and
 fixes a cap on any increases subsequently negotiated at local levels.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1990 established the Labor Relations Commission
 which provides advice and conciliation services in industrial disputes. The Commis-
 sion may refer unresolved disputes to the Labor Court, which may recommend
 terms of settlement and may set up joint employer-union committees to regulate
 conditions of employment and minimum wages in a specific trade or industry.
 
 
 There is an export processing zone at Shannon airport that is subject to the same
 labor laws as the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 and does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-By law children are required to
 attend school until the age of 15. The employment of children under age 15 is gen-
 erally prohibited by the 1977 Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, but
 those age 14 are allowed to do light nonindustrial work during school holidays with
 the written permission of their parents. They are limited to working 7 hours per
 day and 35 hours per week. For children age 15, the law limits work time to 8 hours
 per day and 40 hours per week. For those age 16 or 17, the limits are 9 hours per
 day and 45 hours per week. The Department of Enterprise and Employment effec-
 tively enforces these provisions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no general minimum wage law, but
 there are several minimum rates of pay applicable to specific industrial sectors,
 mainly those with lower-than-average wages. Although the lowest of these minimum
 wages would not be sufficient to provide a decent living for a family of four, low-
 income families are entitled to additional benefits such as subsidized housing and
 children's allowances.
 The standard workweek is 39 hours. Working hours in the industrial sector are
 limited to 9 hours per day and 48 hours per week. Overtime is limited to 2 hours
 per day, 12 hours per week, and 240 hours in a year. The Department of Enterprise
 and Employment is responsible for enforcing four basic laws dealing with occupa-
 tional safety that provide adequate and comprehensive coverage. There were no sig-
 nificant complaints from either labor or management regarding enforcement of these
 laws. Recent regulations provide that employees who find themselves in a situation
 that presents a "serious, imminent and unavoidable risk" may absent themselves
 without the employer being able to take disciplinary action.
