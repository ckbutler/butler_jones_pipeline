 DJIBOUTI
 Djibouti remained at year's end a de facto one-party State ruled, since independ-
 ence in 1977 by President Hassan Gouled Aptidon and the People's Rally for
 Progress (RPP). Djibouti is com posed of two main ethnic groups, the politically pre-
 dominant Issa (the tribe of the President, who is of Somali origin) and the Afar (who
 are also numerous in Ethiopia and Eritrea). The Afars comprise the largest single
 tribe in Djibouti, but they are outnumbered by the Issa and other Somali clans
 (Issak and Gadabursi) taken together.
 The Constitution permits four political parties. Of the two opposition parties rec-
 ognized by the Government, only one, the Party for Democratic Renewal (PRD), par-
 ticipated in the December 1992 legislative elections. The National Democratic Party
 (PND) boycotted them on the grounds that President Gouled did not consult the op-
 position on the "democratization" process and hence that safeguards did not exist
 for free and fair elections. The Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy
 (FRUD), essentially an ethnic Afar organization, persuaded most Afars also to boy-
 cott the elections. Consequently, the RPP won all 65 parliamentary seats and, with
 the managed reelection of President Gouled in May, holds all significant government
 posts as well.
 In late 1991 the FRUD began a large-scale Afar insurgency in the northern part
 of the country; its unmet demands include the formation of a transitional govern-
 ment and regional autonomy for the Afars in Djibouti. A government counteroffen-
 sive which checked the FRUD advance in July resulted in the capture of most rebel
 bases in northern Djibouti.
 As a result of the conflict, the Government more than tripled the size of the com-
 bined Djiboutian national armed forces (comprised of the army, the national security
 forces, and the gendarmerie) to nearly 20,000 persons. This mobilization had a dev-
 astating effect on Djibouti's economy. By year's end, the total costs of maintaining
 the armed forces on a war footing accounted for about 35 percent of central govern-
 ment budgetary expenditures, a percentage so high as to be the principal cause of
 the economic crisis gripping the nation. The armed forces, especially those of Somali
 origin, committed serious a uses of human rights during this period.
 Demobilizing the armed forces remains a challenge for the Government since
 adult male unemployment in the capital hovers around 60 percent. Djibouti's soil
 is unproductive. Pastoralists who have not settled in Djiboutiville eke out a living
 from their livestock. There is virtually no industry. The State is the largest em-
 ployer. Commerce and services for the 12,000 expatriate residents (mostly French,
 including 3,800 military personnel) and the operation of the seaport and airport ac-
 count for most of the gross domestic product. People are free to pursue private busi-
 ness interests and to hold personal and real property.
 Human rights remained restricted despite the introduction of a new Constitution
 and a limited multiparty political system. Although freedom of the press has ex-
 panded since the Government allowed the publication of opposition newspapers and
 tracts, many of the other rights provided for in the Constitution were not respected.
 The Government orchestrated constitutional changes to enhance its political power
 and dashed the opposition's hopes for a peaceful settlement of the civil conflict by
 manipulation of the May presidential elections. Its military offensive and the virtual
 occupation of the north by national defense forces essentially of Somali origin, along
 with the attendant abuse of the Afar civilians living there, moved Djiboutians penil-
 ously close to open ethnic conflict. The authorities also continued to detain arbitrar-
 ily political opponents and to abuse detainees, reportedly including by the use of tor-
 ture. Violence against women and children continued to be a problem; rape was on
 the rise in 1993. It often goes unpunished.
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known instances of
 deliberately targeted political killings, but fighting between the army and the FRUD
 led to many civilian casualties (see Section 1.g.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported disappearances or abductions, yet the
 Government again failed to investigate the disappearance of 12 Afars on December
 18, 1991. These 12 are presumed dead and are listed among the 59 victims of the
 massacre on that date of Afar civilians in Arhiba, Djiboutiville. Gendarmerie offmers
 implicated in the massacre have not been punished. Nor did the Djiboutian army
 
 
 try the soldiers who tortured and killed Hasna Mohamed All in 1992. There is rea-
 son to believe that high-level officials condoned their action after the fact.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution affirms that no one shall be subjected to torture, nor to other inhu-
 man, cruel, degrading, or humiliating punishments. However, security forces contin-
 ued to abuse detainees, mainly Afars and criminal suspects. In this connection the
 Movement for Solidarity with Civilian Victims of the North affirmed that at feast
 12 Afar women were raped by government forces during a September 5 attack on
 rebel strongholds.
 In 1993 credible witnesses reported seeing police officials beating two British na-
 tionals with fists and a broken bottle and dragging them by their hair into a police
 station for interrogation following a dispute in a local bar.
 President Gouled's Chief of Staff, Ismael Omar Guelleh, heads the secret police.
 Many of his critics assert that he has orchestrated the torture of opponents to
 Gouled's regime. Interrogation techniques have included use of "the swine by which
 victims are tied by their wrists and ankles to a horizontal pole and beaten all over.
 In general, the Government has taken no action to pursue or prosecute persons ac-
 cused of torture.
 In the overcrowded central prison, former prime minister Ali Aref Bourhan and
 his fellow inmates staged a brief hunger strike in June to protest the curtailment
 of family visits. Subsequently, family visits resumed, but Ali Aref's relatives main-
 tained that he had no access to medical care for chronic skin and prostate ailments.
 The Government permits representatives of the International Committee for the
 Red Cross (ICRC) to have regular access to all prisoners whether civilian or mili-
 ta. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Ministry of Interior regularly dis-
 regards the criminal procedures which stipulate that the State may not detain a
 person beyond 48 hours without an examining magistrate's formal charge. In par-
 ticular, people who express views critical of the Government and the President are
 often subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention. The national police briefly ar-
 rested Ibrahim Warsama Myreh, "Douneh", a nephew of the President and a mem-
 ber of the ruling party, after he criticized government-sanctioned fraud during the
 May 7 presidential elections. On September 15, police detained Mohamed Houmed
 Souleh the President of the Djiboutian Association for the Respect of Human Rights
 and Liberties; he was subsequently released. Another victim of arbitrary detention
 and interrogation was Dabale Ahmed Kassim, editor of the weekly paper, The Com-
 bat, who was accused of offending institutions of the State, a charge which govern-
 ment authorities typically use to keep political opponents in line.
 With the ICRC acting as intermediary in the exchange, and with the cooperation
 of the Ethiopian Government, the Djibouti Government and the FRUD exchanged
 detainees on December 1: The Government released 68 detainees, and the FRUD
 released 26 members of the armed forces.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The legal system comprises legislation and execu-
 tive decrees, French codified law adopted at independence, Shari'a (Islamic law),
 traditions of the native nomadic peoples, and a Constitution modeled on the Con-
 stitution of the Fifth French Republic. Crimes committed in urban centers are dealt
 with in accordance with French-inspired law and judicial practice in the regular
 courts. Civil actions may be brought in these courts or in the traditional courts.
 The Constitution states that all persons have the right to life, liberty, and the se-
 curity and integrity of the person. It also declares that the accused is innocent until
 proven guilty, has the right to legal counsel, and has the right to be examined by
 a doctor if imprisoned. Theoretically, imprisonment can occur only if an arrest de-
 cree is confirmed by a judicial magistrate. In practice, security forces arrest people
 without warrants, and constitutional provisions for a fair trial are often not re-
 spected.
 The judiciary is not independent of the executive. The State Security Court tries
 people accused of political crimes and persons judged by the President to be a dan-
 ger to national security. Some members of the State Security Court as well as inves-
 tigating magistrates do not have a legal education. Political trials, such as the trial
 ofAli Aref ourhan in July 1992, may be appealed to the Supreme Court, but the
 judgments of the lower courts are usually sustained. On June 20, the Supreme
 Court rejected Ali Arefs appeal of the State Security Court's guilty verdict.
 A general amnesty for 213 criminals in September did not apply to Ali Aref
 Bourhan, Mohamed Houmed Souleh, and other detainees considered political pris-
 oners by human rights monitors. However, a December 15 presidential pardon re-
 leased Ali Aref and 13 associates.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though the Constitution provides for the inviolability of the family, home, cor-
 
 
 77
 respondence, and communications, telephone service to opponents of the regime, in-
 cluding opposition party and Afar leaders, is believed to be tapped by the security
 services.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The conflict between the armed forces and the Afar-led insurgency resulted
 in excessive use of force and violations of humanitarian law concerning the treat-
 ment of civilians.
 On September 5, FRUD combatants ambushed an army convoy 15 kilometers out-
 side Assa Gueyla, killing four soldiers and wounding seven. The rebels kidnaped
 and raped a woman member of the convoy. Afar leaders asserted that the convoy
 had been sent to resupply government troops. Retaliation by government forces left
 a reported 51 dead in the vicinity of Randa and Tadjoura, according to FRUD and
 other Afar sources. A northern traditional leader confirmed 21 civilian dead near
 Tadjoura alone. Despite credible reports to the contrary, the Government denied
 that its security forces perpetrated a massacre of civilians.
 The Djibutian Association for the Respect of Human Rights and Liberties, an or-
 ganization whose credibility remains to be established, claimed that innocent Afar
 civilians were often killed indiscriminately by government military and paramilitary
 forces in northern Djibouti. In one such instance in July, soldiers reportedly killed
 a father and son, Mola Omar and Mohamed Mola, in the vicinity of the town of
 Lahassa.
 During the first 6 months of 1993, the ICRC maintained medical clinics at some
 10 locations in the north, including the towns of Assa Gueyla and Dorra. After the
 government offensive of July, independent organizations such as the ICRC and Doc-
 tors Without Borders no longer had access to northern Djibouti. For this reason,
 FRUD reports of atrocities and government reports of ambushes have not been inde-
 p endently confirmed. The Government continues to deny access to the north to em-
 aEies, international organizations, and other observers. All these organizations
 continue t receive reports of human rights violations which cumulatively strength-
 en the circumstantial case against the Government.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government continued to exercise control
 of the national media. During the Presidential campaign which was confined to the
 4 to 6 weeks preceding the May 7 elections, it permitted political debate and made
 available equal television and radio time to the five presidential candidates to ex-
 press their views. However, the official media devoted disproportionate coverage to
 the activities of the ruling party.
 The Government employed economic coercion to stifle freedom of speech, firing
 public sector employees who supported opposition candidates or unwelcome politicsl
 ideas. Since President Gouled's reelection, persons who have publicly expressed
 views critical of the Government or caused offense to the President have been inter-
 rogated, arrested, or detained-occasionally for a long period-before being tried for
 defamation, as in the case of Mohamed Houmed Souleh (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government Information Secretariat censors the official press, which presents
 the views of the ruling party. Djibouti's radio and television stations and one news-
 paper, La Nation, a French-language weekly, are government owned and operated.
 The official media do not criticize the Government. The newspapers of the two legal
 opposition parties circulate freely and openly criticize the Government.
 The Government neither interferes with foreign broadcasts nor prevents the dis-
 tribution of foreign publications or detains persons in possession of such publica-
 tions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government effectively
 bans political protest by selective enforcement of public assembly laws, in spite of
 the freedom of assembly provisions of the new Constitution. Permits are required
 for peaceful assembly from the Ministry of Interior. The PRD and the PND have
 applied for and been granted such permits for rallies in the past.
 The Government permitted independent presidential candidates and the two au-
 thorized political parties to hold rallies before the election, but let it be known that
 public protest of the results would not be tolerated. As the Government had harshly
 repressed an opposition political rally in the aftermath of the legislative elections
 of December 18, 1992, the PND and the PRD, fearing further government repres-
 sion, refrained from demonstrating against the Government's manipulation of the
 election process.
 The Constitution sanctions four political parties. The ruling party, the RPP, re-
 served for itself the right to determine the criteria and the circumstances under
 which the other three parties could be recognized as legal entities. At year's end,
 the Government had recognized just two opposition parties, the PND and the PRD.

 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion. Virtually the entire population
 is Sunni Muslim. The Government imposes no sanctions on those who choose to ig-
 nore Islamic teachings on such matters as diet, alcoholic consumption, and religious
 fasting.
 The foreign community supports Roman Catholic, French Protestant, Greek Or-
 thodox, and Ethiopian Orthodox churches. Foreign clergy and missionaries may per-
 form charitable works but proselytizing, while not illegal, is discouraged.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Travel within Djibouti has been disrupted by civil war so movement be-
 tween the north and south is severely restricted. In principle, Djiboutians may trav-
 el or emigrate to foreign countries,without restriction or interference, except to Is-
 rael.
 In June the Government refused to issue travel documents to the President of the
 Association for the Respect of Human Rights and Liberties, Mohamed Houmed
 Souleh, and to Samira Ai Hugo, wife of FRUD spokesman Abbo Abbatte, who had
 hoed to travel to the Vienna International Conference on Human Rights.
 Djibouti hosts almost 100,000 refugees, according to government sources. This
 would be approximately a fifth of the total population. The United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) acknowledges the presence of some 45,000 ref-
 ugees, a more credible figure. Most refugees come from Somalia although some are
 from Ethiopia. About 20,000 are in four refugee camps. Most of the other refugees
 live in Djiboutiville, where they have no refugee status.
 Some 4,000 Afar civilians fleeing civil confict sought refuge in Ethiopia and Eri-
 trea. As many as 9,000 may have fled to those countries since the end of 1991.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of citizens to change their government, while theoretically possible, re-
 mains unrealizable. The Government permits multiparty democracy as long as it
 poses no credible threat to it, i.e., as long as the elite which has held power since
 independence in 1977 can retain it. The Constitution, voted into law on September
 4, 1992, lays down fundamental rights, almost all of which are circumscribed or con-
 trolled in their implementation by the ruling regime.
 President Gouled was reelected to a fourth term on May 7 in a tightly controlled
 multiparty presidential election. He was endorsed by about 60 percent of the 50 per-
 cent of the registered voters who went to the polls. The President secured only 53
 percent of the votes in the capital where, by all accounts, the balloting was fair, but
 he claimed more than 80 percent of the votes in the rebellious Afar-inhabited north-
 ern districts where international observers detected widespread fraud. The Afars,
 who compose at least one-third of the population, heeded admonitions from the
 FRUD to boycott the election. President Gouled's four electoral opponents, all fellow
 Issas, issued a Joint communique characterizing the election as a "massive fraud,"
 and the FRUD dismissed the exercise as a sham.
 The Afars, a large segment of the body politic, boycotted all three occasions when
 the Djiboutians were called upon to vote. They also boycotted the constitutional ref-
 erendum in September 1992, on the grounds that it was a creation of President
 Gouled's regime and not a text upon which the disaffected members of the commu-
 nity were consulted. They claimed the Constitution was tailored in such a way as
 to ensure the President's domination of virtually all aspects of the government-in-
 cluding the legislature and judiciary. Having rejected the Constitution, the Afars
 boycotted the subsequent elections for fear of legitimizing the process initiated by
 the President and his supporters.
 Women are poorly represented in government and in the political process. There
 are no women in the Cabinet or in Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government was disdainful of a domestic human rights group. It refused to
 recognize the Association for the Respect of Human Rights and Liberties and im-
 prisoned its leader, who had criticized government suppression in the north. Gov-
 ernment officials viewed the human rights Association as a political body and treat-
 ed it as an opposition group.
 The Government cooperated with some international and nongovernmental orga-
 nizations, notably the ICRC, which had access to the central prison and interceded
 on behalf of detainees in the conflict between the Government and the FRUD. On
 December 1, the ICRC arranged the exchange of 68 FRUD detainees held by the
 Government for 26 held by the FRUD in Ethiopia.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of language, race, sex, or
 religion, but discrimination against women and ethnic minorities is widespread.
 Women.-Women legally possess full civil rights. They traditionally play a second-
 ary role in public life and do not have the same professional opportunities as men.
 Women are active in small trade as well as in the clerical and secretarial fields.
 There are only a few women in the professions (civil service, judiciary, teaching and
 medicine) and the security services.
 According to medical personnel, all forms of violence against women increased in
 1993. The Government has not specifically addressed violence against women or
 children. Very few perpetrators of crimes against women, including rape, are pun-
 ished. When punished, they are often pardoned or serve short sentences. Most do-
 mestic and community violence is considered a family or clan affair. Occurrences of
 gang rape indicate that violence against women is no longer controllable by tradi-
 tional authorities.
 Children.-Although there are a few charitable organizations working with chil-
 dren, the Government devotes virtually no public resources to the advancement of
 children's rights and welfare.
 In 1988 the Djiboutian National Women's Union began an educational campaign
 against female genital mutilation, particularly infibulation, the most extensive and
 dangerous form of sexual mutilation in Djibouti, which is generally performed on
 girls between the ages of 7 and 10. The campaign has had only marginal impact
 on this pervasive custom, which is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to physical and mentalhealth. According to an independent ex-
 pert, as many as 90 percent of Djiboutian females have undergone this operation.
 Judicial reforms enacted in 1991 stipulate that anyone found guilty of genital muti-
 lation of young girls can face a heavy fine and 5 years in prison. No one has been
 convicted under this statute.
 The Government has not specifical!y addressed other forms of child abuse which
 are often lightly punished. When a child is raped or otherwise abused, the perpetra-
 tor is usually fined an amount sufficient to cover medical care given to the injured
 child.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government continued with its dis-
 criminatory ethnic policy. Because of the President's policy of assigning key posi-
 tions of authority to members of his tribal group, in particular to powerful advisers
 in his Cabinet, the Issa (the dominant Somali clan in Djibouti) control the ruling
 RPP, the civil service, and the military. The President's subclan the Mammasane,
 is particularly strong and wields disproportionate power in the affairs of state.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation concerning the handi-
 capped.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The organized labor movement is in its infancy.
 Fewer than 20 percent of workers in the very small wage economy are union mem-
 bers. Many unions represent employees of individual private or state-owned enter-
 prises. Under the Constitution, workers are free to join unions and to strike pro-
 vided they comply with legally prescribed requirements. Previously, the Government
 exerted controlover individual unions through the state organized labor confed-
 eration, the General Union of Djiboutian Workers (UGTD). The UGTD has been in
 eclipse since the establishment of the independently organized Democratic Labor
 Union (UDT) in 1992.
 In May secondary school teachers successfully organized an independent labor
 union, SYNESED. After its members struck and refused to grade end-of-year exams,
 the union was recognized by the Government.
 Unions are free to maintain relations and exchanges with labor organizations in
 other countries. The UGTD is affiliated with the pan-African trade union body, the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although labor has the right
 to organize and bargain collectively, collective bargaining rarely occurs. Relations
 between employers and workers are informal and paternalistic. Wages are generally
 established unilaterally by employers on the basis of Ministry of Labor Guidelines.
 When disputes about wages or health and safety issues arise, the Ministry of Labor
 encourages direct, ad hoc resolution by labor representatives and employers. Em-
 ployees or employers may request formal administrative hearings before the Min-
 istry of Labor's Inspection Service. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination
 against employees, and employers guilty of such discrimination are legally required
 to reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 
 
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor. This prohibition is generally observed, but security forces sometimes
 compel illegal immigrants to work lor them in lieu of deportation.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age, 14 years,
 is generally respected. The paucity of labor inspectors makes it unlikely that inves-
 tigations are ever carried out, according to union sources. Children may and do
 work in family owned businesses, such as restaurants and small shops, at all hours.
 Children are generally not employed under hazardous conditions. Many of the beg-
 gars in the streets are young children whose parents have forced them to beg for
 a living.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Only a tiny minority of the population is gain-
 fully employed. Minimum wage rates are specified by government regulation, ac-
 cording to occupational categories, and are enforced by the Ministry of Labor. Last
 raised in 1980, the minimum monthly wage rate of approximately $200 for a 12-
 hour day of unskilled labor does not provide adequate compensation for a worker
 and his family to maintain a decent standard of living. Many workers receive hous-
 ing and transportation allowances.
 By law the workweek is 40 hours, often spread over 6 days. Overtime pay and
 mandatory seniority bonuses are provided. Workers are guaranteed daily and week-
 ly rest periods and paid annual vacations. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for
 occupational health and safety standards, wages, and work hours. Because enforce-
 ment is ineffective, workers face hazardous working conditions, particularly at the
 port. Workers rarely protest as they fear replacement by others willing to accept the
 risks.
