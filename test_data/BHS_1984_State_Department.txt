 THE BAHAMAS
 The Bahamas is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy with
 regular national elections. As a Commonwealth country, its
 political and legal traditions are similar to those of Great
 Britain, with emphasis on the rights of individuals. The
 Progressive Liberal Party has governed since 1967 under the
 same leader, Sir Lynden Pindling.
 The country has a tradition of human rights observance. The
 Constitution provides for the protection of fundamental rights
 and freedoms without discrimination by reason of race, origin,
 political opinions, color, creed, or sex, and its provisions
 are carried out in practice. The judiciary is independent,
 and the Privy Council in The United Kingdom serves as the
 court of final appeal. No major changes occurred in the human
 rights record during 1984.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no killings for political motives during
 recent years. There are no known terrorist groups in the
 country.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no cases of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel or degrading treatment or punishment are
 prohibited by the Constitution. Both American citizens as
 well as Bahamians have on occasion reported instances of
 police brutality during the course of arrests or in obtaining
 confessions to crimes. Redress is possible through the courts,
 but it is rarely sought.
 The downtown Nassau jail is crowded and unsanitary, with food
 barely adequate; conditions at the Fox Hill prison are austere
 and overcrowded but somewhat better. The Freeport central
 lockup is unsanitary.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment
 and requires that persons be charged without undue delay.
 This is observed in practice. Habeas corpus is respected,
 charges must be brought within 24 hours of an arrest, and
 those arrested are allowed access to lawyers of their own
 choosing.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are fair and public. The Constitution entitles
 defendants to counsel, and access to defendants is freely
 permitted. The judiciary is independent of executive or
 military control, and there is no political interference in
 its activities. There are no political prisoners.

 THE BAHAMAS
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not interfere in the private lives of its
 citizens. The sanctity of the home is safeguarded by custom,
 law, and tradition and is respected in practice. The
 Constitution permits searches to occur only with a
 court-issued warrant. Personal privacy is respected, and
 there are no known cases of wiretapping or interception of
 correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Full freedom of speech and press exist in the Bahamas. There
 are three privately owned daily newspapers, one publicly owned
 radio station with three frequencies, and one publicly owned
 television station. There are several news weeklies, of which
 three are affiliated with political parties, including one
 affiliated with the leftist Vanguard Party. The television
 station is government-owned and has been accused by. the
 opposition Free National Movement of political reporting
 biased in favor of the ruling party. There is no political
 censorship or intimidation of journalists. For example, in
 1984, the local press published details of a commission of
 inquiry, investigating charges of official corruption, which
 were politically embarrassing to the Government. U.S.
 newspapers and magazines carrying such stories enter and
 circulate freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution protects the right to assemble freely and
 associate with others and specifically mentions political
 parties and trade unions. Labor unions are independent of the
 Government and are free to organize, assemble, bargain, and
 strike. Many unions are affiliated with counterparts in other
 countries and in the International Labor Organization. The
 Secretary General of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas Trade
 Union Congress, an umbrella organization comprising most of
 the leading trade unions, also serves as President of the
 Caribbean Congress of Labor.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion, freedom of conscience is
 protected, and discrimination on the basis of creed is
 prohibited. Some members of the small Rastafarian cult
 believe they are persecuted by the police, but the police
 assert that their actions have been directed against some
 illegal Rastafarian practices, such as drug use.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigraton, and Repatriation
 There exists freedom of movement within and outside the
 country. However, an estimated 12,000-20,000 Haitians who
 left Haiti mainly for economic reasons now reside illegally in
 the Bahamas and have no legal status; during 1984
 approximately 250 who had been incarcerated were repatriated
 to Haiti. The Bahamas continues to be concerned about the
 arrival of illegal aliens, principally Haitians, and insists
 upon its sovereign right to repatriate them to their country

 of origin. This problem appears to be economically rather
 than politically based.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Bahamas is a constitutional democracy governed by a freely
 elected Prime Minister and Parliament, with a resident
 Governor General under ihe British Commonwealth system. The
 political process is open to all elements of the society.
 There are two principal political parties, the governing and
 dominant Progressive Liberal Party and the opposition Free
 National Movement.
 The Progressive Liberal Party led the country for five years
 of internal self-government before independence in 1973, and
 has held power without interruption since that time. It
 currently holds 32 of the 43 seats in Parliament. The Free
 National Movement, a more conservative party, holds the other
 11 seats. The radical leftist party, the Vanguard, has no
 seats.
 The last general election was in 1982 and new elections need
 not take place before 1987. Elections can be called sooner,
 however.
 The Progressive Liberal Party has used its tenure in office to
 strengthen its political position through selective political
 appointments and by hiring political supporters as civil
 servants, which has drawn increasing opposition criticism.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests from international organizations
 to investigate human rights conditions in the Bahamas. The
 Government has not generally been active ih human rights
 affairs but it has criticized human rights violations in South
 Africa. Amnesty International did not mention the Bahamas in
 its 1984 report. Freedom House rated the country "free" but
 noted that government power is partly maintained *by
 discrimination in favor of supporters and control over the
 broadcast media.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Bahamas is made up of some 700 islands or cays; only 10
 have populations of any size. Of these, two islands, New
 Providence (Nassau) and Grand Bahama, contain over 75 percent
 of the population. Most economic and cultural activities take
 place on these two islands. The Government has sought to
 develop the other, "family' islands to curb the movement by
 young people to the two major centers of activity.
 The Bahamas has a good record of nondiscrimination on sexual,
 racial, and religious grounds. Notwithstanding the transfer
 of political power from the colonial era's white elite to a
 black majority (80 percent) in the 1960's, a few white
 Bahamians hold high-level civil service and political posts,
 and a few are in Parliament. Women participate prominently in
 all levels of business and government. In both law and
 practice women enjoy equal status. Women serve as Permanent
 Secretaries in ministries (the highest civil service

 THE BAHAMAS
 position), one was elected to a seat in Parliament, and four
 have been appointed to the Senate. Women are well represented
 in the professional and private sectors. Many businesses are
 owned by women. Several magistrates are female, and women
 serve as uniformed police officers.
 The current population is 228,000. Life expectancy at birth is
 70.07 years, while infant mortality is 20.20 per 1,000
 births. The annual population growth rate is 2 percent. The
 Bahamas has 925 hospital beds, and Ministry of Health doctors
 make regular trips to the outer islands. 1979 statistics
 indicate that 65 percent of the total population had access to
 safe water. The urban percentage was 100 percent, while the
 rural percentage was just 13 percent.
 In education, the Government is continuing to place emphasis
 on technical and vocational training. While literacy rates
 have remained about 93 percent over the past decade, with a
 1980 primary school enrollment ratio of 97.31 percent, a
 weakening of education in the public school system has
 resulted from shortages of teachers, equipment, and supplies
 as well as physical deterioration of many schools. There are
 225 schools in the Bahamas of which 62 are private.
 Per capita gross national product was estimated at $3,831 for
 1982. The rate of inflation from August 1983 to September ï¿½
 1984 was estimated by the Department of Statistics at 3.90
 percent, while the overall unemployment figure for 1979 was
 19.6 percent (for those between 14 and 19 it is estimated at
 42.1 percent, and 22.7 percent for those between 20 and 24).
 The Government is continuing to attempt to reduce unemployment
 by creating new jobs in tourism through both private and
 public investment.
 Drug abuse is a growing problem, especially among the younger
 generation affected by high unemployment. Primarily the
 result of spillover from the drug traffic in transit to the
 U.S., the ready availability of high-grade cocaine has led to
 a nigh level of addiction. Several privately sponsored
 programs are attempting to address the problem, while the
 Government is reviewing the recommendations of a special task
 force called to study the situation.
