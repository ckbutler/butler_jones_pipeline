 COMOROS
 The Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros comprises three islands and claims
 a fourth, Mayotte, which is still governed by France. The Comoros has a constitu-
 tional government but has been prone to coups since independence in 1975. The
 most recent came in September 1995, when foreign-led mercenaries and disaffected
 Comorian troops attempted to overthrow the elected government of President Said
 Mohamed Djohar. French military forces sent to the island 1 week later arrested
 the mercenaries,-reinstaled the elected Prime Minister, and freed Djohar but re-
 moved him for "medical treatment" to the French Department of Reunion. Prime
 Minister Caabi El Yachroutou declared himself acting president, and pledged to hold
 new presidential elections. In January President Djohar returned to Comoros to as-
 sume ceremonial duties in accordance with an agreement brokered by the Organiza-
 tion for African Unity (OAU). In March Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim was elected
 President. The elections were deemed to be free and fair by international observers.
 In April President Taki dissolved the National Assembly and postponed general
 elections beyond the 40 days within which the 1992 Constitution required they be
 held. President Taki appointed a committee to draft a new constitution which was
 approved in a referendum in October. Parliamentary elections were held in Decem-
 ber.
 The Comorian Defense Force (FCD) and the Gendarmerie are responsible for in-
 ternal security. Both are under civilian control, but their loyalty is suspect as shown
 by the participation of several hundred soldiers in the 1995 coup. French officers
 serve as advisers to the FCD.
 The economy of this extremely poor country is dominated by agriculture, but there
 is a shortage of arable land; soil erosion exacerbates this problem. Revenues from
 the main crops-vanilla, essence of ylang ylang, and cloves--continue to fall, while
 the population (about 500,000) is growing at an extremely high rate of about 3 per-
 cent. The per capita income is approximately $470. The Comoros is a part of the
 French franc monetary zone, but the 1994 devaluation of the franc did not improve
 the import-dependent economy, and it has had serious short-term consequences on
 government finances. The Comoros depends heavily on financial assistance from
 France and the European Union.
 The human rights situation did not improve in 1996. Soldiers being held for alleg-
 edly participating in a 1992 coup attempt were released by the mercenaries in 1995
 and later granted amnesty, but the Taki Government took steps to restrict freedom
 of speech and press. Prison conditions remain harsh but prisoners are rarely held
 overnight. Societal discrimination against women continued to be a serious problem.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 As far as is known, there has been no official investigation into the deaths of two
 p ersons reportedly killed and secretly buried by the Gendarmerie on the eve of the
 lgsative elections in December 1993 on the island of Anjouan.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no substantiated reports of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrad-
 ing treatment or punishment.
 ron conditions continued to be poor. A lack of proper sanitation, overcrowding,
 inadequate medical facilities, and poor diet are common problems. The Government
 has not taken action to remedy these problems. Because of these conditions, even
 prisoners found guilty of serious crimes are typically released in the evening to go
 home to sleep and are expected to return the next morning.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The 1996 Constitution prohibits arbi-
 trary arrest and imprisonment. It does not specify a time limit between arrest and
 appearance before a magstrate. The law does not specify how long prisoners held
 for security reasons maybe detained without being charged.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The 1996 Constitution provides for an independ-
 ent judiciary assured by the President. Trials are open to the public except for lim-
 ited exceptions defined by law.
 The High Council, made up of four members appointed by the President, three
 members elected by the Federal Assembly, and a member of each island council,
 also serves as the High Court of Justice and rules on cases of constitutional law.
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law of all citizens. It does not
 mention right to counsel. There are very few lawyers in the country, making it dif-
 ficult to obtain legal representation. The Government does not provide free legal
 counsel to the accused. The legal system incorporates Islamic law as well as French
 legal codes. Most disputes are settled by village elders or by a civilian court of first
 instance.
 In September a man who allegedly murdered a pregnant woman in front of sev-
 eral witnesses was found guilty in a public, 2-day trial before a lay penal court. He
 had legal counsel. Prior to the conclusion of the man's trial and sentencing, Presi-
 dent Taki stated publicly that the trial process was unnecessarily slow and called
 for harsher punishments for criminals. The man was publicly executed on Septem-
 ber 16, and was the first person to be sentenced to death since the late 1970's.
 There are no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no known cases of arbitrary interference with privacy or correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution does not provide for freedom
 of the press and the Government sought to restrict this freedom in January. The
 National Unity Government, which ruled between the restoration of civilian rule
 and the March presidential elections, arrested two journalists who criticized mem-
 bers of the Government for corruption. The journalists were released shortly there-
 after. Several small, independent newspapers freely criticize the Government, but
 in June the Minister for Information convened journalists to remind them of their
 duty to support the country and the leadership. In July the Government shut down
 and confiscated the transmitter of the independent radio station, Tropic FM, accus-
 ing it of disseminating false news and inciting and provoking public disorder. Ob-
 servers say that the Taki Government also has exerted more pressure on the semi-
 official weekly, Al-Watwan, whose editors are selected by the Minister for Informa-
 tion. Comorians discuss and criticize the Government and its leading personalities
 with more caution than in previous years.
 The government-controlled radio station, Radio Comoros, is the only station in the
 country following the closure by the Government of Tropic FM. Comorians receive
 broadcasts from Mayotte Radio as well as from French television without inter-
 ference, but these carry only limited news about Comoros developments. Satellite
 antennas are popular and amateur radio licenses are issued without hindrance. For-
 eign newspapers are available, as are books from abroad.
 Although there is no university in the Comoros, secondary level teachers and stu-
 dents speak freely, and students occasionally engaged in meetings which criticized
 the Government.
 
 
 59
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The 1996 Constitution does
 not provide for freedom of assembly and association, but the Government generally
 respects these rights in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-An overwhelming majority of the population is Sunni
 Muslim. The Constitution prohibits discrimination before the law based on religion
 or religious belief but establishes an ulamas council, which advises the President,
 Prime Minister, President of the Federal Assembly, the Council of Isles, and the is-
 land governors on whether bills, ordinances, decrees, and laws are in conformity
 with the principles of Islam. The Government permits non-Muslims to practice their
 faith, and Christian missionaries work in local hospitals and schools but are not al-
 lowed to proselytize.
 In August President Taki announced a ban on alcohol and indecent apparel worn
 by women, citing a need to return to Islamic values.
 d. Freedom ofMovement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on travel within the country or abroad, and
 exit visas are generally freely granted.
 The Government has not formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first
 asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right, but it has not yet been fully demonstrated that they, in
 fact, have the ability to change their government peacefully through free and fair
 elections. The Constitution stipulates that sovereignty belongs to the people and is
 exercised by elected representatives or by referendum. Although the March presi-
 dential elections were characterized as free and fair by international observers,
 Djohar's removal from office by mercenaries and the subsequent stripping of his
 power by the National Unity Government was not a legal or democratic method of
 changing the government.
 In October President Taki's proposed Constitution was approved in a national ref-
 erendum. The new Constitution mandates that all political parties that did not win
 at least two seats per island in the December legislative elections are automatically
 dissolved unless they join other parties validly represented in the Federal Assembly.
 If only one party is represented in the assembly, the party or group obtaining the
 second largest number of votes is permitted to continue its activities.
 Villagechiefs and Muslim religious leaders tend to dominate local politics. Tradi-
 tional social religious, and economic institutions also importantly affect the coun-
 trys political life.
 Traditionally, Comorian society is male-dominated, making it very difficult for
 women to become involved in politics. Women have the right to vote and participate
 in the political process. There is one female minister. In National Assembly elections
 held in December, no women were elected.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Comoros Human Rights Association, established in 1990, continues to func-
 tion, but many members are unwilling to criticize the Government vigorously for
 fear of losing their civil service positions. The Government cooperates with inter-
 national human rights organizations, including the International Committee of the
 Red Cross.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for the equality before the law without discrimination
 based on race, religion, or religious belief but is silent on sex, disability, language,
 and social status. The Government generally respects these provisions in practice,
 but discourages the practice of religions other than Islam.
 Women.-Violence against women occurs, but medical authorities, the police, and
 women's groups believe that it is rare. In theory a woman could seek protection
 through the courts in the case of violence, but in reality the issue would most likely
 be addressed within the extended family or at the village level.
 Men have the dominant role in Comorian society, and few women hold positions
 of responsibility in government or business. Societal discrimination against women
 is most apparent outside the major towns where women have onerous farming and
 child-rearing duties, with fewer opportunities for education and wage employment.
 In contrast change in the status of women is most evident in the major towns,
 where growing numbers of women are in the labor force and generally receive wages
 comparable to those of men engaged in similar work. While legal discrimination ex-
 ists in some areas, in general inheritance and property rights do not disfavor
 
 
 women; for example, the house the father of the bride traditionally provides to the
 couple at the time of their marriage remains her property even in the case of di-
 vorce. In August President Taki announced a ban on indecent apparel worn by
 women (see Section 2.c.).
 Children.-The Government, while committed to the protection of children's rights
 and welfare in theory, has an extremely limited ability to put this into practice. Pop-
 ulation pressure and poverty force some families to place their children into the
 homes of others. These children, often as young as 7 years of age, typically work
 long hours as domestic servants in exchange for food and shelter. The few legal in-
 struments which address the rights and welfare of children are not enforced because
 of a lack of inspectors.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is not generally prac-
 ticed, and child abuse appears to be rare.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no evidence of widespread discrimination
 against the disabled in the provision of education or other services. No legislation
 is in force or pending concerning accessibility to public buildings or services for peo-
 ple with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution does not provide for the right to
 unionize and strike, but these rights are practiced freely. Farming on small land-
 holdings, subsistence fishing, and petty commerce make up the daily activity of most
 of the population. Hence, the wage labor force is small; less than 7,000 including
 government employees, and less than 2,000 excluding them. Teachers, civil serv-
 ants, and dock workers are unionized. Unions are independent of the Government.
 Teachers and hospital workers go on strike intermittently, mostly because they do
 not get paid for months. There are no laws protecting strikers from retribution, but
 there were no known instances of retribution.
 There are no restrictions on unions joining federations or affiliating with inter-
 national bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to bar-
 gain collectively, and strikes are legal. Wages are set by employers in the small pri-
 vate sector and by the Government, especially the Ministries of Finance and Labor,
 in the larger public sector. The Labor Code, which is only loosely enforced, does not
 set up a system for resolving labor disputes, and it does not prohibit antiunion dis-
 crimination by employers.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution does not mention
 forced or compulsory labor, but it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code defines 15 years
 of age as the minimum age for the employment of children. The Ministry of Labor
 has few resources to enforce this provision, but outside of domestic work child labor
 is not an issue due to the general lack of wage employment opportunities. Children
 generally help with the work of their families in the subsistence farming and fishing
 sectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government mandates minimum wage
 levels. The rates, which vary by occupation, have not been changed in over a decade
 and no longer reflect economic realities. The minimum wage for a laborer is about
 $11 (4,600 Comorian francs) per month. The Government periodically reminds em-
 ployers to respect the Labor Code, which specifies 1 day off per week, plus 1 month
 of paid vacation per year, but does not set a standard workweek. There are no safe-
 ty or health standards for the minuscule manufacturing sector.
 CONGO
 The Republic of the Congo continues its transition to democratic government. In
 1992 Pascal Lissouba became its first democratically elected president after 24 years
 of one-party rule. Elections for the multiparty legislature followed in 1993. The Gov-
 ernment continued to build upon the stable foundation provided by the Libreville
 Peace Accords, which ended a period of violent civil unrest in late 1992, 1993, and
 early 1994. The Government made some progress in establishing constitutionally
 mandated institutions, such as the Supreme Court; however it is still lagging in oth-
 ers. The Government continued to devolve power to regions and municipalities. The
 judiciary is independent although in some instances subject to government influ-
 ence.
 
 
 The national police and gendarmerie maintain internal security. The army and
 the border guard are responsible for external security but also have domestic re-
 sponsibilities. While the civilian authorities generally maintain effective control of
 the security forces, some members of the security forces committed human rights
 abuses.
 The economy depends heavily upon petroleum revenues and external capital. The
 Government made significant progress in economic liberalization and privatization.
 Per capita gross national product is $600.
 The Government's human rights record was mixed, with improvements in some
 aspects but deterioration in other areas. Security forces continued to use severe
 beatings and abuse to extract confessions and as punishment, and to arbitrarily ar-
 rest and beat refugees in Brazzaville. Prison conditions remained life threatening.
 The Government arrested and beat four unionists who were sentenced to 4 months'
 imprisonment for "impeachment of the freedom to work" in a strike judged illegal.
 The Government passed a press law that intimidated many journalists and in-
 creased the frequency of self-censorship. The Government arrested two men for "at-
 tack against the state in peacetime"; the men were sentenced to 1 year in prison
 and exile from the capital. The judiciary is subject to political influence, and lengthy
 pretrial detention remains aproblem. Societal discrimination and violence against
 women remained problems. Bantus continued to discriminate against and exploit
 Pygmies. Citizens sometimes resorted to vigilante justice, killing presumed thieves
 and "sorcerers." The partial disbandment and integration into the government secu-
 rity forces of private political militias early in the year reduced the incidence of citi-
 zen harassment, extortion, theft, and beatings carried out by these forces.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings committed by the Government.
 Civilians, however, continued to employ vigilante justice against presumed thieves
 and "sorcerers," sometimes beating them to death. Congo's leading human rights
 watch group, the Organization Congolaise des Droits de 1'Homme (OCDH), reported
 11 such killings. No judicial actions followed.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatient or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits the use of torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment. In practice, however, some security force members routinely severely
 beat detainees both to extract confessions" and as punishment. Security force mem-
 bers generally act with impunity.
 Security forces beat four trade unionists prior to their trial (see Section 6.a.).
 Prison conditions are dire and life-threatening. The death rate and the incidence
 of disease and malnutrition are considerably higher than among the general popu-
 lation. Buildings are dilapidated, security is lax, and food and medical care are inad-
 equate. Most prisons, built during French colonial rule, were designed for short-term
 incarceration and low-inmate population. Although the maximum capacity of the
 Brazzaville prison is ostensibly 100, over 400 inmates were being held there in Feb-
 ruary. Prisoners often have to depend on their families to bring them food, as the
 Government does not provide meals. In the interior of the country, nonviolent in-
 mates leave their cells during the day to forage for food in the surrounding towns.
 They return of their own accord in the evenings. With financial backing from the
 French Government, the Government's High Commissioner for Human Rights
 launched an initiative to improve prison conditions. The program managed to pro-
 vide some mattresses, clothing, and limited medication. Much, however, remains to
 be done to bring the prisons up to international standards. Rape and sexual abuse
 of women and children by prison guards was not commonplace.
 Political/security prisoners are held separately from the general prison population-
 however, their conditions do not differ significantly. Human rights groups reported
 difficulties in gaining access to prisons i the major urban centers of Brazzaville
 and Pointe-Noire. Access is facilitated, however, if an organization provides funds
 to ameliorate prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile. The Code of Penal Procedure requires that an individual
 be apprehended openly and have a lawyer present during initial questioning. The
 code further stipulates that warrants be issued before arrests are made and that
 detainees be brought before a judge within 3 days and either charged or released
 within 4 months. In practice, the Government often violated these legal procedures
 and did not respect the constitutional mandates.
 
 
 Detainees were promptly informed of the charges levied against them. However,
 many waited in prison for several months without being brought before a judge.
 Some detainees languish in jail for years because of lost files, oversights, and bu-
 reaucratic inertia. Except in a few cases with political overtones, lawyers and fami-
 lies had free access to detainees. Although the law provides for a system of bail,
 the average detainee lacks the financial means to meet bail. Over half of all persons
 in custody are pretrial detainees-70 percent at the central prison in Brazzaville.
 The Government often does not honor laws that provide for legal counsel for the in-
 digent.
 in May authorities arrested Colonel Bouissa Matoko at the airport after a search
 of his briefcase revealed "seditious" documents addressed to the former president,
 Denis Sassou Nguessou. Security forces conducted a raid on Matoko's home and
 found three guns and a small cache of grenades and ammunition. Colonel Matoko
 and the author of the "seditious" documents, Professor Gabriel Longombe, were con-
 victed in September of "attack on the security of the state in peacetime." They were
 sentenced to 1 year in prison, followed by 1 year of probation and each was fined
 $2,000. The sentence further stipulates that while on probation, the two are exiled
 from Brazzaville.
 In September the Government arrested Otto Mbongo for debts owed to the now
 bankrupt International Bank of Congo (BIDC). Mbongo was a key aide to former
 president Sassou Nguessou, and some allege that his arrest was politically moti-
 vated. The private media reported that Mbongo was arrested without a warrant, de-
 nied access to legal counsel, and refused family visitation. Mbongo is being held in
 an undisclosed location, separate from the general prison population. A trial date
 had not been set by year's end.
 Three political detainees were being held as of year's end.
 The Government does not use foreign exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. Certain rulings, however, suggested that in some instances the courts were
 subject to political influence.
 The judicial system consists of local courts, courts of appeal, and the Supreme
 Court.
 In general, defendants are tried in a public court of law presided over by a state-
 appointed magistrate. The defense has access to, and the right to counter prosecu-
 tion evidence and testimony. In formal courts, defendants are presumed innocent
 and have the right of appeal. The judiciary is overburdened with a caseload that
 far exceeds its capacity to ensure fair and timely public trials. Some cases never
 reach the court system, however. For example, it is common practice for citizens to
 beat thieves caught in the act, sometimes to death (see Section L.a.). In rural areas,
 traditional courts continue to handle many local disputes, especially property and
 probate cases. Many domestic disputes are adjudicated under traditional law and
 within the extended family.
 Colonel Bouissa and Professor Longombe (see Section 1.d.) were considered politi-
 cal prisoners by human rights observers.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the privacy of homes as well as correspondence and tele-
 communications. Official searches of private properties and communications require
 a warrant, but in practice, warrants are not used in all instances. There is govern-
 ment surveillance of some telephone lines.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion and calls for the establishment of an independent council to oversee private and
 electronic media and to safeguard speech and press freedoms. This council has not
 yet been established. In practice, individual freedom of expression is enjoyed, but
 press freedoms have been restricted. The Government retains monopoly power over
 radio and television.
 In July Parliament passed a new press law that has been roundly criticized by
 local journalists and some international media experts as repressive and limiting
 press freedom. The law mandates that newspapers be deposited at several govern-
 ment offices before sale. The law also requires journalists, publishers, printers, and
 even vendors to register their place of residence with a court. Police authorities
 went to the homes of various journalists ostensibly to confirm their place of resi-
 dence; however, some journalists reported feeling intimidated by these visits. Under
 the new law, journalists, publishers, printers, or vendors may be imprisoned for up
 to 5 years or fined up to $10,000 for a number of infractions including slander, incit-
 ing ethnic violence, and libel. The law allows the court to order the physical destruc-
 
 
 63
 tion of printing presses, if the court finds that the machinery was used to print an
 "inflammatory" article.
 Workers employed by the Government in the state-owned radio and television en-
 terprises often practice self-censorship. Although the new law has intimidated some
 of the private media, those with the political patronage of influential opposition
 members still criticize and disparage the Government.
 In July journalists met with the Minister of Communication in an effort to mod-
 erate the new law. The Minister agreed to take their concerns under consideration,
 but no changes were made. In August the Government confiscated all journals not
 in compliance with the law. Journals reappeared for sale the following week, after
 having complied with the new regulations.
 There were no known abridgements of academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. In practice, any group wishing to hold a public
 assembly must inform the Minister of Interior, who reserves the right to forbid as-
 semblies that threaten public order. The Minister of Interior, invoking this privilege,
 denied a request by a refugee organization to hold a meeting concerning problems
 being experienced with the government ministry charged with their protection (see
 Section 2.d.).
 There are no restrictions on trade associations or professional bodies, and affili-
 ation with international bodies is permitted.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right of all citizens to travel freely
 within Congo, and it specifically prohibits roadblocks and barriers. Nonetheless,
 military forces, political militias, and opportunists sometimes hindered free move-
 ment with barricades-generally demanding money. On occasion, motorists refusing
 to give money were detained for several hours. The National Conference Charter of
 Rights gives all citizens the right to travel abroad and return."
 The approximately 3,000 refugees in Brazzaville continued to encounter serious
 human rights abuses. Security forces sometimes subjected Brazzaville-based refu-
 gees to arbitrary arrests, intimidation, and beatings, and the refugees also experi-
 enced bureaucratic ineptitude. Midyear the Government instituted a mandatory
 "sponsorship" policy, which requires refugee/asylum seekers to secure a pledge of fi-
 nancial support before it will process their claims. At year's end, the Brazzaville of-
 fice of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was working with the
 Government to reverse this requirement. There was one report of a forced expulsion,
 but this claim proved untrue.
 In the Pointe-Noire area, the Congo hosts over 10,000 refugees, most of whom are
 from the Angolan enclave of Cabinda. There were no reports of human rights viola-
 tions against this group. The Government provided first asylum to approximately
 1,000 persons in 1996.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for popular election of the President and National As-
 sembly. In a transition from one-party rule to democracy, the current President was
 elected in 1992. Legislative elections followed in 1993. A dispute over two legislative
 contests has not yet been resolved. The next presidential election is scheduled for
 1997. In October successful, violence-free, indirect elections for one-third of the Sen-
 ate's seats were carried out.
 The Constitution divides power between the presidency and a government headed
 by a prime minister and formed with the approval of the National Assembly. The
 Constitution provides for 5-year terms of office for the President and National As-
 sembly Deputies, all elected by universal suffrage, and 6-year terms for Senators,
 who are chosen by local councils. International monitors observed the last several
 rounds of legislative elections and found them to be free and fair.
 The President sought to create a representative government by appointing mem-
 bers of each geographical region to the Cabinet.
 There are no legal restrictions on representation by women or minority popu-
 lations. However, women are underrepresented in government and politics. Women
 hold 4 of the 185 seats in the Senate and the National Assembly. Women occupy
 3 of the 39 cabinet posts. Indigenous Pygmies are excluded from the political process
 (see Section 5).
 
 
 64
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operated with minimal government restric-
 tion, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government
 officials were generally cooperative and responsive to their views, although prison
 visits by NGO s were sometimes restricted (see Section 1.c.). There were no visits
 by international human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically forbids such discrimination, but it persists in fact,
 particularly against women and Pygmies.
 Women.-Domestic violence, including rape and beatings, is widespread but rarely
 reported. The problem is handled within the extended family and only in the most
 extreme instances is the matter brought to the police. Spousal abuse resulted in the
 death of eight women, according to a leading women's rights group. All of these
 cases are under judicial investigation.
 There are no specific provisions under the law for spousal battery. Crises centers
 and hot lines are nonexistent. The problem of violence against women is largely ig-
 nored by the general population and the media.
 The Constitution provides for the equality of all citizens, specifically prohibits dis-
 crimination based on sex, and specifically endorses the right of women to earn equal
 pay for equal work. In practice, however, women in the formal sector are underrep-
 resented and encounter discriminatory promotion patterns. Most women work in the
 informal sector and thus have little or no access to credit. Women in rural areas
 are especially disadvantaged in terms of education and wage employment and are
 confined largely to family farm work, petty commerce, and childrearing responsibil-
 ities.
 Marriage and family laws overtly discriminate against women. For example, adul-
 tery is illegal for women but no' for men. Polygyny is legal; polyandry is not. While
 the Legal Code provides that 30 percent of an inheritance goes to the wife, in prac-
 tice the wife generally loses all rights to the property. The "symbolic" nature of the
 brideprice set in the Family Code is often not respected, and men are forced to pay
 excessive amounts to the woman's family. As a result, the right to divorce is cir-
 cumscribed for some women because they lack the financial means to reimburse the
 brideprice to the husband and his family. This problem is more prevalent in rural
 areas than in urban centers.
 There are approximately 10 nongovernmental organizations that work on women's
 issues. Their effectiveness varies widely, however, and none is physically situated
 in rural areas. The Government's Ministry for the Integration of Women into Devel-
 opment is actively working with a number of nongovernmental organizations to edu-
 cate women regarding their. rights and to reform certain legal codes.
 Children.-The Constitution states that the Government must protect children in
 accordance with international conventions. Child labor is illegal, and education is
 mandatory until age 16. In practice, limited state resources prevent public action
 toward achievement of these objectives, particularly in rural areas.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides for "specific measures of pro-
 tection in relation to their needs." In practice this means very little as the ministry
 charged with the welfare of the disabled has severe financial constraints. There is
 no overt discrimination against the disabled in employment and education. The Gov-
 ernment has not implemented laws mandating access for people with disabilities.
 Indigenous People.-The Constitution provides the same rights for Pygmies, an
 ethnic minority numbering in the tens of thousands, and living primarily in the
 northern forest regions, as it does for other citizens. In practice-in a society where
 Bantu Congolese predominate in every respect-Pygmies do not enjoy equal treat-
 ment. Pygmies are severely marginalized in the areas of employment, health, and
 education. They are often considered social inferiors, have no political voice, and are
 completely outside the political process. Many have never heard of the concept of
 voting and have no ability to influence government decisions affecting their inter-
 ests.
 Many Pygmies have a Bantu patron to whom they are obligated for perpetuity.
 Pygmies are inherited by their patron's eldest son upon his death. This arrangement
 has its roots in the ancestral tradition of pygmy slaver. In the informal sector,
 pygmy workers are generally underpaid for their labor relative to others, with com-
 pensation often being made in kind rather than wages, and they must gain permis-
 sion from "their Bantu" before they can contract out their labor. Most Pygmies in
 the formal sector work for logging companies, and there are unconfirmed reports
 
 
 that Pygmies do not receive equal pay for equal work and are underrepresented in
 skilled labor and management positions.
 There are credible reports that unless accompanied by a non-Pygmy, Pygmies are
 routinely denied medical treatment in the formal health sector; they are most often
 sirmply ignored or are asked to present documents that most Pygmies lack, such as
 national identification cards or national health cards. Credible sources also allege
 that Bantus are given first priority in national vaccination programs and that Pyg-
 mies are not vaccinated if there are not enough vaccination materials. In September
 a measles outbreak in Mbanza took the lives of 125 Pygmy children and 20 Bantu
 children, these figures are cited by one Western expert as proof that vaccination pro-
 grams have historically prioritized Bantus over Pygmies. Investigation efforts by
 health officials reportedly focused exclusively on Bantu children.
 Pygmy children who attend school are not always accorded equal treatment by
 their teachers and other educational authorities. Pygmy children are also routinely
 taunted by Bantu children, resulting in a difficult learning environment.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Both the Constitution and the Labor Code affirm the
 iht to associate freely and allow no restriction on the formation of trade unions.
 ost workers in the formal (wage) sector are union members, and unions have
 made efforts to organize informal sectors such as agriculture and retail. The Con-
 stitution prohibits members of the security forces from forming unions or striking.
 There are six independent trade union organizations recognized by the State al-
 though not all are active.
 Unions are free to strike but must file a letter of intent with the Ministry of Labor
 beforehand, thereby starting a process of arbitration. In theory, a strike may not
 take place until a process of nonbinding arbitration under the auspices of a regional
 labor inspector from the Labor Ministry has begun. The letter of intent must include
 the strike date, at which time the strike may legally begin even if arbitration is not
 complete. Employers have the right to fire workers if they give no advance notice
 of a strike.
 In January negotiations broke down between the Government and the unions in
 four state-owned companies scheduled for privatization, and a strike was called. The
 Government ruled the strike to be illegal because the 3-day advance notice require-
 ment was not observed. Workers not associated with the trade unions were re-
 quested to report to work. Armed members of the security forces reportedly went
 to the homes of known technicians (retired employees, etc.) and "encouraged" them
 to come to the assistance of the public service. The Government arrested four of the
 principal trade unionists and dismissed all workers who went on strike. Before
 oing to trial, the four arrestees were beaten by security forces. Despite weak evi-
 ence, the four were convicted for "impeaching the freedom to work" and sentenced
 to 4 months in prison and fined. An international labor organization intervened on
 their behalf, raised bail money, and financed legal counsel. In March the four were
 granted a presidential pardon. The 120 dismissed striking workers were reinstated.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international trade unions, and they maintain co-
 operative accords with other African, European, and American trade union organiza-
 tions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code allows for
 collective bargaining and this provision is freely practiced. The Government sets in-
 dustry-specific minimum wage scales, but unions are usually able to negotiate much
 higher wages for their members. Employers are prohibited from discriminating
 against employees who exercise their constitutional right to join a union. There were
 no reported firmngs for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition on Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor. There was, however, one instance when technicians were "encour-
 aged" to come to the assistance of the public service (see Section 6.a.). There were
 also allegations that Pygmies experienced exploitation (see Section 5).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chidren.-The Constitution prohibits chil-
 dren under the age of 16 from working. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for en-
 forcing child labor laws but concentrates its efforts only on the formal wage sector.
 Young children continued to work in the informal sector in cities, without govern-
 ment intervention.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government raised the minimum wage to
 $80 (CFAF 40,000) per month effective in March. This wage was not sufficient to
 provide a decent living for a worker and family. High urban prices and dependent
 extended families still obliged many workers to seek opportunities beyond their
 main employment or to practice subsistence agriculture.
 
 
 The Constitution provides for reasonable pay, paid holidays, periodic paid vaca-
 tion, and legal limits on allowable hours of work. The Labor Code stipulates that
 overtime must be paid for all work in excess of 40 hours per week and that regular
 days of leisure must be granted by employers. Although health and safety regula-
 tions require twice yearly visits by enforcement officers from the Ministry of Labor,
 in practice such inspections occur on a much less regular basis. There is no specific
 regulation granting workers the right to remove themselves from hazardous situa-
 tions without jeopardy to continued employment, but unions are generally vigilant
 in calling attention to such situations.
