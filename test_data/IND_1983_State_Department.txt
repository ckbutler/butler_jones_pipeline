 INDIA
 India follows a multi-party democratic system based on the
 British parliamentary model, with an independent judiciary and
 a free press. Free elections are held regularly and through
 constitutional processes. The last general election was in
 1980; the next will be no later than January 1985. The
 Constitution of India guarantees basic human rights and
 proscribes discrimination based on religion, caste, sex, or
 place of birth.
 The principles of protection of basic human rights are well
 established in India and are protected by a democratic
 political system which has remained stable and effective
 despite the 19-month emergency period in 1975-77 which severely
 tried the system. Human rights concerns have been expressed
 about abuses by police and in relation to centuries-old
 patterns of social discrimination which the Government has not
 been able to eliminate. The Government's record in support of
 human rights has generally been good, and the independent
 judiciary and a free press are important elements in
 continuation of this record. At the same time, social tensions
 and the pressure of a population growth rate which constrains
 economic growth also continue and could affect both political
 stability and human rights.
 The Congress (I) Party headed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
 controls both houses of parliament and the legislatures of 16
 of the 22 states. The remaining six states are controlled by a
 number of other parties. The central Government is currently
 exercising direct control under a constitutional procedure
 known as "President's Rule" in Punjab State, following the
 suspension of the elected Government in October 1983 in
 response to escalating violence there.
 India's economy can be best characterized as mixed, with banks,
 air and rail transport, public utilities, and much of the heavy
 industry in government hands. The entire agricultural sector,
 the manufacture of consumer goods, and the supply of services
 are all privately held. In the last two years there has been
 some relaxation of government regulation of private business.
 A large and diverse country, India's population is over 730
 million and grows at about 15 million a year. It is a secular
 state. Although the vast majority of the people (83 percent)
 are Hindus, India has a large Muslim population (about 80
 million, or 11 percent of the total). There are also sizable
 populations of Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Buddhists, and
 Parsis. In addition, in some outlying regions there are
 locally important minorities or tribal groups, such as the
 Assamese and the Nagas.
 India faces a number of problems based on centuries-old
 patterns of social discrimination. Although untouchability is
 banned by the Constitution, the caste system plays an important
 role in Indian society.  Both national and state governments
 discourage social discrimination and provide programs designed
 to beriefit groups which have been historically among those
 socially disadvantaged. A national commission report now being
 studied recommends strengthening these programs. The
 Government's attention in 1983 to efforts to improve social
 conditions through special programs targeted at the
 disadvantaged has caused a backlash among members of some
 groups who believe they are suffering a disadvantage as a
 result of the programs, particularly in such government
 benefits-as admission to educational institutions.

 1243
 In 1983, human rights concerns centered on violence in Assam
 and Punjab, both torn by political dissension, and on police
 brutality and the rights of women. Widespread violence in
 Assam in early 1983 left at least 3,000 dead. In Punjab,
 violence, exacerbated by extremists, centers around the
 political demands of the Sikhs. During the last two years,
 more than 120 people have died as a result of clashes between
 police and demonstrators, attacks by members of one community
 or sect on members of another, or assassinations of officials.
 The Government of Punjab was dissolved and "President's Rule"
 declared in early October 1983. A high level of violence
 continues.
 Despite legal protections, reports indicate that police
 brutality is widespread. Staged deaths of already-dead
 criminals or political activists (in what are known as police
 .encounters") continue to be reported. Violence by police
 forces, particularly prevalent in northern India, probably
 stems from the initiative of local police officials, although
 the Indian press widely claims that state government officials
 encourage and condone it.
 "Bride burning" or "dowry deaths" (i.e., murders, usually by
 burning, of married women by their in-laws or husbands because
 their parents cannot provide adequate additional dowry demanded
 after marriage) have received much attention in 1983. Women's
 organizations and lawyers have called for legislation to
 protect women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life.
 The Government of India does not itself as a matter of policy
 engage in unlawful or arbitrary deprivation of life. However,
 there were many people killed in 1983 in violence which swept
 through two widely separated parts of India. There are also
 reports of killings by police.
 In Assam, the Government estimates that at least 3,000 people
 were killed in the worst violence surrounding an election in
 India since independence in 1947. It was triggered by a
 central Government decision, despite substantial opposition, to
 hold an election for the Assam state assembly, as required by
 the Indian Constitution. The opposition from the Assamese was
 based upon the presence on the voter rolls of large numbers of
 allegedly illegal immigrants from Bangladesh not entitled to
 vote. A spasm of violence swept through the mixed communities
 of the Brahmaputra Valley and into tribal communities which
 harbored grievances against Assamese and Bengali Hindus as well
 as against the largely Muslim and more recent migrants from
 Bangladesh. The worst reported violence took place in
 Februaryin the town of Nellie when indigenous tribespeople
 attacked and killed as many as 600 Muslim villagers. Police
 and security forces were not on the scene to control the
 killing. The state Government subsequently appointed a high
 level administrative inquiry committee to investigate the
 violence.
 
 
 1244
 Since February, Assam has returned to a semblance of normal
 life under the elected state Government. Over 300,000 persons
 who fled have returned to their villages and have been given
 materials by the Government to rebuild. The Government has
 announced but not yet implemented the establishment of
 tribunals to identify aliens who entered India after March
 1971, which the Government of India has determined will be the
 arrival cutoff date for persons to obtain voting rights in
 Assam. In order to stem the continuing migration, the
 Government of India has increased security posts along the
 Assam-Bangladesh border and has stated its intention to erect a
 barbed wire fence along its -entire length. The underlying
 causes of violence in Assam remain and incidents of terrorism
 continue despite security precautions.
 In the Indian State of Punjab, a party comprised of members of
 the Sikh religion is leading the agitation for increased
 political, economic, and religious autonomy. The Government
 has acceded to some demands (mainly religious) but has yet to
 act on others (primarily political) which relate to the status
 of the city of Chandigarh and allocation of river water flowing
 through Punjab as well as other issues. Violence exacerbated
 by extremists calling for secession has escalated steadily over
 the past year. The violence had originally been directed at
 government officials but has spread to include religious
 dissenters and Hindus. More than 135 people have been killed.
 "President's rule," a constitutionally approved procedure which
 has been used frequently in India for temporary crises since
 1947, was declared in Punjab on 7 October 1983 following an
 incident in which six Hindus were murdered, allegedly by Sikh
 gunmen. Military and civilian authorities in Punjab have been
 empowered to arrest without warrant and to shoot to kill, but
 despite these measures the level of violence has subsided only
 marginally and tensions remain high.
 Hindu-Muslim riots in the city of Hyderabad and other areas of
 the state of Andhra Pradesh in late 1983 resulted in 46 deaths,
 according to official figures. The violence appeared to be
 communal in nature with no political undertone. Other communal
 disturbances took place in Gujarat and in Uttar Pradesh.
 Police are widely believed occasionally to stage mock
 "encounters" with suspects (ostensibly resulting in the death
 of the suspects) to cover up the fact that the victims had
 previously died in police custody. Most reports of such
 encounters involve known or suspected criminals. Reports of
 the deaths of young Sikhs in such "encounters" in Punjab have
 led to press allegations that the police deliberately killed
 the victims while they were in custody and then staged the
 "encounters." Amnesty International in August 1983 issued a
 statement expressing concern at the failure of Indian
 authorities adequately to investigate allegations of killings
 of political activists in circumstances described as
 "encounters."
 b. Disappearance
 No instances have been reported of the abduction, secret
 arrest, clandestine detention, or disappearance of individuals
 at the hands of public authorities in India.
 
 
 1245
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment.
 Torture is prohibited by law. Under well-established and
 respected procedures, confessions, to be valid, must be made in
 the presence of a magistrate. Indian case law extending over
 many decades excludes from admission in court any confessions
 or information extracted through use of force or torture.and
 demonstrates that recourse to torture in India for any purpose
 is contrary to law and practice. Cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment is also proscribed by law. The
 Government of India does not condone or encourage torture or
 cruel treatment.
 Press reports have asserted, however, that torture by the
 police does occur. Newspapers in 1983 reported police
 brutality against prisoners and suspects in a number of Indian
 states. There is no doubt that some police brutality is
 practiced in India, and conditions vary widely from state to
 state and by locality. There is no evidence that state
 governments direct or condone such police violence.
 Prison conditions continue to be a matter of serious public
 concern in India. Facilities are very crowded and persons
 awaiting trial are often held for months or even years before
 being tried. Recent press reporting has highlighted the
 condition of young boys held in New Delhi's central prison.
 These reports claim that the boys are sexually abused by other
 older prisoners and are forced to perform degrading or
 difficult physical labor for the authorities as well as for
 other prisoners. Judicial inquiries are being conducted.
 India continues to classify prisoners according to a system set
 up during the colonial period. According to these
 classifications, different categories of prisoners enjoy
 different privileges. Foreign nationals and political
 prisoners are entitled to larger or less-crowded cells, better
 food and other amenities than ordinary prisoners, and some
 middle class prisoners are segregated from ordinary prisoners
 and also are given more privileges. This system enjoys wide
 support in India.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that a person in custody must be told
 of the grounds for arrest, must be given the right to be
 represented by counsel, and must be brought before a magistrate
 within 24 hours of arrest. At that appearance the accused must
 be either remanded for further investigation or released on
 bail. These provisions are generally respected in practice.
 The Constitution permits the enactment of preventive detention
 laws against threats to the public welfare and to safeguard the
 national security. Such laws must provide for limits on the
 length of detention (not to exceed 12 months) and review of
 such detention. Two such preventive detention laws are
 currently in force. One, rarely used, permits the arrest of
 suspected "economic offenders." The other, the National
 Security Act, authorizes the Government to detain individuals
 to prevent action "prejudicial to the defense or security of
 India or to the maintenance of public order or the availability
 of supplies and services essential to the community." The
 Government has published a list of 16 essential services, the
 disruption of which would invite.detention under the Act.
 Under the Act, during the year 1982, 2540 persons were arrested
 and detained, but 2176 were released in the same period.
 Figures for 1983 are not yet available.
 
 
 1246
 During September and October 1983, some politicians were being
 held under the Act. In Andhra Pradesh, four state assembly
 members were held following Hindu-Muslim rioting. In Punjab,
 two Sikh Akali Dal party leaders, as well as a newspaper
 editor, were held for their "inflammatory speeches and writing
 which tended to promote secession and hatred between
 communities." All three were transferred to jails in other
 states.
 Exile is not a legally sanctioned punishment in India; there is
 no evidence that any Indian citizen was exiled during 1983.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is no constitutional guarantee of public trial. The
 criminal procedure code provides for open trial, but also
 permits the judiciary to close the proceedings under some
 relatively narrow circumstances. For example, the Official
 Secrets Act permits closed proceedings on the plea that
 publication of any evidence or statements would be prejudicial
 to the safety of the state. The Act requires, however, that
 the passing of sentence take place in public.
 Despite the existence of these closing procedures, Indian legal
 procedures effectively assure fair trial. Defendants have the
 right to choose counsel, and effective appeal channels are
 available at each stage of the judicial process.
 The Indian bar is independent of government at all levels.
 Judges of the state high courts and the Supreme Court are
 selected by the Law Ministry of the central Government,
 following consultations with the Chief Justice of the Supreme
 Court. The central Government in 1983 reversed previous
 practice and began to appoint chief justices in states other
 than their states of residence. Some state high court justices
 believe that this new practice could be used to remove judges
 who have given verdicts unfavorable to the Government. Two
 persons so affected have resigned in 1983.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Indian law requires warrants for searches and seizures, but it
 also permits the police in the course of a criminal
 investigation to institute searches without warrant if
 otherwise there would be undue delay. In such cases, the
 officer must state in writing the grounds for making the search
 without a warrant and specify the object of the search. There
 is no indication that this provision has been abused in
 practice.
 The Indian authorities have invoked special powers during 1983
 in the "disturbed areas" of Assam and Punjab. Under the
 provisions of law governing disturbed areas, civilian
 authorities down to the rank of sub-inspector of police, and
 military authorities down to non-commissioned officer, are
 given exceptional authority including the right to search and
 arrest without warrant and to shoot to kill in some
 circumstances.
 Allegations about the tapping of telephones and interception of
 personal mail have been made in the press. Such surveillance
 is authorized by law "on the occurrence of any public emergency
 or in the interest of the public safety or tranquility." These
 terms are not specifically defined, and thus lend themselves to
 
 
 1247
 a broad interpretation. Beyond these areas, the Government
 does not arbitrarily interfere in the private lives of Indian
 citizens.
 Section 2   Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution of India guarantees freedom of speech, and by
 extension, of the press. However, material which is considered
 to incite religious or communal hatred is proscribed from
 print. Occasionally some publications (foreign as well as
 Indian) will have offending issues seized or banned. With the
 exception of maps of disputed borders, there is no
 prepublication censorship of domestic or foreign books or of
 artistic works.
 A film censorship board passes on all films before they are
 licensed for distribution. Material deemed overly violent or
 offensive to public morals or to religious and communal
 sentiment is frequently excised. Radio and television are
 government monopolies, and both are often accused by opposition
 politicians of favoring the ruling party. During a strike of
 some government employees in opposition-ruled Andhra Pradesh,
 the Chief Minister was prevented, allegedly on orders of
 All-India Radio headquarters, from addressing the state over
 the publicly-owned broadcast facilities.
 Opposition viewpoints are widely disseminated in print media,
 and many political parties control their own newspapers or
 journals. The press in general is lively and free, and there
 are no restrictions on it concerning criticism of the
 Government. Investigative reporting is a growing phenomenon,
 and sections of the press in 1983 have given major coverage to
 election fraud and to mistreatment of women and of prisoners.
 One state has repealed controversial legislation which the
 press contended would curb press freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 As a hallmark of India's independence struggle, the right of
 peaceful assembly and association is considered in India to be
 an extension of the right of freedom of speech. Groups and
 parties of all persuasions may assemble freely and no hindrance
 is imposed to the size of gatherings. For reasons of crowd
 control, however, advance notification to police and permits
 are required in some instances.
 Trade unions may organize, negotiate, and strike with freedom
 in India. Freedom to form associations and unions is
 guaranteed in the Constitution. There are some restrictions on
 strike activity in industries which the Government considers
 essential. The National Security Act can be invoked by the
 Government against strikes that "threaten the public order."
 Another act allows the Government to intervene to stop strikes
 and to mediate a solution to the dispute.
 There is heavy emphasis on political activity by unions
 representing the relatively small number of workers in the
 organizable modern sector of the economy. Although political
 parties exercise strong influence on their trade union wings,
 the unions are independent. Four-fifths of the labor force is
 in the rural sector, where unemployment and underemployment are
 endemic, and where organization into effective unions is
 difficult if not impossible. Special labor problems are
 
 
 1248
 created by large-scale underemployment and unemployment,
 particularly by large masses of rural workers occupied in
 casual labor, including those problems related to seasonal
 migration of agricultural and construction labor. The
 All-Indian Organization of Employers and the National Institute
 of Personnel Management, both management organizations, as well
 as unions and government mediators, play a prominent role in
 developing industrial relations norms in the private sector.
 These organizations, as well as unions, are protected by the
 constitutional and legal guarantees to free association.
 Unions and professional bodies are free to maintain contact
 with international bodies. The Indian National Trade Union
 Congress and the Hind Mazdoor Sabha are affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 India is a secular state, and all religious groups are allowed
 to worship freely. Communal tensions based on religious
 differences do occur frequently in India and sometimes lead to
 violence. Incidents of communal violence are more prevalent
 now than 10 to 15 years ago and appear to be increasing in
 number. Government policy favors no one religious community
 over any other. Although foreign Christian missions are
 generally not allowed to replace retiring foreign missionaries
 with other foreigners, there is no legal prohibition affecting
 proselytizing by Indian Christians.
 During the agitation in Punjab, the Akalis and some other Sikhs
 charged the central Government with anti-Sikh discrimination.
 Some Sikhs have sought asylum abroad claiming persecution
 because of their activities in support of Sikh separatism.
 Members of the Nirankaris (a religious group whose members come
 from both the Sikh and Hindu communities) have been killed
 because of their religion. Almost all Sikh leaders oppose the
 Nirankari faith, which they consider to be heretical. During
 the past three years, at least 27 Nirankaris have been murdered
 in Punjab and about 100 injured, by persons unknown. There is
 no evidence of government involvement.
 The Government seems to be vigorously investigating the
 Nirankari murder cases. The police arrested two suspects in
 December 1983, one of whom allegedly killed the leader of the
 Nirankaris in 1980. In addition, a Parliamentary committee has
 been assigned to work towards reconciliation between Sikhs and
 Nirankaris.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Millions of refugees have been admitted into India from
 neighboring countries since Indian independence in 1947. The
 vast majority of those who wanted to remain have been granted
 Indian citizenship and integrated into the society and economy;
 figures on their numbers are not available.
 In Assam, migration of Hindus and Muslims from what is now
 Bangladesh led to the violence of early 1983. As a result of
 the disturbances in Assam, a large number of Bengali-speaking
 people from Assam moved into West Bengal. West Bengal
 authorities report that over 23,000 are still in relief camps.
 
 
 1249
 Following ethnic disturbances in Sri Lanka in July, several
 thousand Tamils came from Sri Lanka to India, particularly to
 the state of Tamil Nadu. Several thousand Afghans have entered
 India since the Soviet invasion in 1979. Many have departed to
 other countries. Although India does not as a rule formally
 recognize Afghans as refugees, there is no evidence of forcible
 repatriation of those who are in India. The United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees operates an office in India.
 Except for requirements for permits to enter sensitive border
 areas, there is full freedom of movement within India for all
 citizens. Foreign travel and emigration are without political
 restrictions, and in the last six years the rules for obtaining
 a passport and necessary foreign exchange have been liberalized
 and simplified. More than three million Indian citizens now
 live abroad. There are no special restrictions of movement of
 any sort applied to women or to other groups.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change their Government
 India is a functioning multi-party democracy. The Constitution
 grants universal adult suffrage to all citizens over 21.
 Elections to bodies at every level are held regularly. The
 last general election was held in January 1980; by law the next
 must be held before the end of January 1985. State assembly
 elections were held in four states and in the Union Territory
 of Delhi in early 1983.
 Elections are administered by an Election Commissioner whose
 responsibilities are defined in the Constitution and who is
 responsible only to the President. While this arrangement
 ordinarily makes supervision of the electoral machinery
 impartial, Assamese opposition parties questioned the political
 motives of the Commissioner in that state's election. Contrary
 to rules of the Commission, but in line with the decision of
 the central Government to hold the elections, the Commissioner
 went forward with the state elections on the basis of rolls
 only slightly revised since the 1978-79 elections.
 The Constitution provides the basis for temporary, exceptional
 central Government powers. The President of India is empowered
 to declare a state of emergency or "President's Rule" on the
 advice of the Prime Minister in the event of: war, external
 aggression, or internal disruption; collapse of the
 constitutional machinery in any state; the financial breakdown
 of the federal or any state government.
 Throughout India a multitude of local, state, and national
 parties are in active opposition to the Congress (I) Party,
 which presently holds power at the national level and in
 sixteen of India's twenty-two states. The parties represent
 every shade of the ideological spectrum and freely contest
 elections at all levels. No group in India, whether social,
 religious, or linguistic, is denied political participation or
 suffrage.
 There are no barriers to women candidates, although their
 numbers have remained small since independence. The present
 Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, is a woman, and there are 29
 women in the lower House of parliament, and 25 in the upper
 House (of 530 and 240 members, respectively).
 
 
 1250
 Section 4   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international investigations of the human rights situation
 in India are known to have occurred since 1978. India is a
 member of U.N. bodies such as the Human Rights Commission.
 There are several independent Indian human rights
 organizations, including the People's Union for Civil Liberties
 and the People's Union of Democratic Rights, both based in
 Delhi with chapters in other cities. These organizations
 periodically send study teams to assess and report on specific
 situations. Several women's groups monitor the status of women
 and have been active in 1983 in agitating against "dowry
 deaths" and the exploitation of women in films.
 Parliament and the press continue to be the most significant
 channels for reporting human rights violations. In 1983 the
 press has focused public attention on the problem of violence
 against women, including "dowry deaths", rape and other
 physical violence; on conditions in jails; and on exploitation
 of low-caste, harijan (untouchable), or tribal people in rural
 areas.
 The 1983 Report of Amnesty International expressed its concern
 for the use of preventive detention to detain dissidents,
 reports of torture, police brutality, staged "encounters" by
 the police in which people are killed, and use of the death
 penalty. Freedom House expressed similar concerns, but rated
 India overall as "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Indian Constitution calls on the Government to endeavor to
 minimize inequalities in income and in status, facilities, and
 opportunities for all citizens. Among the rights of Indian
 citizens, the Constitution lists "the right to work, to
 education, to public assistance, to secure a living wage...and
 a decent standard of life." Indian development and general
 economic policies have been laid out in a series of five-year
 plans since 1950, which have sought to establish a framework
 for realization of these objecives. In India's mixed economy,
 eighty percent of the gross national product (GNP) is produced
 in the private sector and 93 percent of the employment is there.
 India's population in 1983 numbered 730,572,000 and is growing
 at a rate of 2.1 percent. That many basic human needs are
 still to be met is evident. However, in each of the
 statistical categories listed below there has been an
 improvement in recent years.
 In 1982 life expectancy at birth was 52.6 years. Infant
 mortality in 1983 is 117.7 per 1000. The GNP per capita in
 1980 (the latest figure available) was $260. Adult literacy is
 36 percent. Those with access to safe drinking water are only
 33 percent (in rural areas the figure is 20 percent). The
 ratio of calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirements is 89 percent.
 India's relatively poor growth performance has been a major
 contributor to the persistence of poverty. Between 1950-51 and
 1977-78, overall income growth averaged only about 3.6 percent
 per year, and per capita income grew by about 1.5 percent. The
 income of an estimated (1979) 50.7 percent of the rural
 
 
 1251
 population and 40.3 percent of the urban population is below
 the absolute poverty line. India's great physical, economic,
 and climatic diversity contribute to the wide variance of these
 figures from state to state.
 In both health services and education, there are great
 differences between rural and urban areas in all parts of the
 country. The rural crude death rate exceeds the urban rate by
 42 percent, and the rural infant mortality rate exceeds the
 urban by 43 percent. The difficulty in providing adequate
 health, nutritional, and family planning services in the
 countryside has been a serious constraint to reducing both
 mortality and fertility rates among the rural poor.
 There has continued to be a steady (but imperfectly understood)
 decline of the ratio of women to men over many decades, and the
 trend is likely to continue. Women die in larger numbers than
 men, and the female infant mortality rate is also higher. Both
 phenomena may reflect the greater economic value associated
 with males, especially in northern India, and consequent
 nutritional and health-care neglect of females in poorer homes.
 Although women are guaranteed equal rights and protection under
 the law in India, in practice, longstanding cultural biases
 regarding the role of women cause them to have fewer
 educational and career opportunities than men. In 1983, press,
 Parliament, and public attention have focused on "dowry
 deaths," the death under suspicious circumstances of women
 whose parents have been unable to pay supplementary dowry
 demanded by the husband's family after marriage. In New Delhi
 in the first six months of 1983, 23 cases of murder or culpable
 homicide, all presumed "dowry deaths," were registered. Most
 reported cases of "dowry deaths" have been in northern India,
 and most are in lower middle class urban families. There has
 been increasing agitation for legal protection, and the issue
 has been taken up, without resolution, in Parliament.
 Education and literacy have both expanded rapidly since
 independence. Primary school enrollments, which were 43
 percent in the 1950-51 school year, rose to 80 percent in
 1979-80. School and college enrollments are noticeably higher
 for males than for females, and are lower than the norm for
 children from disadvantaged groups such as scheduled castes and
 tribes. Certain castes and tribes are "scheduled" for the
 purpose of assigning benefits of governmental action to relieve
 disadvantages resulting from social factors.
 Scheduled castes (including the so-called untouchables or
 harijans) make up 15 percent of India's population. The tribal
 people (or scheduled tribes) are an estimated 7 percent. The
 Government has met with only modest success in its efforts to
 improve the positions of these groups and has unintentionally
 mobilized many in the upper castes against their programs to
 benefit the disadvantaged. These programs in India include a
 quota system in educational enrollments, preferences for
 housing and government jobs, and reserved seats in Parliament
 for members of the scheduled groups.
 The press has widely reported violence against scheduled castes
 or scheduled tribes in 1983, often instigated by members of
 other castes or groups who perceive that their access to
 government benefits and assets are threatened by demands of
 scheduled groups, such as for legal minimum wages or tenancy of
 land. The Government provides some legal and physical
 protection to the victimized groups, and in 1983 the judiciary
 
 
 1252
 toOk an increasingly hard line against perpetrators of mass
 killings of harijans by handing down death sentences.
 The report of the Backward Classes Commission instituted in
 1979 was released in mid-1982 and is now under consideration at
 both state and national levels. The report covers not only the
 scheduled castes and tribes, but a number of other communities
 considered "backward." A number of castes are trying to be
 included on the growing list of "backward" communities in hopes
 of obtaining special government compensation and consideration
 for jobs. The Commission's main recommendations involve more
 than doubling the number of reserved seats in education and
 government employment from the 22.5 percent provided under the
 constitution to 49.5 percent.
 There has been considerable concern in India over the
 persistence of bonded labor.   Although the practice is
 proscribed by law, in 1982 authorities in 11 states reported
 the existence of illegal contract labor schemes which exploited
 landless migrant laborers, and knowledgeable observers claim
 that bonded labor is widespread in every state of the Indian
 Union. In 1983, numerous cases of bonded labor continued to be
 reported. The central Government, state authorities, and the
 Supreme Court have all investigated the illegal practices, and
 programs have been instituted for the rehabilitation of bonded
 laborers. In Indian fiscal year 1981-82, the central
 Government spent the equivalent of approximately 2 million
 dollars on matching grants to state governments. Private human
 rights organizations and trade unions are also active in the
 field. However, the large surplus supply of labor makes the
 .system of bonded labor difficult for the Government to control.
