 ANDORRA
 The Principality of Andorra became a parliamentary democracy in 1993 when its
 Constitution was approved by popular referendum. Two Princes with joint authority
 representing secular and religious authorities have governed since 1278. Under the
 Constitution, the two Princes-the President of France and the Spanish Bishop of
 "Sue D'urgell"-serve equally as heads of state and are each represented in Andorra
 by a delegate. Elections were held in 1997 to choose members of the "Consell Gen-
 eral" (the Parliament), which selects the head of government. The judiciary func-
 tions independently.

 Andorra has no defense force and depends on neighboring Spain and France for
 external defense. The national police, under effective civilian control, have sole re-
 sponsibility for internal security.
 The market-based economy is dependent on those of its neighbors France and
 Spain. With the creation of the European Union internal market, Andorra lost its
 privileged duty-free status and is suffering an economic recession. Tourism is still
 an important source of income. Because of banking secrecy laws, the financial serv-
 ices sector is growing in importance.
 The Government respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and the
 judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of abuse.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials
 employed them.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 The highest judicial body is the five-member Superior Council of Justice. One
 member each is appointed by: The two Princes; the head of government; the Presi-
 dent of the Parliament; and, collectively, members of the lower courts. Members of
 the judiciary are appointed for 6-year terms.
 The judiciary provided citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides citizens with safeguards against arbitrary interference with
 their "privacy, honor, and reputation," and government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions. Private dwellings are considered inviolable. No searches of pri-
 vate premises may be conducted without a judicially issued warrant. The law also
 protects private communications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system
 combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peacefial Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice. Since adoption of the
 1993 Constitution, the Government has registered seven political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. The Constitution acknowledges a special
 relationship between the Roman Catholic Church and the state, "in accordance with
 Andorran tradition." The Catholic Church receives no subsidies from the Govern-
 ment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refu-
 gees. It is government policy not to expel persons having valid claims to refugee sta-
 tus, and there were no reports of such expulsions. The issue of first asylum did not
 arise during the year.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Progress has been made, but women continue to play a relatively minor role in
 politics. Despite the absence of formal barriers, few women have run for office. Only
 2 of 28 Members of Parliament are women, and only 2 women occupy cabinet level
 positions. Prior to the current administration, only two women held elective office.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government accepts international and nongovernmental investigations of al-
 legations of human rights abuses. During the year, the first two indigenous human
 rights groups were formed. One defends the rights of foreign residents; the other
 actively supports women's rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution declares that all persons are equal before the law and prohibits
 discrimination on grounds of birth, race, sex, origin, religion, opinions, or any other
 personal or social condition, although the law grants many rights and privileges ex-
 clusively to citizens. The Government effectively enforces these provisions.
 Women.-Little data exist regarding spousal abuse, although the police received
 five cases of physical or psychological abuse during the year. There is no legal dis-
 crimination against women, either privately or professionally. The recently estab-
 lished Association of Andorran Women actively promotes women's issues through in-
 formation exchanges and limited direct support to those in need.
 Children.-The Government's commitment to children's welfare is demonstrated
 by its systems of health care and education. Free public education begins at age 4
 and is compulsory until age 16. There is no societal pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. The law man-
 dates access to new buildings for people with disabilities, and the Government en-
 forces these provisions in practice.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Spanish nationals are the largest group of
 foreign residents, accounting for 47 percent of the population. Other sizable foreign
 groups are Portuguese, French, and British. A small number of North African and
 African immigrants work mostly in agriculture and construction.
 Although the Constitution states that foreign legal residents enjoy the same
 rights and freedoms as citizens, some immigrant workers do not believe that they
 have the same rights and security. Recent legislation has improved the quality of
 life for immigrant workers. Nevertheless, many immigrant workers hold only "tem-
 porary work authorizations." These permits are valid only as long as the job for
 which the permit was obtained exists. When job contracts expire, temporary workers
 must leave the country. The Government prohibits the issuance of work permits un-
 less the workers can demonstrate that they have a fixed address with minimally
 satisfactory living conditions.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution recognizes the right of all persons
 to form and maintain managerial, professional, and trade union associations with-
 out prejudice. In accordance with constitutional provisions, a registry of associations
 was established in 1996 and is being maintained. Strikes were illegal under the old
 system, and the new Constitution does not state explicitly that strikes are per-
 mitted.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution states that
 both "workers and employers have the right to defend their owrl economic and social
 interests." Parliament is charged with adopting legislation to regulate this right in
 order to guarantee the provision of essential services. Antiunion discrimination is
 not prohibited under the law. However, no trade unions have been formally estab-
 lished.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor, including that per-
 formed by children, is not specifically prohibited by law, but it has not occurred.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Children
 under the age of 18 are normally prohibited from working, although in exceptional
 circumstances children ages 16 and 17 may be allowed to work. The Labor Inspec-
 tion Office in the Ministry of Social Welfare, Public Health, and Labor enforces child
 labor regulations. Forced and bonded labor by children is not specifically prohibited,
 but there were no reports of its practice (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The workweek is limited to 40 hours, although
 longer hours may be required. The legal maximums for overtime hours are 66 hours
 per month and 426 hours per year. An official minimum wage is set by government
 regulations. Other, higher wages are established by contract. The minimum wage
 is approximately $4.50 (Ptas 600) per hour, and it is enforced by the Labor Inspec-
 tion Office. Workers can be dismissed with 15 days' to 6 months' notice depending
 
 
 1115
 
 on how long they have been working for the company. A minimal indemnification
 of 1 month's salary per year worked is paid if a worker is fired without justification.
 A dismissed worker receives unemployment and health benefits for only 25 days.
 A board composed of Andorran nationals, although they represent only a small por-
 tion of the work force, controls retirement benefits. The Labor Inspection Service
 hears labor complaints.
 The Labor Inspection Service sets occupational health and safety standards and
 takes the necessary steps to see that they are enforced. The law authorizes employ-
 ees to refuse certain tasks if their employers do not provide the customary level of
 protection.
