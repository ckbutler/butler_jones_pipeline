 SRi LANKA
 Sri Lanka is a longstanding democratic republic with an active multiparty system.
 Constitutional power is shared between the popularly elected President and the 225-
 member Parliament. President Chandrika Kumaratunga leads the governing Peo-
 ple's Alliance (PA), a coalition of parties. Both the Parliament and the President
 were elected in free and fair elections in 1994. The Government respects constitu-
 tional provisions for an independent judiciary.
 
 
 1 1964
 For the past 15 years the Government has fought the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
 Eelam (LTTE), an insurgent organization fighting for a separate state for the coun-
 try's Tamil minority. The conflict has claimed over 55,000 lives. In May 1997 the
 fighting intensified, with the Government launching a major offensive aimed at
 opening a land route to the Jaffna peninsula through LTTE-controlled territory in
 e north. The offensive, which concluded in December, has resulted in approxi-
 mately 5,000 combatants killed on both sides and has displaced tens of thousands
 of persons from their homes.
 The Government controls all security forces. The 50,000-member police force is re-
 sponsible for internal security in most areas of the country and also has been used
 in military operations against the LTTE. The 118,000-member army (which includes
 the Army Volunteer Force), the 15,000-member navy and 17,000-member air force
 bear principal responsibility for conducting operations against the LTTE insurgents.
 The Police Paramilitary Special Task Force (STF) also baffles the LTITE. The more
 than 15,000-member Home Guards, an armed force drawn from local communities
 and responsible to the police, provides security for Muslim and Sinhalese village
 communities in or near the war zone. The Government also arms and directs var-
 ious Tamil militias opposed to the LTTE, although at times these groups act inde-
 p endenly of government authority. During the year, some members of the security
 orces committed serious human rights abuses.
 Sri Lanka is a low-income country with a market economy that is based on the
 export of textiles, tea, rubber, coconuts, and gems and on earnings from tourism and
 repatriated earnings of citizens employed abroad. The gross domestic product per
 capita is approximately $850. The economy's growth rate was 6.8" percent in 1997
 and growth for 1998 was expected to be 5.0 percent due to continued strong garment
 and tea exports. In 1997 the Government made significant steps-toward economic
 reform and liberalization, including privatizing some government enterprises and
 promoting foreign investment and trade. These steps continued in 1998.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens in areas not
 affected by the insurgency; however, the ongoing war with the LITE continued to
 be accompanied by serious human rights a uses by the security forces. Security
 forces committed at least 33 extrajudicial killings, and apparently killed prisoners
 captured on the battlefield. In addition, up to 11 individuals disappeared from secu-
 rity force custody in Vavuniya and in the east. At least 25 other persons reportedly
 disappeared or were killed after last being seen near the army~s forward defense
 lines in the north, areas that civilians are ordered by the military to avoid. The cir-
 cumstances of such disappearances and killings were unclear. Torture remained a
 serious problem, and prison conditions remained poor. Arbitrary arrests-including
 short-term mass arrests and detentions-continued, often accompanied by failure of
 the security forces to comply with some of the protective provisions of the Emer-
 gency Regulations (ER). Impunity for those responsible for human rights abuses re-
 mained as a serious problem. No arrests were made in connection with the dis-
 appearance and presumed killing of at least 350 LTTE suspects in Jaffna in 1996
 and 1997. Progress was made in a few longstanding high profile cases of
 extrajudicial killing and disappearance. However, in most cases, no progress was
 made, or there was no investigation or prosecution at all, giving the appearance of
 impunity for those responsible for human rights violations. The Government in-
 fringed on citizens' privacy rights and at times restricted freedom of the press. The
 Government engaged in direct censorship of domestic newspaper reporting and for-
 eign television broadcasts on miltary and some security operations from June
 through the end of the year. On occasion security forces harassed journalists. There
 were some restrictions on freedom of movement. Discrimination and violence against
 women, child prostitution, and child labor continued to be problems.
 In positive developments, the Government took steps to control the abuses. The
 national Human Rights Commission (HRC) continued its operations at 10 offices
 around the nation; however, human rights observers believed that the HRC was not
 pursuing aggressively its mandate due to poor leadership. The Government also es-
 tablished a cabinet-level committee to inquire into undue arrest and harassment,
 initially known as the Anti-Harassment Committee, to investigate complaints and
 take remedial action as necessary to alleviate problems associated with alleged har-
 assment and   arrests and  other security force actions. In the Krishanthi
 Kumaraswamy murder and rape case, in which a young woman and three other in-
 dividuals were killed in September 1996 in Jaffna, the Government concluded an
 expedited trial for the eight persons accused, the ninth having died of natural
 causes. The trial, which began in September 1997, ended on July 3. Six of the ac-
 cused were found guilty andsentenced to death; the two other accused persons were
 acquitted. One of the soldiers convicted claimed to have knowledge of a mass grave
 at Chemmani in Jaaa where the bodies of up to 400 Tami     illed by security
 
 
 1965
 forces were buried. The Government has been slow to investigate this claim. There
 was no attempt, as in the past, to use the ER to cover up security force misdeeds.
 Through its rulings, the judiciary continued to exhibit its independence and uphold
 individual civil rights. Government security forces continued to take effective meas-
 ures to limit civilian casualties during military operations. The Government also
 continued to provide relief to those displaced by the conflict even though many were
 still in areas under LTTE control such as the Vanni area. However, government re-
 strictions on medical supplies and a significant reduction in food rations contributed
 to poor health conditions for civilians in the Vanni. Three regional commissions es-
 tablished to investigate disappearances over the period from 1988 to 1994 completed
 their investigations in 1997 and their reports finally were made public in February.
 The reports concluded that more than 16,000 persons had disappeared after having
 been forcibly removed by security forces (including paramilitary organizations) and
 antigovernment elements, primarily the leftist Janetha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).
 Following their publication, the Government began submitting cases of alleged
 human rights abuses to the Attorney General's office for review and possible pros-
 ecution of those involved. The Attorney General had referred over 100 indictments
 to the courts and action reportedy had been filed against 28 security force person-
 nel by year's end. A fourth commisin was established in May to investigate those
 cases of disappearance th  the first three commissions could not investigate before
 their mandates expired.
 There are several former Tamil insurgent organizations that now are aligned with
 the Government. These progoverninent Tamil militants sometimes committed
 extrajudicial killings and were responsible for disappearances, torture, detentions,
 extortion and forced conscription in Vavuniya and the east. The military wing of the
 People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) committed many such
 abuses. The Government took no clear action to stop such abuses.
 The LTTE attacked civilians during the course of the year. The LTTE regularly
 committed extrajudicial killings, including killing prisoners taken on the battle-
 fields, and also was responsible for disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrests, deten-
 tions, and extortion. The LTTE killed 13 worshipers, including several children, in
 a truck bombing of the "Temple of the Tooth" on January 25. The temple is the holi-
 est Buddhist shrine in the country. On March 5, a vehicle bomb in downtown
 Colombo killed 36 persons, including the LTTE suicide bomber. More than 250 per-
 sons were injured in the attack. The LTTE also killed the newly elected mayor of
 Jaffna on May 17 and killed a Tamil Member of Parliament, his 3-year-old son, and
 three others on July 15. On September 11, a powerful LTTE bomb in a municipal
 building in Jaffna killed 12 persons, including the succeeding mayor of Jaffra, 4
 other civilians, and 7 security force personnel. On December 29, the LTTE killed
 another senior Tamil politician in Jaffna. Several LTTE " lamp post" killings oc-
 curred in which those found guilty of offenses by the LTTE's self-described courts
 were executed and their bodies tied to lamp posts or otherwise left for public dis-
 play. Through a campaign of killing and intimidation, the LTTE undermined the
 work of local government bodies in Jafmia whose members had been elected in free
 and fair elections on January 29. LTTE attacks on international ssipping continued,
 with the LTTE hijacking an Omani-flagged cargo vessel on August 14.
 The LTTE continued to control large sections of the north and east of the country
 through authoritarian military rule. It denied the people under its authority the
 right to change their government, infringed on their privacy rights, routinely vio-
 lated their civil liberties, operated an unfair court system, restricted freedom of
 movement, and severely discriminated against ethnic and religious minorities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Polce, home guards, and army per-
 sonnel committed extrajudicia killings in the eastern province, and army personnel
 also were responsible for killing a number of persons in the Vavuniya area in Jaffna
 in the north. At least 33 such killings occurred, many of them associated with oper-
 ations against the LiTE insurgents or with the interrogation of suspected terrorists.
 In at least 18 other cases, persons were killed near the army's forward defense lines
 near Vavuniya, Mannar, and Kilnochchi where civilians are warned not to proceed.
 Security force bombs and artillery fire also killed civilians (see Section 1.g.). The
 exact number of extrajudicial killings was impossible to ascertain due to censorship
 of news relating to military or police operations, and to lack of regular access to the
 north and east where the war was being waged.
 In some cases these extrajudicial killings were reprisals against civilians for
 LTTE attacks in which members of the security forces or civilians were killed or
 
 
 1966
 injured. In most cases, the security forces claimed that the victims were members
 of the LTTE, but human rights monitors believe otherwise. In Thampalakamam in
 the Trincomalee district on February 1, police and home guards allegedly massacred
 eight Tamil civilians, including three children, possibly in reprisal for the LTTE
 bombing of the ' Temple of the Tooth" 1 week earlier. Some 31 police officers and
 10 home   ards were arrested in connection with the case. In September 21 of these
 individua' were charged, 4 with murder and 17 with unlawful assembly. The other
 20 were released after the Attorney General determined that there was insufficient
 evidence against them. The cases were scheduled to be heard in early 1999. The
 case was continuing at year's end. The perpetrators of most extrajudcial killings
 had not been arrested by year's end.
 Impunity remains a serious problem. Since April 1995 at least 740 persons have
 been killed extrajudicially by the security forces or have disappeared after being
 taken into security force custody and are presumed dead. With the exception of the
 six security force personnel convicted in the    1996 killing  of Krishanthi
 Kumaraswamy, no member of the security forces has been convicted for any of these
 cimes. In the vast majority of cases where militarypersonnel may have committed
 human rights violations, the Government has not identified those responsible and
 brought them to justice. The military leadership has failed also in this regard. Al-
 most all senior military officers now serving were midlevel officers during the
 Janetha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) uprising in 1988-91, when security forces were
 given great leeway in dealing with   threat to the nation's security. Attitudes
 and practices have been slow to change.
 On August 4, the Government reimposed a state of emergency nationwide. There
 was no evidence that the Government was using the Emergency Regulations, as in
 previous years, to conceal extrajudicial killings or disappearances. Nevertheless,
 crucial safeguards built into the ER and the legislation establishing the HRC often
 were ignored routinely by the security forces-especially those provisions requiring
 receipts to be issued for arrests and ordering the security forces to notify the HR
 of any arrest within 48 hours. Although security force personnel can be fined or
 jailed for failure to comply with the ER, none were known to have been punished
 during the year.
 Security force personnel probably were responsible for the 1997 death of Reverend
 Innasi Arulpalan, a priest from the Jaffna diocese of the Church of South India. Al-
 though the University Teachers for Human Rights-Jaflna (UTHR-J) reported that
 witnesses claimed to have seen Reverend Arulpalan and two other individuals being
 taken away by the army on August 25, 1997, subsequent investigations by reliable,
 indepenet sources failed to identify any witnesses that actually saw the three in
 army custody. Their mutilated bodies were found on September 9, 1997. Although
 initially the military formally denied responsibility for  e incident and placed the
 blame on the LTTE, senior military officials since have suggested that the Reverend
 may have been killed accidentally, since his death took place near the areys for-
 ward defense lines, an area where confrontations with the LTTE were common. Al-
 though it promised a further investigation into the matter, by year's end the Gov-
 ernment had not produced additional information regarding the case and no frther
 inquiries into the Reverend's death were continuing.
 In November 1996, 16 police and army personnel were arrested for the rape and
 murder of Krishanthi Kumaraswamy, the murder of two of her family members, and
 the rae and murder of another individual. Nine of these security force members
 subsequently were charged in the case. The Government in February 1997 ordered
 a trial at bar against the accused in an effort to expedit e case. (A trial at bar
 means that the case is heard by a panel of judges, dispensing with a lengthier trial
 by jury.) This was only the fourth time since independence that the Government
 had taken the step of ordering a trial at bar. The case came to trial in September
 1997 and, on July 3, six of the accused were found guilty and sentenced to death.
 Two other persons accused were acquitted. One died in custody of natural causes
 in February. On March 18, two detainees in the case escaped from custody during
 the trial; but both were recaptured by year's end.
 On December 12, 1997, three Tamil prisoners were hacked to death in prison by
 Sinhaese prisoners at Kalutara prison. Prison staff and army personnel at the pris-
 on allegedly failed to take measures to protect the detainees even as the attack oc-
 curred.
 At his sentencing in the Kumaraswamy case, one of those convicted claimed that
 he had knowledge of a mass grave at Chemmani in Jaffna where the bodies of up
 to 400 persons killed by security forces in 1996 had been buried. On July 22, the
 Ministry of Defense (MOD) issued a statement indicating that the police criminal
 investigation department had been directed to investigate the allegation. In August
 the Ministry of Defense (MOD) stated that a forensic expert, a government analyst,
 
 
 1967
 and police detectives would visit the site. The Human Rights Commission also was
 involved in investigating the claim and asked for United Nations' forensic assist-
 ance. Although by year's end it was apparent that the Government was not pursu-
 ing the investigation vigorously, it was also evident that the security threat in
 Jaffna and the LTTE's efforts to disrupt civilian administration there were impeding
 progress into the investigation.
 The case against the eight soldiers and one reserve police constable arrested in
 February 1996 in the Kumarapuram massacre of 24 Tamil villagers came to trial
 in September 1997. In November six of the soldiers were indicted for murder and
 the case was scheduled for trial in 1999. The other accused security force personnel
 were released due to lack of evidence.
 In July 1996, the charred body of a Tamil textile merchant who had been detained
 under the ER was found at Giribawa in the North Central province. Six police offi-
 cers, including the officer in charge of the police countersubversive unit in
 Vavuniya, were arrested and detained under the ER. The officer in charge was re-
 leased on bail at the end of December 1996; the other officers were released in Janu-
 ary 1997. The Attorney General had not made a recommendation to the High Court
 atyear's end.
 in October 1995, 22 members of the STF were arrested and detained under the
 ER on suspicion of murdering 23 Tamil youths whose bodies were found floating in
 Bolgoda Lake and other waterways near Colombo earlier that year. The suspects
 were released on bail and resumed their police functions in February 1996. In No-
 vember 1997, three of the STF members were indicted on charges of abduction and
 illegal detention. The case is to be heard in March 1999.
 In 1996 a presidential commission was established to investigate alleged torture
 and murder during the 1980's JVP uprising at a government-run detention center
 at Batalanda housing estate near Colombo. In August, five senior police officials
 were placed on compulsory leave for their involvement in the case, but they report-
 edly had been returned to duty by December. The investigation was continuing at
 year's end.
 The People's Alliance (PA) Government came to power in 1994 and promised to
 bring to justice the perpetrators of extrajudicial killings from previous years. In
 1994 it began prosecutions of suspects in several extrajudicial murders allegedly
 perpetrated by members of the security forces. The trial of 21 soldiers accused of
 massacring 35 Tamil civilians in 1992 in the village of Mailanthani in Batticaloa
 district was transferred to the Colombo High Court in 1996. The trial was continu-
 ing at year's end.
 There were no developments in the government investigations into the mass
 graves at Sooriyakanda, which contain an estimated 300 bodies, or the grave at
 Ankumbura, which is thought to contain the bodies of 36 people killed by the police
 in 1989. There were also no developments in the Nikaweratiya army camp incident
 in which soldiers allegedly killed 20 youths in 1989 during the period of the JVP
 uprising.
 Former insurgent Tamil militant groups now aligned with the Government com-
 mitted extrajudicial killings in the eastern province and in th       e
 north. The military wing of PLOTE and the Raseek Group were responsible for kill-
 ing a number of persons. The security forces arm and use these militias and a num-
 ber of other Tamil militant organizations to provide information, help identify LTTE
 insurgents, and, in some cases, to fight in military operations agalst the insur-
 gents. The exact size of these militias is impossible to ascertain but they probably
 total less than 2,000 persons. Although the army in some instances took steps to
 convert Tamil militia groups into regular army units, military oversight of these
 groups is generally inadequate. These groups frequentiy op   beond govern-
 ment control. Complaints about their activities continued, especily in transit
 camps for internally displaced persons (IDP's) in Vavuniya. The militias gain access
 to these camps through a variety of means, including bribery and threats. It was
 impossible to determine the number of victims because of the secrecy with which
 these groups operated. Those killed by these militants probably included both LTTE
 operatives and civilians who failed to comply with extortion demands. The Govern-
 ment took no clear steps to prevent human rights abuses committed by these Tamil
 militant organizations.
 The LTTE continued to commit extrajudicial killings, including both targeted at-
 tacks and bombings. For example, on January 25, LTTE suicide bombers attacked
 the Buddhist "Temple of the Tooth" in Kandy, killing 13 worshipers including sev-
 eral children (see Section 1.g.). On May 17, the LTTE killed the newly elected mayor
 of Jafna, and on July 15 killed a Member of Parliament (M.P.) and his 5-year-old
 son in Vavuniya. On June 30, suspected LTiE members attempted to kill a Tamil
 Member of Parliament when he was visiting the prison in which they were incarcer-
 
 
 1968
 ated; the M.P. was injured seriously. On September 11, an LTTE bomb placed in
 a municipal building in Jaffna killed 12 persons, including the succeeding mayor of
 Jaffna (see also Section 1.g.). Killings of political opponents in the east continued,
 some perpetrated by "pistol gangs", which successfully carried out their attacks
 using motorcycles and revolvers. The LTTE continued to execute suspected govern-
 ment informants and conducted several "lamp post" killings in which the bodies of
 those executed were tied to lamp posts or otherwise left for public display. In the
 past, the LTTE has killed university professors, members of nonviolent Tamil oppo-
 sition parties, and human rights monitors.
 The LTTE also attacked government installations. Attacks on police stations and
 military bases in the north and east killed or wounded more than a hundred civil-
 ians. The LTTE also sometimes kills its own injured troops to avoid their capture.
 In July 1997, the Attorney'General determined that there was insufficient evi-
 dence to charge anyone in the October 1994 suicide bombing that killed the United
 National Party's presidential candidate, Gamini Dissanayake, and 58 other persons,
 although the LTTE generally is believed to be responsible. No further investigations
 were continuing.
 b. Disappearance.-Disappearances at the hands of the security forces continued
 in the north and east. During the year, there were no reports of disappearances in
 Colombo, Trincomalee or Jaffna. At least 11 disappearances involved cases where
 individuals were last known to be in security force custody in Vavuniya and the
 east. In at least seven cases, individuals disappeared after last being seen near the
 army's forward defense lines in the north. As with extrajudicial killings, the exact
 number of disappearances was impossible to ascertain due to censorship of news
 about security force operations and infrequent access to the north and east.
 There were approximately 125 confirmed cases of disappearance in 1997, 350 in
 1996, 34 in 1995, and 10 in 1994. The large number of disappearances in 1996 cor-
 responded to an intensification of the conflict with the LTTE, including the Govern-
 ment's capture of the Jaffna peninsula and several acts of terror by the LTTE, in-
 cluding a suicide bombing in Jaffna in July 1996. Those who disappeared in 1998
 and in previous years are presumed dead. The commander of the army and the in-
 spector general of police have both condemned disappearances and stated that per-
 petrators would be called to account. However, no security force personnel have
 been prosecuted to date.
 In November 1996, the Ministry of Defense established a board of investigation
 to look into disappearances in the north and east and review security force proce-
 dures. According to press reports, the board received more than 2,500 complaints
 of disappearances. After eliminating duplicate names, the board found that 730 per-
 sons were alleged to have disappeared. It was able to trace 182, who were located
 at home or in custody. The balance of 548 cases was unresolved. The board com-
 gleted its activities and disbanded at the end of 1997. By year's end, its findings
 ad not been made public, nor had the Government publicly identified or charged
 those responsible for disappearances, although government officials have indicated
 that those responsible would be held accountable. The Jaffna office of the HRC also
 conducted inquiries into hundreds of those cases.
 Three regional commissions set up in November 1994 to inquire into disappear-
 ances occurring after January 1, 1988, submitted their final reports to President
 Kumaratunga in September 1997. The reports were made public in February and
 made available to the United Nations Working Group on Disappearances. The com-
 missions investigated 19,079 cases of disappearance, most of which occurred during
 the 1988-89 period of the JVP uprising. The commissions found evidence that
 16,742 persons disappeared after having been removed involuntarily from their
 homes, in most cases by the security forces. In other cases, antigovernment ele-
 ments-in particular the leftist JVP-were determined to be responsible for the dis-
 appearances. Based on information contained in the reports, the Government began
 submitting cases of alleged human rights abuses to the Attorney General's office for
 review and possible prosecution of those involved. By year's end, the Attorney Gen-
 eral's office had opened over 400 files and had referred over 100 indictments on ab-
 duction and murder charges to the appropriate courts. The courts had initiated pro-
 ceedings in at least 28 of those cases by year's end.
 In May a fourth commission was established to look into those cases of disappear-
 ance that the initial three commissions had been unable to investigate before their
 mandates expired. The commission began operating on July 10. The commission is
 not to investigate new cases of disappearance, but is to focus on approximately
 13,000 cases that were not completed by the first three commissions. Human rights
 observers have criticized the Government for not extending the mandate of this com-
 mission to include cases of disappearance that have occurred since the Government
 
 
 1969
 took office in 1994. The commission submitted an interim report to President
 Kumaratunga on December 31 and is scheduled to complete its work in April 1999.
 The trial of 9 suspects, including an army brigadier general, in the disappearance
 of 32 youths from the southern town of Embilipitiya in 1989 and 1990 concluded,
 but the court had not delivered a verdict by yeais end. Charges against two persons
 formerly charged in the case were dropped for insufficient evidence. There were no
 developments in the Vantharamulle case, in which army troops allegedly abducted
 158 Tanils from a refugee camp in the Batticaloa district in 1990. Observers main-
 tain there is credible evidence identifying the alleged perpetrators. There was also
 no progress in the case of 31 youths that allegedly disappeared following their ar-
 rests in Divulapitiya in 1989.
 The Government continued to give the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRO) unhindered access to approximately 250 detention centers, police stations,
 and army camps throughout the country that are recognized officially as places of
 detention. This played an important role in enabling the ICRC to monitor the
 human rights practices of the security forces. The HRC through its 10 regional of-
 fices also visited places of detention, though human rights observers believed that
 due to inadequate leadership and a failure of the HRC to give long term contracts
 to many of its workers, the organization was not pursuing its mandate aggressively.
 Progovernment Tamil militias also were responsible for disappearances. These mi-
 litias detain persons at various locations that serve, in effect, as undeclared deten-
 tion centers. Hman rights observers believe that the PLOTE was a major offender
 in the case of disappearances. The HRC has no mandate or authority to enforce re-
 sp ect for human rights among these militia groups. It was impossible to determine
 the exact number of victims because of the secrecy with which these groups oper-
 ated. The Government has taken no clear steps to stop these militants' actions.
 Progovernment Tamil militants in the east and north, acting independently of
 government authority, were responsible for disappearances. As in the case of
 extrajudicial killings, it was impossible to determine the exact number of victims be-
 cause of the secrecy with which these groups operated. The Government has taken
 no clear public steps to stop the militants' actions.
 The LTTE was responsible for an undetermined number of civilian disappear-
 ances in the north and east of the island during the year. Most of the 400 to 600
 police officers captured by the LTTE in 1990 are believed to be dead, as well as over
 200 security force personnel captured at a battle in Pooneryn in 1993. Although the
 LTTE denies taking any prisoners following major battles such as Mullaittivu in
 1996 and at Kilinochchi in September, it is suspected of holding some. The LTTE
 has not notified the ICRC of any new security forces prisoners since 1994.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Despite legal prohibitions, the security forces continue to torture and to mistreat
 persons. In 1994 the Government acceded to the Convention Against Torture and
 Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and Parliament
 subsequently enacted legislation to implement the Convention Against Torture
 (CAT) by making torture a punishable offense. The Convention Against Torture Act
 of November 25, 1994 strengthened the legal mandate of prosecuting authorities to
 investigate and prosecute cases of torture. Torture is defined as a specific crime, and
 the High Court has jurisdiction over violations of the act. The Government, how-
 ever, has not yet developed effective regulations under the new legislation to pros-
 ecute and to punish military and police personnel responsible for torture, though it
 has ceased paying fines incurred by security force personnel guilty of the offense.
 Security forces personnel have been fined under civil law for engaging in torture,
 but have not been prosecuted under criminal law. Members of the security forces
 continued to torture and mistreat detainees and other prisoners, both male and fe-
 male, particularly during interrogation. Most torture victims were Tamils suspected
 of being LTTE insurgents or collaborators. Humanitarian organizations reported
 that while torture and abuse by the security forces remained widespread, its use
 had diminished, especially on the Jaffna peninsula.
 Methods of torture included electric shock, beatings (especially on the soles of the
 feet), suspension by the wrists or feet in contorted positions, burnings, and near
 drownings. In other cases, victims are forced to remain in unnatural positions for
 extended periods, or have bags laced with insecticide, chili powder, or gasoline
 placed over their heads. Detainees have reported broken bones and other serious in-
 juries as a result of their mistreatment. There were no reports of rape in detention.
 Under fundamental rights provisions in the Constitution, torture victims may file
 civil suit for compensation in the Supreme Court. The Court has granted awards
 ranging from $200 to $2,500. Most cases, however, take 2 years or more to move
 through the courts. Moreover, because the 1994 Anti-Torture Law imposes a heavy
 minimum punishment of 7 years' imprisonment, the Court is scrutinizing fun-
 
 
 1970
 damental rights cases more carefully than in the past, since findings would weigh
 heavily in criminal prosecutions of torturers. During the year, there were no cases
 brought before the courts under the Anti-Torture Law.
 Progovernment Tamil militants in the east and north, directly responsible to the
 security forces, also engaged in torture.
 The LTTE reportedly used torture on a routine basis. Security force prisoners re-
 leased by the LTTE said that they occasionally had been beaten during their cap-
 tivity. LTTE ship hijackings continued, with the LTTE hijacking an Omani-flagged
 vessel in August.
 Prison conditions are generally poor and do not meet minimum international
 standards because of overcrowding and lack of sanitary facilities. An increase in de-
 tentions associated with the war with LTTE caused a significant deterioration in al-
 ready poor standards in short-term detention centers.
 The Government permitted representatives from the ICRC to visit approximately
 250 places of detention. The HRC also visited prisons on an ad hoc basis and other
 places of detention more regularly. The HRC made over 1,000 visits to such deten-
 tion facilities during the course of the year.
 Conditions also are poor in detention facilities operated by the LTTE. Some
 former prisoners reported being handcuffed and shackled during much of their cap-
 tivity.
 The LTTE permitted the ICRC to visit only a few detainees (see Section 1.d.).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention are prob-
 lems. Under ordinary law, authorities must inform an arrested person of the reason
 for arrest and bring that person before a magistrate within 24 hours. In practice,
 persons detained under ordinary law generally appear before a magistrate within
 a few days of arrest. The magistrate may authorize bail or order continued pretrial
 detention for up to 3 months or longer. Under the ER and the Prevention of Terror-
 ism Act (PTA), security forces may detain suspects for extended periods of time
 without court approval. The ER, in force nationwide as of August 4, allows pretrial
 detention for a maximum of four consecutive 3-month periods. A magistrate must
 order further detention. Detainees may challenge their detention and sue the Gov-
 ernment for violating their civil rights in the Supreme Court.
 In spite of the Government's announcements that it would close all secret deten-
 tion centers, there were continued reports that the security forces held persons in
 such a manner on the Jaffna peninsula and in the east.
 On August 31, Pararajassan Kugathasan escaped from a secret detention center
 in Rambaikulam, Vavumya, run by the PLOTE. He showed signs of torture all over
 his body when he reached a nearby church. Timely intervention by police kept him
 from being returned to the detention center by PLOTE members. Detention of
 Tamils continued as a result of the continuing hostilities with the LTTE. The Gov-
 ernment continued to hold more than 1,500 detainees under the ER, the same ap-
 proximate number as in 1996 and 1997. Many of these detainees were arrested dur-
 ing operations against the LTTE. The Government continued to detain up to 300
 individuals under the PTA, which permits detention without charge for up to 18
 months. In some cases, Tamils have been detained without charge under the PTA
 for up to 4 years. According to the Attorney General, there were almost 1,000 cases
 under the PTA or ER before the high courts.
 Arrests and detentions by the police took place in violation of the legal safeguards
 built into the ER and other legislation, particularly regarding requirements that re-
 ceipts be issued and that the HRC be notified of any arrest within 48 hours. Those
 arrested by the army generally were turned over to the police within 24 hours as
 required under the ER. The HRC has a legal mandate to visit those arrested and
 police officials generally respected this mandate. Due to censorship and infrequent
 access to the area, it was unclear what was happening to detainees in the north
 and east. The ICRC visits declared detention centers, but there are undeclared de-
 tention centers in the north that are not visited on a regular basis. Instead,
 undeclared detention centers are visited as needed when information received indi-
 cates that persons are being held there. There  e  reportedly fewer than 100 indi-
 viduals being held in undeclared detention camps. In Jaffna, the vast majority of
 detainees are held in the main detention center, where conditions reportedly are
 quite good. On the other hand, conditions in the undeclared centers range from ade-
 qUate to extremely poor.
 ecurity forces continued to conduct mass detentions and arrests of young Tamils,
 both male and female. Major sweeps and arrests occurred in Colombo, the east, and
 on the Jaffna peninsula. Although exact numbers of arrests were impossible to de-
 termine, they reached into the thousands. Hundreds of Tamils  a time were picked
 up during police actions. Most were released after identity checks lasting several
 hours to several days. The Government justified the arrests on security grounds, but
 
 
 1971
 many Tamils claimed that the arrests were a form of harassment. In addition, those
 arrested, most of whom were innocent of any wrongdoing, were sometimes detained
 in prisons together with hardened criminals. Security force actions continued to re-
 sult in other problems for Tamils. For example, following an attack by an LTTE sui-
 cide bomber near the air force headquarters in Colombo in February, security forces
 closed three rooming hotels, leaving hundreds of Tamils temporarily without lodg-
 ing. In July the President appointed a cabinet-level Anti-Harassment Committee,
 which was renamed as the Committee to Inquire into Undue Arrest and Harass-
 ment in September.
 The Committee, which included senior opposition party and Tamil representa-
 tives, was tasked to look into complaints stemming from arrests and other security
 force actions and take remedial action as necessary. The Committee set up a tele-
 phone hot line and had received and investigated more than 100 complaints by
 year's end. Human rights observers generally believed that the work of the Commit-
 tee acted as a deterrent to random arrests and helped to alleviate some of the prob-
 lems encountered by detainees and their families.
 The HRC continued to investigate the legality of detention in cases referred to it
 by the Supreme Court and private citizens. Although the HRC legally is constituted
 to exercise oversight over arrests and detentions by the security forces and to under-
 take visits to prisons, members of the security forces sometimes breached the regu-
 lations and failed to cooperate with the HRC.
 Tamil militant groups, ostensibly under the direct control of the security forces,
 were known to be operating illegal-and unmonitored-detention centers in the east
 and in Vavuniya (see Section 1.b.).
 The LTTE continued to detain civilians, often holding them for ransom. For exam-
 Q , on July 26 the LTTE reportedly detained 25 Muslim fishermen in the
 ncomalee district, releasing them after 2 days once a ransom of $45 per person
 was paid by their families. There continued to be unconfirmed reports that the
 LTTE was holding in custody more than 2,000 civilians in the northern part of the
 island. Those held included 12 civilian crew members of three vessels hijacked by
 the LTTE since 1995. These included three crewmen from the vessel Irish Moana
 and five from the ferry Missen. The LTTE did not permit the ICRC or any other
 humanitarian organization to visit its detainees aside from these crew members and
 15 security force personnel. Four crewmen previously held were released during the
 course of the year, one in July and three in October. Six security force personnel
 also were released in October, while one died of natural causes during the year.
 The Government does not practice forced exile. There are no legal provisions al-
 lowing or prohibiting its use.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects these provisions in practice.
 The President appoints judges to the Supreme Court, the courts of appeal, and
 the high courts. A judicial service commission, composed of the Chief Justice and
 two Supreme Court judges appoints, transfers, and dismisses lower court judges.
 Judges serve until mandatory retirement age, which is 65 for the Supreme Court
 and 62 for judges on other courts. Judges can be removed for reasons of misbehavior
 or physical or mental incapacity, but only after a legal investigation followed by
 joint action of the President and the Parliament.
 In criminal cases, defendants are tried in public by juries. They are informed of
 the charges and evidence against them, may be represented by the counsel of their
 choice, and have the right to appeal. The Government provides counsel for indigent
 persons tried on criminal charges in the high courts and the courts of appeal but
 not in other cases. Private legal aid organizations assist some defendants. There are
 no jury trials in cases brought under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Confessions,
 which are inadmissible in criminal proceedings, are allowed in PTA cases. Most con-
 victions under the PTA rely heavily on them. Defendants bear the burden of proof
 to demonstrate that their confessions were obtained by coercion. Defendants in PTA
 cases have the right to appeal. Although over 1,000 cases under the PTA and the
 ER were before the courts, no cases came to trial during the year.
 Most court proceedings are conducted in English or Sinhala, which, due to a
 shortage of court-appointed interpreters, has restricted the ability of Tamil-speaking
 defendants to get a fair hearing. Few judges speak Tamil. There are also delays in
 publishing the Emergency Regulations in Tamil, and there are no law reports and
 few legal textbooks in Tamil.
 In Jaffna LTTE threats to court officials disrupted normal court operations. The
 courts were operating on oniy a limited basis by yearos end.
 The LTTE has its own self-described court system, composed of young judges with
 litle or no legal training. The courts operate without codified or defined legal au-
 thority and essentially operate as agents of the LTTE rather than as an independ-
 
 
 1972
 
 ent judiciary. The courts reportedly impose severe punishments, including execu-
 tion. During the course of the year the LTTE conducted several "lamp post" killings
 in which the bodies of those executed were left for public display (see Section l.a.).
 The Government claims that all persons held under the ER and the PTA are sus-
 pected members of the LTTE and, therefore, legitimate security threats. There is
 insufficient information to verify this claim and to determine whether these detain-
 ees or members of the now legal Sinhalese JVP, who were detained in similar fash-
 ion in past years, were political prisoners. Between 200 and 300 of those previously
 detained-mostly JVP members-have been convicted under criminal law and re-
 main incarcerated. In many cases, human rights monitors question the legitimacy
 of the criminal charges brought against these persons.
 The LTTE also holds a number of political prisoners. The number is impossible
 to determine because of the secretive nature of the organization. The LTTE refuses
 to allow the ICRC access to these prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government generally respects many of the Constitutional protections of individual
 privacy and the sanctity of the family and home; however, it infringed on these
 rights in some areas. The police obtain proper warrants for arrests and searches
 conducted under ordinary law. However, the security forces are not required to ob-
 tain warrants for searches conducted under either the ER or the PTA. The Secretary
 of Defense is responsible for providing oversight for such searches. There is no judi-
 cial review or other means of redress for alleged illegal searches under the ER.
 The Government is believed to monitor telephone conversations and correspond-
 ence on a selective basis. The security forces routinely open mail destined for the
 LTTE-controlled areas and seize contraband. The Government censors international
 television broadcasts received in the country (see Section 2.a.).
 In February security forces closed three rooming hotels and left hundreds of
 Tamils temporarily without lodging (see Section 1.d.).
 Progovernment Tamil militant groups, nominally operating under government
 control, use forced conscription. There are credible reports that Tamil youth in the
 east in particular have been forced to join these groups under threats to themselves
 and their families.
 The LTTE routinely invades the privacy of citizens. It maintains an effective net-
 work of informants. In 1990 the LTTE evicted thousands of Muslim residents from
 their homes in the north. These Muslims currently live in refugee camps. Although
 some Muslims returned to Jaffna in 1997, they did not remain there due to the con-
 tinuing threat posed by the LTTE. There are credible reports that the LTTE has
 warned Muslims displaced from the Mannar area (approximately 50,000 persons)
 not to return to their homes until the conflict is over. The LTTE forcibly recruits
 children (see Section 6.c.).
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 flicts.-Hostilities between the Government and the LTTE continued throughout the
 year. The security forces generally exercised restraint in the use of excessive force
 and implemented practices that effectively limited civilian casualties. From October
 1995 through April 1996, the Government conducted coordinated military attacks on
 LTTE-held territory in the Jaffna peninsula, resulting in the capture of Jaffna in
 December 1995 and the remainder of the peninsula by April 1996. In May 1997,
 government forces launched a major offensive north of Vavuniya in the Vanni region
 aimed at opening a land supply route to the Jaffha peninsula. The offensive was
 concluded in December without a land route having been opened. Casualties in the
 offensive were heavy. Over 300,000 persons, principally in the Vanni region, remain
 displaced by the past several years of fighting.
 The fact that the Government -was planning an offensive to open a land route to
 Jaffna was publicized widely well before it began, allowing civilians time to vacate
 the probable area of military operations. Civilian casualties also were reduced due
 to the slow and methodical manner in which government security forces pushed for-
 ward, enabling the relatively few civilians remaining in the area to flee well in ad-
 vance of troop movements. In addition, the military issued warnings via public radio
 before commencing major operations, instructing civilians to congregate at safe
 zones around churches and temples. In the past, the military has dropped leaflets
 instructing civilians to avoid LTTE installations. However, security forces have
 killed civilians living or moving near the military's established forward defense
 lines. Such killings have been a particular problem in the Vavuniya,- Mannar, and
 Kilinochchi areas in the north. At least 18 such killings occurred in 1998. Despite
 the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to assess targets before attacks, bombings and
 artillery fire against LTTE installations have killed civilians working at those in-
 stallations or living nearby. For example, several civilians were killed during an at-
 tack on an LTTE factory and administrative center in the Vanni on June 10. In the
 
 
 1973
 east, army artillery fire also has killed civilians. Human rights observers claimed
 that such artillery fire appeared at times to be indiscriminate. A lack of access to
 the area and the fluidity of the conflict in the east made it impossible to verify such
 claims. From January to August 1997, 37 civilians were killed and 30 injured during
 shelling of civilian targets.
 The security forces continued to receive instruction in international humanitarian
 law as part of their training courses (see Section 4). According to the military, the
 army also has established human rights cells in each division and human rights of-
 fices in each brigade and battalion. Civilian casualties in the north and east battle
 zone remained relatively low during the year. The armed forces operate under writ-
 ten rules of engagement that severely restrict the shelling, bombardment, or other
 use of firepower against civilian-occupied areas such as villages. Although incidents
 occurred where the rules apparently were breached or waived, these were isolated
 cases. In some cases, poor targeting by the armed forces resulted in civilian casual-
 ties from artillery fire and bombs. The security forces use aerial observation for se-
 lecting targets for shelling and bombing. They also attempt to locate the source of
 incoming mortar fire before responding. However, government mortar and artillery
 fire is very inaccurate and killed civilians.
 The Government continued to provide food relief to displaced and other needy citi-
 zens, including those living in areas controlled by the LTTE. Food is distributed by
 the Commissioner General for Essential Services (CGES) and the Multi-Purpose Co-
 operative Societies (MCPS). However, in July, the Government drastically cut the
 number of persons eligible to receive dry rations from 317,000 to 190,000. As a re-
 sult, food shipments into the LTTE-controlled parts of the Vanni region dropped sig-
 nificantly from over 3,000 metric tons per month to less than 1,500 tons. The cut
 in numbers of persons eligible for rations followed years of debate regarding the ac-
 tual number of people living in the Vanni region. The most reliable estimates put
 the population in LTTE-controlled areas at very roughly 300,000 persons, of whom
 over 200,000 may be displaced. The Government justified its decision to cut rations
 by citing financial constraints. Later, the Government argued that local food cultiva-
 tion had increased to the point that there was an actual surplus of food in the Vanni
 region and that most persons no longer needed free dry rations. However, humani-
 tarian and human rights workers noted that many displaced persons lacked the
 money necessary to purchase food, and thus were dependent on free government ra-
 tions. The food situation in the Vanni region worsened following the Government's
 decision, particularly among the poorest of those displaced. In December, following
 a reassessment of the situation, the Government increased the number of persons
 eligible to receive dry rations to approximately 250,000. By year's end, it was not
 clear whether the overall reduction food rations had created a humanitarian prob-
 lem in the Vanni.
 The Government maintained a long list of prohibited "War-related" medical items,
 such as sutures, plaster of paris, intravenous liquid supplies, bandages, and some
 drugs. Nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) and other groups that sought to
 take these items to LTTE-controlled areas in the Vanni region needed permission
 from local officials as well as from the Ministry of Defense (MOD). Delays were com-
 mon and approval was sometimes denied, due to fear that supplies would fall into
 the hands of the LTTE. As a result, many medical items in the Vanni region were
 in short supply. This shortfall contributed to an already serious deterioration in the
 quality and quantity of medical care furnished to the civilian population. Govern-
 ment restrictions on the transport of items such as cement, batteries, and currency
 into the LTTE-controlled areas also had a negative impact on the relief work of
 NGO's in those areas.
 The Government reported taking 29 LTTE prisoners on the battlefield during the
 year. Twenty-five of these LTTE fighters surrendered en masse on September 29.
 Of those who surrendered, most were below the age of 18, and at least one was only
 13. In 1997 seven LTTE insurgents reportedly were taken prisoner. The Ministry
 of Defense also reported that during the course of the year, over 400 LTTE insur-
 gents turned themselves in or were apprehended by security forces, with many of
 those arrested subsequently sent to rehabilitation centers. The ICRC continued to
 visit approximately 150 former LTTE members now in government rehabilitation
 camps who had surrendered during the previous 2 years. Given the scale of hos-
 tilities and the large number of LTTE casualties, observers found the number of
 prisoners taken under battlefield conditions to be extremely low; many LTTE fight-
 ers apparently were killed rather than taken prisoner. Observers believed that on
 the government side, an unwritten "take-no-prisoners" policy generally remained in
 effect. However, various other factors may have limited the number of prisoners
 taken, such as the LTTE's efforts to remove wounded fighters from the battlefield,
 the proclivity of its fighters to choose suicide over capture, and the LTTE's occa-
 
 
 1974
 
 sional practice of killing its own badly wounded fighters (see Section l.a.). No army
 or other security forces personnel were prosecuted or disciplined for executing pris-
 oners.
 The Government refused to permit relief organizations to provide medical atten-
 tion to wounded LTTE fighters, although it has offered to treat any LTTE wounded
 entrusted to government care. During the course of the year, there were verifiable
 instances of wounded LTTE militants surrendering to the Government and receiving
 appropriate medical care.
 The LTTE admits that it kills security force personnel rather than take them pris-
 oner. Eyewitness accounts confirm that the LTTE has executed wounded Sri
 Lankan soldiers on the battlefield. The LTTE admits to holding only 15 security
 force prisoners, all of whom were captured in 1993 and 1994. Six security force pris-
 oners previously held were released in October, while one died of natural causes
 during the year. The LTTE is believed to have killed most of the police officers and
 security force personnel it has captured in recent years. However, the LTTE re-
 leased two army deserters who surrendered to it during the course of the year.
 The LTTE uses excessive force in the war. During the course of the year, the
 LTTE engaged in the killing of noncombatants, hostage taking, hijackings, torture,
 and bombing of civlian targets. On January 25, the lTE bombed the most sacred
 Buddhist shrine in Sri Laa, the 'Temple of the Tooth" in Kandy. Thirteen civil-
 ians were killed in the attack. On March 5, an LTTE vehicle bomb exploded in
 downtown Colombo, killing 36 civilians (including the LTTE suicide bomber) and
 wounding 257. On September 11, a powerful bomb planted by the LTTE in the ceil-
 ing of a Jaffna municipal building killed 12 persons, including the newly appointed
 mayor, 4 city workers, and 7 security force personnel. At least 20 persons were in-
 jured in the bombing. There is also credible evidence that the LTTE shot down a
 civilian aircraft on September 29, killing all 55 passengers and crew aboard.
 The LTTE has been accused in the past of using church and temple compounds,
 where civilians are instructed by the Government to congregate in the event of hos-
 tilities, as shields for the storage of munitions. In the July 1996 attack on the army
 base at Mullaittivu, the LTTE killed upwards of 1,500 government troops, report-
 edly killing even those troops who attempted to surrender. Similarly, the LTTE is
 believed to have killed more than 1,000 troops when it captured Kilinochchi in Sep-
 tember. During the Government offensive on the Jaffna peninsula in 1995-96,
 LTTE fighters forced some civilians to abandon their homes and retreat with them,
 allegedly as human shields, in the face of advancing government troops. Reports
 that the LTTE was using children on the battlefield were verified when 25 LTTE
 fighters surrendered en masse in September. At least one of those who surrendered
 was 13 years old; most of the others were between the ages of 15 and 17.
 The LTTE expropriates food, fuel, and other items meant for internally displace
 persons, thus exacerbating the plight of such persons in LTTE-controlled areas. Mal-
 nutrition remained a problem in LTTE-controlled and other parts of the Vanni re-
 gion. Experts have reported an increase in anemia and a lower birth rate, both indi-
 cations of lower levels of nutrition. Nutrition levels were below the national average,
 and there were confi-med cases of malnutrition, including hundreds of cases of mal-
 nourished children. Malnutrition resulted from several factors, including food short-
 ages, poverty, and conflict-related dislocations.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and expression, the Government restricts these rights in practice, often
 using national security grounds permitted by law. During the year, the Government
 strictly limited the access of domestic and foreign media to information and
 censored news relating to military and police matters. On June 5, the Government
 imposed direct censorship on all domestic and foreign media reports relating to on-
 going or possible future military and other security operations. Censorship was still
 in place at year's end, despite the Media Minister's statement in June 1997 that
 all censorship would cease.
 International television broadcasts received in the country were also censored dur-
 ing the same period, with references to Sri Lanka filtered out of the broadcasts. A
 journalist who regularly reports on defense matters, including corruption in military
 procurements, was attacked in his home by armed men on February 12. He and his
 family were threatened at gunpoint before the attackers fled. The Government criti-
 cized the attack, and subsequently arrested and indicted two air force personnel in
 the case, including the bodyguard of a former commander of the air force. The case
 was being heard at year's end. The journalist had been harassed on previous occa-
 sions in 1997. The Government controls the country's largest newspaper chain, two
 major television stations, and the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. However,
 
 
 1975
 there are a variety of independent, privately owned newspapers, journals, and radio
 and television stations. There is one privately owned newspaper published in Jaffna.
 There are no political restrictions on the establishment of new media entities.
 A number of government actions during the year led to concern among the media.
 The Government still has failed to reform the Press Law and to privatize govern-
 ment-owned media as promised during the 1994 election campaign. In 1997 the
 Government presented a draft broadcasting reform bill in Parliament, but there was
 considerable opposition from members of the media, and the Supreme Court subse-
 quently ruled that the bill was inconsistent with the Constitution. A revised version
 of the bill was being considered by a parliamentary committee at year's end.
 In 1997 an editor of a leading national newspaper was found guilty of defaming
 the President, fined the local equivalent to $180, and sentenced to 18 months in
 prison. The editor is appealing the verdict. Another defamation case filed by the
 President in 1995 and three others filed in 1997-all against editors of major pro-
 opposition newspapers-were pending at year's end. These cases were viewed by
 journalists as frivolous and intended only to harass and intimidate the media. In
 some instances, security forces took journalists into custody, treated them roughly,
 and destroyed their film. At least one such incident occurred while reporters were
 covering a mass arrest of Tamils in Colombo. In another incident, a journalist inves-
 tigating police involvement in bootlegging reportedly was beaten by police and his
 home was burned down. In restitution the Government hired the journalist as a full-
 time employee of a government newspaper and rebuilt his home. In December the
 Supreme Court ruled that the journalist's fundamental rights had been violated and
 ordered the officer in charge of the police station responsible to pay him the equiva-
 lent of $900 in compensation. Both foreign and national journalists are allowed to
 go to the conflict areas; however, they must receive permission from the Ministry
 of Defense. The Foreign Ministry also must approve visits to conflict areas by for-
 eign journalists. Bureaucratic delays in processing requests have been reduced but
 still prevail. The Government occasionally arranges for groups of journalists to visit
 Jaffna and the vicinity of the front lines on tightly organized briefing tours. How-
 ever, after censorship was imposed on June 5, the Government became the only
 source of most news about security and defense matters that could be disseminated
 to the public legally.
 The LTTE does not tolerate freedom of expression. It tightly restricts the print
 and broadcast media in areas under its control. In the past, the LTTE has killed
 those reporting and publishing on human rights.
 The Government generally respects academic freedom.
 The LTTE does not respect academic freedom and has repressed and killed intel-
 lectuals who criticize it. The LTTE severely repressed members of a human rights
 organization, the University Teachers for Human Rights, which was formerly based
 on the Jaffna peninsula; most former members of this group have been killed.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for freedom
 of assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice. Although the PTA
 may restrict this freedom, the Government did not use the act for that purpose dur-
 ing the year. The Government generally granted permits for demonstrations, includ-
 ing those by opposition parties and minority groups. However, both the main opposi-
 tion United National Party and the People's Aianc government continued to ac-
 cuse each other of political thuggery and hooliganism, complaining that supporters
 of the opposing party occasionally disrupted rallies and other political events.
 The law provides for freedom of association, and the Government respects this
 right in practice. Although the PTA may restrict this right, the Government did not
 use the act for that during the year.
 The LTTE does not allow freedom of association in the areas that it controls. On
 the Jaffha peninsula, the LTTE occasionally has posted in public places the names
 of those Tamil civilians whose association with security forces and other Govern-
 ment entities it seeks to prevent. The LTTE has killed Tamil civilians who have co-
 operated with the security forces in establishing a civil administration in Jaffna
 under a political leadership elected freely and fairly in January.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution establishes Buddhism as the official na-
 tional religion, but it also provides for the right of members of other faiths to prac-
 tice their religions freely, and the Government respects this right in practice. For-
 eign clergy may work in Sri Lanka, but for more than 30 years the Government has
 prohibited the entry of new foreign Jesuit clergy. Thirty years ago, the Government
 reached an agreement with the Catholic Church that new foreign clergy would not
 be permitted to enter the country on a permanent basis. As foreign clergy retired,
 Sri Lankans would replace them. It permitted those already in the country to re-
 main. However, the Jesuits want their clergy to be replaced by foreign members of
 
 
 1976
 their order as they retire. The local Catholic Church hierarchy does not support the
 Jesuits in the dispute and is not lobbying the Government to change the agreement.
 Evangelical Christians, who constitute less than 1 percent of the population, have
 expressed concern that their efforts at proselytization often are met with hostility
 and harassment by the local Buddhist clergy and others opposed to their work (see
 Section 5). They sometimes complain that the Government tacitly condones such
 harassment. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. The Assemblies
 of God filed a fundamental rights case with the Supreme Court, after the local vil-
 lage council in Gampaha had tried to block the construction of a church on the
 grounds that it would interfere with Buddhism. The Supreme Court ruled that the
 construction of the church could proceed. The construction of the new church was
 ongoing at year's end.
 he LTTE has discriminated against Muslims, and in 1990 evicted tens of thou-
 sands of Muslims from areas under its control in the North.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution grants every citizen  freedom of movement and of
 choosing his residence" and "freedom to return to Sri Lanka." The Government gen-
 erally respects the right to domestic and foreign travel; however, the war with the
 LTTE prompted the Government to impose more stringent checks on travelers from
 the north and the east and on movement in Colombo, particularly after dark. These
 security measures had the effect of restricting the movement of Tamils, especially
 young males.
 Prior to the government military offensive on the Jaffna peninsula in 1995 and
 1996, an estimated 600,000 citizens had been displaced by the insurgency. Most
 lived in camps financed by the Government and NGO's. The Jaffna offensive, in ad-
 dition to the military advance on Kilinochchi in the Vanni region in July 1996, re-
 sulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of persons in LTTE-controlled
 areas of the Vanni region; some of these persons were being displaced for a second
 or third time. Some of the displaced persons lived with friends or relatives, or in
 "welfare centers" in schools, religious institutions; and other public buildings. Many
 others lived in makeshift shelters or camped out under trees. The Government con-
 tinued to supply them with food, medicine, and other essential supplies. The mili-
 tary offensive in the Vanni region that began in May 1997 created over 70,000
 newly displaced persons. However, well over 100,000 persons have left the LTTE-
 controlled parts of the Vanni region since 1996, and this has helped to relieve the
 situation. Most of these displaced persons have returned to their homes on the
 Jaffna peninsula.
 The movement of persons in Jaffna is strictly regulated by military checkpoints
 throughout the city, although by year's end the military had reduced the number
 of checkpoints there compared to 1997. For Tamils, travel from Jaffna to other parts
 of the country is extremely difficult, due in part to security restrictions imposed by
 the security forces and in part by the limited availability of transportation to the
 south.
 From October 1996 until the end of 1998, over 130,000 persons are estimated to
 have moved out of LTTE-controlled regions through Vavuniya and other transit
 points in government-controlled regions. Of these, over 100,000 persons were repa-
 triated to or otherwise reached Jafiha and other Tamil-majority areas. Many had
 left the Vanni region with the intention of proceeding south; they opted for other
 destinations only after learning that they would have to remain in transit camps
 until security clearances for southward travel were obtained. Obtaining a clearance
 was often a lengthy process and some human rights groups alleged that the proce-
 dures were arbitrary and unreasonably strict. Clearance procedures were applied to
 everyone, including the elderly and the very young. While the Government had a
 legitimate interest in identifying LTTE infiltrators, it also seemed reluctant to allow
 displaced Tamils to travel to Colombo where they would contribute to unemploy-
 ment and other social problems. About 14,000 of these displaced persons continue
 to live in substandard conditions in camps in Vavuniya and Mannar. Many of these
 persons hope to return to their homes in the areas of conflict once the fighting stops.
 Prior to 1996, the LTTE severely restricted the movement of Tamils under its con-
 trol, often levying a large "exit tax" on persons who sought to travel to areas under
 government control and requiring travelers to leave all their property in escrow. In
 addition, it usually would grant permission to only one family member to travel at
 a time. However, following the government capture of Jaffna, the LTTE began to
 allow persons to move more freely into government-controlled areas, although it oc-
 casionally has disrupted for unknown reasons the flow of persons exiting the Vanni
 region through a transit point near .Mannar. The LTTE also has disrupted the
 movement of IDP's from Trincomalee and Mannar to Jaffna by hijacking or attack-
 ing civilian shipping in the north. The LTTE also disrupted civilian air traffic to
 
 
 1977
 Jaffna; in- August, it began -warning civilians and humanitarian workers not to use
 civilian flights servicing the peninsula. Subsequently, the LTTE was accused of
 shooting down a civilian -aircraft on September 29, killing all 55 passengers and
 crew aboard (see Section 1.g.). There may be more than 200,000 IDP's in LTTE-con-
 trolled areas (see Section 1.g.).
 Several thousand Tamils fled LTTE-controlled areas to Tamil Nadu in southern
 India in 1998. An estimated 64,000 Tamil refugees already were estimated to live
 in camps there, having left Sri Lanka at various times throughout the period of the
 conflict. Another 100,000 refugees are believed to have been integrated into Tamil
 society in southern India. On July 26, an estimated 47 Tamil refugees drowned
 when the boat carrying them to India overturned.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The issue of
 the provision of first asylum did not arise in 1998. The Government does not permit
 the entry of refugees into the country, nor does it aid those who manage to enter
 to seek permanent residence elsewhere. The law does not include provisions for
 granting refugee/asylee status in accordance with the 1951 U.N. Convention Relat-
 ing to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. However, there were no in-
 stances of forcible repatriation of persons to a country where they feared persecu-
 tion.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the Constitutional right to change their government through peri-
 odic multiparty elections based on universal adult suffrage. This right was exercised
 during Parliamentary elections in August 1994, when the People's Alliance (PA) coa-
 lition ended the 17-year rule of the United National Party (UNP), and during the
 presidential election in November 1994, when PA presidential candidate Chandrika
 Kumaratunga won 62 percent of the vote. Local government elections were held in
 much of the island in areas under government control in March 1997. They were
 marked by significant violence and some charges of electoral fraud. A report pub-
 lished by the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) found that between
 February 5, 1997 and March 20, 1997, (prior to the March 21 elections), 2,237 inci-
 dents of violence were reported in the 30 police districts where elections were held.
 Most of the incidents were allegations of threats of violence, followed by assault,
 mischief, damage to property, and intimidation. There were, however, 5 reports to
 CMEV of murder, 2 reports of attempted murder, 53 reports of robbery, 50 reports
 of arson, and 40 complaints of injury. Although police allegedly were present when
 the incidents occurred, authorities have investigated few of the cases and none were
 brought before the court. The violence did not seem to be organized, except at the
 very local level by some groups of party activists representing the PA and UNP.
 Nevertheless, election monitors generally believed that the outcome of the elec-
 tion-in which the PA won most council seats-was not affected. Neither political
 party took action to discipline party activists who engaged in the violence.
 On January 29, the Government held local government elections in Jaffna for the
 first time in over a decade. Although turnout for the elections was relatively low
 due in part to threats from the LTTE and in part to outdated electoral registers,
 observers believed that the elections were free and fair. Voters elected 239 rep-
 resentatives from 5 Tamil political parties to serve on 17 local councils.
 Elections for five of the country's nine provincial councils, scheduled for August
 28, were postponed indefinitely on August 4 after the Government extended the
 Emergency Regulations (ER) to cover the entire country. The state of emergency
 must be debated and renewed by Parliament each month; it provided the only legal
 mechanism available to postpone the vote. The Government supported its decision
 by arguing that troops engaged in the offensive against the LTTE could not be
 spared to provide security for the elections. The Government promised to hold the
 elections as soon as possible, but had not done so by year's end.
 The Commissioner of Elections recognizes 34 parties; however, only 10 parties ac-
 tually hold seats in the 225-member Parliament. The two most influential parties,
 the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (the principal component party of the governing PA
 coalition) and the UNP, generally draw their support from the majority Sinhalese'
 community. Historically, these two parties have alternated in power.
 Although there are no legal impediments to the participation of women in politics
 or government, the social mores in some communities limit women's activities out-
 side the home. Nonetheless, in August 1994, voters elected a Parliament that chose
 a female Prime Minister for the third time in the country's history. In November
 1994, a woman was elected President for the first time. Eleven women hold seats
 
 
 1978
 in the Parliament. In addition to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Women's
 Affairs, four deputy ministers are women.
 There are 27 Tamil and 20 Muslim M.P.'s.
 The LTTE refuses to allow elections in areas under its control. Through a cam-
 paign of murder and intimidation, it effectively undermined the functioning of local
 government bodies in Jaffna, whose members vere elected in January. This cam-
 paign included the murder of two of Jaffna's mayors and death threats to members
 of the 17 local councils. Throughout the period of the conflict, the LTTE has killed
 popularly elected politicians, including those elected by Tamils in areas that the
 LTTE claims to be part of a Tamil homeland.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are several local NGO human rights groups, including the Movement for
 Interracial Justice and Equality (MIRJE), the University Teachers for Human
 Rights, the Civil Rights Movement (CRM), and the Law and Society Trust (LST),
 that monitor civil and political liberties. There are no adverse government regula-
 tions governing the activities of local and foreign NGO's. The Government generally
 cooperated with these NGO's, with members of Parliament, and with other officials,
 frequently participating in seminars and other events concerning human rights and
 humanitarian affairs.
 The Government continued to allow the ICRC unrestricted access to detention fa-
 cilities. In the past, the ICRC provided international humanitarian law training ma-
 terias and training to the security forces on an ad hoc basis. The UNHCR, the
 ICRC, and a variety of international NGO's assisted in the delivery of food, medical,
 and other essential supplies to the northern conflict zone. Following the capture of
 the Jaffna peninsula in April 1996, the army seriously restricted the movement of
 supplies (including building materials and equipment) by international organiza-
 tions and NGO's to LTTE-controlled areas. Although most of these restrictions were
 lifted by the end of 1997, humanitarian organizations noted that during the course
 of 1998 restrictions oi such supplies again had increased (see Section 1.g.). Some
 observers believed that increased restrictions on relief work, coupled with a cut in
 dry food rations, were linked to a government policy to draw persons out of the
 LTTE-controlled parts of the Vanni region. There was insufficient evidence to verify
 this claim.
 In July 1996, Parliament passed the Human Rights Commission Act, which cre-
 ated a permanent Human Rights Commission, the HRC. The five-meniber body is
 empowered to monitor goveinment human rights practices, to ensure compliance
 with constitutional fundamental rights provisions, and to investigate complaints of
 human rights'abuse. The legislation also provides safeguards for persons detained
 under the PTA and the ER and gives the HRC the power to monitor the welfare
 of detainees. During the year, the HRC conducted more than 1,000 visits to police
 stations and over 300 visits to detention facilities. It is estimated that the 11C has
 well over 2,000 cases of alleged human rights abuse pending. However, human
 rights observers believed that the-work.of the HRC was hampered severely by a lack
 of strong leadership within the organization. For example, such observers noted that
 the HRC failed to open an office in Mannar, did little more than visit prisons de-
 spite its very broad mandate, and did not aggressively follow up on the allegation
 of a mass grave at Chemmani in Jaffna (see Section l.a.). Moreover, despite the es-
 tablishment of a cabinet-level Anti-Harassment Committee in July, some observers
 argued that the need for such a committee demonstrated the HRC's ineffectiveness,
 since its responsibilities clearly fell within the HRC's mandate (see Section 1.d.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights under the law for all citizens and the
 Government generally respects these rights. The Supreme Court regularly upholds
 court rulings in cases in which individuals file suit over the abridgment of their fun-
 damental civil rights. The Human. Rights Commission and the newly established
 Anti-Harassment Committee (later renamed the Committee to Inquire Into Undue
 Arrest- and Harassment) are other mechanisms the Government has established to
 ensure enforcement-of constitutional provisions in addition to access to the courts
 (see Section 1.d.).
 Women.-Sexual assault, rape, and spousal abuse (often associated with alcohol)
 represent serious and pervasive forms of societal violence against women. New
 amendments to the Penal Code introduced in 1995 specifically addressed sexual
 abuse and exploitation. Rape laws were modified to create a more equitable burden
 of proof and to make punishments more stringent. Marital rape is considered an of-
 
 
 1979
 fense in cases of spouses living under judicial separation, and laws govern sexual
 harassment in the workplace and sexual molestation. While the Penal Code may
 ease some of the problems faced by victims of sexual assault, many women's organi-
 zations believe that greater sensitization of police and judicial officials also is re-
 quired. Police statistics indicated that there were 26,565 crimes against women dur-
 ing the period from January to June, compared with 26,862 crimes during the same
 period in 1997. Laws against procuring and trafficking were strengthened in 1995,
 facilitating the prosecution of brothel owners.
 The Constitution provides for equal employment opportunities in the public sec-
 tor, but women have no legal protection against discrimination in the private sector,
 where they sometimes are paid less than men for equal work, often experience dif-
 ficulty in rising to supervisory positions, and face sexual harassment. Women con-
 stitut approximately one-half of the formal work force.
 Women have equal rights under national civil and criminal law. However, issues
 related to family law, including, divorce, child custody, and inheritance, are adju-
 dicated by the customary law of each ethnic or religious group. In 1995 the Govern-
 ment.raised the minimum age of marriage for women from 12 to 18 years, except
 in the case of Muslims, who continue to follow their customary marriage practices.
 The application of different legal practices based on membership in a relgious or
 ethnic group often results in discrimination against women.
 Children.-The Government is committed to protecting the welfare and rights of
 children but is constrained by a lack of resources. The Government demonstrates
 a strong commitment to children's rights and welfare through its extensive systems
 of public education and medical care. Education is compulsory to the age of 12 and
 free through university. Health care, including immunization programs, is also free.
 There is a significant problem of child prostitution in certain coastal resort areas.
 The Government estimates that there are more than 2,000 active child prostitutes
 in the country, but private groups claim that the number is much higher, estimates
 -range-as high as 15,000 to 20,000. A 1998 U.N. International Labor Office Study
 placed the -total at 30,000. Although the bulk of child sexual abuse in the form of
 child prostitution is committed by citizens, many child prostitutes are boys who sell
 themselves to foreign tourists, and the Government has pushed for greater inter-
 -national cooperation to bring those guilty of pedophilia to justice. For example, the
 Government worked closely with another country's security and judicial branches
 during the course of the year to secure the conviction of a pedophiliac accused of
 committing crimes in Sri Lanka. In 1995 the Ministry of Media, Tourism and Avia-
 tion created a task force specifically to study the problem of sex tourism and related
 offenses. The task force was abolished at the end of 1997, and superseded by a pres-
 idential task force on child protection.
 In August, the Government presented a national Child Protection Authority (CPA)
 bill to Parliament, which-waspassed on September 8. The law consolidated existing
 legislation and, defined a child as anyone under age 18. Under the law, the defini-
 tion of child abuse includes all acts of sexual violence against, trafficking in, and
 cruelty to children. The law also prohibits the use of children in exploitative labor
 or illegal activities, or in any act contrary to compulsory education regulations. The
 legislation further widened the definition of child abuse to include the involvement
 of children in war. The CPA is to be composed of senior law enforcement officers
 as well as representatives from education and the medical and legal professions.
 The CPA will report directly to the President. The CPA had not yet been constituted
 at year's end.
 In the first half of the year, the police recorded 1,752 cases of crimes against chil-
 dren, compared with 1,633 crimes in the first half of 1997. Although NGO's wel-
 comed the CPA legislation, many attribute the problem of exploitation of children
 to the lack of law enforcement rather than inadequate legislation. Many law en-
 forcement resources are diverted to the conflict with the LTTE.
 ,Labor force surveys over the-past several years have suggested that more than
 20,000 children may be fully employed (see Section 6.d.). Additional thousands of
 children are believed to be working in domestic service. There have been reports of
 rural children working as domestic servants in urban households--often given into
 service by poverty stricken parents--and being abused by their employers. Some of
 these children reportedly have been starved, beaten, sexually abused, and forced
 into.prostitution (see Section 6.c.). The Government states that it does not have suf-
 ficient resources to protect these children from such exploitation (see Section 6.d.).
 However, the Government has supported a high-profile UNICEF advertising cam-
 paignaimed at combating child labor.
 The LTTE recruits children for use in battlefield support functions and in combat.
 It has been confirmed that some of these children are as young as 13, and some
 are recruited forcibly. In May the LTTE gave assurances to the Special Representa-
 
 
 1980
 tive of the U.N. Secretary General for Children in Armed Combat that it would not
 recruit children under the age of 17. By year's end, it was apparent that the LTTE
 had not honored that pledge.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not mandate accessibility to buildings or
 government services for the disabled. The World Health Organization estimates that
 7 percent of the population is disabled. Most disabled persons who are unable to
 work are cared for by their families. The Department of Social Services operates
 eight vocational training schools for the physically and mentally disabled and spon-
 sors a program of job training and job placement for graduates. Some private com-
 panies, at the urging of the Government, have provided training and jobs to disabled
 veterans. The Government also provides some financial support to NGO's that assist
 the disabled, subsidizes prosthetic devices and other medicaf aids for the disabled,
 makes some purchases from disabled suppliers, and has registered 74 schools and
 training institutions for the disabled run by NGO's.
 In December 1996, Parliament passed legislation forbidding discrimination
 against any person on the grounds of disability. No cases are known to have been
 fied under this law.
 Indigenous People.-The indigenous people of Sri Lanka, known as Veddas, num-
 ber less than 1,000. They prefer to maintain their isolated traditional way of life
 and are protected by the Constitution. There are no legal restrictions on their par-
 ticipation in the political or economic life of the nation. In August the Government
 fulfilled a long-standing Vedda demand when the President issued an order grant-
 ing many Veddas the right to hunt and gather in specific protected forest areas. The
 executive order granted the Veddas the freedom to protect their culture and to carry
 on their traditional way of life without hindrance. Under a pilot program; special
 identity cards were issued to some Veddas to facilitate their use of these forest
 areas. However, some Veddas still complain that they are being pushed off of their
 land.
 Religious -Minorities.-Discrimination based on religious differences is much less
 commonthan discrimination based on ethnic group or caste. In general, the mem-
 bers of the various faiths tend t'be tolerant of each other's religious beliefs. How-
 ever, on occasion, evangelical Christians have been harassed by Buddhist monks for
 their attempts to convert Buddhists to Christianity (see Section 2.c.).
 On January 25, the LTTE bombed the holiest Buddhist shrine in the country, the
 historic "Temple of the Tooth" in .Kandy. Following a bombing in Colombo in Octo-
 ber 1997, an LTTE suicide bomber threw a grenade into a temple compound and
 killed a Buddhist monk. In 1985 the LTTE massacred 150 people worshipping at
 a holy Buddhist site in Anaradhapura. In 1987 the LTTE killed 31 Buddhist monks.
 In the northern part of the island, LTTE insurgents expelled some 46,000 Muslim
 inhabitants from their homes in 1990--virtually the entire Muslim population. Most
 of these persons remain displaced. In the past, the LTTE has expropriated Muslim
 homes, lands, and businesses and threatened Muslim families with death if they at-
 tem t to return.
 NgtionallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-There are a pproximately 1 million Tamils of
 comparatively recent Indian origin, the so-called "hill Tamils" or "Indian Tamils,"
 whose ancestors originally were brought to Sri Lanka in the 19th century to work
 on plantations. About 75,000 of these persons do not qualify for either Indian or Sri
 Lankan citizenship and face discrimination, especially in the allocation of govern-
 ment funds for education. Without national identity cards, they are very vulnerable
 to -arrest by the security forces. However, the Government has stated that none of
 these people would be forced to depart the country.
 Both Sri Lankan and "Indian" Tamils maintain that they have long been the vic-
 tims of systematic discrimination in university education, government employment,
 and in other matters controlled by;-the Government. However, in recent years, there
 has been little clear evidence of overt discrimination in university enrollment or gov-
 ernment'employment, although some groups continue to assert that it exists. In
 January 1996, the Government established a Parliamentary select committee to con-
 pider, a "devolution" package designed to devolve wide-ranging powers to local gov-
 ernments, thereby- providing ethnic minorities greater autonomy in governing their
 local affairs. The devolution proposals were placed before Parliament in September
 1997 and still were being debated at year's end.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 - a. The Right of Association.---The Government respects the Constitutional right of
 workers to establish labor unions. Any seven workers may form a union, adopt a
 charter, elect leaders, and publicize their views. Over 70'percent of the plantation
 work force, which is overwhelmingly Tamil, is unionized. Approximately 20 percent
 of the nonagricultural work force in the private sector also is unionized. Unions rep-
 
 
 1981
 resent most workers in large private firms, but those in small scale agriculture and
 small businesses usually do not belong to unions. Public sector employees are union-
 ized at very high rates.
 �Most large unions are affiliated with political parties and p lay a prominent role
 in the political process. More than 30 labor unions ihave poitcal affiliations, but
 there are also a small number of unaffiiated unions, some of which have active
 leaders and a relatively large membership. In 1997, the most recent year for which
 data are available, the Department of Labor registered 132 new unions and canceled
 the registration of 95 others, bringing the total number of functioning trade unions
 to 1,592: The Department of Labor is authorized by law to cancel the registration
 of any union that does not submit an annual report. This requirement is the only
 legal grounds for cancellation of registration.
 All workers, other than civil servants and workers in "essential" services, have
 the right to strike. By law, workers also may lodge complaints with the Commis-
 sioner of Labor, a labor tribunal, or the Supreme Court to protect their rights. Be-
 fore September 1994, the Government controlled strikes by declaring some indus-
 tries to be essential under the ER. Subsequently, this practice largely ceased, with
 the Government permitting, for example, a 5-week postal strike early in the year.
 However, the President retains the power to designate any industry as an essential
 service. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has pointed out to the Govern-
 ment that essential services should be limited to services where an interruption
 would endanger the life, personal safety, or health of the population.
 Civil servants collectively may submit labor grievances to the public service com-
 mission but have no legal grounds to strike. Nonetheless, government workers in
 the transportation, medical, educational, power generation, financial, and port sec-
 tors have staged brief strikes and other work actions in recent years. There were
 115 strikes during 1998. There were 156 strikes in 1997.
 The law prohibits retribution agast strikers in nonessential sectors. Employers
 may dismiss workers only for disciplinary reasons, mainly misconduct. Incom-
 petence or low productivity are not grounds for dismissal. Any employees who have
 been dismissedhave a right to appeal their termination before a labor tribunal.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international bodies and many of them have done
 b. The Right to Or'anize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to collective bargaimng, and it is widely practiced. Large firms may have employees
 in as many as 60 different unions. In enterprises without unions, including those
 in the export processing zones (EPZ's), worker councils--composed of employees, em-
 ployers, and often a public sector representative--are genealy the forums for labor/
 management negotiation. However, the councils are not mandatory outside the
 EPZ's, do not have the power to negotiate binding contracts, and have been criti-
 cized as ineffective by labor advocates.
 The law currently does not require management to recognize or bargain with
 unions, and, in some cases, employers have declined to recognize the unions in their
 factories. However, the law prohibits antiunion discrimination. Employers found
 guilty of suchdiscrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activi-
 ties but have the right to transfer them to different locations.
 There are approximately 90,700 workers employed in the EPZ's, a large percent-
 age of them women. Under the law, workers in the EPZ's have the same rights to
 join unions as other worker. However, no unions have been formed, largely because
 of severe restrictions on access by union organizers to the zones. Some labor rep-
 resentatives allege that the Government's Board of Investment (BOI), which man-
 ages the EPZ's, has discouraged union activity. Work councils in the EPZ's are
 chaired by the BO and consist of equal delegations from labor and management,
 but councils only have the power to make recommendations. While employers in the
 EPZ's offer higher wages and better working conditions generally than employers
 do elsewhere, workers face other concerns, such as security, expensive but low qual-
 ity boarding houses, and sexual harassment.
 In most instances, wage boards establish minimum wages and conditions of em-
 ployment, except in the EPZ's, where wages and work conditions are set by the BO.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibitd by provisions of the Abolition of Slavery Act of 1844. The act does not pro-
 hibit forced or bonded labor by children specifically, but government officials inter-
 pret it as applying to persons of all ages. While forced or bonded labor by children
 is almost nonexistent, a few rural children are reported to be employed in debt
 bondage as domestic servants in urban households (see Section 5); some of these
 children reportedly have been abused. There are credible reports that some mem-
 bers of the policeSpecial Task Force (STF) operating in the Batticaloa area force
 local villeagers to work without compensation in clearing jungle areas and in other
 
 
 1982
 
 manual labor in and near STF camps. In some cases, the villagers are threatened
 directly or indirectly with physical abuse if they do not perform the work.
 The LTTE continues to conscript high-school age children for work as cooks, mes-
 sengers, and clerks. In some cases, the children reportedly help build fortifications.
 In the past, children as young as 10 were said to be-recruited and placed for 2 to
 4 years in special schools that provided them with a mixture of LTTE ideology and
 formal education. The LTTE uses children as young as 13 in -battle, and children
 sometimes are recruited forcibly into the LTTE.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for 'Employment.-On Sep-
 tember 8, Parliament passed the National Child Protection Authority Act to combat
 the problem of child abuse, including as it pertains to child labor. The act consoli-
 dated existing legislation that clearly established what types of employment are re-
 stricted for children, which age groups are affected, and what the minimum age for
 child labor is for particular jobs. The minimum age for employment is 15. The law
 continues to permit the employment of younger children by their parents or guard-
 ians in limited agricultural work, however. It also permits employment in any
 school or institution for training purposes.
 Persons under age 16 may not be employed in any public enterprise in which life
 or limb is endangered. Children are not employed in the EPZ's, the plantations, the
 garment industry, or any other export industry. About 85 percent of children below
 the age of 16 attend school. The law permits the employment of such persons for
 not more than 1 hour on any day before school. However, a 1995 labor survey of
 the plantations indicated that half of all children in plantations drop out of school
 after the fourth grade, leaving a large pool of children between the ages of 10 and
 15 available to pursue employment.
 Despite legislation, some child labor still exists. A 1997 Census and Statistics De-
 partment survey found that 16,511 children between the ages of 10 and 14 were
 fully employed. This included 11,132 males and 5,379 females. Additional thousands
 of children (estimates range from 50,000 to 100,000) are believed to be employed in
 domestic service, although this situation is not regulated or documented. Many child
 domestics often are subjected to physical, sexual, and/or emotional abuse. A signifi-
 cant portion of employed children work outside their families. In addition to domes-
 tic service, regular employment of children occurs mainly in the informal sector and
 in family enterprises such as family farms, crafts, small trade establishments, eat-
 ing houses, and repair shops. Children also are involved in the manufacture of coco-
 nut fiber products, bricks, fishing, wrapping tobacco, street trading, and farming.
 Government inspections have been unable to eliminate these forms of child labor
 (also see Section 5). There are an estimated 250 to 300 prosecutions each year in
 cases related to the employment of minors. Under legislation dating from 1956, the
 maximum penalty for employing minors is about $18, with a maximum jail term of
 6 months. Children work as prostitutes, as well. Estimates of the number of child
 prostitutes range from 15,000 to 20,000 (see Section 5). Although forced or bonded
 labor by persons of any age are prohibited by law, a few rural children reportedly
 serve in debt bondage (see Sections 5 and 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Department of Labor effectively enforces
 the minimum wage law. While there is no universal national minimum wage, about
 40 wage boards set minimum wages and working conditions by sector and industry.
 According to the Statistics Department of the Labor Ministry, current minimum
 wage rates average $34 (2,000 rupees) per month in-industry, commerce, and the
 service sector; and $1.44 (95 rupees) per day in-agriculture. The minimum wage in
 the garment industry is $38 (2,500 rupees) per month. These minimum wages are
 insufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and the standard
 family of five, but the vast majority of families have more than one breadwinner.
 Most permanent full-time workers are covered by laws that prohibit them from
 working regularly more than 45 hours per week (a 5-and-one-half day workweek).
 Such workers also receive 14 days of annual leave, 14 to 21 days of medical leave,
 and some 20 local holidays each year.             -
 Maternity leave is available for permanent and casual female workers. Employers
 must contribute 12 percent of a: worker's wage to an employee's provident fund and
 3 percent to an employee's trust fund. Employers who fail to comply may be fined,
 although the effectiveness of government enforcement of this provision is unknown.
 Several laws protect the safety and health of industrial workers. However, the De-
 partment of Labor's small staff of inspectors is inadequate to enforce compliance
 with the laws. Workers have the statutory right to remove themselves from situa-
 tions that endanger their health, but many workers are unaware of, or indifferent
 to, health risks, and fear that they would lose their jobs if they removed themselves.
