 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a practicing constitutional democracy with
 an elected president, a two-house legislature, and an
 independently functioning judicial system. The present
 Lopez Administration was elected to office in 1974.
 Congressional and Presidential elections are scheduled
 for February and June 1978, respectively. The country
 has one of the best human rights records in Latin America.
 Though beset with serious problems--jAcluding poverty,
 inflation, crime, narcotics trafficking, guerrilla acti-
 vities, and occasional public disorders--Colombia's adher-
 ence to its democratic traditions and its respect for
 human rights remain strong.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 It is clear that Colombian Government policy is against
 the practice of torture. The infrequent charges of
 torture are investigated by the Government and violators
 have been punished in accordance with Colombian law.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There have been no reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading
 treatment or punishment.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Colombian citizens are generally free from arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment. When a state of siege is in
 effect (provided for in Article 121 of the Constitution)
 the Government has broad powers to arrest and detain
 persons to preserve public order, but these powers have
 been used sparingly. A state of siege has been in effect
 for most of the post-World War II period and was in
 force at the end of 1977. In September 1977, close
 to 4,000 persons were arrested and detained for disturb-
 ing public order--mainly for breaking the curfew during
 a national strike. Only a small group (approximately 50
 to 55) were detained for more than a few days, and then
 (144)
 
 
 145
 only after having been charged with specific crimes,
 i.e. assaulting police officers, looting, arson, etc.
 There have also been occasional reports of temporary
 detentions of peasants in disputes over land tenure,
 as well as accusations that local authorities showed
 bias in favor of the claims of influential landowners;
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is observed. The
 Colombian judiciary is noted for its fairness and
 independence. The length of the trial process is
 often a problem, due to the increase in crime and an
 outmoded judicial system (which the Colombian Govern-
 ment plans to reform).
 e. Invasion of the Home
 No reports have been received of arbitrary intrusions
 into homes by Colombian law enforcement personnel.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 For many decides economic development has been identi-
 fied as a high priority of the Government. The Lopez
 Administration's four-year development plan, entitled
 To Close the Ga (i.e., the gap between the haves and
 tehave-nots in Colombia), stresses assistance for the
 poor--particularly the neglected rural poor--in the areas
 of education, Health, and nutrition. The Government is
 emphasizing the need to increase agricultural production
 in order to meet more fully the food requirements of the
 poor. Better housing for the poor is also a major
 concern and activity of the Government. Much poverty
 remains, however, as does the great contrast between
 rich and poor.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion,
 and Assembly
 
 
 146
 There is full respect for freedom of thought, speech,
 press, and. religion in Colombia. ihile the Roman
 Catholic faith is accorded the status of the official
 reliqion, freedom of religion.is guaranteed and   -
 observed. Freedom of assembly is generally permitted,
 but the Government can and sometimes does ban demon-
 strations and rallies (under the aforementioned Article
 121) if it believes the public order .is 'endangered.
 The September 1977 national strike, declared Dy the
 four major labor confederations, was ruled illegal by
 the Government. Violence occurred 'hen'the confed-
 erations nevertheless carried out the strike. On
 November 18 the confederations requested and received
 Government permission to stage demonstrations, which
 were peaceful.
 b. Freedom'of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no-restrictions on freedom of domestic or
 foreign travel or freedom*-of emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Despite frequent states of siege, there'is full'freedom
 to participate in the political process.-Political
 parties and-other organizations from the-far left to the
 right operate legally and without official harassment.
 Only guerrilla organizations which carry out acts of
 violence are proscribed., In this century there has been
 only one period of military rule (1953-57). Local
 elections are held every two yeats and-national elections
 every four years. They are zonsideted to be administered
 fairly.
 4. Government Attitude afi Record Regarding International
 and Non-Government Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Colombian Government.i;.proud of the country's human
 rights-record, and has shown A willingness to cooperate
 with the few investigations undertaken by international
 and non-governmental organizations; The Amnesty Inter-
 national Report 1977 noted that four prisoners whose
 cases were taN-up by Amnesty were released by court
 
 
 147
 order in October 1976. The Amnesty International Report
 1977 also discussed problems connected with human rights
 n-the rural areas of Colombia, which it judged to be
 "largely the result of excesses by local authorities."
 .:It noted that "national authorities have shown consider-
 able willingness in the past to intervene to remedy
 abuses when they were reported."
