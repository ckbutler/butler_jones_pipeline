 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde became independent from Portugal in 1975 and
 a constitution is expected to be completed in early
 1979. The Government is controlled by the African Party
 for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde,
 (PAIGC). Legislation is by executive decrees; many of
 these incorporate basic tenets of Portuguese law with
 local modifications. The traditional concepts of civil
 liberties and human rights have general support in Cape
 Verde, and the Government appears to be committed to
 upholding many of the basic rights and freedoms in the
 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 There were no reports of torture in 1978. The Ministry
 of Justice informed the United States Embassy that the
 new Constitution would contain provisions prohibiting
 torture and cruel and inhuman treatment.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading
 treatment or punishments during the past year
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Generally such actions do not occur in Cape Verde.
 In his New Year's message, broadcast on December 31,
 1978, President Pereira of Cape Verde granted amnesty
 to 43 political prisoners. These prisoners were
 arrested in June 1977, and 21 had been held since that
 date.   In his announcement, President Pereira stated
 that there were no other political prisoners in Cape
 Verde.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 (29)

 The 43 persons arrested in June, 1977 were seized on
 the Islands of Sao Vincente and Santo Antao for allegedly
 distributing anti-government pamphlets, attempting to
 commit acts of sabotage and planning to assasinate
 Government and party officials. At the time of their
 arrests, those detained were guaranteed a public trial
 with right to defense counsel. However, none of those
 arrested were tried prior to their release.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Effective safeguards against arbitrary invasion of
 the home appear to exist.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Government of Cape Verde has designed programs to
 meet these human needs, and the international community
 has responded positively to requests for assistance.
 All Cape Verdeans are poor and many are illiterate.
 Health care is inadequate. Although hampered by rapid
 population growth and a prolonged drought, now in its
 tenth year, the Government's programs in education,
 agriculture and irrigation and public works appear well
 planned and executed. For example, newly constucted
 dikes have been effected in halting erosion and
 also store water. Approximately seventy percent of
 budget expenditures, including international assistance,
 is devoted to development and the alleviation of the
 effects of the drought. There appears to be little
 corruption in the Government; when detected, it is
 suppressed.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The freedoms of religion and assembly are generally
 
 
 31
 respected. Church and civic organizations are active,
 but are discouraged from engaging in political activities.
 On several occasions priests and ministers have been
 expelled for engaging in political activities.
 With the exception of one newspaper, published by the
 Roman Catholic Church, the media are controlled by
 the ruling party and echo the philosophy and outlook of
 the Government and the PAIGC.
 b.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on travel within Cape
 Verde. Emigration, especially to Portugal, and
 foreign travel are restricted to a limited degree
 by administrative procedures and by the requirement for
 a deposit to encourage return of the traveller to Cape
 Verde.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Cape Verde is a single-party state and opposition
 parties are not. permitted. The Government and the
 PAIGC remain very sensitive to criticism and public
 criticism of the Government is not permitted. In a
 recent case, a well known lawyer was heavily fined and
 sentenced to a year's imprisonment for calling a
 minister incompetent. Though one need not be a member
 of the PAIGC to hold elected or appointed offices,
 party members are given preference over non-party
 members. There was universal suffrage in the elections
 for the 56-member National Assembly held in June 1975.
 The Assembly meets infrequently to endorse laws decreed
 by the Council of Ministers, which is chosen from among
 members of the National Assembly.
 Under the PAIGC there has been considerable progress
 in enhancing the rights of women. Women in Cape
 Verde have the same political, social and economic
 rights as men under the law. The proportion of girls
 attending school has increased and at least one-third
 of the Cape Verdean students abroad under Government
 grants are women. The Government and the PAIGC have
 also started women's organizations, although these are
 
 
 32
 not fully operational. An officially sponsored mass
 labor organization exists, but its activities have been
 very limited so far.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 It appears unlikely that the Government of Cape Verde
 would authorize investigations by outside parties.
