 MOLDOVA
 The Republic of Moldova declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
 Most of the Republic was part of Romania between 1918 and 1940, and the majority
 of its population is Romanian-speaking.
 The President, Mircea Snegur, was elected by Parliament in July 1990 and, seek-
 ing a stronger mandate, in direct elections in December 1991. Although opposition
 candidates withdrew and called for a boycott, Snegur won an overwhelming victory,
 which was interpreted as a show of support for an independent Moldova. The Gov-
 ernment has not been able to assemble a working majority in Parliament. The
 Prime Minister is a leader of the Agrarians, the largest single group in Parliament.
 The numerous other parliamentary groups include several smaller parties, which
 support eventual unification with Romania, and a faction that includes mostly Rus-
 sian-speaking deputies. Early parliamentary elections have been scheduled for Feb-
 ruary 27, 1994. They were considered necessary to end the parliamentary deadlock
 which slowed political and economic reform.
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs has responsibility for the police, while the Min-
 istry of National Security controls the security organs. There are mechanisms to
 provide for limited parliamentary oversight of the activities of the security organs.
 The Parliament has the ability to vote the dismissal of employees of the Security
 or Interior Ministries if employees have not correctly fulfilled their duties or have
 been involved in illegal activities. In principle, this gives the Parliament a means
 to affect the activities of the security organs. This power was not exercised in 1993.
 Moldova's largely agricultural economy continues to suffer from the problems of
 privatization and lack of resources. The Government removed most subsidies from
 food and other products and launched the privatization of housing. The pace of agri-
 cultural privatization also accelerated.
 As a result of the political deadlock, Moldova did not establish a legal framework
 to ensure protection for human rights in 1993. Nonetheless, Moldova made steady
 progress in improving respect for some human rights. Freedom of religion and free-
 dom of movement were respected in practice. Ethnic relations improved as a genu-
 ine dialog began among the different groups, although language issues remain a
 source of tension. Other problem areas include an unreformed legal system that al-
 lows pretrial detention as long as 18 months; a judiciary that has yet to establish
 its independence; an unreformed prison system; instances of custodial abuse; and a
 significant degree of self-censorship that limits freedom of the press.
 Two significant separatist movements within Moldova present problems that re-
 main unresolved. In the Transdniester region, the separatist movement, led by a
 pro-Soviet group, initially sought independence for the region but has on occasion
 indicated a willingness to discuss federal or confederal solutions. There are continu-
 ing credible reports of human rights abuses in Transdniester, although the scale of
 serious abuses is much smaller than in 1992. The cease-fire of July 1992, which
 ended armed conflict between the two sides, was generally observed. Negotiations
 between Moldovan leaders and representatives of the other separatist movement,
 that of the Gagauz (Christian Turkic) minority, centered in 1993 on territorial and
 cultural autonomy, but Parliament rejected territorial autonomy.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Politically motivated killings are not
 known to have occurred in 1993. Given the heightened tensions in many parts of
 the country due to the separatist conflicts and deteriorating economic conditions, the
 Ministry of Internal Affairs has instituted a policy that strongly discourages officers
 from using firearms in any but the most clearly life-threatening situations. Police
 recruits are reportedly tested on their ability to refrain from the use of armed force
 under provocation. There were no known claims of improper use of lethal force by
 police in 1993.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Puns hment.-
 There were no allegations of torture of civil or criminal pisners by Moldovan au-
 thorities in 1993, but there were credible reports that plice sometimes beat pris-
 oners in their custody. Prisoners complained of extremely harsh conditions in ris-
 ons, including inadequate sanitation, medical care, and food supplies, lack of bed-
 ding, and beatings by jailers, coupled with indifference on the part of the authorities
 to the condition of the prisoners. Prisoners also reported, credibly, that jailers did
 not intervene to prevent some prisoners from abusing others.
 Police beat four ethnic Russians, formerly soldiers in the Russian 14th Army sta-
 tioned in Moldova, while in custody on charges of car theft.
 Independent human rights groups report that allegations that the Transdniester
 authorities mistreat prisoners are credible. A group of ethnic Romanians (the
 "Tiraspol Six"), arrested in 1992 and indicted for the assassination of two
 Transdniester officials, made extensive charges of mistreatment. They charged that
 during 10 months of pretrial detention they were beaten, subjected to mock execu-
 tions, drugged, and attacked by dogs. There is special concern about the condition
 of one of the prisoners, Andrey Ivantoc, who appears to suffer from physical and
 mental illness requiring medical treatment. The separatist authorities initially re-
 fused to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit these pr, oners,
 and family members and lawyers were often refused access to the prisoners. Once
 the trial of the prisoners began in April, however, their treatment apparently im-
 proved, and they were usually permitted visits by family members and lawyers (see
 Section 1. e.).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The former Soviet code on penal proce-
 dure remains in force, with some amendments. The prosecutor's office issues arrest
 warrants. A suspect may be held for 72 hours without charge and is normally al-
 lowed family visits during this period. This 72-hour time limit appears to be gen-
 erally respected. If charged, a suspect may be released pending trial, often with the
 restriction that he or she not leave town. There is no system of bail, but in some
 cases a friend or relative, in order to arrange release, may give a written undertak-
 ing that the accused will appear for trial.
 Suspects accused of violent or serious crimes are generally not released before
 trial; the prosecutor's office makes this determination without any judicial review.
 The code permits pretrial detention, at the prosecutor's discretion, for up to 18
 months.
 In 1992 the Penal Procedure Code was amended to permit suspects earlier access
 to an attorney. Formerly, an attorney could be present during official questioning
 only after an arrest or after the prosecution had completed its investigation and for-
 warded the case to the court. If a suspect were detained and under investigation
 but not formally arrested, he had no right to have an attorney present. Under the
 amended provisions, a suspect may have an attorney present during questioning
 from the moment the prosecutor files an "affidavit of retention," which restricts the
 suspect's movements without putting him under arrest. If a person is unable to af-
 ford a lawyer, one is provided at public expense.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The independence of the judiciary has increased
 since the dissolution of the Soviet Union; however, there is still no legal framework
 guaranteeing judicial independence. There are local courts on the city or rayon (dis-
 trict) level, with the Supreme Court acting as an appellate court. The Supreme
 Court is divided into two sections, one handling civil cases and the other criminal
 cases. In criminal cases, the defendant by law enjoys a presumption of innocence.
 Generally, trials are open to the public. Defendants have the right to attend pro-
 ceedings, confront witnesses, and present evidence. Defense attorneys are able to re-
 view the evidence against their clients when preparing their cases. The accused en-
 joys a right of appeal to the Supreme Court. In a number of cases, decisions of lower
 courts were overturned on appeal.
 
 
 Members of the Russian-speaking minority have expressed concern that they have
 not received equal treatment before the courts. To date, no pattern of discrimination
 has emerged in the judicial system.
 In the area of Moldova not under Transdniestrian control, no prisoners are known
 to have been convicted or to be serving sentences based on political charges. There
 have been credible charges, however, that local prosecutors have brought unjustified
 cases against individuals in ret riution for their accusations of official corruption.
 In the Transdniester region, the trial of the "Tiraspol Six", ethnic Romanians
 charged with assassinating two Transdniester officials, began in April, almost 10
 months after their arrest. International human rights groups, including the Russian
 group Memorial, raised serious questions about the fairness of the trial. The legit-
 imacy of the court has also been called into question. Separatist authorities have
 reportedly harassed and threatened attorneys for the defendants. One lawyer, an
 ethnic Russian, made a statement in court, protesting the actions taken against her
 and alleging that local security forces were following her. She withdrew from the
 trial. In-)ecemier all the accused were found guilty; the leader of the group was
 sentenced to death, while several other defendants were sentenced to long prison
 terms. While the prisoners remained in detention at year's end, the formal sen-
 tences, including the death sentence, had not been carried out.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Accord-
 ing to the 1990 law on the police, the prosecutor's office issues search warrants.
 There have been instances when searches were conducted without warrants, and
 courts do not exclude evidence that was illegally obtained. There is no judicial re-
 view of warrants.
 Some government critics claimed that they were followed by security forces and
 harassed. It was widely believed that the security forces continued to use electronic
 monitoring of residences and telephones in some cases, although evidence of such
 activities was lacking. By law, the prosecutor's office must authorize wiretaps and
 may do so only if a criminal investi ation is under way. In practice, the prosecutor's
 office lacks the ability to control and check the security organs and police to prevent
 them from using wiretaps illegally.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government did not actively repress free-
 dom of speech and press during the year. Political parties and other groups pub-
 lished their own newspapers and freely criticized the Government. However, free-
 dom of the press was limited by the lack of independent news media, especially
 broadcast media. The Government controls radio and television, and official or
 quasi-official entities such as government departments or Parliament own most of
 te major newspapers, resulting in significant self-censorship. Some writers report
 for example, that editors encouraged them to mute criticism of individual political
 leaders or to cite the'"authorities" rather than individual officials by name.
 Sfatul Tarii, the parliamentary Romanian-language daily ceased publication
 when Parliament cut off most of its funding. Parliamentary leaders claimed that
 they could not support two newspapers (the other is the Russian-languae Inde-
 pendent Moldova). Editors of Sfatul Tarii charged that its funding was cut ecause
 of its criticism of the Government.
 The Government does not restrict foreign publications. Newspapers from Russia
 are widely available in Moldovan cities. Those from Romania are available but are
 expensive and generally more difficult to obtain. Newspapers published by the sepa-
 ratist forces are not available in the rest of Moldova, although they arrive by mail
 without apparent interference. On the other hand, Romanian-language Moldovan
 newspapers are increasingly available in the separatist Transdniester region.
 The Government controls radio and television. In the Tranadniestrian area, the
 authorities continue to ban Moldovan radio and television. Moldova receives tele-
 vision broadcasts from Romania and from Russia.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right to peaceful assembly
 isrotected by law. Permits for demonstrations are general y issued by the mayor's
 ofice, which may consult the national Government if the demonstration is likely to
 be extremely large.
 There were few demonstrations in 1993; all were allowed to take place without
 police interference, although a large police contingent was occasionally deployed to
 protect the targets of demonstrations, such as the President's office. In a few cases,
 permits were denied for demonstrations, but no action was taken to interfere when
 emonstrations occurred anyway.
 Private organizations, including political parties, are required to register, but ap-
 plications appear to be handled routinely.
 The Presidium of the Parliament ended the ban on the Communist Party.
 
 
 978
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The practice of religion is generally free in Moldova. Par-
 liament passed a law on religion in 1992 which codified religious freedoms, although
 it contained restrictions that could inhibit the activities of some religious groups.
 The law guarantees freedom of religious practice, including each person's right to
 profess his religion in any form. It also provides for alternative military service for
 conscientious objectors, protects the secrets of the confessional, allows denomina-
 tions to establish associations and foundations, and states that the Government may
 not interfere in the religious activities of denominations.
 The law, however, also requires that religious groups be recognized by the Gov-
 ernment in order to function and that denominations obtain specific government ap-
 proval to hire noncitizens. The law also prohibits proselytizing. In practice, street
 preaching and the holding of religious revivals have flourished, although there were
 unconfirmed reports of police preventing street preaching in some cases. Some
 Protestant denominations are concerned that the prohibition on proselytism could
 inhibit their activities. In addition, Parliament did not issue implementing regula-
 tions that provided a legal definition of proselytizing, leaving open the possibility
 of abuse. To date, no legal actions are known to have been taken against individuals
 for proselytizing, despite a substantial amount of such activity.
 Although the Orthodox Church was not designated as the official religion of
 Moldova in the law on religion, it continued to be the strongest religious force and
 exerted significant influence. In December 1992, a group of (primarily ethnic Roma-
 nian) priests broke off from the Moldovan Orthodox Church, which is under the au-
 thority of the Patriarch of Moscow, and received recognition by the Romanian Or-
 thodox Synod as a metropolitanate within the Romanian Orthodox Church. Some
 Moldovan congregations have chosen to join them. The Government, however, has
 not registered the new group, which advocates the union of Moldova with Romania.
 Priests who have joined the "Metropolitanate of Bessarabia-Old Style," as it is
 called, have made credible allegations that local authorities have sometimes har-
 assed them. They also allege that priests remaining with the Russian Orthodox
 group have threatened and harasse them and their congregations, while local po-
 lice have taken no action. Although the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs
 has supported the request of the metropolitanate to be registered, many high gov-
 ernment officials appear to favor the Russian Orthodox group and to support the
 eventual creation of a single Moldovan Orthodox Church, independent of both Rus-
 sia and Romania.
 Protestant groups have increased their ties with coreligionists abroad; foreign
 missionaries are established in Moldova and maintain regular contacts with their
 missions.
 The Jewish community, although small, increased its activities in 1993, and Jew-
 ish leaders report that their relations with the Government and local authorities are
 cooperative. Although there were occasional appearances of anti-Semitic graffiti,
 there was no organized anti-Semitism.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no closed areas or restrictions on travel within Moldova.
 Moldovans generally were able to travel and emigrate freely in 1993. While Soviet
 legislation is still in effect, exit visas, which are still required, are routinely issued
 with passports. Restrictions on emigration remain in force, including the require-
 ment to gain the permission of close relatives in order to emigrate. One Moldovan
 citizen was initially denied the right to emigrate because she could not produce evi-
 dence of the concurrence of her father, who had left the family following a divorce,
 had not had any contact with the daughter for years, and was believed to have left
 Moldova. She was eventually granted permission to emigrate. At least one applicant
 was denied exit permission because he had access to state secrets. Such cases are,
 however, rare.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Parliamentary elections in 1990 and presidential elections in 1991 were Moldova's
 first steps toward permitting a fully functioning democratic system that would allow
 citizens to change their government.
 As a result of frustration with the difficulties experienced by Parliament in resolv-
 ing the most pressing problems facing Moldova, a group of deputies, supported by
 the parliamentary leadership and the President, has called for new elections in ad-
 vance of the end of Parliament's term in 1995. They began a boycott of Parliament
 in September in order to force early elections, which were finally set for February
 27, 1994. Parliament asked international groups to provide technical assistance for
 evaluation of the electoral laws, training of poll watchers, and civic education.
 
 
 The electoral law adopted in October provides for elections on a multiparty basis.
 New presidential elections were also being considered. These new elections will be
 the rst opportunity for the citizens to demonstrate their ability to effect a substan-
 tial change in their government.
 There are no restrictions, in law or practice, on the participation of women in poli-
 tics or government. Women are increasingly represented in important positions in
 ministries, including one Cabinet-level official. Women are also reasonably well rep-
 resented in the judiciary. There are few women in leading positions in political par-
 ties, although a women a party will field a slate of candidates in the February elec-
 tions. About 3 percent of parliamentary seats were held by women in 1993.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A local human rights group, Helsinki Watch, was formed in 1993 and operated
 without governmental interference. While it focused primarily on abuses in the
 Transdniester region by the separatist authorities, it increased its contacts with
 other groups and began to examine more controversial human rights issues, includ-
 ing minority issues.
 Several international human rights groups were active during 1993, with the Gov-
 ernment generally receptive to their activities. Parliament sent draft legislation to
 the American Helsinki Watch, the Council of Europe, and other international orga-
 nizations for expert evaluation.
 The Government welcomed and supported the work of the Conference on Security
 and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which has a mission in the country to assist
 with finding a resolution for the separatist conflict. In January 1993, the Govern-
 ment requested the CSCE to send a mission of experts to investigate and provide
 advice on cur-ent Moldovan legislation and "implementation of minority rifhts and
 interethnic relations." In response, the CSCE's Office of Democratic Initiatives and
 Human Rights (ODIHR) sent a team of experts to Chisinau from January 31 to Feb-
 ruary 4.
 The Tranadniester separatist authorities stated that they will cooperate with the
 CSCE mission. However, on several occasions mission members were impeded from
 traveling freely in the F.!.paratiLt region or threatened by militia or paramilitary
 forces.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Theoretically, women enjoy equal rights under the law. However,
 women are generally underrepresented in government and leadership positions and,
 according to statictics, have been disproportionately affected by Wrowinq unemploy-
 ment. Several women's organizations are active politicafly and in charitable work.
 Women who suffer physical abuse by their husbands have the right to press
 charges; prison sentences may be given to husbands convicted of such abuse (up to
 6 months is not uncommon). Public awareness of the problem of violence in families
 generally is not very high, and no special government programs exist to combat
 spouse abuse.
 According to knowledgeable sources, women do not generally appeal to police or
 the courts for protection against abusive spouses because they -ire embarrassed to
 do so. Police generally do not consider spouse abuse a serious crime, although, when
 cases do reach the cout, they appear to be treated seriously. Spouse abuse is not
 identified by women or legal authorities as a comnion problem.
 Children.-Moldova has extensive legislation designed to protect children, includ-
 ing extended paid maternity leave and government supple'rentary payments for
 families with many children. The health system devotes extensive resources to vac-
 cin.tion programs and child care. No special problems with child abuse were re-
 ported in 1993.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Moldova's citizenship law, adopted in 1990,
 offered an equal opportunity to all persons resident in Moldova at the time of inde-
 pendence to adopt Moldovan citizenship. The CSCE's ODII-iR praised the law as
 eing very liberal The law does not, however, permit dual citizenship except on the
 basis of bilateral agreement. No such agreements were in effect in 1993.
 Moldov has a population of about 4.3 million, of which 65 percent are ethnic Ro-
 nmanians (also called Moldovans). Ukrainians (14 percent) and Russians (13 percent)
 are the two largest minor-ity groups. A Christian Turkic minority, the Gagauz, lives
 primarily in the southern regions. They are largely Russian-speaking andrepresent
 about 3.5 percent of the population. Bulgarians, also mostly Russian speakers, rep-
 resent about 2 percent of the population. About 600,000 people (14 percent of the
 Lotal population) live in the Transdniester region, currently controlled by separatist
 
 
 980
 forces. In this region, about 60 percent of the population is Slavic-speaking and 40
 percent ethnic Romanian.
 While some groups within Moldova continue to advocate unification with Roma-
 nia, this idea has generally lost popularity over the past several years. This in turn
 has led to some improvements in the relations between Romanian speaers and
 Russian speakers. The latter express serious concern about the situation of Russian
 speakers if unification were to take place. The leadership of the separatist
 "Transdniester Moldovan Republic" sought to capitalize on fears of discrimination
 to gin support from the majority Russophone population of the region.
 Although the two sides held negotiations on several levels during 1993, they made
 little progress. In January an 'experts commission," including officials of both sides,
 agrd on a set of basic principles to      uide the negotiations; however, the
 Transdniester "Supreme Soviet" subsequenty rejected these principles. In Novem-
 ber a bipartite commission was formed with the participation of a Russian mediator.
 No results from this effort were reached by year's end.
 In the south, an autonomous Gagauz republic was also proclaimed in 1990. Al-
 though no solution to the conflict with the Gagauz region has yet been found, seri-
 ous negotiations took place during 1993. The Government and parliamentary leader-
 ship prosed a draft law which gained the concurrence of much of the Gagauz lead-
 ership.it would have permitted significant territorial and cultural autonomy and
 would have allowed the Gagauz area to withdraw from Moldova if Moldova united
 with Romania. Parliament, however, rejected this version and prepared its own pro-
 posal, which was sent to the Council of Europe for expert evaluation. This version
 provides for significant cultural autonomy but does not give the Gagauz the right
 to leave Moldova if unification occurs. The draft had not ben voted on by the end
 of the year.
 Language issues remain a source of tension. Before 1989, Russian was the domi-
 nant anguage in Moldova. Moldovans were forced to use the Cyrillic alphabet to
 write vMoldovan" which was officially declared to be a different language from R-
 manian_ althoug they are in fact the same language. In August 1989, the then Su-
 preme Soviet of Moldova ado pted a law making Moldovan (Romanian) the official
 langag of the Republic and replacing the Cyrillic alphabet with the Latin. Al-
 though the law contains significant protection for the use of Russian and other lan-
 guages, it is widely criticized by Russian speakers, who fear that its real intent is
 to drive Russian speakers from the country.
 The principle inherent in the language law is that, in dealing with any official
 or commercial entity, the citizen should pickt to use and the entity
 should be in a position to accommodate him. Officials and employees are therefore
 obligated to know or'nian and Russian (and Gagauz, in the Gagauz regions) "to
 the degree necessi',  . tifill their professional obligations." State enterprises, how-
 ever, are expected to use Roemanian as their working language, unless their local
 authorities obtain approval from the Government to use Russian or another local
 language (e.g., Gagauz). The law sets a deadline of January 1, 1994, for beginning
 to implement these requirements. Implementation of language testing to determine
 whether employees have reached the necessary levels of proficiency in the official
 language, however, was postponed to April 1994 by Parliament.
 Russian speakers have critii fcized the Government for failing to provide sufficient
 support to those who want to learn Romanian. Officials note that they have tried
 to improve the assistance offered (usually to study groups in the workplace), but
 that requests for teachers and manuals have declined.
 Moldova continues to offer Russian-language education through university level,
 although the number of p laces for Russian-speaking students has declined. The
 shortage of buildings for elementary and high schools contributes to the friction sur-
 rounding this issue. Education officials state that Russian will continue to be stud-
 ied at a1 schools and that Romanian instruction in Russian-language schools will
 be improved. Although there is broead acceptance for continuing minority language
 education on the grade school level, there is less support for maintaining Russian-
 language sections in all disciplines at the state university.
 In the Trandniester region, the separatist authorities have decreed that all
 schools must return to usinge t     l       b    rthe n  oldovan"    guage,
 which they insist is a different language from Romanian. Authorities hafe inttnsi-
 fsed efforts, begun last year, to confiscate textbooks in Romanian and have dis-
 missed or threatened to dismiss teachers who oppose this policy. A number of stu-
 dents and teachers have protested, including by boycotting classes.
 People with Disabiities.-While there is no legal discrimination against people
 with disabilities, there are no laws providing for accessibility for them, and there
 are few government resources devoted to training people with disabilities. The Gov-
 ernment does provide tax advantages to charitable groups that assist the disabled.
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1990 Soviet law on trade unions, which was en-
 dorsed by Moldova's then Supreme Soviet and is still in effect, provides for inde-
 pendent trade unions. Moldovan parliamentary decisions in 1989 and 1991, which
 give citizens the right to form all kinds of social organizations, also provide a legal
 "is for the formation of independent unions. However, there have been no known
 attempts to establish alternate trade union structures independent of the successor
 to the previously existing official organizations which were part of the Soviet trade
 union system.
 The successor organization, which at the republic level is called the Federation
 of Independent Trade Unions of Moldova (FITU), broke with the Moscow-based Gen-
 eral Confederation of Trade Unions in 1992. The FITU's continuing role in manag-
 ing the state insurance system and its retention of previously existing official union
 headquarters and tourist facilities provide an inherent advantage over any new-
 comers who might wish to form a union outside its structure. However, its indus-
 trial or branch unions are developing as more independent entities, maintaining
 that their membership in the FITU is voluntary and that they can withdraw if they
 wish. Several threatened to withdraw in 1992 in a successful effort to block the elec-
 tion of a former Communist party secretary to its presidency.
 The FITU has insisted on the right to have union representatives involved in the
 negotiations to set the minimum wage. It has opposed government measures to
 raise prices before back salaries were paid. In these matters, it has begun to leave
 behind its role as an accessory of the Communist party and to work on securing bet-
 ter treatment for workers.
 Government workers do not have the right to strike, nor do those in essential
 services such as health care and energy. Other unions may strike if two-thirds of
 their members vote for a strike in a secret ballot. There was a 1-day strike by trol-
 leybus drivers in November. The Government considered this strike-by public work-
 ers illegal. The strike ended after the Government offered a small wage increase
 and pledged to discuss working conditions.
 Unions may affiliate and maintain contacts with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Moldovan labor law, which
 is still based on former Soviet legislation, provides for collective bargaining rights,
 but collective bargaining is only just beginning. There were no known collective bar-
 gaining agreements in 1993.
 There were no reports of actions taken against union members for union activi-
 ties. The 1990 Soviet law on trade unions provides that union leaders may not be
 fired from their jobs while in leadership positions or for a period after they leave
 those positions. This law has not been tested in Moldova. There are no export proc-
 easing zones in Moldova.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is not
 specifically prohibited; there were no instances reported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 under unrestricted conditions is 18. Employment of those aged 16 to 18 is permitted
 under special conditions, including shorter workdays, no night shifts, and longer va-
 cations. The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection is primarily responsible for en-
 forcing these restrictions, and the Ministry of Health also has a role. Child labor
 is not used in Moldovan industry, though children living on farms do sometimes as-
 sist in the agricultural sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum monthly wage, although it was
 more than tripled during the year, did not keep pace with inflation. It does not pro-
 vide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. At the end of November,
 the minimum monthly wage was about $3 (10,000 rubles, or 10 Moldovan lei in the
 new currency introduced then). The Labor Code establishes a workweek of 41 hours,
 including at least 1 day off weekly.
 The State is required to set and check safety standards in the workplace. The
 unions within the FITU also have inspection personnel who have a right to stop
 work in the factory or fine the enterprise if safety standards are not met. In prac-
 tice, however, the declining economic situation has led enterprises to economize on
 safety equipment and generally to show less concern for worker safety issues.
