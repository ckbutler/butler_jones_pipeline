 ETHIOPIA
 In Ethiopia, serious violations of individual rights
 and civil and political liberties take place amidst a
 restructured economic and social system which has
 improved the basic living conditions of the great
 majority of the country's poor. Human rights were not
 always respected during the reign of Emperor Haile
 Selassie nor did institutions which seek to protect the
 rights of individuals or groups of citizens flourish in
 the decades preceding the 1974 revolution. The level
 of human rights abuses increased dramatically thereafter
 as the Provisional Military Government of Socialist
 Ethiopia (PMGSE) consolidated its political control.
 The atmosphere has been affected by violent political
 opposition movements, pressures generated by wars on
 two fronts and various insurrectionist activities.
 In the last year and a half, the PMGSE has launched
 extensive campaigns of repression against its internal
 enemies, most notably the "Red Terror" drive of December
 1977 to April 1978 -- an intense, widespread campaign
 of violence and terror instigated and encouraged by the
 PMGSE. Amnesty International in its report published
 in November, 1978 stated that this campaign resulted in
 from several thousands to perhaps tens of thousands of
 killed, tortured and imprisoned, including men, women
 and children among its victims. In the absence of hard
 statistical information, the Department of State
 estimates that the number of those killed was about
 3,000 thousand people. These campaigns primarily
 affected urban dwellers, especially in Addis Ababa. In
 contrast, the Ethiopian peasants, who make up at least
 85 percent of the total population, not only suffered
 less from the repressions but have gained economically
 since the revolution. Over 250,000 peasants are being
 moved from infertile areas of chronic starvation (such
 as Welo and Tigray) to underpopulated areas in the
 south. It is possible that much smaller numbers are
 being relocated to settle in the predominantly Somali-
 inhabited Ogaden.

 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Numerous allegations of torture were reported during
 the period of the "Red Terror" from December 1977 to
 April 1978. Such charges are plausible in light of the
 PMGSE's overall efforts to eliminate opposing political
 movements, although they have not yet been verified.
 The number of such allegations has diminished in the
 last few months of 1978.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 An estimated 1,500 to 2,000 people in Addis Ababa were
 shot by armed Kebele (neighborhood associations) squads
 or by one of several other military and para-military
 organizations, perhaps without specific PMGSE approval.
 This campaign was directed against the Ethiopian
 People's Revolutionary Party (EPRP), a rival leftist
 organization. However, at least several thousand
 innocent men, women and teenagers are believed (there
 is no way to develop accurate numbers) by some to have
 been murdered country-wide as rivalries and personal
 scores were also settled. The death toll among young
 people, including school children, was substantial.
 Nightly killings during the "Red Terror" period averaged
 at least ten to twenty and may have risen on occasion
 as high as several hundred. The EPRP was, in turn,
 responsible for a concerted campaign of assassination
 of government officials during the same and preceding
 periods. In late 1977 hardly a week passed without
 some official being killed by EPRP assassins. By
 September 1978 there were still incidents of sporadic
 gunfire in Addis Ababa, but the "Red Terror" had ended.
 Most summary executions since the end of the "Red
 Terror" have not been of civilians but rather of
 soldiers (by the hundreds) to maintain military discip-
 line or in smaller numbers occasioned by power struggles
 within the political and military elite in Addis
 Ababa.
 Until the latter part of 1978 prison conditions were
 understood to be thoroughly inadequate for the many
 
 
 thousands who were detained. Since available prisons
 were filled, prisoners were frequently held in ordinary
 houses in which a few rooms were set aside as detention
 cells. Cells were frequently so crowded that it was
 impossible to sleep or even sit. These makeshift
 prisons often lacked sanitary facilities. Thousands
 have been released since the height of the Red Terror,
 and the Kebele prisons are much less crowded now; many
 are nearly empty. Conditions in the palace prison for
 important political prisoners are understood to be
 poor, but to judge from the few reports available,
 conditions in the major police prison are not parti-
 cularly objectionable.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 At the beginning of 1978, arbitrary arrests were
 widespread. An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 were detain-
 ed for various periods of time between December 1977
 and April 1978. In the latter part of 1978 arbitrary
 arrests still occurred but much less frequently. The
 Department of State is aware of several cases of
 persons arbitrarily detained on the basis of anonymous
 reports, but released a few days later for lack of
 evidence.
 d. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 Individuals arrested on political and criminal grounds
 are frequently denied legal process. Investigations
 are conducted by government entities responsible to the
 Provisional Military Administrative Council (PMAC), the
 PMGSE's political directorate. Arrested individuals
 can then be released, imprisoned further or executed
 without due process or explanation. There are no
 restraints on or recourse against such actions, given
 the absence of due process.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 During the "Red Terror" campaign, house-to-house
 searches Viere normal practice as soldiers or Kebele
 squads sought political opponents as well as weapons,
 anti-regime political literature, and goods such as
 binoculars and typewriters. Often families were
 arrested and taken from their houses in the middle of
 
 
 55
 the night. The level of this kind of abuse has since
 declined, but individuals still have no legal guarantees
 of security in their homes.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 It is the stated policy of the PMGSE to improve the
 political, social and economic condition of the Ethio-
 pian masses. Its efforts at implementation have,
 however, been disrupted by revolution and war. The
 PMSGE seeks to assure a more equitable distribution of
 income and wealth and to restructure the economy to
 favor those disadvantaged under the old regime, i.e.,
 the overwhelming mass of landless peasants and the
 lowly paid or unemployed urban dwellers. Large private
 estates have been nationalized for farming by small
 individual farmers. Wage policies seek to reduce top
 pay levels and increase those at the bottom.
 The most dramatic improvements have taken place among
 the peasantry., which comprises over 85 percent of the
 Ethiopian population. The Government's sweeping land
 reform of 1974-75, the increase in prices paid to
 farmers and the encouragement of farmers' associations
 have dramatically improved the lot of this vast majority.
 Incomes have risen, food availability has increased and
 control by the peasants over their means of livelihood
 has been granted. Indications are, however, that the
 Government has begun to enforce controls upon farmers
 in the south as to the timing, quantity, and price of
 their grain sales, and that these controls are leading
 to serious friction. Beginning in 1975, large increases
 in capital budgets of the agriculture and health
 sectors resulted in more service in rural areas.
 Education also is much more accessible to the rural
 peasantry than before the revolution. The enrollment
 at Addis Ababa University is scheduled to double in the
 1978-79 school year. However, new criteria for admis-
 sions into post-secondary institutions, designed to
 help children of the working class, appear to place
 political reliability over academic merit in choosing
 applicants. Overall, income inequities, maldistribu-
 tion of benefits, urban crime and corruption have been
 substantially reduced by the PMGSE.

 Further advances confront difficulties. Most develop-
 ment programs are aimed at aiding the rural poor.
 However, given the scarce resources available to the
 PMGSE and the high level of military expenditure
 resulting from involvement in two wars, little progress
 was possible in 1978. The situation of the urban
 dweller has probably worsened. Such staple items as
 food grains, cooking oil, sugar, and soap are in short
 supply. Remedial actions (opening neighborhood
 stores, price controls, measures against hoarding) have
 been partially effective in overcoming the shortages.
 In December 1978, the Government inaugurated a major
 coordinated campaign to alleviate Ethiopia's economic
 difficulties, particularly in the areas of food produc-
 tion and distribution. The PMGSE appears to be deter-
 mined to achieve rapid and far-reaching results in this
 area.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of religion for the non-Christian majority of
 Ethiopia has been enlarged since the revolution.
 Freedom of thought, speech, press and assembly enjoy no
 legal guarantees and are not tolerated in any instance
 in which they conflict with PMGSE policy. Moreover, as
 noted above, educational policies predicate access to
 higher education upon students' political loyalties and
 social origins. Additionally, political cadres have
 been placed in secondary schools to ensure political
 conformity  of students. Secondary school curricula
 have been revised along Marxist-Leninist lines.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Roadblocks and searches by military and provincial
 authorities and by farmers' and neighborhood associa-
 tions complicate travel in rural areas. Permission to
 travel is generally subject to government approval, but
 on the whole, internal travel seems relatively unhinder-
 ed except in combat zones and military maneuver areas.
 
 
 Foreign travel and emigration have both been reduced as
 a matter of policy. People may travel on business or
 to study but the required exit permits are difficult to
 obtain. Permission to emigrate is restricted to a few
 humanitarian cases.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political activity is under the complete control of the
 PMAC, which tolerates no opposition. There is no
 parliament. Participation in national political life
 is impossible except as a member of one of the three
 semi-legitimate parties, and those parties serve only
 to implement PMAC policy. Mass organizations (labor,
 peasants and others) sponsored by the PMAC serve the
 same purpose as the parties. Nevertheless, many more
 people are integrated in some participatory activity
 than ever before.
 On the local level there has been a substantial increase
 in political activity since the pre-revolutionary days.
 The PMGSE has permitted many uneducated, formerly
 powerless workers and farmers to form a variety of
 associations, adjudicate local disputes, press for
 improved labor conditions and manage local development
 efforts. These associations have real power on the
 local level. However, participation in the associations
 is mandatory. They often act as instruments of coercion;
 they played a prominent role in the "Red Terror"
 campaign. The PMAC has moved to break the Amhara
 dominance of public life which held sway prior to the
 revolution. There are increasing indications that
 formerly subjugated ethnic groups or peoples within
 Ethiopia exercise a greater role in national life.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Government Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Ethiopian Government rejects such investigations
 on the ground that they constitute unwarranted interfer-
 ence in its internal affairs. The PMGSE claims that
 the human rights enjoyed by the Ethiopian masses have
 improved considerably since the revolution. It dismisses
 the concept of "individual human rights" as irrelevant
 to a revolutionary Government which is building a
 Marxist society.
