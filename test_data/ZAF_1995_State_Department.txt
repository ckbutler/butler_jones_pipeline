 SOUTH AFRICA
 In 1995 South Africa's governing institutions and civil society began to consolidate
 the changes initiated after the historic 1994 national elections which marked the
 end of more than 300 years of white-minority rule. In the next phase of the coun-
 try's democratic transition, most areas held local government elections in November,
 the first democratic selection of local officials. Ministers from three major parties,
 the African National Congress (ANC), the National Party (NP), and the Inkatha
 Freedom Party (IFP) form the Cabinet of the Government of National Unity (GNU)
 headed by President Nelson Mandela. The Cabinet has functioned exceptionally
 smoothly, with almost every decision approved by consensus after lengthy debate
 and compromise. In Parliament the three major parties plus the Democratic Party
 (DP), the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), the Freedom Front (FF), and the African
 Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) compose the 400-seat National Assembly and
 the 90-seat Senate. Parliament has changed from being a rubber stamp to its new
 role as the chief forum of national political debate. The Government currently oper-
 ates under an Interim Constitution. However, the Constitutional Assembly (the Na-
 tional Assembly and Senate sitting jointly) is in the process of producing a final con-
 stitution by May 1996. The judiciary is independent.
 The South African National Defense Force (SANDF) and the South African Police
 Service (SAPS) have undergone monumental changes. Although they remain power-
 ful and influential, they are answerable to civilian leadership to a far greater degree
 than under the former government. Despite initial disturbances over pay, living con-
 ditions, and grades, 20,000 former members of Umkhonto We Sizwe (MK), the
 ANC's military wing;, 6,000 former members of the Aanian People's Liberation
 Army (APLA), the armed wing of the PAC; and 9,000 members of the former home-
 land armies have been successfully integrated with the 65,000 member government
 defense forces. The integration brought the total SANDF forces to approximately
 100,000. However, the military leadership has begun to reduce this number to be-
 tween 65,000 and 75,000 through voluntary and involuntary resignations and retire-
 ments. The SAPS totals 120,000, having assimilated 30,000 police from the former
 homelands. Some members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 South Africa has a diversified and productive economy with strong agricultural,
 mining, and industrial sectors. In 1994 the manufacturing sector contribtedjust
 under 25 percent to a gross domestic product of $120.2 billion. Unequal opportuni-
 ties and disproportionate government spending over the years have resulted in ilit-
 eracy, high unemployment, and other social ills among the black majority. The offi-
 cial unemployment rate in the formal sector is approximately 32 percent but may
 actually be over 40 percent. Over 60 percent of the balack population is either totally
 without work or employed in the informal sector.
 South Africa's democratically elected government has demonstrated a deep com-
 mitment to human rights, and the country's newly independent judiciary has pro-
 tected those rights. Peient Mandela appointed a government Human Rights
 Commission in September which is specially charged wi~th ensuring that these pro-
 tections are respected in fact. In order to foster national reconciliation, a Truth and
 Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has been created with the power to investigate
 apartheid-era human rights abuses, compensate victims, and grant amnesty or in-
 demnity for many politically-motivated crimes. Although the pace of social change
 was very slow, Parliament passed a series of bills designed to alleviate discrimina-
 tion. The Labor Relations Act, the South African Police Service Bill, the Land Ten-
 ure Bill, the Gender Equality Bill, the Censorship Bill, and the Abolition of the
 Death Penalty Bill were all intended to eliminate legal bias against specific sectors
 of the population.
 Some members of the security forces reportedly occasionally tortured and abused
 detainees; 189 persons died in police custody. Political violence, while down substan-
 tially since the April 1994 national elections, was on the increase again in KwaZului
 
 
 242
 
 Natal. As the year progressed, ANC/IFP rivalry continued to claim many lives in
 KwaZulu/Natal but did not spread to any significant degree to other parts of the
 country. Discrimination and violence against women and violence against children
 continued to be serious problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajud icial Killing.-The number of political and
 extrajudicial killings ontinued to derease, following the general trend after the
 April 1994 nationai elections. The Human Rights Committee (NRC), a nongovern-
 mental organization (NGO), reported that political violence resulted in 1,195 deaths
 in 1995, less than half the 2,687 reported by the NRC in 1994. The South African
 Institute for Race Relations (SAIlR) figure is 1,044 fatalities as a result of political
 violence in 1995. In November the NRC reported the lowest monthly number of po-
 litically related deaths (54) sine it beg an keeping such figures in 1990.
 Despite this general decline, politically related deaths in the troubled province of
 KwaZulu/Natal continued to constitute the vast majority of such incidents nation-
 wide, reflecting continuing ANC-IFP rivalry in that region. The HRC reports that
 835 of 1,195 deaths from political violence occurred in KwaZulu/Natal. A downward
 trend towards year's end was reversed in December, when 74 people died in the
 province as a result of political violence. Thirty-seven of these were slain in four
 separate massacres, including one on Christmas day in Shobashobane in which 19
 people died.
 Deaths in police custody remain a matter of concern. The HRC has acknowledged
 that this category was severely underreported in the past due to a lack of informa-
 tion but that the SAPS now provides statistics in this area. Through the end of Sop-
 temier, SAPS reported 189 deaths in police custody (excluding natural causes). Of
 these, SAPS reported 102 died as a result of injuries inflicted by the police during
 or after arrest, 27 died as a result of injuries inflicted by the public during or after
 arrest, and 40 were suicides.
 There were no new reports of politically motivated killings attributed to rightwing
 organizations. However, there were scattered reports of racially motivated murders
 committed by individuals allegedly affiliated with such organizations. The murder
 trial of retired SAP Colonel Eugene de Kock, who commanded a police unit allegedly
 used for "third force" activities, continued. Evidence presented at the trial linked de
 Kock and other former officials to political murders and other crimes. For proce-
 dural reasons, the trial of the 26 Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) members
 accused of carrying out a preelection bombing campaign has been postponed until
 February 1996. As of September, one individual reportedly suspected of involvement
 in the 1994 assassination of former Dutch Reformed Church moderator Johan
 Heyns remains in custody on unrelated charges; however, no charges have been
 filed in the Heyns case to date.
 Former Defense Minister Magnus Malan and 19 codefendants will go on trial in
 March 1996 on murder charges arising from the 1987 massacre of 13 persons near
 Durban. Malan's coaccused include former senior officers of the SANDF's prede-
 cessor organization, the South African Defense Force (SADF), officials from the IFP,
 and from the KwaZulu police. The massacre allegedly was carried out by an IFP
 paramilitary unit created and trained by the SADF while Malan was defense min-
 ister. Malan has denied the charges and vowed not to seek amnesty from the TRC.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no new reports of politically motivated disappear-
 ances caused by government authorities or agents. The TRC, appointed in late 1995,
 is empowered to investigate a broad range of political disappearances that occurred
 since 1960. These investigations, scheduled to begin by early 1996, are intended to
 throw light on the circumstances surrounding several disappearances during the
 apartheid period.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Interim Constitution stipulates that "no person shall be subject to torture of
 any kind, whether physical, mental, or emotional, nor shall any person be subject
 to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment." Courts have been active
 in enforcing these provisions, and broad efforts to reform police practices have large-
 ly curbed such activities.
 However, there were scattered but credible reports of police abusing detainees
 while in custody. Monitoring organizations have reported: threats to the life of a de-
 tainee with a drawn weapon, electric shocks to the body (including the extremities
 and the genitalia), simple assaults, and ejection from a moving vehicle. In February,
 according to a report compiled by the Independent Board of Inquiry, members of the
 SAPS Brixton Murder and Robbery Unit in Johannesburg allegedly assaulted and
 
 
 tortured a security guard suspected of involvement in a bank robbery. The HRC re-
 ported an incident in which members of the SANDF allegedly detained and as-
 saulted 10 men in Loskop, KwaZulu/Natal, after they were arrested for possession
 of two unlicensed weapons, as well as a similar incident in Kwamashu, KwaZulu/
 Natal.
 The SAPS has undergone sweeping and positive changes under the leadership of
 Commissioner George Fivaz, appointed by President Mandela in January. Fivaz in-
 stituted reforms designed to create partnerships between local police forces and the
 communities they serve. He also demilitarized the force, substituting civilian titles
 for military ranks, and has emphasized the "service" role of the police. Resignations
 and retirements of senior police officials have permitted the infusion of new blood
 at senior levels from both inside and outside the SAPS. These appointments have
 also contributed toward achieving affirmative action goals within the SAPS.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards and the Government
 permits unannounced visits by human rights monitors. In February the Government
 signed an agreement providing the International Committee of the Red Cross access
 to detainees held by or on behalf of SAPS without prior notice, formalizing a work-
 ing arrangement which had been in place since October 1992.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Interim Constitution expressly pro-
 hibits detention without trial. It also provides that every "detained person" has a
 number of other rights, including the right to be informed promptly of the reasons
 for detention; to be charged within 48 hours of arrest; to be detained in conditions
 of human dignity; to consult with legal counsel at every stage of the legal process;
 to communicate with relatives, medical practitioners, and religious counselors; and
 to be released with or without bail, unless the interests of justice require otherwise.
 In September President Mandela signed into law a statute which makes it some-
 what more difficult for persons accused of certain very serious crimes to obtain bail
 by placing the burden on the accused-rather than the prosecution-to demonstrate
 that bail is in the interests of justice. At year's end, courts and police were generally
 acting in good faith to respect these rights.
 There were no reports of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent and
 impartial judiciary subject only to the Constitution and the law. The 11 justices of
 the new Constitutional Court, South Africa's supreme judicial body, were sworn in
 by President Mandela on February 14. The Court began hearing cases the next day
 and early on moved to establish its independent authority. In its second ruling, the
 Court abolished capital punishment, a decision which was in line with ANC policy
 but harshly criticized by other political parties and reportedly contrary to wide-
 spread public opinion. In September the Court overturned one section of a statute
 governing local elections. This marked the Court's first major ruling against the
 le ; e   of National Unity, further establishing the Court's independ-
 ence. Drawing on its powers of judicial review, court rulings have also limited the
 use of ]polce-compelled confessions, banned the use of corporal punishment in the
 crimina1 justice system, upheld the right to state-provided counsel, and guaranteed
 access to police documents.
 While the precise relationship between the Constitutional Court and the Appellate
 Division ofthe Supreme Court (which was formerly the countiy's supreme judicial
 body) remains unclear, the interim Constitution makes the former the highest court
 in interpreting constitutional issues; the latter remains supreme in all others.
 Judges try criminal cases; the jury system was abolished in 1969. Serious offenses
 are tried in the Supreme Court, while magistrates, who are career civil servants,
 hear lesser offenses. The presiding judge or magistrate determines guilt or inno-
 cence.
 The Constitution's section on fundamental rights provides for due process, includ-
 ing the right to a fair, public trial within a reasonable time of being charged and
 the right to appeal to a higher court. It also gives detained persons a right to state-
 funded legal counsel when "substantial injustice would otherwise result."
 The Government and legal bodies have acted to redress historic racial and gender
 imbalances in the judiciary and the bar. The ranks of judges, magstrates, senior
 counsels, and attorneys are now more reflective of society, although still far short
 of a representative composition.
 There were no reports of political prisoners. Some persons remained incarcerated
 for common crimes which they claim were committed for political reasons.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.tPolice
 and security forces retain the legal authority to engage in domestic surveillance ac-
 tivities. Most observers believe that use ththis authority generally has been limited
 to the pursuit of legitimate law enforcement and national security activities. At
 year's e    evidence emerged of wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping of senior
 
 
 244
 police officials and a government minister, although the identities and motives of
 the perpetrators remain unclear.
 In July the Government selected judges for the Constitutional Land Court estab-
 lished to adjudicate claims of persons dispossessed and removed from land during
 the apartheid era. Several thousand land claims have already been lodged with the
 Commission on Restitution of Land Rights which has been set up to process, inves-
 tigate, and attempt to settle claims. Decisions will be referred to the court for ap-
 proval, and complex claims will be heard and decided by the Court. The deadline
 or lodging claims is May 1997, and the Court must complete its work within 5
 years.
 Unauthorized land invasions by squatters also continued sporadically throughout
 the year, a practice severely criticized by the Government as inimical to the housing
 strategy it devised as part of its Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. The press criti-
 cizes both the Government and the opposition.
 The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) controls all broadcast tele-
 vision and most radio. Once seen as the Government's mouthpiece, the SABC is in
 the midst of an historic reorganization and change of direction. Under the leader-
 ship of a new board of directors and top-level management, the SABC became a lab-
 oratory for the Government's push for affirmative action in hiring and promotions.
 At the same time, the SABC is carefully building and protecting editorial independ-
 ence from the Government. In May the SABC turned down a government request
 for weekly 30-minute prime time slots on television and radio. The Government ac-
 cepted this display of independence, having declared publicly that it would not at-
 tempt to use the SABC as an instrument of official propaganda. SABC news pro-
 gramming offered balanced coverage of the Government and the leading opposition
 parties, although the smaller opposition parties regularly complained of insufficient
 coverage of their activities.
 The Independent Broadcast Authority (IBA) began to effect major changes in the
 electronic media. The IBA granted 80 licenses for community radio broadcasters and
 approximately 40 stations began broadcasting in 1995. The IBA also released its
 "Triple Inquiry Report" in August, calling for dissolution of the SABC's television
 monopoly and a further diminution of the SABC's primacy in radio. While the IBA
 report established local content quotas for the electronic media, its fundamental ef-
 fect was to begin to bring real competition to the country's airwaves for the first
 time in history.
 Although rarely invoked, considerable legislation remained on the books that per-
 mits the Government to restrict the publication of information about the police, the
 national defense forces, prisons, and mental institutions. Other legislation still in
 effect, though not invoke, can compel reporters to reveal their sources. NGO's, no-
 tably the Freedom of Expression Institute, actively work for the repeal of these laws
 and for ironclad guarantees of press freedom in the permanent Constitution.
 There were no instances of government or police sanctioned harassment of the
 press, nor of systematic attempts by political organiations to intimidate the media.
 There are no official restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Political parties and organiza-
 tions exercise broad constitutional freedoms of assembly and association.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Interim Constitution provides for freedom of religion,
 and the Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Interim Constitution provides for freedom of movement, including
 travel abroad, choice of residence, and safeguards on citizenship. The Government
 of National Unity has not restricted the movement of citizens domestically or their
 freedom to travel overseas, emigrate, or repatriate.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has largely com-
 leted its efforts to assist with the repatriation of South African exiles under its
 September 1991 mandate. On May 15, the United Nations acted to end the refugee
 status afforded to South Africans abroad. The Government cooperates with the
 UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 In some cases, however, energetic efforts to combat illegal immigration resulted
 in wrongful deportations. In at least one instance, Mozambicans claiming refugee
 status, including some with proper documentation, were wrongfully detained and
 deported by the SANDF. In this instance, the Department of Home Affairs (DHA)
 in Pretoria admitted its error and acted to prevent any such recurrence by providing
 additional training for SANDF and immigration officers. In 1995 the UNHCR has
 
 
 245
 trained over 300 government officials from the SAPS, the SANDF, and the DHA to
 improve their understanding of the rights and protections afforded refugees. In addi-
 tion, the DHA joined with the UNHCR to train members of the DHA committees
 that rule on applications for refugee status, shortening the time applicants wait for
 a ruling on their refugee status to an average of 6 months.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 South Africa is governed under an Interim Constitution which allows for executive
 power sharing among political parties, based on the proportion of the vote they re-
 ceived in South Africa s first nonracial election in April 1994. It provides for a bi-
 cameral parliament, an executive state president, and an independent judiciary
 which, for the first time, includes a Constitutional Court. All citizens over 18 years
 of ag were permitted to vote in the election.
 The Parliament comprises the National Assembly and the Senate, and, when in
 joint session, serves as the Constitutional Assembly. According to the Interim Con-
 stitution, the Constitutional Assembly is required to draft andt approve a new and
 permanent constitution which is consistent with 34 constitutional principles by May
 9, 1996. If it fails to do so and absent a constitutional amendment extending the
 deadline, Parliament will be dissolved, and a new election held. By year's end,
 delays in the drafting process had led to consideration of postponement of the dead-
 line for approval; a decision on this matter was expected in early 1996.
 The National Assembly is made up of 400 members elected by a system of propor-
 tional representation. Of the 19 parties which stood for election, 7 received enough
 votes to gain seats in the Assembly. The Senate consists of 90 members, 10 from
 each of the 9 provinces created under the Constitution. With a few exceptions, the
 Senate has coequal legislative powers with the National Assembly. The legislature
 may approve, amend, or rewrite legislation submitted by the Cabinet for consider-
 ation.
 In addition to President Mandela, who is the Executive Head of State, South Afri-
 ca has two Executive Deputy Presidents, Thabo Mbeki, from the ANC, and F.W. de
 Klerk, the former president, from the NP. A constitutional amendment created an
 additional 28th cabinet seat beyond the original maximum of 27 seats provided for
 in the Interim Constitution. Under the terms of the Interim Constitution, any party
 holding at least 20 seats in the Assembly is entitled to a proportional share of cabi-
 net seats. The ANC, which gained 252 seats, shares cabinet positions with the NP
 which has 82 seats and with the IFP which holds 43 seats. According to the Interim
 Constitution, the Cabinet must in the first instance seek consensus. To date in prac-
 tice, the Cabinet has generally functioned on that basis, although there have been
 concerns about the coordination and effectiveness of the established bureaucracies
 in carrying out the policies of the new political leadership.
 The Interim Constitution provides for a Constitutional Court whose responsibility
 is to interpret, defend, and enforce the Constitution. The Court has the power to
 overturn any law or executive act that it deems unconstitutional. Chapter three of
 the Constitution delineates over 25 fundamental rights of a citizen which it is the
 Court's duty to protect. The Constitutional Court must also rule on whether the na-
 tional constitution or any of the provincial constitutions are consistent with the con-
 stitutional principles in the Interim Constitution.
 Transitional authorities continued to administer local governments throughout
 South Africa for the first part of 1995, in preparation for the country's first demo-
 cratic local government elections. Legislation was passed in September to allow
 these elections to be held on staggered dates. Most areas of the country conducted
 voting on November 1 to elect representatives to nearly 700 local councils. Despite
 a number of logistical problems, elections proceeded peacefully and the results were
 generally accepted by all parties. Disputes over demarcation of boundaries and other
 issues forced postponement of elections in the Cape Town Metropolitan Area,
 KwaZuluiNatal, and a few other scattered districts. Elections in these areas are now
 scheduled to be completed by the end of May 1996.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government and poli-
 tics. President Mandela has publicly stated that he is committed to ensuring ade-
 quate representation of women in all aspects of governance. Nearly one third of the
 National Assembly members are women; there are 18 women in the 90-member
 Senate, and a woman was elected Speaker of the National Assembly. However,
 women are less well represented in the Cabinet, where only 3 out of 28 ministers
 are women. There are no women among the nine provincial premiers. In an effort
 to increase female representation in the political sphere, the ANC set a goal of 50
 percent female candidates for its November 1 local government elections lists, al-
 though that figure was not reached in some cases.
 
 
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 During 1995 Parliament passed and President Mandela signed into law legislation
 creating a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, empowered: to look into apartheid-
 era gross human rights abuses dating from 1960; to grant indemnity or amnesty to
 perpetrators of a broad range of politically-motivated crimes; and to award com-
 pensation to victims of human rights abuses. After nominations from a broad range
 of public and private organizations, Mandela named the members of the TRC in late
 1995. The investigations of this body are expected to shed light on a broad range
 of abuses that occurred before South Africa's democratic transition in 1994.
 President Mandela also named the members of the newly created Human Rights
 Commission in September, drawing from a broad spectrum of civil society. The Com-
 mission is tasked with promoting the observance of fundamental human rights at
 all levels of government and throughout the general population. The commissioners
 may conduct investigations, issue subpoenas, hear testimony under oath, and assist
 individuals wrongly deprived of fundamental rights to seek redress.
 In June the Parliament appointed an individual to fill the Office of Public Protec-
 tor, who will be responsible for investigating abuse and maladministration by the
 Government.
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views. Many of these organizations
 are now represented on governmental bodies seeking to gather public input and to
 fashion policies related to human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution explicitly prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, gender,
 ethnic or social origin, color, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience,
 belief, culture, or language.
 Women.-There is a high rate of domestic violence against women. According to
 a study by People Opposing Women Abuse, the figures for reported rape rose from
 19,308 to 27,056 between 1988 and 1993, an increase of 40 percent. Unofficial esti-
 mates by the National Institute for Crime Prevention and Rehabilitation of Offend-
 ers suggests that only 1 in 20 rapes is reported to police.
 Discrimination against women, particularly against black women, remains a seri-
 ous problem despite legal and constitutional advances and government attention to
 this issue.
 South Africa ratified the 1981 U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
 of Discrimination Against Women on December 15.
 The Interim Constitution provides for the establishment of a Commission for Gen-
 der Equality, which will advise and make recommendations to Parliament on legis-
 lation which affects women. The Commission was not yet in place by year's end, al-
 though it is slated to be considered early in the 1996 parliamentary session.
 A team of South African experts on gender has urged the Government to create
 an Office on the Status of Women to ensure tht a gender perspective is integrated
 into all publicly funded policies and programs. The Government is now looking into
 how the office could be incorporated. The team recommended that the OSW be lo-
 cated in the President's office to give it political influence, and Deputy President
 Mbeki indicated in a press conference that the office might be in operation by the
 end of March 1996.
 South Africa has now officially ended tax discrimination against married women.
 However, discrimination against women in traditional law continues. For example,
 women's groups continue to press for legislation to protect women in customary
 marriages.
 The Government has made a concerted effort in several areas to increase women's
 participation in governance and heighten awareness of women's issues.
 Children.-The Interim Constitution stipulates that children have the right "to
 security, basic nutrition, and basic health and social services." Although the Govern-
 ment is committed to providing these services and to correcting past race-based im-
 balances, it is still developing the mechanisms for delivering necessary services.
 Special programs known as "Presidential Initiatives" because the reflect President
 Mandela's personal interest are part of the Reconstruction and Development Pro-
 gram. They offer free health care to pregnant mothers and children under 6 years
 of age, and provide nutritious meals for primary school children. Following Presi-
 dent Mandela's criticism last year of keeping unsentenced children in jail, the Cor-
 rectional Services Act was amended to prohibit the detention of children younger
 than 18 in jail or police cells. Arrested children must now either be released into
 
 
 247
 the custody of their parents or kept in a "place of safety" as defined by the Child
 Care Act.
 Violence against children remains widespread and likely underreported. The
 Goldstone Commission investigating the effects of violence on children released a re-
 port stating that South Africa had become a "child-abusing" society and that vio-
 lence had come to be expected. Many NGO's, such as the National Children's Rights
 Committee, are working to enhance the quality of life of South Africa's children.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is tradition-
 ally practiced in some remote areas of South Africa, but the practice is not thought
 to be widespread.
 People With Disabilities.-The Interim Constitution and Bill of Fundamental
 Rights include disability as a basis for nondiscrimination. South African society con-
 tinues to promote an increasingly modern concept of people with disabilities as a
 minority whose civil rights must be protected.
 In 1986 the NP government incorporated architectural specifications into the Na-
 tional Building Code to ensure equal access to public buildings for the physically
 disabled. However, these have rarely been enforced and until recently, public aware-
 ness of them was virtually nonexistent. The National Environmental Accessibility
 Program, an NGO whose affiliated members comprise disabled consumer as well as
 service-provider groups, has now established a presence in all nine provinces in
 order to lobby for compliance with the regulations and to sue offending property
 owners, as necessary.
 De facto government and private sector discrimination in employment still exists,
 given the wide discretion allowed managers in hiring practices. The Government is
 attempting to ensure that all RDP projects take account of the needs of disabled
 citizens.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-The Government has theoretically elimi-
 nated all forms of racial discrimination with the adoption of the Interim Constitu-
 tion and the Bill of Fundamental Rights and the near total repeal of the race-based
 statutes of the apartheid era. It has also begun reorganizing and redesigning the
 educational, housing and health-care systems to benefit all racial and ethnic groups
 in society more equally. The public and private sectors continue to pursue a vigorous
 program of affirmative action, which is expressly permitted under terms of the In-
 terim Constitution.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Freedom of association is guaranteed by the Interim
 Constitution and given statutory effect by the recently approved Labor Relations Act
 (LRA). All workers in the private sector are entitledto join a union. Most workers
 in the public sector, with the exception of members of the South African National
 Defense Force, the National Intelligence Agency, and the South African Secret Serv-
 ice, are also entitled to join a union. No employee can be fired or prejudiced because
 of membership in or advocacy of a trade union. There are 201 registered trade
 unions and 47 unregistered trade unions, with an approximate total membership of
 3.4 million, or 44 percent of the employed, economicaly active population.
 The largest trade union federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions,
 is formally aligned with the ANC and the South African Communist Party. The sec-
 ond largest trade union federation, the National Council of Trade Unions, while offi-
 cially independent of any political grouping, has close ties to the Pan Africanist Con-
 gress and the Azanian Peoples Organization. There are 62 trade unionist in national
 and provincial government following the 1994 elections.
 The right to strike is provided for in the Constitution. This right is given statu-
 tory effect by the new LRA, which established a simple procedure for a protected
 strike. All that is required is that the dispute be referred for conciliation. If concilia-
 tion fails to resolve the dispute, then a trade union is entitled to engage in a legal
 strike. Such a strike is not liable to criminal or civil action. The LAdoes allow
 employers to hire replacement labor for striking employees, but only after giving 7
 days' notice to the striking trade union.
 The LRA applies to public sector as well as private sector workers. Therefore,
 public sector employees are also guaranteed the right to strike, with the exception
 of those performing essential services and members of the three components of the
 security services mentioned above. While this right was first asserted in the Public
 Sector Labr Relations Act of 1993, the new LRA simplifies and rationalizes collec-
 tive bargaining in the public sector and the resort to industrial action.
 The Government does not restrict union affiliation with regional or international
 labor organizations. The International Labor Organization (ILO) readmitted South
 Africa in 1994. Originally an ILO member since its 1919 inception, South Africa
 
 
 withdrew from the ILO in 1964. Following the reinstatement, the International
 Labor Conference rescinded its declaration concerning action against apartheid.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law defines and protects
 the rights to organize and bargain collectively. The Government does not interfere
 with union organizing and generally has not interfered in the collective bargaining
 process. The new LRA statutorily entrenches "organizational rights," such as trade
 union access to worksites, deductions for trade union subscriptions, and leave for
 trade union officials, which strengthen trade union ability to organize workers.
 The creation of the National Economic Development and Labor Council, a tri-
 partite negotiating forum, will solidify the role of trade unions as social partners
 with government and business in the formation of economic and labor policy. The
 new LRA creates workplace forums which will allow for better shopfloor communica-
 tion between management and labor over issues of work organization and produc-
 tion. The forums, to receive statutory protection, can only be initiated by trade
 unions in businesses with more than 100 employees. However, the law is designed
 to build wide support within the trade union movement and business for new work-
 place relationships. It is intended that with time and support the sections of the law
 regarding workplace forams will be expanded to include such groups no matter what
 the size of the workplace.
 To further reduce the adversarial nature of South African labor relations, the new
 LRA also creates a Commission for Conciliation, Mediation, and Arbitration
 (CCMA), which will play an aggressive, interventionist role in resolving disputes be-
 fore they become ful -fledged strikes or lockouts.
 In the event the CCMA is unable to resolve a dispute, it may be referred to the
 Labor Court. However, the intent of the LRA is to reduce judicial intervention into
 labor relations, relying on the parties to resolve disputes whenever possible.
 South Africa has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is illegal under the
 Interim Constitution and is not practiced
 d. Minimum Age for Empi ment of Children.-Employment of minors under age
 15 is prohibited by the law. However, the law gives discretionary powers to the Min-
 ister of Welfare to exempt certain types of work to allow individual employers or
 groups of employers to hire children under certain conditions. This is common prac-
 tice in the agricultural sector. Use of child labor in the informal economy is also
 common. The Ministries of Labor and Justice are weak and reactive in enforcing
 child labor laws, depending largely on complaints made against specific employers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legally mandated national mini-
 mum wage. Instead, the LRA provides a mechanism for negotiations between labor
 and management to set minimum wage standards, industry by industry. Currently,
 100 industries covering most manufacturing workers come under the provisions of
 the Act. In those sectors of the economy not sufficiently organized to engage in the
 collective bargaining processes which establish minimum wages, the Wage Act gives
 the Minister oif Labor the authority to set minimum wages and conditions. The
 Wage Act, however, does not apply to farm or domestic workers.
 Occupational health and safety issues are a top priority of trade unions, especially
 in the mining and heavy manufacturing industries. Although attention to these is-
 sues has increased dramatically, including passage in 1993 of the Occupational
 Health and Safety Act, industrial and mining processes are still dangerous and
 sometimes deadly. A Mines Commission of Inquiry convened in 1994 to address
 health and safety issues in the mining sector. Its findings and recommendations
 have been incorporated into new mine safety and health legislation which is cur-
 rently before Parliament.
 Current occupational health and safety laws, while requiring an employer not to
 place employees at unreasonable risk, do not give employees the right to remove
 themselves from a hazardous job. An employee's decision to leave a hazardous work-
 site could possibly lead to dismissal but more probably would result in disciplinary
 action. Occupational health and safety laws do provide protection for workers who
 report or file complaints against unsafe working conditions. Such workers cannot be
 dismissed or reduced in salary or rank.
