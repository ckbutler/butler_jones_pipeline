 France is a democratic republic with constitutional provisions
 for human rights, civil liberties, freely functioning
 political parties,and regular'elections. There is universal
 suffrage and voter participation is high.
 Thehig4dy developed industrial economy features a mixture of
 .public and private enterprises. The.Government has halted the
 previous government's policy of denationalizing key
 idustries, banks, and certnin services while declaring that
 there will be no'hew nationalizatiohs.
 The, mil-itary/segurity apparatus consists of the three
 xa~itional services, the 9,000-strong gendarmerie (national
 pol'e/plaramilikaiy force),'and the police in major cities.
 These highly professional forces have a tradition of respect
 for human rights.
 Frznce's cabinet-level Secretary of State for Human Rights,
 wfho reports directly to the Prime 2linister, is tasked with
 promoting human rights in France. Through a firm
 counterterrorist policy, France has reduced, but not
 eliminated, violent incidents perpetrated by small extremist
 groups. French authorities have taken steps to protect the
 rights of woeMn and minority groups. France's overall human
 rights recgord is excellent.
 The promotion,of human rights is also a principal tenet of
 FreAcli foreign policy. There is a cabinet-level
 Minister-Delegate for Foreign Affairs with specific
 reqponsibilities for international human rights matters.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Sec:ion 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:   .
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There is no evidence that French security services engaged in
 political and other extrajudicial killings in 1989. There
 were no major international terrorist murders, and the few
 incidents of violence perpetrated by the country, s domestic
 terrprist groups, primarily Basque, Breton, and Corsican
 separatists, were mostly jinor and nonlethal. The judicial-
 system continued its vigorous prbsecution of terrorists.
 The president of the New Caledonian proindependence Kanak
 National Liberation Front (FLNKS), Jean-Marie Tjibaou, was
 assassinated in May by a proindependence extremist at a
 political meeting. The assassin was immediately shot and
 killed by Tjibaou's bodyguards.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no. evidence ,that French security services have
 engaged in abduction or secret arrests.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 France does not condone or practice torture or cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment or punishment. However, there- have
 been a few documented cases of police brutality, including the
 
 
 1110
 beating of one American in a drug-related case in 1988.
 Investigation of this-case.is still-under way.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 French law guarantees freedom from arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. There is no direct equivalent of habeas corpus
 in the French legal system, but there is a limit of 2 days---
 4 for drug and terrorist cases--before a suspect must be
 transferred to a magistrate for investigation.
 The judiciary plays a determining role in the detention
 process. Government authority to hold a person beyond the
 prescribed periods is severely restTicted, and such detention
 must be ordered by the competent court.
 There is no provision for exiling persons. There is no
 evidence that the authorities detain any person for political
 reasons.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of fair public trial is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Suspects are presumed innocent until
 proven guilty and have the right to legal counsel as soon as
 their cases are transferred from the police to the
 magistrate. For'misdemeanors, pretrial confinement normally
 is limited to 4 months; with extensions in special
 circumstances of approximately 8 to 12 months. However, in
 drug cases (all of which are handled by the courts as
 misdemeanors), pretrial confinement may be unlimited. For
 felonies, pretrial confinement also is not limited. This
 pretrial period may be lengthy, depending upon the seriousness
 and complexity of the case. Evidence is gathered and assessed
 by an independent examining judge. Defendants are free to
 request and present evidence during this important
 investigatory period.
 Trials in France are normally open-and public, but provisions
 exist for the defense to request a closed proceeding. The
 press has free ,access to records of court proceedings,
 -although under French law the prosecutor may not disclose
 infotmati-on about cases being tried or investigated.
 French law provides for the right-of appeal, except in jury
 trials of felony cases. An appeal-to the Court of Cassation
 is possible in felony-cases, but this court rules only on
 procedure; no appeal that involves review of the facts of the
 case is possible.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 French law guarantees freedom from invasion of privacy, and
 this freedom is respected in practice. The search of a
 private residence requires a search warrant and must take
 place between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. except in special
 circumstances, such as drug cases, when the search may be
 undertaken at any time. Telephone conversations may be
 monitored in conjunction with criminal proceedings with a
 court order and in national security cases with administrative
 approval from the agency conducting the investigation.
 
 
 1111
 Section 2 -Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Pr-ess
 These freedoms are-guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice  Newspapers and magazines are-free from government
 control and present views ranging across the political
 spectrum.' -There are two state-owned and three-private
 television networks--in addition to private cable channels.
 Private radio stations-,have operated in France since 1983.
 Hundreds are now.on the air and offera wide array of
 independent, uncensored programming. Academic freedom of
 expression is respected in both public and private academic
 institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom -of peacefulimssembly and association is widely
 respected, although, -except for a specific reference to trade
 -unions, -it- is. not mentioned in the Constitution. Groups'
 wishing to organize public meetings, protest marches, or
 demonstrations must obtain a permit from the local
 authorities. Permits are routinely granted for both political
 and apolitical-,gatherings; Private associations, whether
 -political br apolitical, must register,with the prefecture in
 .the department in which they are established, but they do not
 require the prefecture's authorization to exist. Such
 'registration is considered routine.- Informal associations,
 such as those without officers,-.bylaws, or dues, need not.
 register.-.-       k
 For a disaussion-of freedom of association as it- applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c.:: Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholics comprise by far the largest religious group in
 .France. -Separation of- church-and state is guaranteed by law.
 All weligious groups function freely- without persecution...-
 Private and parochial-schuols receive.substantial subsidies
 from the Ministry of National Education.
 d. Freedom of Movement_ ithin the-Country, Foreign
 -, Travel, Emigraction, iand Repatriation
 French law provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign
 travel, emigration, and repatriation. Arriving refugees,
 intending emigrants, and intending repatriates can undertake
 foreign travel and, in most instances, return to -France.
 France has an extensive record of refugee aid and resettlement.
 -Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 -to Change Their Government
 The people have the right and ability to change their
 government by peaceful-means, not only through-the election of
 national representatives but also through amendment of the
 Constitution by means of a national referendum. This right
 was exercised with the adoption of a'new Constitution in 1958.
 The Constitution guarantees the equality of all citizens
 before the law, without regard to origin, race, or religion.
 All French citizens who have reached majority may vote, except
 for most convicted criminals, bankrupt persons, and persons
 certified to be mentally incompetent. These provisions are
 
 
 1112
 fully respected in practice. Presidential elections are held
 every 7 years, and elections for the National Assembly are
 held every 5 years, unless the Government is dissolved, in
 which case elections may be called sooner.
 A wide variety of political parties compete freely in
 elections. In addition to national, presidential, and
 legislative elections, there are regularly scheduled local
 elections. For several years, the Government has been
 transferring selected powers from the executive branch to
 locally elected assemblies. Many special interest
 groups--business, labor, veterans, consumer advocates,
 ecologists, and others--organize freely and regularly support
 candidates for elective office.
 The Matignon Accords of 1988, which call for a territorial
 referendum in 1998 to decide the future of New Caledonia,
 continued to be implemented in 1989. Municipal elections in
 March and provincial elections in June were conducted fairly.
 Despite the assassination of FLNKS leader Tjibaou in May (see
 Section l.a.), the level of ethnic violence in the territory
 has substantially diminished.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 France has traditionally been a leader in the human rights
 area. Human rights organizations, including the International
 Federation for Human Rights, operate freely in France.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The authorities do not condone discrimination based on race,
 religion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 Although incidents of racial, religious, or political
 discrimination occur, particularly against the large immigrant
 community of Arabs and Africans, authorities consistently
 condemn such incidents. Food, shelter, health care, and
 education are available to all inhabitants.
 Women have equal status under the law but are engaged in
 continuing efforts to maintain and strengthen their rights. A
 cabinet-level Secretary of State for Women's Rights, appointed
 in 1988, operates under the direct supervision of the Prime
 Minister. The Government also has taken steps to close
 loopholes in French legislation on sex discrimination in the
 workplace and to eliminate sexist advertising. In 1985 it
 passed legislation to ensure more equality in marriage
 rights.
 The Government does not tolerate violence and abuse against
 women, and such violence, including wife beating, is
 prohibited under article 309 of the penal code. In 1987, the
 latest year for which statistics are available, 7,840 women in
 France lodged legal complaints of wife beating against their
 husbands under the provisions of article 309.
 The rights of linguistic and ethnic minorities are protected,
 both in metropolitan France and in overseas territories
 subject to French authority. The right of legally admitted
 immigrants to coexist peacefully without assimilating
 completely into French culture is recognized. Legislation has
 been passed simplifying the deportation of illegal immigrants
 
 
 1113
 and tightening immigration procedures. In metropolitan France
 in 1989, extreme rightwing gangs in a number of instances
 assaulted members of minority groups, mainly Arabs. The
 authorities fully investigated-such cases and vigorously
 prosecuted those apprehended.
 -An.accord was-signed in 1988 between ethnic Melanesians and
 European settlers on the status of New Caledonia in an effort
 to reduce deep-rooted antagonisms between the two ethnic
 communities.-
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 .a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution affirms the principle of freedom of, labor
 union association, the right to a job, the right of equal
 opportunity for education and training, social security, and
 workers' participation in the operation of the enterprise in
 which they are employed.
 Although only 10 percent of the work force is unionized, trade
 unions exercise significant economic and political influence.
 They patticipate actively in numerous tripartite (government,
 employer, and .wo'ker) bodies dealing with social matters,
 including  lbor cpurts~and the Economic and Social Council, a
 constitutionally mandated consultative body. All unions are
 technically independent of the political parties, but many of
 the leaders of France's largest union, the General
 Confederation of Labor, belong to the Communist Party. (The
 General Secretary traditionally is a.member of the Communist
 Party Political Bureau.) Leaders of most other unions are
 members of one or another faction of the Socialist Party,
 although members of other parties are also active in the labor
 -movement. There are no restrictions on the unions'.
 international activities, .and all three world trade union
 confederations have Fxench affiliates. French workers are
 free.to:stike, with a few exceptions in cases where strikes
 are. determined to be a threat to public safety.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers-have the right to organize and bargain collectively.
 The-principle of free collective bargaining was reestablished
 after World War II by a law of 1950, with separate statutes
 applying to public enterprises. The legislation, as amended
 in 1971 and 1978, encourages collective bargaining at the
 national, regional, local, or plant level. French law
 strictly prohibits antiunion discrimination. The law further
 sets forth procedures for dealing with labor disputes and
 defines two forms of collective contracts--extendable and
 ordinary. Amendments added in 1982 require at least annual
 bargaining on wages, hours, and working conditions at both
 plant and industry levels. France has no export processing
 zones, .and labor law and practice are uniform throughout the
 country.
 The Government encourages management and labor organizations
 to negotiate on issues important to public policy--such as
 adjustment plans for dislocated workers, training, retraining,
 unemployment compensation, and supplementary retirement
 schemes. The "social partners" sometimes invite the
 Government to participate in these negotiations, particularly
 if legislation will be needed for implementation or if public
 financing is involved.
 
 
 1114
 The 1950 law sets forth procedures for resolving labor-
 management disputes. These are frequently arbitrated by labor
 inspectors. Conciliation boards, composed mainly of
 management and labor representatives, have proved
 ineffective. The Higher Court of Arbitration is rarely used.
 Mediation of wage issues at the national, regional, or local
 level has been more successful. Outside mediators, drawn from
 the upper ranks of the civil service, impose solutions that
 are binding unless formally rejected by either side within 8
 days. In 1988, 1,242,000 man-days of work were lost because
 of strikes, as opposed to some 969,063 man-days in 1987.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and is not
 practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 With a few minor exceptions for those enrolled in recognized
 apprenticeship programs, children under the age of 16 may not
 be employed. Certain categories of work considered to be
 arduous and night work (10 p.m. to 5 a.m.) may -ot be
 performed by persons under the age of 18 or by women in
 manufacturing, mining, the public sector, unions, and
 nonprofit organizations. However, women with managerial
 responsibilities may perform night work. This prohibition
 does not apply to women in commercial establishments,
 entertainment, or the health sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 France has a minimum wage of about $4.60 an hour, which is
 sufficient to provide a decent standard of living. The
 standard workweek is 39 hours, and overtime is controlled. In
 general terms, French labor legislation and practice,
 including that pertaining to occupational safety and health,
 are fully comparable to those in other industrialized market
 economy countries. The minimum wage is somewhat less in the
 overseas departments, and not all social legislation applies
 in overseas territories.
