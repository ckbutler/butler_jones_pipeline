 LIBYA*
 The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya describes its
 form of government as a "popular democracy." In theory
 political power is vested in "the masses" with the guidance of
 the People's Congress and its executive arms, the People's
 Committees; in practice the country is dominated by an erratic
 military dictator, Colonel Mu'ammar Al-Qadhafi. He is aided
 by extragovernmental "Revolutionary Committees" which operate
 at his behest.
 The governing principles of the society are expressed in
 Qadhafi's "Green Book" rather than in the Constitution.
 Qadhafi has created a political system borrowing from
 pan-Islamic and pan-Arab sources and purporting to establish a
 "third way" superior to both capitalism and communism. His
 -philosophy on human rights is summed up in his statement that
 "it is an honor to jail or liquidate the enemies of the
 authorities." He has instigated the assassination of his
 enemies abroad, and he controls-enemies at home in a variety
 of summary and judicial proceedings which are employed
 wherever popular resistance exists. Ethnic minorities such as
 the Berber population are tightly controlled.
 Libya's security apparatus operates at multiple levels,
 involving not only Qadhafi's personal bodyguards and the
 official police/interior establishment,.but also the
 Revolutionary Committees and People's Committees which act
 independently of other authorities, sometimes encouraged
 directly by Qadhafi. The result is a complex of multilayered,
 tight surveillance and control of individual activities.'
 Conservative religious and social attitudes further restrict
 freedoms and rights for such groups as women and professionals.
 Qadhafi has sought to provide greater equality for women in
 education and employment but has faced serious resistance from
 his conservative countrymen.
 Libya has used'its oil income to finance Internal development
 (new schools, hospitals, roads), but much has been wasted and
 the recent decline in oil revenues has forced retrenchment.
 Significant parts of Libya's development plans have been
 dropped, foreign exchange contrbls have been tightened, and
 imports have been restricted. Qadhafi has exhorted the
 population to return to the days of self-sufficiency. The
 current economic difficulties have been eiacerbated by the
 regime's expenditures for large quantities of weapons and on
 foreign military adventures, including Libyan aggression in
 Chad.
 Legal freedoms and rights are generally lacking in Libya,
 except for minimal guarantees for minorities and women. There
 is no right to peaceful association or assembly, no freedom of
 speech, no right to express opposition to the Government in
 any form, to form trade unions, or to strike. There are no
 legal or judicial rights such as the right to be considered
 innocent until proven guilty, to a public or speedy trial, to
 be secure in one's home or person, or even to hold property.
 Libya's human rigbts record remained poor in 1987. In
 February the regime revived the practice of public executions

 since Libya's media is totally coptrolled, this report draws
 heavily on unofficial %.urces.

 of political opponents. The campaign of "physical liquidation"
 of Libyan political opponents abroad also continued during
 1987, resulting in assassinations or assassination attempts in
 Athens, Rome, and Vienna. There-were continued reports of
 torture and abuse, disappearances, and executions. Amnesty
 International (AI) expressed concern about 77 "prisoners of
 conscience" and 144 political prisoners but believed the
 actual number of such prisoners to be much higher.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 It is not known how many political killings were carried out
 ii! 1987. In February the public hanging of six civilians and
 execution by firing squad of three military personnel were
 televised. The victims' crimes included the establishment of
 underground fundamentalist organizations. There have also
 been reports of exeoutions of persons accused of plotting
 -,against the regime and of military personnel blamed for
 defeats in Chad.
 In 1980 the Government instituted a policy of assassinations
 of Libyan exiles and announced the formation of "suicide
 squads" to hunt down and kill Libyan dissidents abroad. In
 1905 Qadhafi stated that the death penalty was still
 appropriate.for-persons who refused to return and "repent"; he
 reiterated his call that "stray dogs" be searched out and
 "liquidated." Between March 1980 and June 1987, AI recorded
 at leapto37 Attacks on Libyan opponents or presumed opponents
 living pbroad, resulting in 25 deaths. During 1987 this
 campaign .resulted in the assassination of a member of the
 Libyan National Organization in Athens in January, the second
 assassination attempt against the former Libyan ambassador to
 Austria in Vienna in May, and the assassination of an executive
 member of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya in Rome
 in June. .During 1987 bothFrance and Switzerland expelled
 Libyans, including government officials, suspected of plotting
 attacks against opponents of the Libyan regime.
 b. Disappearance
 It is not known how many persons disappeared in 1987.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Detainees in criminal and security cases reportedly are
 regularly beaten during interrogation. In some prisdns,
 conditions reportedly are tolerable but conditions of
 detention for political prisoners are often poor, including
 confiscation of reading and writing materials.
 While Shaxila (Islamic) law is practiced in Libya, physical
 mutilation is not used as a form of punishment.
 Al has expressed concern about the large number of offenses,
 including political offenses, which are punishable by death
 under Libyan law. For-example, Law Number 71 of 1972 provides
 for the death penalty for anyone involved with any group
 activity based on any ideology opposed to the principles of
 the revolution.
 
 
 1233
 LIBYA
 In its 1987 Report, AI noted that it had received reports of
 torture in Libya, confirming that torture methods such as
 "falaqa" (beating on the soles of the feet) and "farruj" (in
 which the prisoner is hung upside down from a perch inserted
 between the kfiees, with wrists and ankles bound and is beaten
 intermittently) have been used in recent years.' It also noted
 that in October 1986 Libya paid $500,000 compensation to the
 Norwegian Government for the torture and ill-treatment of
 Norwegian merchant seamen and the death under torture of one
 of them in May 1984. It said,'however, that the investigation
 into the death of another sailor, promised by Libya in 1985,
 was reported not to have taken place.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Elements of the Revolutionary Committees and the People's
 Committees continue to carry out arrest and detention of
 suspected opponents of the Government with the encouragement
 of Qadhafi. Under Libyan law, detainees may be held
 incommunicado for unlimited periods. Many political prisoners
 are held in unofficial detention centers controlled by members
 of the Revolutionary Committees,, where prolonged periods of
 incommunicado detention are common. Many allegedly are held
 without charge or tria' apparently as an example to other
 would-be opponents of t he regime. In security cases in
 particular, there are many reports 6f prisoners being held
 without trial for several years. While undergoing
 interrogation, sometimes for periods of several months, they
 are given no access to legal representation.
 Libya declared several years ago that there were then "no
 political detainees on any charge in its prisons." Reports
 from a variety of sources, however, assert that the prisons
 contain increased numbers of persons convicted of, or held
 for, political offenses, including large numbers of persons
 arrested in 1984. Qadhafi has justified imprisonment on
 political charges. Although he has claimed to be opposed to
 arrests in secrecy, there is no evidence that his exhortation
 has resulted in any improvement in practice. During 1986
 Libyan authorities did not respond to any of AI's
 communications about 75 "prisoners of conscience." In its
 1987 Report, covering 1986, AI noted that it had received
 reports that political prisoners in Libya were often held
 without trial or after having been acquitted or ha-ving served
 their sentences.
 Foreigners are not immune from aibitary arrest. In February
 five foreigners who entered Libya on a disabled yacht were
 held incommunicado for several months before four of them were
 allowed to leave. The fifth was reportedly released seven
 months later.
 Exile is not a form of punishment practiced in Libya; to the
 contrary, Qadhafi seeks to pressure Libyans working or
 studying abroad to return to Libya. Libya does, however,
 engage in the arbitrary expulsion of noncitizens. In general,
 forced labor is not practiced, but paid labor is mobilized for
 major projects under conditions similar to conscription.
 During 1987 there were credible reports of widespread forced
 conscription of trQops--from among Libyans as well as
 non-Libyan resident workers--for service in southern Libya and
 northern Chad related to Libyan aggression against that
 country.

 LIBYA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Civilians may be tried in the regular courts, in less formal
 "people's courts," or by military or revolutionary courts,
 depending on the arbitrary decisibn bf the security forces.
 Security forces have the power to consider persons guilty
 without trial, particularly "traitors to the people." Trials
 are also held in private or in the absence of the accused.
 The traditional courts have also been bypassed to a significant
 extent by peoples courts'and revolutionary courts which
 sometimes conduct "show triAls"-on television, followed by
 public executions. 'These various trial systems provide few
 safeguards. Freedom House notes, however, that some
 acquittals have occurred in political cases.
 A 1981 law prohibits the private practice of law and makes all
 attorneys employees of the Sdcretariat of Justice. The Union
 of Arab Lawy'ers, located in France, has expressed concern for
 the ability and freedom of attorneys simultaneously to provide
 legal defense for political prisoners and to serve as
 government employees. Libya claims that it "guarantees
 prisoners all necessary means of defense'and -afeguards of
 justice adequate to the principles contained in the
 Declaration of Human Rights" and provides for legal assistance
 "as soon as possible with respect to the exigencies of
 interrogation," but there are numerous reports that these
 rights are frequently denied.
 Alleged political offenses are often tried before ad hoc
 "revolutionary courts" rather than under the normal judicial
 procedure, with the opportunities for defense severely
 restricted. Moreover, a number of these trials have been held
 in secret.' There is no precise estimate of the number of
 political prisoners in Libya. AI states that it is concerned
 about the'continued impriso.nment of 77 "prisoners of
 conscieiice' in Libya as well as 144 political prisoners, many
 of whom'may'be prisoners of conscience.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not recognize the right to privacy. The
 legal requirement that judicial warrants must be obtained
 before entering a private home is reportedly often disregarded.
 Local and international phone calls are routinely monitored.
 The informer network is very extensive, encouraged by both
 security agencies and Revolutionary Committees. Individual
 privacy is disregarded. Libyan exiles clai' that mere family
 ties to suspetted regime opponents can result in harassment or
 even persecution and detention by the authorities. Property
 can be seized and burned if it belongs to "enemies of the
 people" or those who "cooperate" with foreign powers.
 g. Violations of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts
 In the course of Libya's armed aggression against Chad,
 Chadian authorities accused the Libyans of poisoning wells
 and mistreating Chadian prisoners of war. Libya has refused
 International Red Cross access to Chadian prisoners of war.
 In a public statement November 6, the International Committee
 of the Red Cross cited Libya for violating the Third Geneva
 Convention concerning treatment of prisoners of war. There
 are reports that at least one Libyan commander in the conflict
 with Chad was executed by Libyan authorities after the
 Chadians overran Libyan positions in northern Chad in March.

 LIBYA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although some difference of opinion is tolerated in People's
 Committee meetings and at the General People's Congress, in
 general, freedom of speech is severely limited, particularly
 with regard to any criticism of Qadhafi or his regime.
 Freedom of speech and other basic civil and political freedoms
 are further restricted during periods of internal security
 crises. Libyan media are owned and controlled by the State.
 There is only one daily newspaper, which has a circulation of
 40,000. JANA, the official news agency, is the designated
 conduit for politically acceptable opinions. It is impossible
 to publish opinions contrary to government policy. Foreign
 publications, if not banned outright, are severely censored.
 There is an underlying climate of fear and mistrust at all
 levels of society which further restricts freedom of speech.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public assembly is repressed unless it is government
 controlled and supportive of regime positions. The right of
 association is granted only to those institutions affiliated
 with the regime. Organizations such as independent trade
 unions and professional associations are viewed as threats by
 Qadhafi, who has vowed not to "accept intermediaries between
 the revolution and its working forces."
 Unions are organized under government control and are
 administered through the people's committee system. There is
 no collective bargaining; there have been no reports of
 strikes (except by students) for years, and presumably these
 are not permitted. An exiled opposition group in June 1983
 appealed to the International Labor Organization to investigate
 "the oppressive record of the Qadhafi regime with regard to
 its treatment of workers and laborers and employees in Libya,
 with particular emphasis on violations of human rights
 agreements and conventions governing labor and labor unions."
 This group also charged that Libya has forced foreign workers
 and employees into military training with the intention of
 coercing them into military and subversive activities against
 their own countries.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim. Some minority religions (e.g.
 Christians) still are allowed to conduct services, but Islamic
 groups differing from the state-sanctioned one are banned. In
 1986 the closure of all Koranic schools allegedly was ordered
 to reduce the influence of the mosques and to integrate all
 children into the public system. In October 1986, the regime
 arrested, as a threat to state security, members of an
 "enemies of God" or "godless" clique, nine of whom were
 publicly executed in February 1987. In an apparent effort to
 eliminate any alternative power bases, the regime has banned
 -the once-powerful Sanusiyya Islamic religious following.
 Restrictions were placed on the operation of the organization's
 Zawaayaa (lodges), a government supervisor was appointed for
 Sanusi properties, and the Sanusi-sponsored Islamic University
 was merged with the University of Libya.
 
 
 1236
 LIBYA
 Services in Christian churches are attended exclusively by the
 foreign community. There is a resident Catholic bishop and a
 small number of priests. Nuns reportedly are permitted to
 wear their habits.
 All but five members of the formerly sizable Jewish community
 have emigrated. Qadhafi has stated that he is opposed to
 Zionism, not Judaism, and that Arab nations should welcome
 Arab Jews who wish to return to their countries of origin.
 But in a speech in June 1985 he cited the Prophet Muhammed as
 stating that Judaism and Islam cannot coexist in the land of
 the Arabs and, in September 1985, anti-Jewish broadcasts on
 Libyan radio called virulently for anti-Jewish violence in
 areas of Tunisia and Morocco within broadcast range.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 With tile exception of security areas, internal freedom of
 movement is monitored but not usually restricted for Libyan
 citizens. An exit permit is required for travel abroad, and
 currency controls are imposed to restrict travel. Although
 restrictions on travel abroad were eased somewhat in mid-1987,
 it remained difficult for Libyans to travel outside Libya.
 Those who are permitted to leave Libya are always monitored by
 members of the Revolutionary Committees while abroad. Under
 Libyan Islamic law, wives' may not leave the country without
 their husbands' permission; children may not travel without
 their fathers' consent. The right of return of Libyan
 nationals is fully protected and theoretically extends to
 include opponents of Qadhafi, so long as they are prepared to
 "repent." However, this "right" often appears to be more of
 an obligation or threat, with calls for students, often under
 govee'nment subsidy, and others working abroad to return on
 little or no notice and-without regard to the impact on their
 studies o r work. Libyans studying abroad are interrogated on
 their returh.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people of Libya have no right to change their government.
 Majoe government decisions are controlled by Qadhafi or by
 committees acting in his name. He makes appointments of
 military officers and official functionaries down to a junior
 level. Power flows through a small circle of trusted
 associates, whose own authority is a reflection of their
 proximity to Qadhafi. Corruption in administration has
 assumed major proportions, with adverse effects on government.
 Part'icipation in elections is mandatory, and the candidates
 are cleargd-by the Revolutionary Committees from among persons
 who are not 6merchants, contractors, tribal advocates, election
 brokers, officials of the former (pre-1969) government or
 people who have been attacked by the power of the revolution."
 Politicar parties and tribal or local groupings are
 prohibited, and involvement in such activities remains
 punishable by death. Aside from these constraints, Freedom
 House has noted that local elections are relatively fair.
 
 
 1237
 LIBYA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no human rights organizations in Libya to monitor
 the Government's performance, and the Government considers
 inquiries from international human rights organizations to be
 interference in its domestic affairs.
 In its 1987 Report, covering 1986, AI noted that it had
 received no reply from Libyan authorities to any of AI's
 communications about 75 "prisoners of conscience," some of
 whom were under death sentences or serving life sentences.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There are frequent allegations of discrimination based on
 tribal status, with particular discrimination alleged against
 Berbers in the interior and Tuaregs in the south. Qadhafi has
 complained about the continued power of tribal and other
 antisocial groups. In past years, he sought unsuccessfully to
 assure that Berbers married only non-Berbers, presumably to
 diminish their tribal identity.
 The conservative cultural attitudes of Libya's Islamic society
 serve to restrict rights of certain groups, most notably
 women. Within the confines of Islamic beliefs, Qadhafi has
 taken a leadership role in efforts to change the status of
 women and expand their access to educational and employment
 opportunities. Women currently receive basic military
 training and are subject to a draft. The husband's permission
 is necessary for women or children to travel abroad, and
 female circumcision is still reportedly practiced in remote
 areas of the south.
 There is also discrimination on the basis of religion. The
 regime is-opposed, however, to Islamic fundamentalism.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Libya maintains a work force of around 1 million workers in a
 population of 3.7 million. Some 300,000 of these'are foreign
 workers whose permission to stay in Libya extends 6nly for the
 duration of the contracts under which they are employed.
 Foreign workers do much of the blue-collar and technical work
 in Libya. Foreign workers are subject to arbitrary pressures
 such as changes in work rules and contracts with little option
 but to accept or to depart the country, often without full
 compensation for work already performed. Nevertheless, with
 the Government dependent in many cases on the skills of
 expatriates, most foreign laborers are paid substantially more
 than they would receive in their home countries. The
 Government places significant restrictions on the amount of
 earnings that may be repatriated.
 No information is available on Libyan regulations governing
 minimum wages, health and safety, and child labor. In
 general, there is no evidence that child labor is a problem in
 Libya.
