 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy which,
 despite the assassination of three presidential candidates
 during the 1990 presidential campaign, successfully carried
 out three national elections--congressional (March),
 presidential (May), and one for a constituent assembly
 (December). The Liberals and Social Conservatives have
 historically been the dominant national parties.
 Internal security is the primary responsibility of the
 Ministry of Defense, which includes the national police. The
 Department of Administrative Security (DAS), roughly
 equivalent to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation,
 reports directly to the President. Security forces are
 responsible for a number of human rights abuses.
 Colombia has a mixed economy, with private enterprise having a
 dominant role. The coffee industry, which accounts for 20 to
 25 percent of legal export earnings, is mainly in the private
 sector, as are most entities engaged in manufacturing,
 agriculture, and the service sector. State enterprises control
 participation in the oil and coal industries and play an
 important role in the electrical and telecommunication
 utilities. Privatization of certain public industries is
 under way.
 The human rights situation in Colombia, where strong
 democratic traditions and civilian governments have withstood
 extraordinary levels of violence for more than 40 years, is
 complex. The main causes of the current violence and of human
 rights violations are powerful narcotics traffickers, leftist
 guerrilla movements, and rightwing paramilitary groups that
 sometimes operate with the support or acquiescence of regional
 or local military and police officials. There are significant
 abuses by members of the police and military, usually in the
 context of efforts to quell trafficker or political violence.
 Narcotraffickers, the principal source of the violence,
 carried out campaigns to assassinate policemen and often
 propagated disinformation regarding official human rights
 abuses, hoping to undermine both domestic and international
 support for the Government. The guerrilla groups often
 tortured their captives and have frequently murdered local
 government officials and civilians as part of their continuing
 effort to overthrow the Government. Rightwing paramilitary
 groups often engage in political violence at the direction of
 drug traffickers and powerful rural political interests.
 Narcotics traffickers control enormous illicit enterprises and
 use violence and terrorism to bend the Colombian political and
 judicial systems to their purposes. They have achieved virtual
 immunity from prosecution by threatening, kidnaping, and
 murdering judges, government officials, political leaders,
 police, and their families. In some areas, the guerrillas
 cooperate with narcotraffickers; in others they are in violent
 conflict. Some guerrilla units have their own trafficking
 organizations--in October, for example, the army uncovered a
 guerrilla-operated drug laboratory complex in the department
 of Putumayo.
 Members and units of the army and the police participated in a
 disturbing number of human rights violations including
 extrajudicial executions, torture, and massacres. The army is
 reluctant to distinguish between guerrillas and noncombatants
 during counterinsurgency operations: targets of serious abuse

 COLOMBIA
 include leftist politicians, labor organizers, and human rights
 workers. Moreover, some persons and units have assisted or
 participated in rightwing paramilitary activity, which also
 targets guerrillas and those believed to have leftist or
 guerrilla sympathies. Some of these paramilitary groups have
 been linked to narcotraffickers. Paramilitary activity
 declined in the last half of 1990, partly because the
 Government succeeded in reducing civilian and military
 involvement in these illegal organizations.
 Official human rights abuses contravene government policy, but
 so far efforts by security forces to end such abuses have been
 inadequate. In frequent'public statements President Gaviria,
 who took office in August, has made it clear that he will not
 tolerate human rights abuses by government officials. The
 Government promulgated several constitutionally authorized
 state of siege decrees, designed to facilitate the struggle
 against traffickers and political extremists. The Government
 continues to negotiate with the guerrillas- in March the M-19
 guerrilla group turned in its arms and became an influential
 legal political party. By January 1991, three other guerrilla
 groups had also agreed in principle to give up their weapons
 and return to civilian society.
 The Procuraduria, an independent government watchdog
 institution, sharply stepped up investigations into allegations
 of government involvement in specific human rights abuses. By
 year's end, the Procuraduria had ordered the dismissal (its
 strongest sanction) of some officers and enlisted men from the
 military and the police, and the security forces themselves
 dismissed certain violators from their ranks. -Nevertheless,
 sanctions for human rights abuses seldom extend beyond
 dismissal from the service. Until ongoing government efforts
 at judicial reform have a significant impact, the
 ineffectiveness of Colombia's criminal justice system means
 that few human rights violators are likely to face criminal
 punishment.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Colombia has one of the highest murder rates in the world.
 Because of a lack of sufficient police and judicial resources
 to investigate and prosecute most of these crimes, it is
 difficult to separate political and nonpolitical murders.
 Nevertheless, Centro de Investigaciones y Educacion Popular
 (CINEP), Bogota's Jesuit-affiliated human rights-social
 research institution, gives a credible figure of 313 confirmed
 political killings in Colombia in 1990, a significant decline
 from the 463 political killings recorded by CINEP in 1989.
 CINEP labeled an additional 1,514 murders as presumably
 politically motivated, compared to 1,515 in 1989. These
 numbers exclude deaths in combat.
 During the first half of the year narcotraffickers continued a
 deadly terror campaign begun in mid-1989. A common tactic used
 by the narcotraffickers is the explosion of powerful car bombs
 placed deliberately in urban areas to kill large numbers of
 civilians. Three such explosions in shopping centers of Bogota
 and Cali on May 12 killed at least 30 people and injured some
 180 others. On April 5 a car bomb with approximately 1,750
 
 
 550
 COLOMBIA
 pounds of high explosive was found in a Bogota residential
 neighborhood after it failed to detonate. The narcotraffickers
 also:launched a campaign to murder Medellin-area policemen,
 offering a.$4,000 reward for each one killed. Over 200
 policemen were-assassinated during the first 7 months of 1990
 in.the Medellin area alone. In the second half of the year,
 the Medellin drug lords announced a cease-fire, reducing but
 not eliminating their campaign of violence against policemen.
 .Nationwide, policemen continue to be murdered by the
 .narcotraffickers, the guerrillas, and common.criminals at a
 rate of more than 1 a day; according to official statistics,
 521 members of the national police were killed in the line of
 duty between January and October 16.
 Narcotraffickers also fought among-themselves; Colombia's two
 main groups, based in the cities of Cali and Medellin, engaged
 in a violent power struggle during 1990, with perhaps hundreds
 of persons associated with the traffickers killed and innocent
 civilians often caught in the crossfire. On September 26, in
 an incident directed against the Cali group, several gunmen
 opened fire at a crowd watching a soccer game at a farm
 outside that city, killing at least 19 spectators, many of
 them affiliated with the Cali traffickers.
 Before the March elections there was an organized wave of
 assassinations of members of the leftist Patriotic Union (UP)
 party; during the first 3 months of the year 32 members were
 murdered, according to conservative CINEP statistics. Both
 narcotraffickers and rightwing paramilitary groups were
 responsible for these killings. The UP charged that security
 forces were also involved in some of these assassinations and
 that the Government was not providing it with adequate
 protection. On March 22, UP presidential candidate Bernardo
 Jaramillo was assassinated in Bogota's airport. The following
 month Carlos Pizarro, the M-19 presidential candidate, wat
 murdered aboard a commercial airplane. Narcotraffickers,
 intent on destabilizing the country, almost certainly were
 responsible for both crimes. 'Although apparent low-level
 figures in the assassination plots against Jaramillo and
 Pizarro were arrested, the intellectual authors of these
 crimes remained at large at year's end.
 Colombia's two major political parties also suffered from
 assassinations, although in no way proportional to UP losses.
 According to CINEP statistics, 35 Liberal leaders and 17
 Social Conservatives were killed for political or apparently
 political reasons in the first 8 months of the year. Senator
 Frederico Estrada Velez, a prominent Liberal, was shot by
 unknown assassins on May 21. The murder was ordered by drug
 traffickers who had kidnaped and released the Senator several
 weeks earlier. On July 27, Social Conservative Congressman
 Jaime.Salazar Robledo was shot by an unknown assassin.
 Rightwing paramilitary groups, sometimes with the cooperation
 or acquiescence of local military and police officers, were
 responsible for a number of mass murders in rural regions. On
 January 14 a group of armed men acting under the orders of
 Fidel Castano, a trafficker and the most notorious leader of
 these groups, and possibly operating with assistance from
 local military units, kidnaped some 42 peasants in a heavily
 militarized zone in Antioquia department. All were tortured
 and killed shortly afterwards; many of the bodies were later
 uncovered by investigators in a mass grave on one of Castano's
 ranches. The Procuraduria subsequently began disciplinary
 proceedings against two military officers for allowing the
 
 
 551
 COLOMBIA
 assassins to pass a military checkpoint, and the courts began
 criminal proceedings against Castano and other responsible
 persons. Nevertheless, only one person was known to have been
 detained for participation in this crime. Another
 investigation indicated that a second rightwing group,
 operating with the support and participation of local military
 officials, murdered some 20 residents of Trujillo, Valle
 department, during the first half of the year. In 1990 police
 and military leaders continued dismissing some officers with
 ties to these organizations.
 Some military and police units committed extrajudicial
 killings on their own. The Procuraduria filed disciplinary
 charges against eight army enlisted men and three officers for
 the extrajudicial executions of six rural residents on April
 18 in Puerto Valdivia, Antioquia department. The military
 claimed that the victims were guerrillas killed in battle, but
 forensic and other evidence contradicts this account. There
 was also credible evidence that on June 7 a military unit
 executed 11 individuals in Macaravita, Santander department.
 Again, the military initially reported the victims as killed
 in combat, but they appear to have been dressed up in military
 fatigues after they died. In midyear, during the police
 assassination campaign sponsored by narcotraffickers in
 Medellin, scores of young males were murdered in and near that
 city. There are credible reports that some Medellin-based
 members of the national police, frustrated by the inability of
 the justice system to punish those responsible for killing
 their colleagues, retaliated in some of these instances by
 killing persons they thought had links to the
 narcotraffickers. It is impossible to judge, however, how
 many of these killings were inspired by police and how many
 resulted from feuds between the city's deadly gangs of paid
 assassins. There are also credible reports that local police
 have been responsible for "clean-up" campaigns which involve
 the extrajudicial executions of petty thieves, prostitutes,
 and other street people. In 1990 police were alleged to have
 committed at least 15 such murders in the town of Girardot.
 Leftist guerrillas were responsible for numerous extrajudicial
 killings of those who refused to submit to their extortion,
 those who they thought had helped the Government, and those,
 including democratic union leaders, whom they declared
 "guilty" of "crimes against the people." They also executed
 those within their own groups who tried to leave or who
 questioned the leadership's political line. On February 11,
 three bodies were found in Ocana, Norte de Santander
 department, with a placard saying they were executed for
 deserting the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC),.
 Colombia's largest guerrilla group. The record of the Army of
 National Liberation (ELN) was particularly atrocious. On
 January 4, the ELN killed four persons in Bolivar, Cauca
 department, for allegedly providing information to the army.
 On February 10, four farmworkers, allegedly army informants,
 were murdered in Monteria, Cordoba department. In early
 October, members of the ELN occupied the town of Pinillos,
 Bolivar department, singled out the mayor and former mayor,
 and killed them.
 Due in large part to an ineffective criminal justice system,
 very few political killers, whether they are narcotraffickers,
 members of armed rightist groups, guerrillas, or government
 security officials, are brought to justice. Judicial reform
 is a top priority of President Gaviria, who moved quickly on
 this issue during the year
 
 
 COLOMBIA
 A notable exception to the general judicial ineffectiveness
 was the June conviction of 10 persons who were involved in the
 January 1989 massacre by a rightwing paramilitary group of 12
 judicial officials in La Rochela, Santander department. The
 two persons most responsible for the massacre were sentenced
 to 30 years' imprisonment. Later in the year an appeals court
 upheld almost all of the convictions, including that of an
 army sergeant found guilty of obstructing the investigation
 into the case, but ruled that a lieutenant convicted of aiding
 the paramilitary group be retried before a military tribunal.
 Later, the lieutenant was reported to have escaped from
 detention on a military base.
 In January the human rights division of the Procuraduria was
 officially established by legislation. Although it cannot
 file criminal charges, the Procuraduria can impose
 administrative sanctions, including dismissal, against any
 executive branch employee it determines committed human rights
 violations. The Procuraduria, however, cannot investigate
 abuses by private citizens. During the year this division,
 which handles only allegations of the most serious abuses,
 filed administrative charges against 96 government employees,
 most of them members of the security forces, for alleged
 violations of human rights. By October 1, two of these cases
 had been resolved by the temporary suspension of two employees
 and the dismissal of a police officer and a prison guard.
 Nevertheless, lack of cooperation by the security forces,
 especially the army, limits the effectiveness of the
 aggressive investigations being conducted by the Procuraduria.
 b. Disappearance
 Both disappearances and kidnapings increased in 1990; CINEP
 reported 217 in 1990, compared to 137 in 1989. Most
 disappearances take place in areas of active guerrilla
 insurgency and were due to forced recruitment by the
 guerrillas, flight from such recruitment, extrajudicial
 executions by either the guerrillas or rightwing paramilitary
 groups, or kidnaping for political or nonpolitical motives.
 Military and police personnel were also involved in
 disappearances during 1999. There is credible evidence
 linking members of the security forces to the July 4
 disappearance in Bogota of human rights lawyer Alirio
 Pedraza. At year's end the Procuraduria was still
 investigating this and other instances of possible official
 involvement in disappearances. The inability to resolve most
 of these cases reflects the inadequacy of judicial processes,
 and the lack of cooperation with the Procuraduria shown by the
 police and military.
 Kidnapings carried out by guerrillas, common criminals, and
 narcotraffickers increased significantly in 1990, although
 accurate statistics are unavailable because many of these
 crimes go unreported. A respected news magazine reported 626
 kidnapings in the first 8 months of the year, compared to 666
 in all of 1989. Kidnaping the wealthy for ransom is an
 important source of revenue for the guerrillas. They also
 kidnap for political reasons, sometimes executing victims
 after mock trials. Traffickers, operating with guerrilla
 assistance, were responsible for kidnaping a number of
 prominent journalists in September in an attempt to intimidate
 the Government. On November 25, the ELN kidnaped three
 American oilworkers.
 
 
 553
 COLOMBIA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although torture is prohibited by law, there are reliable
 reports that the police and security forces frequently beat
 and torture detainees, especially in the period immediately
 following detention. An international human rights
 organization has charged that the army tortured and shot to
 death three community leaders in Cauca department. In March,
 16 labor union and political activists and a human rights
 monitor were arrested and apparently tortured by army
 personnel. According to an America's Watch report in October,
 they were physically abused, threatened, and starved for a
 period of several days; the human rights monitor, the wife of
 one of the union activists, was raped. In May the
 Procuraduria began proceedings against an army colonel and
 three other officers after uncovering evidence they were
 responsible for the torture of the 16 activists. At year's
 end the Procuraduria's investigation was continuing. There is
 no evidence of organized, systematic abuse of prisoners in
 long-term detention facilities, although some instances of
 abuse were reported.
 Rightwing paramilitary groups operating in the countryside
 frequently torture victims cruelly before killing them, as
 evidenced by the condition of the bodies found. Torture is
 also a common guerrilla practice. On February 17 three
 peasants were reportedly tortured and then executed by the
 EPL, according to information compiled by CINEP.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The right to challenge the legality of detention is generally
 respected. A person may be arrested if apprehended in the act
 of committing a crime or if an appropriate order of capture
 has been issued by a judge. Normally, the police must inform
 a judge of a person's detention within 24 hours, but during
 1990 hundreds of persons were detained under a state of siege
 decree permitting an incommunicado period of 7 working days.
 A November decree reduced permissible incommunicado detention
 to 5 working days. Incommunicado detention can continue for a
 limited additional period of time with the consent of the
 responsible judge. Even under these decrees a warrant for
 arrest is required, but this requirement is sometimes ignored
 in practice.
 Once a case is turned over to the courts, a judge must, within
 a specified time which varies depending on the type of case,
 decide if there is enough evidence to continue with formal
 criminal proceedings. If there is, the judge issues an order
 of detention, under which bail is possible, or an order of
 preventive detention, under which the person is incarcerated
 until trial. Despite these safeguards, there are instances of
 arbitrary arrest or detention for political reasons. The
 police sometimes arrest persons of modest means for the
 purpose of extorting money for their release.
 Persons are not subject to exile on the basis of their
 political beliefs or for any other reason.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative
 branches in both theory and practice. The right to a public
 trial and due process provided for in the Constitution are
 
 
 554
 COLOMBIA
 frequently not respected in practice. The accused have the
 right to representation by counsel, but in practice
 representation for indigents is grossly inadequate. An
 overburdened judiciary and a traditional reluctance to grant
 bail results in many prisoners never coming to trial; they
 simply serve the minimum sentence applicable to the crimes
 which they are alleged to have committed. According to one
 study, a majority of the prisoners in Colombia have never been
 convicted. Bail is prohibited for the first 210 days of
 detention for suspected terrorists arrested under a 1988
 antiterrorist decree.
 When a serious narcotrafficking case comes to trial, the
 judiciary is subject to intimidation. Many magistrates,
 judges, and attorneys have been suborned, threatened with
 death, killed, or had family members killed because they were
 investigating or trying trafficker cases. Five judges were
 killed in the first half of 1990, apparently by assassins
 hired by the narcotraffickers. Many judges investigating
 rightwing paramilitary violence have also been threatened or
 killed in recent years. In June a court convicted a number of
 paramilitary members for participation in the 1989 La Rochela
 killings of 12 judicial officials (see Section l.a.).
 In a November decree the Government reformed and strengthened
 an existing, but not particularly effective, system of special
 "public order" courts which will now hear all major terrorist
 or narcotrafficking cases. The special courts are designed to
 protect threatened judges better (such as by concealing their
 identity) and process cases more rapidly. The decree also
 strengthens the powers of the security forces to conduct
 judicial investigations without direct judicial supervision.
 Under the reformed system the Procuraduria is charged with
 closely monitoring police investigations in order to prevent
 abuses. Defendants before the public order courts enjoy all
 the procedural rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 A judicial order is generally required for authorities to
 enter a private home, except in case of hot pursuit. However,
 state of siege decrees authorize nonjudicial warrantless
 searches in circumstances of great urgency when a warrant is
 not readily obtainable. Local human rights organizations
 report widespread violations of legal norms regarding searches
 in remote regions, but in urban areas the sanctity of the home
 is generally respected. Peasants frequently charge that they
 are forced to leave their farms by military counterinsurgency
 operations, guerrilla conscription and confiscations, and by
 paramilitary groups.
 Telephone taps and the interception of mail are normally
 allowed only when authorized by a judge. State of siege
 decrees, however, allow specified nonjudicial officials to
 ,authorize taps and the interception of mail during the
 investigation of trafficking and terrorist-related crimes.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 During 1990 there were reports that military aircraft and
 helicopter gunships had bombed and strafed villages. Some
 local human rights groups charged that civilians were
 deliberately targeted. The military responded that the
 
 
 COLOMBIA
 incidents occurred while combating guerrillas and
 narcotraffickers and that noncombatant civilian injuries were
 either inadvertent or unavoidable. Relatively few casualties
 were reported, although these incidents did produce
 significant numbers of temporarily displaced persons. These
 incidents occurred in rural areas where armed clashes are
 common, generally making it difficult to verify conflicting
 claims. During the second half of the year, a Procuraduria
 investigation of one report that the army was bombing and
 strafing civilian villages in the vicinity of Yondo, Antioquia
 department, concluded that charges against the army were
 unfounded.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom- of Speech and Press
 These-constitutionally assured rights are respected. The
 press often vigorously criticizes the Government and its
 leaders. Virtually no governmental restraints or sanctions
 inhibit free expression, and the privately owned print media
 publish a wide spectrum of political views.
 Television frequencies and facilities are owned by the State
 which leases air time to private production companies and
 which imposes some guidelines on coverage of terrorism. For
 example, under a 1988 decree television and radio programs
 cannot identify witnesses to terrorist acts or broadcast
 terrorist incidents live. During a crisis, the Government
 reserves the right to prohibit broadcast media from coverinq
 certain news events. During a November 14 general strike, the
 Government, fearing violence, placed significant temporary
 restrictions on the broadcast media's freedom to cover the
 event. This measure did not affect the print media. All
 candidates for public office receive fair coverage on
 television and radio newscasts. During the 1990 presidential
 campaign the Government provided free and fairly distributed
 time slots on television and radio to all candidates .
 The most serious threat to freedom of expression came from
 narcotraffickers who threatened and killed journalists and
 others who supported extradition or other strong antinarcotics
 policies. In 1990 narcotraffickers continued their assault on
 Bogota's second leading daily, El Espectador, a vigorous
 longtime critic of drug trafficking. On April 20 Hernan
 Tavera Gaona, the newspaper's Medellin distributor, was
 assassinated, and the paper was forced to suspend circulation
 in that city. In September a team of television journalists
 and an editor of the leading Bogota daily, El Tiempo, were
 kidnaped by drug traffickers. In the case of the team of
 journalists, the initial kidnaper, the ELN, subsequently
 turned the team over to traffickers (see Section 1.b.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly is respected. Public meetings
 and demonstrations are normally held without interference.
 Permission is required for demonstrations and is usually
 granted, except when the Government concludes that there is
 imminent danger to public order. After the Jaramillo murder
 (see Section l.a.), Bogota's Mayor, fearing violence, banned
 demonstrations in the city, although the funeral march was
 allowed.
 
 
 556
 COLOMBIA
 Colombians have the constitutional right to form political
 parties, trade associations, unions, clubs, or groups of any
 type which do not advocate violence. Theoretically, the
 Government can deny legal status to newly formed groups, but
 this power is almost never used. Any organization is free to
 associate with international bodies in its field.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and there is
 little religious discrimination in practice. The overwhelming
 majority of Colombians are Catholic, and the predominant
 position of the Catholic Church is established by a treaty
 with the Vatican. The Government permits proselytizing among
 Indians as long as the Indians welcome it and are not induced
 to adopt changes that inhibit their survival on traditional
 lands. The Government requires all missionary groups
 (Catholic and non-Catholic) to keep it informed of their
 activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are free to travel domestically and abroad. In areas
 where military operations against guerrillas are under way,
 civilians can be required to obtain safe conduct passes from
 the military; guerrillas reportedly use similar means to limit
 travel in areas under their control. Emigration is
 unrestricted, and those granted diplomatic asylum in embassies
 have always been allowed to depart the country. There were no
 such incidents in 1990. Expatriates may, by law, repatriate.
 The Government uses accepted United Nations standards to
 determine the status of refugee and asylum seekers.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Colombia has a democratic system of government, and elections
 have generally been conducted fairly and openly for the past
 30 years. Persons are enfranchised at age 18. Public
 employees are forbidden to participate in political campaigns
 but, except for military personnel, may vote. There are no
 restrictions on the participation of women or minorities in
 politics. All parties operate freely without government
 interference.
 The presidential candidate of the M-19 party (Navarro Wolff,
 who replaced the assassinated Carlos Pizarro) finished third
 in the May presidential.election with 13 percent of the vote.
 In addition to the winning Liberal party, the M-19 and two
 competing factions of the Conservative party are represented
 in the Cabinet.
 Section 4 GovernmentalAttitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Colombia is sensitive to its human rights image and cooperates
 with investigations by international and nongovernmental human
 rights groups. One function of the presidential human rights
 adviser is to assist -hese groups. The Government cooperated
 with an Amnesty InteLnational mission early in the year.
 The Government maintains close contact with prominent local
 human rights groups. The members of these groups are
 
 
 COLOMBIA
 sometimes the target of violence by rightwing paramilitary
 groups or members of the police or military forces. Human
 rights lawyer Alirio Pedraza was probably abducted by security
 forces (see Section l.b.). Since 1987, Human Rights Watch has
 registered 30 human rights monitors killed and 3 disappeared.
 CINEP is one of the most respected domestic human rights
 organizations, and information compiled by it has been used by
 private international human rights organizations. Local human
 rights groups, universities, and the Government itself
 regularly sponsor conferences to analyze violence and human
 rights violations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 In July the Government issued a decree implementing the U.N.
 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
 Against Women. Colombia has been a party to the Convention
 for nearly a decade. The decree prohibits discrimination
 against women and declares that women are entitled to equality
 with men with respect "to all economic, social, cultural,
 civil, and political" rights. Much of the decree reflects
 rights long provided for in earlier legislation. For the most
 part, however, neither the decree nor previous legislation
 establishes effective mechanisms to prevent de facto
 discrimination against women.
 Women are entitled to remuneration equal to that of men, but
 this law is more respected by the Government than the private
 sector. Although according to one estimate women comprise
 just over 25 percent of the country's economically active
 population, men still dominate top positions in government and
 industry. Nevertheless, approximately 40 percent of the
 university population is female, and, over the past several
 years, women have increasingly held senior positions,
 especially in government. There are active private
 associations working for women's rights in the workplace and
 in public life.
 Violence directed against women appears to be common, but a
 lack of reliable statistics makes it impossible to gauge its
 extent. Victims of domestic violence, such as wife beating,
 are usually reluctant to file reports or press charges.
 Domestic violence is not usually treated as a serious crime in
 Colombia. The Government does, however, through the Colombian
 Institute of Family Welfare, provide education in domestic
 relations and personal behavior, primarily to lower income
 families.
 Several million blacks form the country's largest racial
 minority. They enjoy all the legal rights of other citizens,
 but they suffer some de facto discrimination. Colombian
 Indians legally enjoy all the rights and privileges of full
 citizenship but also suffer from some de facto
 discrimination. Both blacks and, to a much greater extent,
 Indians are significantly underrepresented among government
 and business leaders. On November 28, three leaders of the
 Aurauca indian tribe were kidnaped and subsequently executed.
 There were allegations that the army was responsible for these
 murders. In a surprisingly strong showing, Indian
 representatives won 2 of 70 seats during the December
 balloting for the Constituent Assembly.
 
 
 COLOMBIA
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution grants workers the right to organize trade
 unions and to strike. Public employees are legally prohibited
 from striking, although this prohibition is not strictly
 enforced. Public law 26 affirms the autonomy of labor
 organizations in producing their own statutes and rules, in
 electing trade union officials, and in administering their own
 activities. The labor code also forbids the dissolution or
 suppression of trade unions by administrative fiat, and
 provides for legal recognition for unions which have the
 requisite number of signatures from a workplace.
 Before carrying out a legal strike, unions must negotiate
 directly with management and engage in conciliation procedures
 if no agreement results. By law, public employees must go to
 binding arbitration if conciliation talks fail; in practice,
 public service unions decide by membership vote if they choose
 to arbitrate or not.
 Nearly three-fifths of the country's 880,000 organized workers
 belong to the Unitary Workers Central (CUT). The CUT is about
 equally divided between a pro-Communist faction (A Luchar),
 which has close informal links with the Communist-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions, and a democratic faction
 (FUTD), which is a member of the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). Most of the remaining unionized
 workers belong to three smaller federations. One of these
 federations is affiliated with the ICFTU, and one is
 affiliated with the World Confederation of Labor.
 A significant obstacle to union activity is the endemic
 violence in Colombia, which takes a heavy toll on the labor
 sector. Some affiliates of the CUT, such as the banana
 workers' unions in Uraba, are led by persons who are active in
 guerrilla movements. Many union members have been killed by
 rightwing paramilitary elements, sometimes with the complicity
 of members of the security forces. Others are believed to
 have lost their lives due to vendettas among insurgent
 groups. Moderate trade union leaders and farm workers have
 also been threatened and assassinated, in some cases by
 guerrillas who are trying to extend their territorial control.
 In its February 1990 report, the Committee of Freedom of
 Association (CFA) of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) once again expressed deep concern over the large number
 of trade union members and leaders who had been murdered or
 had disappeared since 1986, and the continuing climate of
 violence which hinders trade union activities. The CFA
 credited the Government for following up on two of its
 essential recommendations: the adoption of vigorous measures
 to strengthen the judiciary, and the strong measures taken at
 the national level aimed at dismantling the rightwing
 paramilitary groups. It also urged the Government to consider
 reforming the labor code so that strikes could only be banned
 in essential public services.
 In its May-June session, the CFA requested the Government to
 pursue efforts to reinstate a climate in which civil liberties
 and the physical safety of trade unionists could be
 protected. The CFA again cited provisions in the labor law
 which it said were incompatible with ILO Convention 87 on
 freedom of association, because they permit government

 intervention with unions' internal administration and public
 employees' right to strike. The CFA's observations were the
 subject of a "special paragraph" in the 1990 report of the ILO
 Conference Committee on the Application of Conventions aqd
 Recommendations, urging the Government to revise its labor law
 and guarantee the safety of trade unionists.
 On November 14, the major union federations called a general
 strike to protest a package of government labor and economic
 measures. The Gaviria administration declared the planned
 labor action illegal on November 13, arguing that it would
 harm the nation's economy. Except in the telecommunications
 sector, most workers disregarded the call to lay down their
 tools. Several dozen employees reportedly lost their jobs as
 a result'of the walkout. A threatened government crackdown
 did not materialize, and sanctions initiated'against six local
 union boards were in the process of being resolved at year's
 end.
 In December the Congress passed a law designed to revise
 outmoded sections of the 40-year-old labor code and bring
 others in line with ILO standards. The bill makes legal
 recognition automatic for unions which sign up 25 members in a
 workplace. It reduces state intervention in labor-management
 relations, extends maternity benefits from 8 to 12 weeks,
 gives federations the right to assist member unions in
 collective bargaining, and replaces a job tenure clause (which
 was practically unenforceable) with increased indemnification
 for firing workers without just cause.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of workers to organize and to engage in collective
 bargaining enjoys constitutional protection. At the present
 time, unions have been successful in organizing only the
 largest firms and the public services, which include less than
 8 percent of Colombia's economically active population.
 In the private sector, workers have the right to bargain
 collectively; however, because of high unemployment, they have
 limited bargaining power. The use of strikebreakers is
 prohibited by law, and generous severance benefits tend to
 discourage management from firing union militants. This norm
 is effectively ignored by many small and medium-size
 enterprises. In September the Congress passed into law a bill
 forbidding the firing of any employee during contract
 negotiations.
 Colombian labor law is applied uniformly throughout the
 country, including the export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is legally prohibited, and this
 prohibition is respected in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law prohibits the employment of children in most jobs
 before the age of 14, particularly when such employment might
 interfere with schooling. This provision is respected in
 larger enterprises and major cities. However, the extensive
 informal economy is effectively outside government control.
 According to a 1987 study, approximately 2.5 million children
 under 15 years of age work in the informal sector for low pay
 
 
 560
 COLOMBIA
 under poor conditions with little protection from the labor
 code.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government annually sets a national minimum wage which
 serves as an important benchmark for wage bargaining. The
 minimum wage, which the Government increased in December to
 about $89 per month, is insufficient to maintain an acceptable
 standard of living. Labor experts estimate that at least half
 of the work force is paid the minimum wage or less.
 Enforcement is lax, in part due to the small number of Labor
 Ministry inspectors.
 The labor code regulates the hours of labor and other work
 conditions. While the 8-hour day is standard in larger
 companies, the workweek for most Colombians is about 48
 hours. A standard week of five 8-hour days remains an
 important long-term goal of Colombian trade unions.
 Workers' occupational safety and health are extensively
 regulated. The use of protective clothing and ventilation is
 required, as are first aid and fire fighting equipment at the
 job site, sanitary facilities and potable water, and
 compensation for injuries. These regulations apply to the
 larger agricultural enterprises as well as industry and
 mining. However, exemptions for small companies, the frequent
 subcontracting of workers, and general enforcement
 difficulties leave large numbers of workers outside the
 protection of the law.
 The Government is endeavoring to improve regulatory
 enforcement, and improved working conditions are a priority
 goal of trade unions. Violations appear to be more frequent
 among the newer, smaller industries. More than half of all
 the violators are concentrated in the commercial sector and in
 the restaurant and hotel industries, while almost one-fourth
 are in the manufacturing sectbr. Labor regulations most
 frequently violated by management are those which require
 mandatory affiliation of workers with the Social Security
 Institute, observance of minimum salary levels, timely payment
 of salaries, and maintenance of hygienic conditions and
 occupational safety standards.
