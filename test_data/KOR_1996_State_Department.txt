 REPU3LIC OF KOREA
 The Republic of Korea is governed by a directly elected president and a unicam-
 eral legislature selected by both direct and proportional voting. The judiciary oper-
 ates independently of the executive branch. The Government held legislative elec-
 tions in April and continued to reform the political system, creating a special legisla-
 tive committee composed of assembly members from ruling and opposition parties
 to revise election laws and investigate campaign irregularities.
 Responsibility for maintaining internal security lies with the National Security
 Planning Agency (NSP), the Korean National Police (KNP), and the Defense Secu-
 rity Command (DSC). Legislation passed in 1993 restricted the NSP from interfer-
 ing in domestic politics; and gave it investigative authority only in cases involving
 terrorism, espionage, and international crime organizations. In December the Gov-
 ernment revised this law to allow the NSP to investigate domestic organizations
 that are viewed as supporting the North Korean Government. There continued to
 be credible reports of some infigements of suspects' rights by NSP officials during
 the interrogation process.
 After a period of sustained economic growth averaging about 9 percent per year,
 the economy has slowed somewhat, with 1996 economic growth projected at 7 per-
 cent. This slowdown in the rate of growth is attributable to dampened demand for
 key exports, declining terms of trade, and lower investment growth. While economic
 growth is still robust, Korea continues to face issues of declining competitiveness,
 a labor shortage, an inefficient agricultural sector, and inadequate infrastructure.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there were problems in some areas. The use or threatened use of the National Secu-
 rity Law  (SL) continued to infringe upon citizens civil iberties, including the right
 to free expression. There was no progress toward reform of the NSL,~ although
 judges appointed since the onset of democratic government demonstrated their inde-
 pendnce in several cases in which they refused to authorize prosecution of dis-
 sidents under the NSL or acquitted defendants charged under its prvisions. The
 Ministry of Justice continued to implement guidelines requiring that suspects be
 told at the time of arrest of their right to remain silent and their right to a lawyer.
 Nevertheless, there continued to be credible reports that, in some instances, police
 deprived suspects of timely access to counsel or subjected detainees to verbal
 threats, physical abuse, and sleep deprivation. Some human rights groups alleged
 that police used excessive violence in confrontations with student demonstrators.
 Women continued to face legal and societal discrimination. Violence against women
 and physical abuse remain serious problems. There is still insufficient legal redress
 for these problems. Ethnic minorities face legal and societal discrimination. In De-
 cember labor statutes were amended in an effort to meet international standards
 for worker rights and to increase labor flexibility. However, key worker rights provi-
 sions  were  either  delayed  or  deleted  from  the  final legislation, while
 promanagement labor market changes are to become effective March 1997. The
 raor bill encountered strong opposition from Korean labor organizations, which
 launched demonstrations andstres to protest its passage. After opposition legisla-
 tors physically prevented a vote on this bill, it, as well as the revised NSP statute,
 was passed in a secretive, predawn National Assembly session with no opposition
 legisators present.
 The Government continued its surveillance of some released political prisoners
 and continued to require released poltical priseners to make regular reports to the
 police under the Social Surveillance Law. However, the Government still has not au-
 thorized independent investigations of the cases of some prisoners who received sn-
 
 
 699
 tences on charges believed to have been fabricated by previous governments. Some
 of these prisoners reportedly were subjected to torture to extract confessions and to
 trials that did not meet international standards of fairness.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajucicial killings by the police or military. One student and a policeman died
 during demonstrations. No Su Sok, a student at Seours Yonsei University who par-
 ticipated in a demonstration during the spring near the campus, was stricken by
 heart failure while fleeing from police. Activists maintained that bruises on No s
 body suggested that the heart attack may have been induced by police violence.
 However, medical authorities who examined the body attributed Nos death to a
 heart attack. A policeman trying to control a demonstration at Yonsei University
 in August died after rocks thrown by students struck him in the head (see Section
 2.b.).
 On September 18, a North Korean submarine attempting to infiltrate an armed
 reconnaissance team into South Korean territory ran aground off the South Korean
 coast. The 26 North Korean personnel onboard abandoned the vessel. Eleven crew
 members were apparently killed by the submarine's complement of highly trained
 infiltrators in order to prevent their capture. Of the surviving infiltrators, 13 were
 killed in enounters with South Korean security forces, 1 was captured alive, and 1
 remains unaccounted for. Nine members of the South Korean military and a police
 officer were killed in the search for the infiltrators. Three civilian bystanders were
 murdered by the infiltrators. One civilian was killed accidentally by South Korean
 military personnel.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Government has ordered investigating authorities to protect the human rights
 of suspects, and allegations of abuse by authorities of those in custody for question-
 ing continued to decline. Nonetheless, prosecutors continued to place much empha-
 sis on securing convictions through confessions. In spite of government directives
 discouraging sleep deprivation as a technique for obtaining confessions, there con-
 tinued to be reports of poice questioning suspects through the night and, reportedly
 in some cases, verbally or physically abusing suspects, including beatings, threats,
 and sexual intimidation in the course of arrest and police interrogation. Some
 human rights groups alleged that police used excessive violence in quelling disturb-
 ances that resulted from student demonstrations in August (see Section 2.b.).
 The Government continued to consider cases in which former detainees argued
 that they deserved redress for torture suffered in the past. However, the Govern-
 ment has failed to provide an effective mechanism for redress, such as an independ-
 ent body to investigate complaints of past human rights violations. It remained rel-
 atively rare for officials accused of abuse or harassment of suspects to be prosecuted.
 Prison conditions are Spartan. Prison diets are adequate, but the prisons offer lit-
 tle protection against cold in winter and heat in the summer. Consequently, some
 prisoners claim that the conditions have damaged their health. There have been a
 few claims that prison guards have used excessive force or have needlessly put pris-
 oners in manacles and that medical care for prisoners has been inadequate. Prisoner
 access to reading materials and television broadcasts has improved significantly in
 recent years. There is little independent monitoring of prison conditions, although
 representatives of human rights groups may visit certain prisoners at the discretion
 of the prison warden.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Korean law is often vague, and prosecu-
 trs have wide latitude to interpret the law. The NSL defines espionage in broad
 terms, and permits the authorities to detain and arrest persons who commit acts
 viewed as supportive of North Korea and therefore dangerous to the Republic of
 Korea. Authorities arrested persons not oaly spyg on behalf of North Korea but
 also those who praised North Korea, its former eader Kim II Sung, or the DPRK's
 self-reliance" ("juche") political philosophy. The United Nations Human Rights Com-
 mittee has termed the NSL "a major obstacle to the full realization of the rights
 enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights." The Govern-
 ment arrested over 200 dissidents under the NSL during the year, accusing most
 of them of trying to undermine democracy by aiding North Korea.
 Article 7 of the NSL permits the imprisonment for up to 7 years of anyone who
 "with the knowledge that he might endanger the existence or security of the State
 or the basic order of free democracy, praised, encouraged, propagandized for, or
 sided with the activities of an antistate organization." The legal standard for know-
 
 
 700
 ig what might endanger the existence of the State is vague. Consequently, a num-
 ber of Koreans have been arrested for what appeared to be peaceful expression of
 opposig views. For example, in February singer Lee Run Jin and publisher Won
 YongHo were                 publishing a songbook that allegedly praised North
 Korea.
 The Government's rationale for retaining the NSL is that North Korea is activel
 trying to subvert the Government and society and that special circumstances call
 for limiting some forms of expression to block the greater danger to freedom and
 democracy posed by totalitarianism. The effect sometimes is to relieve the Govern-
 ment of the burden of proof in a court of law that any particular speech or action
 does, in fact, threaten the nation's security. Citizens continued to be prosecuted for
 unauthorized travel to North Korea (see Section 2.d.).
 The Criminal Code requires warrants to be issued by judges in cases of arrest,
 detention, seizure, or search, except if the person is apprehended while committing
 a criminal act, or if a judge is not available and the authorities believe that the sus-
 pect may destroy evidence or escape capture if not quickly arrested. In such emer-
 gency cases, judges must issue arrest warrants within 48 hours after apprehension,
 or, ira court is not located in the county, in 72 hours. Police may detain suspects
 who voluntarily come in for questioning for up to 6 hours but must notify the sus-
 pects' families. The police generally respected these legal requirements.
 Upon issuance of an arrest warrant, the security services normally must release
 suspects after 30 days unless an indictment is issued. Hence, detainees are a rel-
 atively small percentage of the total prison population.
 The Constitution specifically provides for the right to representation by an attor-
 ney, but attorneys are not allowed to be present during a police interrogation. The
 Government began in 1993 to permit suspects to consult with "duty layer " during
 breaks in the interrogation. The Justice Ministry also issued guidelines last year re-
 quiringpolice to inform suspects at the time of arrest about their right to be rep-
 resentedby a lawyer. However, there continued to be complaints that access to a
 lawyer was restricted during this phase. There is a functioning system of bal, but
 human rights lawyers say that bail is gnrlynot ganted in cases involving seri-
 ous offenses, and, even when the offense is relatively minor, bail often will not be
 granted unless the victim of the alleged crime agrees to the bail request.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Triai.-The Constitution provides for an in dependent judi-
 ciary. The President appoints the Chief Justice and most justices of the Constitu-
 tional Court. Although judges do not receive life appointments, in recent years the
 judiciary has shown increasing independence. Judges cannot be fired or transferred
 for political reasons. In a notable instance of judicial independence, a district court
 judge in Pusan ruled in January that a studet activist's exchange of faxes with
 North Korean students and chanting of slogans at demonstrations that echoed
 North Korean propaganda were not sufficient grounds to convict him of violating the
 NSL. In July a Seoul District Criminal Court rejected an arrest warrant request for
 Catholic Priest Moon (Thong Hyon, who met with North Korean figures in Poland.
 The Court ruled that authorities had not presented evidence that Moon's actions un-
 dermined freedom or democracy in the South Korea.
 The judicial system has lcal ourts p resided over by judges who render verdicts
 in all cases. There is no trial by jury. Defendants can appeal a verdict to a district
 appeals court and to the Supreme Court. Constitutional challenges can be taken to
 the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court, which began operation in 1988,
 continued to grow in its role of interpreting the Constitution.
 The Constitution provides defendants a number of rights in criminal trials, in-
 cluding presumption of innocence, protection against self-incrimination, freedom
 from retroactive laws and double jeopardy, the right to a speedy trial, and the right
 of appeal. When a person is physically detained, the initial trial must be completed
 within 6 months of arrest. These rights are generally observed. Trials are open to
 the public, but the judge may restrict attendance if he believes spectators may seek
 to disrupt the proceedings.
 Judges generally allow considerable scope for examination of witnesses by both
 the prosecution and defense. Cases involving national security and criminal cases
 are tried by the same courts. Although convictions are rarely overturned, appeals
 ofen result in reduced sentences. Death sentences are automatically appealed.
 Human rights groups believe that many dissidents tried under past military gov-
 ernments were sentenced to long p rison terms during the 1970's and 1980's on
 trumped up charges of spying for North Korea. Furthermore, these persons, dozens
 of whom are still in jail, reportedly had been held incommunicado for up to 60 days
 after their arrest, subjected to extreme forms of torture, forced to make "confes-
 sions," and convicted after trials that did not conform to international standards for
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 a fair trial. Political prisoners have been denied early parole because they refused
 to renounce real or alleged communist beliefs. Some released political prisoners
 were required to report their activities regularly to the police.
 In a landmark decision this year, former presidents Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae
 Woo and several of their close associates were convicted for their roles in the mili-
 tary takeover of the Government in 1979 and 1980. Chun, who argued that the
 court proceedings were unconstitutional because the statute of limitations had ex-
 pired for these offenses, was sentenced to death. Roh was sentenced to a prison term
 of more than 20 years. These sentences were subsequently reduced to life in prison
 and 17 years respectively.
 It is difficult to estimate the number of political prisoners, because it is not clear
 whether particular persons were arrested for merely exercising the rights of free
 speech or association or were detained for committing acts of violence or espionage.
 me uman rights monitors estimate the number of political prisoners at over 400.
 However, these monitors' definition of political prisoner often includes all persons
 imprisoned for acts that were politically motivated, without distinction as to wheth-
 er the acts themselves included violence or other criminal behavior. The number of
 political prisoners and detainees as defined by international standards appears to
 number under 200.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In gen-
 eral the Government honors the integrity of the home and family. In the past, the
 security services conducted varying degrees of surveillance, including wiretaps, of
 political dissidents. The Antiwiretap Law and the law to reform the NSP were de-
 signed to curb government surveillance of civilians and appear largely to have suc-
 ceeded. The Antiwiretap Law lays out the conditions under which the monitoring
 of telephone calls, mail, and other forms of communication are legal. It requires gov-
 ernment officials to secure a judge's permission before placing wiretaps, or, in the
 event of an emergency, soon after placing them, and it provides for jail terms for
 those who violate this law. Some human rights groups argue that a considerable
 amount of illegal wiretapping is still taking place and assert that the lack of an
 independent body to investigate whether police have employed illegal wiretaps
 hinders the effectiveness of the Antiwiretap Law.
 Citizens are not allowed to listen to North Korean radio in their homes or read
 books published in North Korea if the Government determines that they are doing
 so for the purpose of helping North Korea. Student groups make plausible claims
 that government informants are posted around university campuses. Persons with
 backgrounds as political or labor activists may find it difficult to obtain some forms
 of employment or advance in such fields as government, broadcast media, and edu-
 cation.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While most political discourse is unrestricted,
 under the NSL the Government limits the expression of ideas that authorities con-
 sider Communist or pro-North Korean. Broad interpretations of the NSL allow for
 restrictions on the peaceful expression of dissenting views.
 While the Government has abandoned direct control over the news media, it con-
 tinues to exercise considerable indirect influence. Some officials reportedly lobby
 journalists aggressively to discourage them from writing stories critical of the Gov-
 ernment. In addition, the latent threat of tax investigations against parent media
 companies is widely believed to encourage newspapers and broadcasters to soften
 criticism. Moreover, while the Government's anticorruption campaign curtailed poli-
 ticians' payments of money to reporters, it did not eliminate these payments. Never-
 theless, press criticism of the Government is extensive in all fields, and authorities
 have not used repressive measures to stop media reporting. Although most radio
 and television stations are state-supported, the stations maintain a considerable de-
 gree of editorial independence in their news coverage.
 Journalists allege that the libel laws are used to harass publications for articles
 that are unflattering but not necessarily untrue. In January a Seoul district court
 ordered the Hangyoreh Sinmun newspaper to pay a libel award of approximately
 $500,000 to President Kim's son, Kim Hyun Chul. The court maintained that the
 paper had not adequately checked its facts before reporting that the President's son
 ad accepted bribes. Many reporters criticized the award, saying that the court had
 been influenced by government pressure. However, other credible observers noted
 that Korean journalism suffers from sensationalism and insufficient fact checking,
 and they argued that the judge in this case appropriately penalized the reporter for
 basing serious defamatory charges on a single source whose allegations could have
 been refuted by checking with other principals involved.
 
 
 702
 Prosecutors continued to indict dissidents under the NSL for producing, selling,
 or distributing pro-North Korean or pro-Communist materials. Court precedents
 allow Koreans to possess these kinds of publications for purely academic use, profit,
 or curiosity, but not with the intent of subverting the State. Prosecutors are given
 wide discretion in determining motives for possessing or publishing such material.
 The Government continued to allow, within its guidelines, an increase in media
 coverage of North Korea. Television networks continued to broadcast edited versions
 of North Korean television programs. The media extensively reported on United
 States and South Korean talks with North Korean officials.
 The Government Censorship Board, which screens movies for sexual or violent
 content before release, has followed more liberal guidelines in recent years. Con-
 sequently, a broader range of films has been released to the public.
 In 1994 authorities began investigating eight Kyongsang University professors on
 the grounds that their textbook on Korean society endorsed North Korean ideology.
 This investigation was regarded by much of the scholarly community as a serious
 infringement on academic freedom. However, prosecutors who sought to arrest sev-
 eral of the professors under the NSL were denied warrants by a judge who decided
 that authorities had not provided evidence of the scholars' pro-Communist activities.
 This investigation has been closed, and no instances of prosecution for scholarly
 writing were reported in 1996. However, student groups plausibly report the pres-
 ence of government informants on university campuses (see Section 1.f.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Law on Assembly and
 Demonstrations prohibits assemblies considered likely to undermine public order.
 The law forbids outside interference in peaceful assemblies approved by the authori-
 ties and requires that the Police be notified in advance of demonstrations of all
 types, including political rallies. Police must notify organizers if they consider the
 event impermissible under this law. The Government forbade some demonstrations,
 such as a rally of students at the border of North and South Korea, that authorities
 believed were orchestrated by North Korea to undermine the State.
 In August thousands of student demonstrators, led by the National Federation of
 Student Councils, occupied buildings on the Yonsei University campus after being
 denied permission to hold a rally at the border of North and South Korea. Departing
 from its usual practice of not intervening in protests contained within university
 campuses, the Government sent a massive police force onto the campus to remove
 demonstrators. The students resisted using steel pipes, rocks, and firebombs. In the
 confrontations at the university, which lasted for more than a week, one policemen
 was killed and scores of students and police were injured. Some human rights
 groups alleged that police used excessive violence in quelling the disturbance. How-
 ever, most observers also acknowledged that the tactics of protesting students were
 violent and provocative. Associations, except those whose aim is deemed by the Gov-
 ernment to be the overthrow of the State, operate freely.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this provision in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Most citizens are allowed to move freely throughout the country. How-
 ever, police may restrict the movements of some former prisoners. Foreign travel is
 generally unrestricted, but travel to North Korea must be approved by the Govern-
 ment. To obtain approval, potential visitors must demonstrate to authorities that
 their trip does not have a political purpose-that is, to praise North Korea or criti-
 cize the South Korean Government. Travelers to North Korea who do not receive
 government permission are likely to be arrested upon their return to South Korea.
 For example, Chong Win Ju, a student at Inchon University, and Lee Hye Jong, a
 student at Catholic University, were sentenced in the spring to 3 years in jail for
 visiting North Korea in August 1995 to attend a "unification rally."
 In the past, the Government forbade some Koreans convicted of politically related
 crimes from returning to Korea, and some citizens still face sanctions if they return.
 In 1994 the NSP lifted the entry ban on composer Yun I Sang, a dissident who had
 been living in Berlin for a number of years. However, the Government required that
 he refrain from any political activity while in Korea and that he give an accounting
 of his political activities overseas before authorities would allow him into the coun-
 try. Yun refused these conditions and decided against returning to South Korea.
 The Government cooperates with the UN. High Comissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Government guidelines pro-
 vide for offering temporary refuge in the case of a mass influx of asylum seekers
 (sometimes referred to as "first asylum"). However, the issue of provision of first
 asylum did not arise in 1996, and there were no reports of forced return of persons
 to a country where they had a fear of persecution.
 
 
 703
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to elect their own government. The Constitution, as
 amended in 1987, provides for the direct election of the President and for a mixed
 system of direct and proportional election of legislators to the unicameral National
 Assembly. The President serves a single 5-year term and may not be reelected. Na-
 tional Assembly members serve 4-year terms. All citizens 20 years of age or above
 have the right to vote, and elections are held by secret ballot. Kim Young Sam, who
 took office in February 1992, is Korea's first chief executive in nearly 30 years not
 to have a career military background.
 Because of cultural traditions and discrimination, women occupy few important
 positions in government. In the current and past governments, the only woman in
 the Cabinet has been the Second Minister for Political Affairs, whose portfolio is
 Women's Affairs. In addition, in 1995 a woman was elected mayor of Kwangmyong
 City, and a female legislator chairs one of the special committees of the National
 Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several nongovernmental private organizations are active in promoting human
 rights, and they operate without government restriction. Chief among these groups
 are the Lawyers for a Democratic Society, Sarangbang, the Human Rights Commit-
 tee of the National Council of Churches in Korea, the Korean Bar Association, and
 "Mingahyup," an association of the families of political prisoners. These groups pub-
 lish reports on the human rights situation in Korea and make their views known
 beth inside and outside the country. Government and ruling party officials generally
 have been willing to meet with international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and equal opportunity statutes forbid discrimination on the
 basis of race, sex, religion, disability, or social status, and the Government respects
 these provisions. However, traditional attitudes limit opportunities for women and
 the disabled. Ethnic minorities face bath legal and societal discrimination.
 Women.-Violence against women remains a problem, and some women's rights
 groups maintain that such violence, including spousal abuse, has worsened in the
 past few years. The law does not provide adequate protection to victims of abuse.
 Raperemained a serious problem, with 6,173 cases reported in 1994 (the last year
 hstatistica are avalable). Many incidents of rape go unreported because of
 the stigma associated with being a rape victim. The activities of a number of wom-
 en's groups have increased awareness of the importance of reporting and prosecut-
 ing rapes as well as offenses such as sexual harassment in the workplace. According
 to women's rights groups, cases involving sexual harassment or rape generally go
 unprosecuted, and perpetrators, if convicted, often receive very lenient sentences.
 The amended Family Law, which went into effect in 1991, permits women to head
 a household, recognizes a wife's right to a portion of the couple's property, and al-
 lows a woman to maintain greater contact with her children after a divorce. Al-
 though the revisions helped abused women, divorce remains a social taboo, and
 there is little government or private assistance for divorced women. These factors,
 plus the fact that divorced women have limited employment opportunities and have
 difficulty remarrying, lead some women to stay in abusive situations. The Govern-
 ment has created some shelters for battered women and increased the number of
 child care facilities, providing women in abusive situations with more options, but
 women's rights groups say that they fall far short of dealing effectively with the
 problem.
 A conservative Confucian tradition has left women subordinate to men socially
 and economically. There has been some limited and gradual change in social mores
 and attitudes affecting women; for example, women have full access to education,
 and a few have become government officials and hold elected office. Despite the pas-
 sage of equal employment opportunity legislation in 1988, however, few women
 work as company executives or leading officials in government. The Women's Affairs
 Ministry continued its efforts to expand employment opportunities for women, and
 during the year the air force implemented a program to encourage women to become
 pilots and seek other senior positions.
 Children.-The Government ontinued to devote an increasing share of the overall
 budget to social expenditures, which includes those related to the welfare of chil-
 dren. High quality elementary education is available to all Korean children free of
 
 
 704
 charge, and most obtain a good quality secondary education. High quality health
 care facilities are widely avmable to children.
 Child abuse does not appear to be a significant problem or policy issue. Child
 abuse has not been studied extensively, and statistics on such abuse are limited.
 About 150 cases were reported during the year. Although experts believe that a
 number of cases go unreported, instances of child abuse still appear to be relatively
 rare. The Seoul metropolitan government runs a children's counseling center, which
 investigates reports of abuse, counsels families, and cares for runaway children. In
 the absence of a specific law against child abuse, however, it is not possible to pros-
 ecute and punish child abusers unless they commit a crime punishable under a sep-
 arate law.
 The traditional preference for male children continues, although it is less evident
 among people in their twenties and thirties. Although the law bans fetal sex testing,
 such testing and the subsequent termination of pregnancies with female fetuses fre-
 quently occur. The Government has expressed concern at the widening disparity be-
 tween male and female birth rates.
 People With Disabilities.-Although new measures aimed at creating opportunities
 for the disabled have been taken, public facilities for their everyday care and use
 remained inadequate. However, there is no legal discrimination against disabled
 persons in employment, education, or in the provision of other state services.
 In 1995 the Government expanded job training programs, medical benefits, and
 welfare facilities for disabled citizens. Since 1991 firns with over 300 employees
 have been required by law either to hire disabled workers or pay a fee. After human
 rights groups publicized a survey indicating that most companies either paid the fee
 or evaded the law, the Labor Ministry announced it would increase the subsidies
 provided to companies that hire the disabled. New public buildings are required to
 include facilities for the disabled, such as ramp access to entrances, a wheelchair
 lift, and special parking spaces.
 National /RaciallEthnic Minorities.-The Republic of Korea is a racially homo-
 geneous country with no ethnic minorities of significant number. Citizenship is
 based on blood, not location of birth, and Koreans must show as proof their family
 enealogy. Ethnic Chinese born and resident in Korea cannot obtain citizenship or
 ecome public servants and may have difficulty being hired by some major corpora-
 tions. Due to legal as well as societal discrimination, many formerly resident ethnic
 Chinese have emigrated to other countries since the 1970's. Amerasian children are
 usually able to obtain Korean citizenship, and no legal discrimination against them
 exists. Informal discrimination, however, is prevalent, making it more difficult for
 Amerasians to succeed in academia, business, or government.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution gives workers, with the exception
 of public sector employees and teachers, the right to free association. There are
 some blue-collar public sector unions in railroads, telecommunications, the postal
 service, and the national medical center. The Trade Union Law specifies that only
 one union is permitted at each place of work and that all unions are required to
 notify the authorities when formed or dissolved. About 10 percent of workers belong
 to a union.
 In the past, the Government did not formally recognize labor federations that
 were not affiliated with the country's two legally recognized labor groupings-the
 Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) and the Independent Korean Federa-
 tion of Clerical and Financial Workers. In the past several years, however, the
 Labor Ministry officially recognized some independent white-collar federations rep-
 resenting hospital workers, journalists, and office workers at construction firms and
 government research institutes. The courts ruled in 1992 that affiliation with the
 F     is not required to be registered as a legal labor federation. In practice, labor
 federations not formally recognized by the Labor Ministry exist and work without
 government interference, unless authorities considered their involvement in labor
 disputes disruptive. In May the President created a presidential commission to con-
 sider additional changes in the labor laws, including granting legal recognition to
 the dissident Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU). In October, however,
 in connection with a pending decision on its application for membership in the Orga-
 nization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and in anticipation of
 specific recommendations from the Commission, the Government pledged to reform
 its labor legislation so as to achieve greater conformity with internationally recog-
 nized labor standards.
 In December the National Assembly passed labor reform legislation with provi-
 sions designed both to enhance worker rights and increase labor market flexibility.
 However, last-minute changes to the legislation by the National Assembly delayed
 
 
 the legalization of multiple trades unions by at least 3 years and deleted provisions
 that would have allowed teachers to form associations, thus limiting the worker
 rights enhancements. The new law also maintained certain restrictions preventing
 unauthorized "third-parties" from becoming involved in labor disputes and did not
 address organizing rights for white-collar government employees. In contrast, the
 promanagement changes concerning Korea s labor market flexibility changes (in-
 cluding provisions making layoffs easier, increasing employer flexibility in establish-
 ing employee work schedules, and permitting the replacement of strikers) are to be-
 come effective March 1, 1997. The bill encountered strong opposition from labor
 which launched demonstrations and strikes to protest its passage.
 The Government arrested and tried unionists it viewed as acting as "third par-
 ties" in instigating labor disputes. Cho Myung Lae and Kim Seung Hyun, officers
 of the Korean Federation of Metalworkers Unions, were arrested in June for their
 alleged role in fomenting a dispute at the Korea Textile Company. Kwon Yong Kil
 and Yang Kyu Hun, respectively Chairman and Vice President of the KCTU, both
 were tried for their role as third parties" in the 1994 subway and railroad strikes.
 Authorities charged that they had incited illegal and violent strikes in the public
 sector. Human rights groups argued that Kwon was arrested for attempting to exer-
 cise the legitimate functions of a trade union federation leader. Several dozen work-
 ers were arrested for "interference with business" and for committing criminal vio-
 lence during strikes. The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU)
 alleges that over 40 trade unionists were imprisoned for prolonged periods for var-
 ious trade union activities during the year.
 The Government continued the ban on labor union activities by public and private
 schoolteachers, arguing that the teachers' union (Chonkyojo) is essentially a political
 organization with radical aims. The Government continued its program of ireinstat-
 ing those among the 1,500 fired teachers who agreed to resign from Chonkyojo.
 Only two members are required to form a union. Election and labor laws forbid
 unions from donating money to political parties or participating in election cam-
 paigns. However, trade unionists have circumvented the ban by temporarily resign-
 ing from their union posts and running for office on the ticket of a political party
 or as independents.
 Strikes are prohibited in government agencies, state-run enterprises, and defense
 industries. By law, unions in enterprises determined to be of "public interest," in-
 cluding public transportation, utilities, public health, banking, broadcasting, and
 communications, canbe ordered to submit to government-ordered arbitration in lieu
 of striking. In practice, however, the Government rarely imposes arbitration. The
 number of labor disputes has declined in recent years. According to Labor Ministry
 statistics, 88 strikes occurred in 1995, the last year for which complete data are
 available. The Labor Dispute Adjustment Act requires unions to notify the Labor
 Ministry of their intention to strike, and it mandates a 10-day "cooling-off period"
 before a work stoppa    y legally begin. (The cooling-off period is 15 daays in pub-
 lic interest sectors. Labor laws prohibit retribution against workers who have con-
 ducted a legal strike and allow workers to fie complaints of unfair labor practices
 against employers.
 Both theTKTU and the KCTU are affiliated with the ICFTU. Most of the FKTU's
 20 constituent federations maintain affiliations with international trade secretar-
 iats, as does the KCTU Metalworkers Council. In response to freedom of association
 complaints lodged by dissident and independent unions, the International Labor Or-
 ganization (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Association issued a report at midyear
 recommending that the Government bring Korean labor law and policy up to inter-
 national worker rights standards in accordance with the principle of free associa-
 tion.
 In recent years, the Government has cultivated a more neutral stance in labor dis-
 putes. Authorities rarely sent police to quell labor disturbances, and there were no
 reports of employer-hired squads assaulting workers in 1996.
 Since July 1991, South Korea has been suspended from the U.S. Overseas Private
 Investment Corpotion (OPIC) insurance programs because of the Government's in-
 fringements on freedom of association and other worker rights.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution and the
 Trade Union Law provide for the right of workers to collective bargaining and collec-
 tive action. This law also empowers workers to file complaints of unfair labor prac-
 tices against employers who interfere with union organizing or practice discrimina-
 tion against union members. Employers found guilty of  air ractices can be re-
 quired to reinstate workers who were fired for union activities.
 Extensive collective bargaining is practiced, even with unions whose federations
 are not legally recognize[ by the Government. The labor laws do not extend the
 right to organize and bargain collectively to government employees, including em-
 
 
 706
 ployees of state or public-run enterprises, defense industries, and public and private
 schoolteachers.
 Korea has no independent system of labor courts. The central and local labor com-
 missions form a semiautonomous agency of the Labor Ministry that adjudicate dis-
 putes in accordance with the Labor Dispute Adjustment Law. Each labor commis-
 sion is composed of equal representation from labor (represented by the FKTU),
 management, and "the public interest." Lcal labor commissions are empowered to
 decide on remedial measures in cases involving unfair labor practices and to medi-
 ate and, in some situations, arbitrate labor disputes. Arbitration can be made com-
 pulsory in sectors of the economy (e.g., utilities and transportation) that are deemed
 essential to public welfare.
 The Trade Union Law and Labor Dispute Adjustment Law forbid third-party
 intervention in union and labor disputes by federations not recognized by the Gov-
 ernment (such as the dissident federation, the KCTU), but they allow recognized
 labor federations, principally the FRU, its affiliates, and some independent white-
 collar federations, to assist member unions. The ban on third-party intervention also
 a pplies to mediation efforts by lawyers, experts, and others who have the consent
 of both labor and management.
 Enterprises in Korea s two export processing zones (EPZ's), had been designated
 by the Government as public interest enterprises. Workers in these enterprises,
 whose rights to organize were formerly restricted, have gradually been given the
 rights enjoyed by workers in other sectors of the economy.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution provides that no
 person shall be punished, placed under preventive restrictions, or subjected to invol-
 untary labor, except as provided by law and through lawful procedures. Forced or
 compulsory labor is not condoned by the Government and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children-The Labor Standards Law pro-
 hibits the employment of persons under the age of 13 without a special employment
 ertificate from the LaborMiistry. Because there is compulsory education until the
 age of 13, few special employment certificates are issuedor full-time employment.
 Some children are allowed to hold part-time jobs such as selling newspapers. To
 gain employment, children under 18 years of age must have written approval from
 their parents or guardians. Employers may require minors to work only a limited
 number of overtime hours and are prohibited from employing them at night without
 special permission from the Labor Ministry. Child labor laws and regulations are
 clear and usually enforced when violations are found, but the Government employs
 too few inspectors to carry out regular inspections.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Wor.-The Government implemented a minimum
 wage law in 1988. The minimum wage level is reviewed annually. In September the
 minimum wage was raised to approximately $1.70 (1,400 won) per hour. Companies
 with fewer than 10 employees are exempt from this law. Due to Korea's tight labor
 market, however, most firms pay wages well above the minimum to attract and re-
 tain workers. The FKTU and other unions continue to claim that the current mini-
 mum wage does not meet the minimum requirements of urban workers. In fact, a
 worker earning the minimum wage would have difficulty in providing a decent
 standard of living for himself and his family, despite the fringe benefits such as
 transportation expenses with which Korean companies normally supplement sala-
 ries. (The Government notes that the money an average blue-collar worker takes
 home in overtime and bonuses significantly raises the total compensation package.)
 According to the Ministry of Labor, 3.3 percent of the population lived below the
 poverty level in 1995.
 Foreign workers, most of whom come from China, the Philippines, Bangladesh,
 Nepal, and Pakistan, often face difficult working conditions. The Government has
 sought to ameliorate the problems of illegal workers by creating a program whereby
 about 60,000 foreign workers were allowed to enter Korea legally to work at estab-
 lished wages and with legal safeguards. Illegal foreign workers, who probably num-
 ber more than 100,000, still suffer significant hardships in the workplace. It is dif-
 ficult for illegal workers to seek relief for loss of pay or unsatisfactory living and
 working conditions because they always face the threat of being deported. The Gov-
 ernment has, however, established counseling centers that hear complaints from il-
 legal foreign workers facing deportation proceedings about such issues as overdue
 wages and industrial accidents. Other foreigners working as language teachers have
 complained that language institutes that hired them frequently violated employ-
 ment contracts and that the legal system provided insufficient redress for such
 abuses.
 Amendments to the Labor Standards Law passed in 1989 brought the maximum
 regular workweek down to 44 hours, with provision for overtime to be compensated
 at a higher wage. The law also provides for a 24-hour rest period each week. How-
 
 
 ever, labor gups claim that the Government does not adequately enforce these
 laws, especially with regard to small companies.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, but South Korea suffers from
 unusually high accident rates. The accident rte continues to decline gradually, due
 to public and unon pressure for better working conditions. However, the number
 of deaths resulting from work-related accidents remains very high by international
 standards. The Labor Ministry has improved enforcement of safety standards but
 still lacks enough inspectors to enforce the laws fully. The Industrial Safety and
 Health Law does not guarantee job security for workers who remove themselves
 from dangerous work environments.
