 MONGOLIA
 Mongolia, once a highly centralized Communist state, installed its first freely
 elected government in 1990 as part of its transition towards multiparty democracy.
 Following passage of a new electoral law, Mongolia's first multiparty legislative elec-
 tions were held in July 1990. As a result of those elections, a new government was
 formed in September 1990.
 Mongolia has a president, prime minister, and a popularly elected legislature. In
 January the legislature approved a new Constitution, which entered into force on
 February 12. In addition to establishing Mongolia as a sovereign republic and pro-
 viding a broad range of rights and freedoms, the new Constitution restructured the
 legislative branch of government, replacing the bicameral legislature (Great People's
 
 
 621
 Hural and Small Hural) with the unicameral State Great Hural (SGH) with 76
 members. The new Constitution also replaced legislative election of the President
 by election through a popular vote. Elections for a new President are scheduled for
 June 1993. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are nominated by the President
 and approved by the SGH.
 Thirteen parties, including the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP),
 registered to participate in the June 28 elections which elected the first SGH. The
 MPRP's approximately 57 percent of the popular vote gave it 71 of the 76 SGH
 seats. In contrast to the previous coalition government, the three opposition parties
 represented in the SGH refused to join Prime Minister Jasrai's Government, which
 is thus entirely composed of MPRP members.
 The state security apparatus--now a department responsible to the Cabinet--con-
 tinues to redefine its role in Mongolia's post-Communist society. Although legisla-
 tion enacted in August 1991 banned police and security officers, along with a wide
 range of other officials, from membership in litical parties, several parties nomi-
 nated security, national police, and border poiCe officials as candidates in the June
 SGH campaign. However, all withdrew before the election. Some national police and
 border guard officers also are active in the ultranationalist "Committee of 281' and
 its associated "Independence Party."
 A State Security Law enacted in 1992 establishes SGH control and supervision
 of the Department of State Security's (DSS) budget; presidential control of policy;
 and government oversight of daily activities, with the State Procurator also
 overseeing the legal aspects of security operations. However, the new law also pro-
 vides the Department a special right to conduct surveillance in order to carry out
 its duties, and establishes the presence of security representatives in all public en-
 terpises
 Tots military expenditures for 1989, the last year for which the U.S. Arms Con-
 trol and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were $259 million.
 Since that year tight government budget restraints, withrwal of Soviet aid, and
 skyrocketing inflation have severely cut into military expenditures. Although no ac-
 curate figures are available, real dollar spending on the military has likely signifi-
 cantly decreased.
 Despite increasing industrialization and urbanization, a large portion of the popu-
 lation is engaged in agrculture, with an emphasis on livestock raising and associ-
 ated light industry. After decades of nealy total dependency on the former Soviet
 Union ,lMongoia is attempting to increase its foreign trade with other countries and
 to make the difficult transition to a market economy. The new Constitution lays the
 legal groundwork for this transition by establishing the right to private ownership
 oa property, and to onduct private ommercial activity. However, these efforts have
 been handicapped by a severe foreign exchange shortage and a general economic
 slowdown.
 The new Constitution establishes the basis for continued significant progress in
 most human rights categories. It forbids discrimination of any sort and clearly es-
 tablishes freedom of speech and press, assembly, and the right of citizens to change
 their government. Implementation of the rights provided for in the Constitution,
 however, will depend on SGH enactment of a range of implementing laws.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGCtf
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial iling.-There has been no evidence of such
 killings in recent years.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known instances of politically motivated abduc-
 tions or disappearances in recent years.
 c. Torture and Other Crud, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 According to the new Constitution, 'no person shall be subjected to torture, inhu-
 man, cruel, or degrading treatment.* There have been no reports that torture or
 other such treatment or punishment has been practiced in the recent past. However,
 in September a senior official of the Ministry of Justice confr-med recent press re-
 ports that several prisoners starved to death while in jail when prison officials were
 unable to provide minimum caloric requirements due to a national food shortage.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, and Exile.-There were no confirmed reports of ar-
 bitrary arrest, detention, or exile.
 Under the new Constitution, no person shall be searched, arrested, detained, or
 deprived of liberty except by law. A person arrested for committing a crime, his fam-
 ily, and his legal counsel are to be notified of the reasons for the arrest within a
 period of time established by law. Mongolia's Legal Code is currently under revision.
 Until that revision is complete, the existing Legal Code remains in force. That Code
 
 
 622
 permits police to arrest those in the act of committing a crime and hold them for
 up to 72 hours without a warrant. For incarcerations of longr duration, or when
 the actual crime was not witnessed, a warrant must be issued by a prosecutor. Pros-
 ecutors are appointed by the State Prosecutor for a 5-year term. The State Prosecu-
 tor was appointed by the GPH for a 5-year term. At year's end, the SGH was re-
 viewing a new law on the structure and operations of the state prosecutor system.
 Under the existing Legal Code, a person in detention has no statutory right to
 see an attorney, and defense attorneys have been routiney denied access to their
 clients prior to trial. The new Constitution, however, provides for the right to legal
 assistance upon request but does not provide for free legal counsel for the indigent.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The new Constitution provides the right to a fair
 trial, legal assistance, appeal of a court judgment, and request for pardon. Court
 proceedings are to be open to the public except in cases involving crimes against
 the State, rape cases involving minors, and particularly brutal murders, as specifi-
 cally prescribed by law. The accused is entitled to examine the evidence pertaining
 to his case. Trials are conducted in Mongolian but an interpreter is provided if the
 accused does not understand Mongolian. A person has the right not to testify
 against himself or his family. A person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.
 The new Constitution also provides for a number of structural changes that have
 not yet been implemented. A General Council of Courts (CC) is to select all judges
 and protect their rights. The Supreme Court is to b  he highest judicial body with
 its justices nominated by the GcC and confirmed by the SGH and President. The
 Supreme Court is constitutionally empowered to review and make decisions on
 criminal cases and legal disputes assigned to it, examine all lower court decisions
 excluding specialized court rulings upon appeal, and provide official interpretations
 of all laws except the Constitution itself. The sole authority for interpreting the Con-
 stitution is the newly created Constitutional Court. It is comprised of nine members,
 including a chairman, appointed for 6-year terms. Three are named by the SGH,
 three by the President, and three by the GCC.
 While the Supreme and Constitutional Courts are now functioning, further re-
 structuring of the court system must await enactment of implementing legislation
 by the SGI. In the interim, the existing three-level court system remains in oper-
 ation. The local (or upeople'sm) courts handle most routine criminal and civil cases
 such as assault, petty larceny, traffic accidents, and liability disputes. Provincial
 courts hear serious cases such as murder, rape, grand larceny, official corruption,
 and security cases. Provincial courts also review local court decisions. The Supreme
 Court serves as an appeals court for the people's and provincial courts. To date the
 Supreme Court has rarely overturned the verdicts of the lower courts. Supreme
 Courtju dges were appointed by the former Great People's Hural (GPH) for a 4-year
 term. Lower court judges were appointed by provincial huras, also for 4-year terms.
 Current civil and criminal codes provide for the right of the accused to judicial proc-
 ess, a legal defense, and public trial "except as stipulated by law." Closed proceed-
 ings are permitted in cases involving crimes against the State, rape cases involving
 minors, and particularly brutal murders. Witnesses are usually required to appear
 at trials, but written testimony is sometimes accepted instead. The accused must
 answer all questions put to himaby the prosecutor.
 The status of the Mongolian Military Court is unclear. In the past, the Military
 Court was a separate entity rather than part of the national court system. Since
 no reference to this court is made in the new Constitution, new legislation is needed
 to resolve the issue. Many expect that the Military Court will be fully integrated
 into the civilian judicial system.
 In the past the courts have been nominally independent, but in reality were close-
 ly contrmlled by the MPRP. S  vice the 1990 revolution, there has been a comprehen-
 sive review of the Legal Code and the structure of the judiciay in order to establish
 a legal system which will conform to international standards. The new Constitution
 stipulates that the judiciary will be independent and strictly guided by law; it re-
 mains to be seen how this stipulation will be implemented.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to privacy of Mongolian citizens, their families, correspondence, and homes is
 provided for in the new Constitution. Despite political reforms and cutbacks in the
 apparatus of government, however, the Government, under old regulations still in
 force, retains the authority to exercise control over individual activity. Warrants
 must be issued by a prosecutor before persons or premises may be searched.
 According to the 1992 State Security Law, the DSS, despite internal reforms, still
 reserves the right to use special surveillance methods (e.g., wiretaps) in order "to
 carry out its duties." No information is available on the extent of these practices,
 
 
 623
 but the authority of the DSS seems significantly less than what it was before the
 1990 democratic revolution.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech, press, and "expression of
 opinion" is provided for in the new Constitution and is now widely respected in prac-
 tice, although some limits remain. Lively debate covering a broad range of political,
 economic, and social topics continued in 1992. Newspapers are able to pubis and
 circulate freely. However, except for those newspapers which were able to import
 newsprint directly or obtain it as a gilt, newsprint shortages prevented most news-
 papers from appean    reglarly. The Government controls the allocation of news-
 print imortedthrou    official trade, and oppsition parties and other publishers
 continued to allegethat limitations on the quantities of newsprint effectively pre-
 vented them from publishing as frequently as the MPRP newspaper, Unen.
 Although a new "independent" but government-financed television company was
 formed in mid-1992, it broadcats only 1 day a week and only in the Ulaanbaatar
 area. Government-owned Mongolian radio and television remain the only national
 broadcast systems. Although both the opposition and the Governmen! at times have
 criticized Mongolian television's coverae, it regularly broadcasts the views of oppo-
 sition parties as well as those of the Government, and its news programs are gen-
 erally considered balanced. During the 1992 SGH elections, all parties and inde-
 pendent candidates were given free and equal broadcast time on Mongolian radio
 and television and space in the government newspaper Ardiyn Erh on the basis of
 a mutually agreed lottery.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associaton.-The new Constitution provides
 for freedom of peaceful assembly. Demonstrations-including hunger strikes--over
 various issues, mainly protesting government economic policies, were held through-
 out the year without interference by the authorities. Although permits are required
 for demonstrations, this requirement is not enforced. The new Constitution also
 grants the right to form a political party or other public organizations and to unite
 voluntarily in associations according to social interests or convictions.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The new Constitution provides for the right both to "wor-
 ship and nonworship"; there is no state religion. The Constitution explicitly provides
 for the separation of church and state. Since the 1990 revolution, freedom of religion
 has been respected in practice. Throughout 1992 the revival of the Buddhist faith
 and its institutions continued, includinK the reopening of a number of monasteries
 and schools. The Government continued to emphasize that it no longer interferes
 in the conduct of religious affairs. Two religious-based political parties participated
 in the June elections with a number of Buddhist clerics among their candidates.
 Mongolia's Muslim Kazakh population, concentrated in the western province of
 Bayan Ulgiy, is allowed to practice religion freely. Some Mongolian Kazakhs make
 the haji to Mecca each year, and a number of future clerics are now studying theol-
 ogy in Turkey and other Muslim countries. The importation of Korans has been al-
 lowed since 1990. The Association of Mongolian Religious People, formed in 1990,
 continued to function freely. The Government has not interfered with the activities
 of Christian and other missionaries, and proselytizing is permitted. However, a Min-
 istry of Education announcement stipulates that, because the new Constitution re-
 quires that education be kept separate from religion, foreign language teaching
 must not be used as a means of conducting missionary activity.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The new Constitution provides Mongolians the right to move freely
 within the country, choose their residence, travel and reside abroad, and return to
 Mongolia. The right to travel abroad may, however, be limited by law in order to
 ensure national security and protect public order. At least some Mongolians are re-
 quired to surrender their passports upon completion of foreign travef and must re-
 quest their return for further use. Over 131,000 Mongolians traveled abroad in the
 first 8 months of 1992. A large number of Mongolian Kazakhs chose to emigrate to
 newly independent Kazakhstan, and the Government posed no obstacles to their de-
 rture. Mongolia does not receive many refugees, but a few who have come from
 ina's province of Inner Mongolia have been accepted for resettlement.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The 1992 Constitution provides citizens the right to change their government
 through periodic, free elections with universal suffrage. In June 1992, Mongolian
 citizens exercised their right to vote in the first SGH elections. The elections were
 generally judged by observers to be free and open, as procedural flaws did not sig.
 nificantly affect the outcome of the election. Thirteen parties, including the ,U.-,
 
 
 624
 registered to participate in the campaign. The MPRP won approximately 57 percent
 of the popular vote, and 71 of the 76 SGH seats. Although the other 12 parties won
 43 percent they failed to be awarded an equivalent number of seats because the
 large number of competing parties splintered the vote, and the 1992 election law
 stipulated that the party which ained a simple plurality of the votes for a particu-
 lar seat, regardless of how smal a share of total votes cast, won the seat. Based
 on the MPRP's victory, the ruling party formed a new Government which included
 new Prime Minister Jasrai, two deputy prime ministers, and a Cabinet composed
 only of MPRP members. President Ochirbat will remain in his position until a new
 presidential election scheduled for June 1993.
 The Constitution establishes the unicameral State Great Hural (SGH) as the su-
 preme organ of government. Its 76 members are elected by direct, secret ballot for
 4-year terms. The SGH has the right to set the date of SGH and presidential elec-
 tions and can remove the President. The President of Mongolia serves as Head of
 State and is elected to a 4-year term (with a limit of two terms) by national secret
 ballot. The Government has a 4-year mandate and is nominated by the party that
 wins a majority in the SGH. The SGH, in consultation with the President, will con-
 tinue to elect the Prime Minister and approve his Cabinet.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation of women in government and
 politics. According to the new Constitution, "men and women shall be equal in polit-
 ical and economic fields * * *" In 1991 women constituted about 30 percent of the
 MPRP membership. Several women were elected to the SGH in June.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovermental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A local human rights group, the Mongolian Human Rights Committee, was
 formed in 1990. There are no known impediments to its abihty to monitor and re-
 port on human rights developments. The Government has cooperated with inter-
 national nongovernmental human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The new Constitution provides that "* * * no person shall be discriminated
 against on the basis of ethnic origin, language, race, age, sex, social origin, or status
 * * " and that "    men an( women shall be equal in political, economic, social,
 cultural fields, and family affairs."
 There appears to be little discrimination in education on the basis of race, sex,
 or religion. According to government statistics, the percentage of women in the work
 force was 51.3 percent in 1992. Women formed about half of trade union member-
 ship and also hold high professional positions in such institutions as the courts,
 schools, research centers, and hospitals. Women reportedly get equal pay for per-
 forming the same jobs as men.
 Little is known about the extent to which violence against women, including do-
 mestic violence, occurs. It has not been discussed as a matter of public policy or in
 the media. According to senior officials, there is some domestic violence against
 women but the problem is not common and does not require new legislation. How-
 ever, the Government believes a related problem-the growing number of orphaned
 and abandoned children-is becoming a serious national problem that requires addi-
 tional government action.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association. -The right to organize professional associations and
 trade unions is provided for in the new Constitution. The charter of the Federation
 of Mongolian Trade Unions (FMTU) provides for the unionization of police and mili-
 tary personnel, but it is unclear whether there are any such unions. Approximately
 75 percent of the total Mongolian work force is unionized. Union officials are elected
 by secret ballot.
 There are no arbitrary restrictions on who may be a union official. Union mem-
 bers, other than civil servants and essential service workers, have the right to
 strike, and several strikes took place during the year. In early 1992 medical and
 railway workers conducted sit-in protests in Ulaanbaatar's main square but drew
 little support. These protests apparently were settled by mutual agreement between
 the strikers and the Government acting as employer and reportedly resulted in
 wage increases. In November a national teachers' strike, organized with the help
 of te Social Democratic Party, closed a portion of Mongolian schools for several
 days. Although the Government rejected the teachers' demand for doubled salaries,
 the strike was suspended in December to permit an attempt to negotiate a solution.
 Most unions in Mongolia are currently affiliated with the FMTU, which formerly
 was a part of the MPRP. The FMTU separated from the party during the 1990 revo-
 lution, and its charter now states that all unions have the right to leave it should
 
 
 625
 they so desire. The FMTU also maintains there is no reirement for new unions
 to register with it or with any government body. The FMTU is apparently no longer
 an instrument of sovernment controL No political parties can be directly rep-
 resented in Mongolian enterprises During 1990 a new union movement called "Rh
 Association of Free Trade Union? (AFTU) emerged, which includes some 70 unions.
 In 1992 another new union organization, called 'Blue Mongoli," came into exist-
 ence with approximately 40,000 members.
 The new Constitution places no restrictions on the political activity of unions or
 union officials. In 1992 all three labor movements, as well as individual unions, fre-
 quently and publicly criticized government economic policies and actions. There is
 no statutory prohibition against unions forming federations or joining international
 bodies. Mongolian unions formerly affiliated exclusively with international Com-
 munist organizations, are broadening their contacts with Western labor movements.
 b. The Right to .Oranize and Bargain Co/ectiely.There reportedly have been
 no collective barga n  agreements completed to      because of changes in the
 Labor Law introduced in 1991: A draf law which guarantees the right to bargain
 collectively was not approved before conclusion of the previous parliament and re-
 portedy will be resubmitted for consideration by the new Government. A state com-
 mission and individual institutions determine wage levels. Unions are also involved
 in negotiating wage levels.
 The Laborlaw prohibits antiunion discrimination. Aecording to the law, an em-
 ployer must show work-related cause and must obtain the unions approval to fire
 a union official who is an employee. The courts have the right to order reinstate-
 ment. The FMTU says there were a few audh cases in 1992, most of which resulted
 in the workers regaining their jobs.
 Export proceasing zones de not exist in Mongolia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or CompulsoryLabor-Forced or compulsory labor Is spe-
 cifically prohibited by law. However, students are frequently mobilized to help farm-
 ers harvest their crops. A Mongolian Student Union (MSU) spokesman charged that
 students were compelled to participate in the fall harvest under threat of 1 year's
 involuntary leave or expulsion from school. Tho MSU also claimed that many stu-
 dents were compelled to help with the 1991 harvest under threat of penalties to be
 imposed by their schools and that a number of those who refused were punished.
 The courts rejected an MSU challenge to the constitutionality of studentrticipa-
 tion n the harvest, and the Government has nt otherwise responded to  MUcom-
 plaints. Under the Criminal Code, prisoners can be forced to [sor for the Govern-
 ment although the extent of such compulsion is unknown.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chidren.-The law prohibits children under
 the age of 16 from working, with the exception of those aged 14 and 1 if allowed
 by the local trade union committee and given permission by their pare nto. Those
 under 18 are statutorily prohibited from working at night, from doing arduous work,
 or from working in dangerous areas udh as mining or construction.
 Mongolian Government Resolution 208 of 1991 specified those jobs barred to
 women and to children under the age of 16. Enforcement of these prohibitions, as
 well as all other labor regulations, is the responsibility of state labor inspectors as-
 signed to regional and local offices. These inspectors visit workplacs an d have the
 authority to order and, reportedly, compel immediate compliance with labor regula-
 Prior to 1991 child employment was banned by the Constitution, and no statistics
 were kept on such employment. However, in 1991 the Government created the Na-
 tional Commission for Children. The Commission, under the Ministry of Labor, is
 responsible for verifying the extent and condition of child labor. As a fr step, the
 Commission requested basic information from Mongo. lian firms. Its staff also vsited
 businesses to obtain data. According to the commission, as of late December, no
 Mongolian firm provided any information im response to its requests. No alternate
 source of data on child labor appears to exist.
 e. Acceptable Conditions  Ho Work-Thine government-established minimum wage
 applies to all workers. While it is difficult to determine what portion of the work
 force is paid at the minimum wage, this wage, together with subsidies provided
 workers, appears to provide an adequate standard of living, although that is endan-
 gred by continuing inflation.
 The Labor Law sets 46 hours as the standard workweek, and establishes a mini-
 mum rest period of 42 hours between work weeks. For those under 18 the standard
 workweek Isl36 hours. Overtime is forbidden by law exept in case of national emer-
 gency or natural disaster, such as an earthquake or floods, and then only with the
 concurrence of the local labor union.
 Safety and health are priority concerns of the Government, but no specific laws
 on these topics have yet been presented to the SGH. At present, the Labor Law,
 
 
 626
 
 the Cooperatives Law, and the Enterprise Law provide occupational safety and
 health standards, and the Ministry of Labor sets additional standards. These stand-
 ards are enforced by the Government with the help of the trade unions; violators
 may be fined and imprisoned. Nonetheless, given Mongolia's near total reliance on
 outmoded machinery and continuing problems with spare parts and maintenance,
 accidents are frequent. According to the FMTU, every fourth day a Mongolian work-
 er dies from an industrial accident.
