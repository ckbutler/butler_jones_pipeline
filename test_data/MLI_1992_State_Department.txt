 MALI
 Mali became one of Africa's newest democracies in 1992; President Alpha Oumar
 Konare took office after a 14-month transition period which began with the March
 1991 overthrow of the Moussa Traore regime. In a series of six direct elections be-
 tween January and April 1992, Malians ratified a new Constitution and then elected
 municipal councilors, National Assembly Deputies, and, finally, a President. The
 voting was conducted under an electoral code drawn up by the August 1991 Na-
 tional Conference, which also drafted the new Constitution. Twenty-one political
 parties participated, in elections that were judged by international observers to be
 free and fair. The new President was inaugurated on June 8, and the new
 multiparty National Assembly opened its fist session in July.
 The country continued to be affected by insurgency in the north, which varied
 from politically motivated rebels seeking an autonomous Tuareg state to simple ban-
 ditry. Rebel activity which started in mid-1990 continued throughout early 1992, de-
 it negotiations between the Government and rebel movements. After the signing
 o the National Pact on the North in April 1992, the violence abated until dissidents
 resumed attacks in June. There were credible reports of civilians killed by rebels,
 of extrajudicial killings committed by government forces, and of the theft by rebels
 of vehicles belonging to private voluntary organizations involved in food distribu-
 tion. The Government's efforts to resolve the problems politically by implementing
 the National Pact led to a reduction of hostilities by the end of July, but the peace
 remained uneasy.
 Mali's armed forces number some 7,000 and are under the control of a civilian
 Minister of Defense. The President is Commander in Chief of these forces. The gen-
 darmerie (paramilitary police) and local police fomes (which in 1992 were trans-
 ferred to the Ministry of Territorial Administration and demilitarized) have primary
 responsibility for maintaining internal security. The military establishments credi-
 bility was badly damaged in the aftermath of the March 1991 riots in which lethal
 force was used to quell demonstrators seeking the overthrow of then-President
 Moussa Traore. Military participation in and support for the transition to democracy
 helped restore some of that credibility. Total military expenditures for 1989, the last
 year for which the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a de-
 tailed analysis, were $41 million. The end to massive Soviet assistance, coupled with
 security demands related to the rebellion in the north, may increase expenditures
 in the near future, but streamlining and redefining the military's role and mission
 should lead to long-term reductions.
 Military forces remained deployed throughout the northern regions of the country
 to deal with insurgency and banditry. Both rebel actions and military reprisals took
 many lives. While the Government remains committed to establishing civilian con-
 trol of the military, problems remain, particularly in the north.
 With an annual per capita gross national product of approximately $300, Mali is
 one of the world's poorest countries. The economy is based primarily on subsistence
 farming and animal husbandry, making it highly dependent on good rainfalls for its
 well-being. The Government continued to modernize the economy through fiscal re-
 form, made determined efforts to end government corruption, and in August signed
 agreements for an enhanced structural adjustment facility with the World Bank and
 International Monetary Fund. Nonetheless, Mali remained heavily dependent on ex-
 ternal aid. Private enterprise was encouraged as part of economic reform and liber-
 alization programs.
 Although there were violations of human rights in 1992, including extrajudicial
 killings and detentions without charge, especia ly in connection with the conflict in
 the north, the improvements in human rights beun under the transitional govern-
 ment continued. The Government expanded political rights and fully respected free-
 dom of speech, press, assembly, and association. Because of extensive media cov-
 erage of the new Constitution, more Malians became aware of their rights and were
 less afraid to file complaints when these rights were violated. In addition, independ-
 ent associations and the Government took many steps toward consolidating Mali's
 new multiparty democracy based on the rule of law. Violence against women re-
 mained a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of targeted
 political killings. There were, however, several instances of extrajudicial killing by
 security forces in reprisal for rebel attacks in the north. (see Section 1.g.).

 b. Disappearance.-Rebels frequently abducted civilians, including government of-
 ficials, during raids on villages. -While most were released, and abductions became
 less frequent after the signing of the National Pact on the North in April, at least
 one individual was taken hostage in a raid in July. Four persons kidnaped in raids
 during 1990 remained unaccounted for. There were no reported incidents of dis-
 appearance, abduction, or hostage-taking attributable to the Government.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The new Constitution prohibits torture and inhuman, cruel, degrading, or
 humiliating treatment, and the new Government made strides through training and
 disciplinary measures toward ending the physical abuse of suspected persons, which
 sometimes occurred during police interrogation. However, no charges were fled or
 prosecutions pursued for any alleged abuses. Widespread publicity given to human
 rights issues made citizens more willing to complain; this constrained individual po-
 lice officers in their treatment of detainees, even in rural areas. Investigations by
 two human rights associations into the March 1992 riot at the Bamako central pris-
 on, which left 29 dead, confirmed government reports that most died in fighting
 with other prisoners or from overdoses of drugs stolen from the prison infirmary.
 When the Government heard about Tuareg allegations of mistreatment of prisoners
 in Gao, it sent a high-level team to investigate. Many of those held were released;
 the others were transferred to Bamako, where prison facilities are more adequate.
 The Government improved conditions in prisons by repairing the Bamako prison
 and numerous regional prisons and by releasing many prisoners to reduce over-
 crowding. However, conditions are still harsh, and there are inadequate medical fa-
 cilities and food supplies.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The new Constitution has expanded the
 rights of arrested persons. Persons arrested must be charged or released within 48
 hours. Greater awareness of this law resulted in increase adherence to it. Detain-
 ees are accorded the right to a judicial determination of the legality of their deten-
 tion withir. 48 hours. Malian law does not provide for release on bail, but detainees
 are sometimes released on their own recognizance. Administrative backlogs often
 cause delays in bringing people to trial. Those charged with petty crimes are gen-
 erally released; others often languish in prison for a long time awaiting trial. The
 new Constitution gives arrested persons the right to have a lawyer of their choice
 present at all questioning; even before the Constitution was promulgated, such per-
 sons began to demand that this right be accorded them.
 Lawyers are quite active in making sure detainees have representation. Many
 provide pro bono service. A number of Tuaregs detained by military authorities in
 the wake of rebel attacks in the northern regions were released ater the signing
 of the National Pact in April. The resurgence of attacks in June, however, led to
 new arrests. Those arrested were to be charged and tried under regular criminal
 law, but there were complaints that Tuaregs were being held without charge.
 Three of the former president's children and his grandson, who were detained
 without charge (ostensibly for their own protection) were released in June 1992 and
 allowed to leave the country. Another adult son previously detained was formally
 charged with misuse of public funds and remained under arrest. There are no politi-
 cal detainees.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The new Constitution basically retained the exist-
 ing court structure, with two notable changes: It declared the judiciary independent
 of the legislative and executive branches, and it abolished the special court of state
 security, which operated outside the regular judicial system.
 The new Constitution provides for the independence of the judiciary. Although the
 Ministry of Justice and the Superior Judicial Council (headed by the President) su-
 pervise judicial activity administratively, they do not intervene in specific cases. In
 May magistrates went on strike to protest executive branch membership on the
 Council. The Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative powers. The new
 Constitution established a separate Constitutional Court as well as a High Court
 of Justice with the power to try senior government officials in cases of treason.
 Except in the case of minors, trials are public and defendants have the right to
 be present and to have an attorney of their choice. Defendants are presumed inno-
 cent and have the right to a ppeal decisions to the Supreme Court. Many members
 of the former government, including the former president and his wife, were charged
 by the regular criminal court with corruption and embezzlement and with violations
 oflaw in connection with the shooting of demonstrators during the 1991 riots. All
 former government members have access to legal representation. Trials in connec-
 tion with the shootings, postponed in June because of insecurity arising from -the
 intense popular reaction, began in earnest in late November. The trials were not
 completed by year's end.
 
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Invio-
 lability of the home is provided for in the new Constitution and is generally re-
 spected in practice. Police searches are infrequent, and warrants are issued by a
 judge and recorded, though sometimes after the fact. Local authorities sometimes
 seize and open mail extralegally, and postal employees have publicly condemned
 this practice.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 fliets.-The Tuareg rebellion in the north continued to result in the deaths of many
 civilians, rebels, military personnel, and government officials. The number of dead
 in the conflict is uncertain, but as many as 100 civilians were killed by Tuaregs in
 at least 50 attacks in 1992, including many which took place after the signing of
 the Pact. There are credible reports that in more than one case Tuaregs singled out
 members of southern ethnic grups during thir attacks.
 Military responses to these attacks included reprisals against unarmed Tuaregs
 and Maurs. There were numerus reports of excessive use of force by miitary per-
 sonnel in responding to rebel attacks. Credible reports put total civilian Tuareg
 deaths at the hands of military personnel at over 100. After a May 14 bandit attack
 in the town of Gossi, security forces arrested and subsequently executed 10 Tuareg
 residents of the town. There were credible reports that on May 19 at least 24 Maurs
 and Tuaregs returning from Mauritania to Mali, including some women and chil-
 dren, were killed by Malian security forces. There were also credible reports that
 on June 7 near the town of Goundam security forces executed seven Tuaregs.
 The Government attempted to end such practices and took action to improve dis-
 cipline and control in the security forces. President Konare explicitly denounced re-
 prisals by military personnel and promised to punish those involved. However, while
 the Government reported y transferred and disciplined the soldiers involved, no one
 was arrested or tried for these acts. There were no further reports of reprisals after
 the inaugration of the new Government. There were also reports of many others
 being killed by local self-defense groups armed by the Government.
 By the end of 1992, the Government had still not released the results of the inves-
 tigations that were promised after the killing of Tuareg notable Mohamadoum Ag
 Hamani and members of his household in December 1991. While internal investiga-
 tions were conducted in the wake of this and other incidents, no reports Were issued
 or charges pressed.. Under the terms of the National Pact on the North signed in
 April, a commission of inquiry is to be established to investigate all deaths on both
 sides in the conflict. However, by the end of the year, the commission had not yet
 been established due to lack of consensus on the selection of foreign members.
 In addition to those who died or were wounded in rebel attacks and army repris-
 als, many nomads lost cattle, and commercial enterprises were destroyed. On nu-
 merous occasions, rebels stole vehicles from private voluntary organizations, includ-
 ing the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), making food distribution
 in the region extremely difficult.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Since the overthrow of the previous regime in
 March 1991, Malians have enjoyed virtually complete freedom of speech and press.
 The new Constitution contains strong affirmations for these freedoms. During the
 election campaigns, individuals openly voiced their opinions. Independent journals
 and radios, and even the state-owned press frequently carried vigorous criticism of
 the new President, his Government, and other politicians. The Malian people view
 the press as an important brake on official abuse and corruption, and they fre-
 quently use the press to expose petty malfeasance.
 There are nearly 30 independent newspapers and journals. The government-
 owned newspaper, radio, and television system are open and give coverage to a wide
 range of views. The Government undertook measures to convert the state media into
 semi-independent entities. At the end of 1992, there were three independent radio
 stations in Bamako and others planned for Segou and Sikasso. A group of private
 investors is planning an independent subscription television station, which is sched-
 uled to begin broadcasting in 1993.
 The political pressures which previously inhibited academic freedom have all but
 disappeared.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-One of the first acts of the
 transitional government was to allow the free formation of political parties and
 other associations. The new Constitution affirms this right. Some 46 political parties
 and hundreds of professional and special interest associations operate freely. While
 no political parties have established formal ties with parties in other countries,
 there are no restrictions on their doing so. Permits required for mass demonstra-
 
 
 tions are routinely granted, and political meetings take place openly and without
 interference.
 c. Freedom of ReltIgon.-Mali's status as a secular state is reconfirmed in the new
 Constitution. The Government generally does not discriminate on religious grounds.
 Ninety percent of Malians are Muslim; members of other religions practice their
 faiths freely and are permitted to establish houses of worship and schools. Christian
 missionaries of various faiths, including foreign missionaries, operate freely. Pros-
 elytizing and conversion are permitted. The Government prohibits publications in
 which one religious group defames another;, the Minister of Territorial Administra-
 tion determines whether such publications are defamatory. This law is rarely ap-
 plied, however.
 Administrative orders promulgated in 1977 prohibiting members of the Baha'i
 faith from meet'ing in groups of more than three people are not enforced, and Baha'i
 practice their faith without interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Freedom of movement in Mali is generally unimpeded, although police
 stop Malians and foreigners alike at checkpoints, particularly at night. These checks
 ostensibly are used to restrict the movement of contraband goods and to check vehi-
 cle registrations, but in practice some police supplement their salaries by assessing
 ad hoc fines or confiscating goods. As part of its anticorruption campaign, the Gov-
 ernment attempted to end these abuses. An exit visa is no longer required.
 In recent years Mali has both accepted and generated refugees. Some 13,000
 Mauritanian Peulh, whose normal transhumance patterns were interrupted by strife
 in their country in 1989, settled in Mali and were generally absorbed into the local
 economy. In 1992 the continuing insecurity in Ma's northern regions led Malian
 Tuaregs and Maurs to take refuge in neighboring countries. During 1992 approxi-
 mately 15,000 additional Malian refugees went to Mauritania, joining the 15,000
 who had arrived in 1991. In addition, some 5,500 fled across the border to Burkina
 Faso. Several thousand additional refugees crossed into Algeria in 1992. In June the
 ICRC estimated that there were 33,500 Malian Tuaregs in Algeria, most of whom
 had been in the country since the 1984-85 droughts. The Government worked with
 the ICRC and U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to prepare for the
 return of these refugees once peace returns to the north.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights:- The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In 1992 Malians for the first time exercised their right to change their govern-
 ment through peaceful means, electing a new President (who took office on June 8)
 and members of a new multiparty National Assembly (which met for the first time
 on July 12). Mali's Third Republic is a multiparty democracy based on the Constitu-
 tion drawn up at the August 1991 National Conference and ratified in the January
 1992 referendum. Under the Constitution the President is Chief of State and Com-
 mander in Chief of the Armed Forces. Hie is elected for a term of 5 years with a
 limit of two terms. He appoints a Prime Minister, who is Head of Government. The
 National Assembly consists of 116 members. Representation is apportioned accord-
 ing to the population of administrative districts. Election is direct and by party list.
 The Constitution provides for separation of executive, legislative, and judicial pow-
 ers.
 The Third Republic succeeded a transitional government which had taken j.wer
 following the fall of the Moussa Traore regime in March 1991. The Transitional
 Committee for the People's Salvation (CTSP), led by Lieutenant Colonel Amadou
 Toumani Toure and consisting of representatives of prodemocracy groups and mili-
 tary officers, adhered to its pledge to organize multiparty elections and to turn
 power over to an elected civilian government.
 Twenty-one political arties participated in the municipal, legislative, and presi-
 dential elections held ?etween February and April 1992. Parties were allowed to
 campaign freely and were given broad access to the state-owned media. The prohibi-
 tion on transitional leaders running for office helped to promote a more open atmos-
 phere. Participation in the elections, while relatively low, was fairly even. across
 most regons and ethnic groups, as well as among men and women. Balloting was
 secret. Although there were complaints about some irregularities, all parties accept-
 ed the outcome. On June 8, Toure turned power over to Alpha Oumar Konare, who
 won sixty percent of the vote in the second round of presidential balloting in April.
 Konare's party the Association.-for Democracy in Mal (ADEMA-Pasj), also won
 the majority of seats in the National Assembly. Ten other parties, aggregated into
 four parliamentr groups, are also represented. During its first session, the Assem-
 bly approved all legislation proposed by the Government after considerable debate
 on all key issues. Minority parties operate freely and are considered an important
 
 
 part of Mali's new political system. Women and members of all ethnic groups, in-
 cluding Tuaregs and Maurs, are able to participate freely in government and poli-
 tics. However, social factors tend to lint their representation in leadership posi-
 tions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are two independent domestic human rights organizations. The Malian As-
 sociation.-for Human Rights (AMDH), established in 1989, was prominent in the
 pmdemocracy movement. AMDH lawyers represent defendants in cases of human
 rights violations before courts and work to inform people of their rights. The Malian
 League of Human Rights, a smaller organization, conducts similar activities. Both
 organizations have had a lower profile since the installation of democracy in Mali.
 While both have investigated problems in the north, neither has made public state-
 ments about human rights violations there.
 The new Government and the transitional government addressed human rights
 questions much more forthrightly than did the previous government. The new Presi-
 dent condemned reprisals by the army against Tuaregs and welcomed any inter-
 national human rights orgamzation to Mali to investigate problems. The new Gov-
 ernment has continued to work with the ICRC in the North. ICRC representatives
 are stationed in several northern towns and are permitted to travel widely. The
 ICRC was involved in the exchange of prisoners after the signing of the National
 Pact and in the release of the children of the former President. At the request of
 the transitional government, the ICRC organized a conference on international hu-
 manitarian law which emphasized treatment of prisoners of war and noncombatants
 under the Geneva Conventions. The Government also allowed the ICRC and the
 local human rights associations access to members of the former government who
 were under arrest or detention. The new Minister of Justice and Human Rights ac-
 tively promoted wider public awareness of human rights guarantees.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Virtually all of Mali's ethnic and language groups are represented at all levels of
 government and society. Not being completely integrated into the economic and po-
 litical mainstream, the nomad populations resent being politically dominated by
 other, more numerous, ethnic groups. In June 1992, Tuareg and Maur groups be-
 came the target of ethnic rioting in Gao, Niono, and Niara and were threatened with
 violence in Bamako in the wake of an upsurge of rebel attacks. The Government
 worked vigorously to reduce tensions by having government ministers visit affected
 towns and neighborhoods. By midJuly the situation had calmed considerably, but
 at the end of 1992 tension and racial polarization remained high throughout the
 north. Fify-one people were later charged and convicted for their part in the June
 anti-Tu areg violence.
 Although the new Constitution reaffirms that there shall be no discrimination, so-
 cial and cultural factors give men a dominant role in Mali. Women voted in large
 numbers in the elections, and there are many women in the professions and in im-
 portant government posts. However, economic and educational opportunities for
 women are limited. Women live under harsh conditions, especially in the rural
 areas. According to a 1991 U.N. report, females in Mali receive only 29 percent as
 much schooling as males. Traditional practice and existing Malian laws place
 women at a disadvantage with regard to family and property rights. However, many
 newly formed women's organizations began actively seeking the improvement of
 women's rights, and the 1991 National Conference addressed ways to improve the
 condition of women.
 Violence against women, including wife beatingt is accepted in Malian society,
 though there are no statistics to incate how widespread it may be. The society
 generally does not tolerat e          that results in physical injury and deals
 with the problem informally at the village level. For example, a village chief may
 intervene to stop such abuse and punish the uerpetrator. Legal action for redress
 of injury in such cases is not normally available, although severe physical injury is
 grounds for divorce. The issue of spousal abuse was not addressed by the Govern-
 ment. Especially in rural areas, it is extremely difficult for women and girls to es-
 cape the practicc of genital mutilation (circumcision). Excision or infibu ation are
 particularly dangerous to life and hcalth. According to an independent export in the
 field, the percentage of Malian women who have undergone such mutilation may be
 as high as 75 percent. Many of the new women's organizations and some independ-
 ent journals campaign against female circumcision; the Government continued radio
 and television broadcasts intended to discourage it. Legislation in effect for 30 years
 prohibiting such practices has never been enforced.
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The new Constitution specifically provides for the
 freedom of workers to form or join unions and, unlike the old Constitution, does not
 limit workers' union options to the National Union of Malian Workers (UNTM).
 While most unions are still part of the UNTM, higher education teachers left the
 teachers' branch of the UNTM and created an independent union, which has been
 officially recognized by the Ministry of Education. The UNTM was a leading force
 in the movement which led to the overthrow of the Moussa Traore regime in 1991.
 Three of its members, including its president, sat on the CTSP. The UNTM has
 maintained its autonomy from the new Government and political parties and was
 accepted as a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in
 December.
 The new Constitution provides for the right to strlke. In 1992 there were several
 strikes, some for higher wages and some Tor improved working conditions. These
 strikes were generally resolved by negotiations between the labor unions, the new
 Government, and the economic entity involved.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The fall of the previous gov-
 ernment and the promulgation of the new Constitution reduced some of the con-
 straints on workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively, notably by ending
 the UNTM's legal status as the sole union. Wages and salaries for those workers
 belonging toUNTM unions are still set by tripartite negotiations between the Min-
 istry of Labor the labor unions, and representatives of the federation of employers
 of the sector for which the wages are being set. Workers in some industries have
 created associations which are starting to function like unions, making demands
 and operating outside the tripartite system. There is no specific language in the
 Labor Code prohibiting antiunion discrimination. There have been no complaints of
 antiunion discrimination. The labor union considers the new Labor Code to be
 prounion.
 No export processing zones exist in Mali.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The new Constitution prohibits
 forced or compulsory labor. Although not sanctioned or upheld by law debt slavery
 exists in the salt mining communities north of Timbuktu. Since the change of $ov-
 ernment in 1991, however, many of those treated as slaves have refused to continue
 working under such conditions. The Government does not force those who flee condi-
 tions of slavery to return and, in the past, has helped some former slaves to settle
 in villages.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 14, but with parents' permission, children may be apprenticed at age 12. In prac-
 tice, many employers ignore the limitation. In addition, children in rural areas and
 in the informal sector are not protected by laws against unjust compensation, exces-
 sive hours, and capricious discharge. The Labor Inspection Service of the Ministry
 of Labor is responsible for enforcement of child labor laws. The law is reasonably
 effective in the modern sector but has no effect on the vast number of children who
 work in the informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Mali has a detailed Labor Code specifying con-
 ditions of employment, including hours, wages, and social security benefits. The
 legal workweek is 40 hours, with a requirement for at least one 24-hour rest period.
 orkers must be paid overtime for additional hours. There are legal minimum wage
 scales most recently adjusted in 1991, which are supplemented by a required pack-
 age of benefits, including social security and health care benefits. While this could
 provide a minimum standard for one person, most wage earners support extended
 families. In addition, most people work in the informal sector outside the realm of
 these rules and conventions.
 The Social Security Code provides a broad range of legal protection against haz-
 ards in the workplace, and workers' groups have put pressure on employers to re-
 spect certain parts of the regulations, particularly those affecting personal hygiene.
 With unemployment levels.gigh, however, workers are sometimes reluctant to re-
 port violations of occupational safety. In theory, the Labor Inspection Service of the
 Ministry of Labor oversees these standards; in practice, enforcement is limited due
 to the lack of inspectors.
