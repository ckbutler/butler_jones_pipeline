 THE GAMBIA
 A former British colony on the West African Coast, The Gambia
 is a parlimentary democracy with an elected President. Until
 the bloody coup attempted in 1981, The Gambia had a history of
 political stability under the leadership of its first and
 current President, Sir Dawda Jawara. His ruling People's
 Progressive Party has dominated the House of Representatives
 since independence in 1965, but the leading opposition party
 and independent candidates are also represented and actively
 participate in the political process. A state of emergency
 imposed after the July 1981 coup attempt was lifted in
 February 1985.
 Given impetus by the coup and formalized by the Confederation
 Treaty of 1981 establishing Senegambia, the process of
 confederation with Senegal continued during 1985, albeit
 slowly. Important steps were taken during the year to
 implement the protocols on defense and security. The Gambia
 gendarmerie has been organized under a Senegalese officer, and
 the first company trained by British officers has now been
 integrated with Senegalese troops into a confederal battalion.
 The Gambia's population of 725,000 (1984 census) consists
 largely of subsistence farmers growing rice and groundnuts
 (peanuts), the country's primary export crop. Drought has
 affected production of both groundnuts and rice. In 1984, the
 Government signed a standby agreement with the. International
 Monetary Fund (IMF) to provide badly needed balance of
 payments and budgetary support, but has had to accept
 stringent spending and import limitations. Due to a shortage
 of food experienced early in 1985, many groundnut farmers
 planted food crops, thus further depleting the Government's
 anticipated revenues from groundnuts.
 With the lifting of the state of emergency in 1985, the human
 rights climate improved further as The Gambia increasingly
 returned to normalcy after the shock of the 1981 coup. The
 coup attempt had been led by leftist elements and supported by
 a large part of the police field force. It resulted in the
 deaths of over 800 people. Of the persons eventually brought
 to trial, 55 were acquitted. An independent judiciary, open
 courts, established trial procedures, and an appeal process
 ensured that the accused received a fair trial and due
 process. There is only one outstanding case arising from the
 events of July 1981: one of the leaders of the attempted coup
 was finally apprehended as he was returning home from a
 four-year, self-imposed exile. His treason trial began in
 August but has been postponed repeatedly as the courts sought
 additional evidence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no instances of political killings in The
 Gambia in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no known record or allegation of abduction or secret
 detention by any element of the Government or by any other
 group.

 THE GAMBIA
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The constitutional prohibition against torture is observed in
 practice. No allegations of torture have been noted in 1985.
 The Constitution also contains prohibitions against cruel,
 inhuman, and degrading punishment. Persons familiar with the
 operation of the legal system believe that courts are alert to
 any allegation of mistreatment in prisons. These sources also
 acknowledge, however, that there may be lapses in supervision
 resulting in individual instances of mistreatment of
 prisoners. The Government allows prison visits by
 representatives of the local Red Cross and by close family
 members.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Based on British legal practice, there are well developed
 constitutional and legal procedures governing the arrest,
 detention, and bringing to trial of persons accused of
 crimes. Under these procedures, a detained person must be
 brought to trial within one week. This waiting period,
 however, can be extended twice, making 21 days the maximum
 period of detention before trial.
 Under the Emergency Act of 1981, the Government could order
 the detention of any person who was considered to have been
 involved in acts prejudicial to public safety for up to 14
 days without a detention order but with right to legal
 counsel. The Emergency Act was lifted in February 1985.
 It is important to note that the Government scrupulously
 observed its own laws in handling the 1091 persons detained
 after the coup attempt and reportedly released numerous
 detainees against whom strong evidence was in hand and who may
 still pose a potential danger to the State.
 The Labor Administration Act prohibits forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 To date, 62 persons have been sentenced to death--after
 lengthy public .trials observing due process of law--for crimes
 committed in connecton with the 1981 coup attempt. The cases
 have now gone through appeal and, in each case brought to the
 President, executive clemency has been granted. No executions
 have taken place.
 Three kinds of law operate in The Gambia: general, Shari'a,
 and customary law. Shari'a, governing Muslims, is observed in
 marriage and divorce proceedings. Customary law covers
 marriage, inheritance, divorce, land tenure and utilization,
 local tribal government, and all other civil and social
 relations originating in the traditional religious and tribal
 situation of the country. General law, based on English
 statutes and modified to suit the Gambian context, governs
 criminal cases and trials and most organized business
 practices. If there were a conflict between general law and
 Shari'a, general law would prevail.
 The Constitution guarantees criminal defendants rights
 traditional in the English system, such as the right to a
 public trial, the presumption of innocence, and the right to
 
 
 123
 THE GAMBIA
 be informed promptly of offense charged. If an accused person
 is released on bail, the individual need not come to trial
 until the investigation is completed, and there apparently is
 no maximum time limit for investigations. Appeals normally
 proceed from the Supreme (trial) Court to the Court of
 Appeals, the country's highest tribunal. Under the Emergency
 Act, the court system in this tiny nation was overwhelmed with
 the large number of detainees. Consequently, the Government
 established a special division of the Supreme Court, which
 included judges and prosecuting and defense attorneys from
 neighboring English-speaking countries which have the same
 basic legal system as The Gambia. This unusual step was taken
 because of a shortage of trained legal personnel in The
 Gambia, to avoid overwhelming the regular judicial process,
 and to demonstrate publicly the Government's concern for
 impartiality.
 There are currently no political prisoners in The Gambia. One
 of the coup leaders of 1981 was arrested in 1985, tried, and
 sentenced to death. It is expected that execution clemency
 will be granted as it has been in all other cases arising out
 of the 1981 coup attempt.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or'
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides guarantees, which are respected in
 practice, against arbitrary search of person and property.
 The Constitution permits the voluntary submission by the
 suspect to a search or a mandatory search if the search is
 reasonably required in the interests of national defense or
 other public interest. Under the criminal code, search
 warrants are issued by magistrates upon application by the
 police, based on probable cause. There are a number of police
 and military check points in and around Banjul. Drivers are
 stopped and vehicles searched from time to time.
 The rights of family are of extreme importance in this
 conservative Muslim society. Marriage, the raising of
 children, and religious instruction are regulated by a
 combination of personal preference and ethnic and religious
 tradition. The Government does not intrude in family matters
 except to protect public safety and morality. There is no
 effort to censor or control personal correspondence or
 communicat ions.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides guarantees of press freedom. In
 practical terms The Gambia, with its small, mainly rural,
 largely illiterate, and multilingual population does not
 support an active press. There are no daily newspapers.
 There is a government weekly paper and several intermittently
 published, mimeographed news sheets. There is a government
 radio station and also one private commercial station, which
 broadcasts largely music programs. There is no television in
 The Gambia, although Senegalese stations can be received. The
 Government dominates the media through Radio Gambia, but there
 have been no reported instances of government interference
 with the commercial radio station. The Government does not
 attempt to censor published materials whether they originate
 within or outside the country. Magazines and some newspapers
 
 
 124
 THE GAMBIA
 from outside the country are available at a few outlets in the
 capital. The Emergency Act, with its broad powers of
 detention, had an inhibiting effect on criticism of the
 Government by independent news sheets.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no restrictions on freedom of association and
 assembly in the Constitution. According to available
 information, no permits for meetings have been denied, but the
 authorities require meetings to be open to the public.
 Trade unions are small and fragmented and remain a minor
 element in Gambian economic and political life. Less than 20
 percent of the workforce is engaged in the industry, commerce,
 and service sectors, where unions normally are active. The
 Government has agreed that the general confederation, the
 Gambian Workers Union, may resume its functions provided it is
 reregistered. It had been deregistered after an illegal
 strike in the late 1970's. The union alleges that obstacles
 have been put in its way when it has sought to reregister,
 while the Government claims that the union is free to do so at
 any time. Apparently full union activity remains conditional
 on filing several reports and rectifying what the government
 alleges are financial irregularities. Other unions continue
 to function under basic labor and trade union legislation.
 Union members have freedom of movement to attend meetings
 outside the country. The Labor Administration Act specifies
 that workers are guaranteed freedom of association and the
 right to organize and to bargain collectively.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The constitutional guarantees of freedom of conscience,
 thought, and religion are observed in practice. The state is
 secular though Muslims constitute over 90 percent of the
 population. The schools provide instruction in the Koran for
 Muslim students. Christians, both Catholic and Protestant,
 freely practice their religion. There is a small Baha'i
 community in Banjul. Missionaries are permitted to carry on
 their various mission-related actitities. No evidence of
 discrimination in employment, education, or in other areas of
 Gambian life on the grounds of religion has been reported.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of movement subject to
 conditions protecting public safety, health, and morals.
 There is no restriction on freedom of emigration or freedom of
 return. Internally, police and military checkpoints exist in
 and around Banjul. There is no evidence that police harass
 travelers.
 Because of historic and ethnic ties with the people of
 Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and Mali, people tend to move
 unregulated across borders, which are poorly marked and
 difficult to police. Under the Confederation Treaty of 1981,
 neither Gambians nor Senegalese need passports or visas to
 travel to the other country. Early in 1985, some 600 Gambians
 were among the vast number of illegal aliens expelled by
 Nigeria. Their return has had no noticeablp impact. With the
 change of regime in Guinea (Conakry) there is evidence that
 many Guineans formerly resident in The Gambia are returning to
 Guinea.

 THE GAMBIA
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is elected by citizens 18 years of age and older;
 the chief executive official (the President) and the members of
 the legislature (House of Representatives) are popularly elected,
 as are the district councils and the chiefs who exercise
 traditional authority in the villages and compounds. A
 functioning multiparty system exists in The Gambia, even though
 the People's Progressive Party has been in power since
 independence. The principal opposition party, the National
 Convention Party, contests national and district elections. Other
 opposition parties contest the Presidency and other offices on a
 selected basis. Independents have run for and won legislative
 seats. There have not been any serious allegations of election
 fraud, but the opposition believed the 1983 district elections
 would be fixed and chose to boycott rather than contest the
 elections. The government party currently holds 35 of 43 seats in
 the House of Representatives, and the opposition is not able to
 defeat or modify significant legislation. Nevertheless, debate is
 open, and accepted parliamentary procedures are observed.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Government permits visits of international human rights
 organizations to observe the conditions of the detainees and the
 trial process. There have been no requests by such organizations
 for investigation of alleged human rights abuses in The Gambia
 during the past year. Amnesty International's main concerns, as
 expressed in its 1985 report (covering 1984), were largely
 overtaken by events in 1984 and 1985, e.g., commutation of death
 sentences for persons involved in the 1984 coup. Freedom House
 rates The Gambia "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Gambia is a poor, largely agricultural nation with a
 population of 751,000 people (1985). Almost 83 percent of the
 people live in rural areas. The population growth rate is 3.5
 percent a year. Per capita gross national product (1984) is $360
 a year.
 The Gambia depends on one major crop, groundnuts, for foreign
 exchange; this is subject to the vagaries of weather and world
 market conditions. There is also considerable unofficial entrepot
 activity across Gambia's porous borders. The population consists
 mostly of subsistence farmers who are not able to satisfy The
 Gambia's food requirements. As a result, the Government has
 relied heavily on external food assistance in recent years and on
 foreign assistance to fund a 5-year development plan which
 emphasizes crop diversification and greater agricultural
 productivity. The Government's ability to absorb and administer
 the assistance has been hampered by a lack of facilities and
 trained personnel.
 Life expectancy at birth is 40 years (1985); and the infant
 mortality rate is a high 191 per 1,000 live births. Access to
 safe water is limited almost exclusively to the few urban areas
 (85 percent in 1980). Rural population access to safe water was
 only three percent in 1970. The ratio of caloric supply available
 for consumption relative to nutritional requirements was 93
 percent in 1977. The adult literacy rate is 20 percent (1984).
 
 
 126
 THE GAMBIA
 Approximately 51 percent (1983) of eligible children attend
 primary school (males 64 percent, females 37 percent). The new
 Gambia College provides postsecondary training leading to
 certificates in teaching, agriculture, and nursing, but there is
 no university-level institution in The Gambia.
 The minimum age for employment is 18, at which age a prospective
 employee is authorized a labor card. The prohibition on child
 labor does not apply to customary chores on family farms. Minimum
 wages and hours of work are determined by the Joint Industrial
 Council, pursuant to the Labor Administration Act, which has
 represenation from employees, employers, and government.
 Occupational safety and health are covered by the Factory Act
 under which the Minister of Labor is given authority to regulate
 factory health and safety, accident prevention, and dangerous
 trades and to appoint inspectors to ensure compliance.
 Most people are Muslim and live in villages. While individual
 initiative and choice are valued, rights and privileges are
 generally perceived to reside in the group rather than in the
 individual. Though they are changing, traditional values remain
 strong. Education of. women is on the rise, and women participate
 increasingly in the professions and in political life. Marriages
 are still often arranged, but there is growing freedom of personal
 choice. Family planning, focused on the health and welfare of
 mother and child, remains controversial but is gaining
 acceptance. There is a Women's Bureau in the Office of the
 President which actively promotes debate on women's issues.
