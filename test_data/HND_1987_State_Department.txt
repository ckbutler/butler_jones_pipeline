 Honduras' constitutional democracy, despite socioeconomic
 difficulties'and continued challenges to security and
 development, was strengthened in 1987. Electoral reforms
 passed by the National Congress in October 1986 greatly
 diminished the possibilities for deliberate electoral
 irregularities. The new law was put to the test during the
 internal Liberal Party election of September 1987 in which
 over 600,000 party supporters participated. The impartial
 supervision exercised by the National Elections Tribunal (TNE)
 helped ensure popular acceptance of the outcome of this hard-
 fought election. The demonstrated commitment to civilian,
 democratic government by both civil and military authorities
 contributed to the general sense of social stability in the
 country.
 Fundamental structural problems in the economy have proven
 difficult to correct. The problems of unemployment and low
 productivity coistitute the chief economic concerns; per capita
 income ranks among the lowest in Latin America. Iriadequate
 social servibes, an influx of rural population to the cities,
 and marginal standards of living for many have generated social
 ills in the cities.' There has been a sharp increase in crime
 and sporadic terrorism by radical leftist organizations. The
 presence'in Honduras of some 150,000 refugees; mostly
 Nicaraguan, constitutes a significant additional burden on the.
 country's-limited resources.
 The Armed Forces are responsible for internal and external
 security,- During 1987 the Armed Forces and its police branch,
 the Public Security Forces FUSEP), have been publicly accused
 of various'liurman rights abuses. The involvement of radical
 organizatiopstin a series of murders and armed robberies
 generated Well-publicized, tometimes controversial
 countermeasures by t e secUrity forces. 'At the same time,
 FUSEP has confronted an increase in common crime of
 approximately 50 perc6nt over the past 2 yeats. In connection
 with an anticriim campaign, FUSEP undertook a significant
 force expansion. The large influx of untrained recruits may
 have exacerbated the problem. Such problems are being
 addressedbhi ugh'an assistance and trainzing program
 administered by the U.S. Department of Justice in cooperation
 with FUSEP.
 During 1987'Honduians exercised without impediment most basic
 rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. Certain
 rights, however; continued to be subject to sporadic.violation.
 Chief among those were the right to'habeas corpus, the right
 to counsel, and freedom from ihcommunicado detention for more'
 than 24ho~Urs. Violations attributable to the judiciary
 generally'reflect inadequate resources and systemic'weaknesses
 rather than deliberate abuses. The Honduran judiciary suffers
 from a lack of resources. The Supreme Court has made strong
 efforts to overcome some problems, as demonstrated by the
 establishment in early 1987 of a special commission to receive
 and investigate 'allegations of judicial corruption or
 irregularities." Several judges have been replaced as a result
 of the commission's work.
 Although the number of alleged abuses has increased over the
 previous year, both the Government and the Armed Forces'
 leadership took steps to deal with instances of improper
 behavior. In January 1987, President Azcona announced the
 formation of an Inter-Institutional Commission on Human
 Rights. Headed by the Attorney General and staffed by
 
 
 522
 HONDURAS
 attorneys and representatives of the three branches of
 government and the Armed Forces, the Commission receives
 complaints of and collects information on reports of abuses by
 the Government or the Armed Forces. The Commission also
 recommends remedial action in cases in which charges are
 supported by the evidence, and responds to national and
 international inquiries. At the Commission's urging, the
 President increased both its authority and resources in late
 1987.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no substantiated charges of politically motivated
 killings by security forces in 1987. There were, however,
 cases in which the official explanations of events leading to
 deaths were challenged. In the case of two alleged subversives
 killed in March, Hilda Rosa Lopez and Jose Fredy Nolasco, the
 media accused the police of using excessive force. The police
 claimed that the two were killed only after they opened fire
 when ordered to surrender. In a similar case in September,
 the media charged the police with having ambushed two other
 alleged subversives, Juan Angel Caballero and Roberto Ortiz
 Lopez. That charge was vigorously denied by the Armed Forces,
 which stated that the suspects had opened fire on a mobile
 surveillance unit, leading to an exchange in which they were
 killed. The controversy generated in that incident led to the
 opening of a judicial inquiry, the results of which have not
 yet been made public. In a third case, two men were killed
 under circumstances that remain unclear in a night attack
 while on a hunting trip. The media claimed that the two were
 victims of a military ambush, but did not cite a possible
 motive. The two surviving members of the expedition were also
 unable to suggest a motive or to identify their assailants.
 The Armed Forces, for their part, stated that they had no
 information on the incident and opened their own inquiry into
 the case. To date, there has been no report on its findings.
 A fourth case in which the police were accused of a politically
 motivated killing involved Trinidad Maria Pacheca, a member of
 the National Center of Rural Workers (CNTC). Pacheca was
 arrested by Honduran immigration authorities and in January he
 was turned over to the police, in whose custody he died. At
 the initiative of the CNTC, his body was exhumed by judicial
 order the day after burial. A medical examination indicated
 that Pacheca had died of blows to the body. A military judge
 rejected a CNTC request that an investigation be opened into
 the the case, citing insufficient evidence. Although the CNTC
 has declared its intention to pursue the matter further, there
 have been no further developments in the case.
 In addition to Pacheca, the press reported three other cases
 in which prisoners died while in police custody, allegedly as
 a result of beatings. None of the three cases has resulted in
 legal action. Both FUSEP and National Directorate of
 Investigations (DNI) also have been unofficially accused of
 having engaged in the summary killing of habitual violent
 criminals or of using unnecessary lethal force in the
 apprehension of suspected criminals during the intensified
 
 
 523
 HONDURAS
 anticrime campaign. The lack of substantiation of the charges
 made in the press makes it impossible to verify the validity
 of the allegations.
 It should be noted that the Committee for the Defense of Human
 Rights in Honduras (CODEH), a nongovernmental organization,
 has compiled'data of undetermined validity that would attribute
 to the security forces significant numbers of abuses in all
 categories. CODEH's President, Ramon Custodio, has been widely
 criticized in Honduras as-an unreliable source of information
 because of his association with the far left. CODEH cites the
 deaths of unidentified persons by unknown assailants as
 "evidence" of the existence of "death squads." CODEH neither
 presents, nor claims to have, evidence to support that charge.
 CODEH has similarly charged the Armed Forces with other
 violations, such'as bombings and kidnapings, hgain without
 substantiating its claims.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no confirmed cases of politically motivated
 disappearances in Honduras in 1987, although there have been
 inconclusive charges that some people detained by the security
 forces have disappeared. In March 1ï¿½87, for example, CODEH
 President Ramon Custodio announced that suspected subversive
 Doris Rosib~l Benavidez had "disappeared" and'been murdered by
 security-forces after Custodio failed to find her in his own
 inspection of DNI facililities. Shortly after that charge was
 made public, '8naridez appeared and soUght asylum in the
 Mexican EmbMsy,'-where hhe had been dropped-off by unknown
 persons. A' BenaVidez'had not beeii"charged with anj' crime,
 the Honduran Governmient allowed her to depart for Mexico.
 CODEH similarly claimed a dihappearance had occurred in August
 immediately after immigration authorities took into custody a
 youth who hdbattemptedto enter the country fromthe Soviet
 Union on falsified documents. In a press conference, the-
 youth provided- ihfbtma'ion indicating the methods by which
 member5  fthe Honduran radical left are able to enter and
 leave the country clandestinely. 'The youth, whose self-exiled
 stepfather-is the Secretary General of the Honduran'Communlst
 Party and whose mother is a fugitive suspected of a series of
 bombings in Honduras, was turned over to juvenile court for
 processing on a-misdemeaior.- He was released in-January 1988, "
 by order of the Supreme Court under the Government's amnesty
 program.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although torture is prohibited under the Constitution, abuse
 of prisoners is notuncommon. The most commonly charged form
 of abuse'against prisoners in 1987 was physical beating.
 There were,'however, several cases in which more severe forms-
 of abuse, including the use of electric shocks, were charged.
 The most Widely publicized case involved 14 farmers detained
 in October-on charges of subversion.- A number of those'
 'detained showed visible signs of beatings when turned over to
 the courts, and several claimed to have been given electric
 shocks, to have had their heads covered by a hood during
 interrogation, and to have been strung up by their hands. The
 case was widely aired in the press and created considerable
 public controversy, leading to investigations by both FUSEP
 and the National Congress, which are still under way. All of
 
 
 524
 HONDURAS
 these farmers were released by the end of 1987, as part of the
 amnesty law passed by the Congress under the requirements of
 the Esquipulas II Peace Plan.
 It is common for suspected criminals, when turned over to the
 courts, to claim to have confessed under torture. However,
 purported victims rarely offer evidence to substantiate those
 claims, or even details of how they were tortured. The police
 assert that persons turned over to the courts routinely make
 such charges in recognition that Honduran law not only
 nullifies confessions given under duress, but accepts as valid
 only those confessions specifically repeated before the judge.
 The police maintain that increasingly frequent use of such
 charges complicates prosecution of credible cases. Disputes
 over the handling of confessions have contributed to tensions
 between the judiciary and the police. The judiciary does not
 believe it is necessary to have a confession in hand in order
 to reach a decision during the evidentiary period, while the
 police tend to believe that the courts are too ready to
 release even those with a history of habitual violence, as
 evident in cases of defendants who are repeat offenders. In
 October 1987, the police and judiciary formed a joint
 commission to resolve their differences and ensure the
 efficient and fair processing of suspected criminals.
 FUSEP is not indifferent to charges of abuse and has taken
 action to remove some offenders from its ranks. During 1987,
 some 780 members of the Public Security Forces were
 dishonorably discharged for abuses of authority. Those so
 discharged are prohibited from subsequent service in any
 branch of the Armed Forces. A number of FUSEP and military
 personnel who were arrested and charged with more serious
 abuses were turned over to military tribunals for trial.
 Aside from abuses by individual members of the security forces
 or other authorities, prisoners in the Honduran penal system
 face inadequate nutrition and insufficient medical care.
 Prisoners are allowed visits from friends or family, including
 conjugal visits, and generally arrange for supplements to
 their diet from outside. Problems in one prison in San Pedro
 Sula erupted in rioting in late 1987. Prison authorities
 resorted to armed force to put down the rioting and a number
 of prisoners were killed. There were widespread charges by
 the press that prison authorities had used excessive force in
 this case.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Under Honduran law, a person may be arrested only with specific
 court authorization in the form of an order for arrest and must
 be clearly informed of the grounds for arrest. The suspect may
 be held no longer than 24 hours by security forces before being
 turned over to the court, which reviews the evidence against
 the person. Within 6 days, the court is obligated to order
 either the release of the detainee or his remand to a penal
 center pending trial. Bail is both available and frequently
 used, although, in response to the sharp increase in crime,
 the Supreme Court in July revoked the granting of personal
 bail in cases involving assault and robbery. The legality of
 this Supreme Court action remains a matter of controversy.
 In practice, the police and other elements of the security
 forces have been known to carry out detentions without
 judicial orders, and there were several such cases in 1987.
 Such violations appear to be the result of actions of
 
 
 525
 HONDURAS
 individual officers rather than an official effort.to conceal
 detentions. The police periodically violate the 24-hour rule,
 holding detainees incommunicado during questioning prior to
 turning them over- to the courts or released. The security
 forces have taken the position that the 24 hours allowed is
 both unreasonable and unrealistic. In most cases the period
 of detention does not last for more than a few days, but that
 period may extend to as much as several weeks if a person is
 suspected of involvement in more serious crimes such as murder
 or subverqipn.
 A writ of habeas corpus can be filed with a court to locate
 persons believed to be detained, and this recourse is
 frequently used.  Most subjects bf habeas corpus writs are
 released prior to the courts completion of action on the
 writ. While the courts appear to carry out-their obligations
 with respect to habeas corpus fairly consistently, the
 security forces do not always comply with court orders for
 personal appearance. This is particularly true when a person
 is being questioned on matters affecting national security.
 The Armed Forces, generally assert that it is in the public
 interest to retain custody until interrogation is completed.
 That position has created frictions with the judiciary. The
 Supreme Court President has indicated that prolonged detention
 may be justified An certain national security cases, but the
 law hasnot been.revised and the matter remains contentious.
 There have been no reported cases either of forced exile or
 forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All trials in Honduras are public; there are neither secret
 tribunals nor political prisoners. Although 8 of 10 persons
 granted asylum by the Mexican and Spanish Embassies during
 1987 were allowed to leave the country, the Government of
 Honduras did not recognize their claims of political
 persecution. They were instead granted exit permission on the
 basis that in none of the cases were there legal impediments
 to their departure.,
 The law provides that every person accused of a crime has the
 right to an initial hearing by a judge to assess the merits of
 the charges, to bail, and to an attorney, provided by the
 State if necessary. The defendant also has the right to an
 appeal and is considered innocent until proven guilty.
 Despite the comprehensiveness of the law in the matter of fair
 trial, in practice these-basic rights have not been fully
 exercised, A reflection of continued weaknesses in the
 judicial system. The failure to implement a public defender
 progran, as-provided for in the Constitution, weighs heavily
 on the indigent. There are numerous cases in which persons
 accused of-crimes, but lacking the means to hire an attorney
 or to pay bail, have been detained for long periods of time
 without any legal processing. Further, the acute lack of
 resources that characterizes the judiciary, including the
 absence of an'adequate administrative-system, chronic budget
 inadequagies, and shortages of qualified personnel, contributes
 to a backlog-in the processing of legal cases. The Department
 of Penal Institutions-reported in July 1987 that only 1,384 of
 the country's 3,270 accused criminals held in penal centers
 had had their cases tried, of whom only 244 had been
 sentenced. A survey of several prisons further indicated that
 the majority of accused persons had already served their full
 terms by the time-they were judged and sentenced.
 
 
 526
 HONDURAS
 In an effort to alleviate a situation that is in violation of
 basic constitutional guarantees, the Government took remedial
 steps during 1987. In July President Azcona ordered a special
 investigation that resulted, in September, in an order from
 the Supreme Court to all lower courts to provide state
 attorneys to indigent persons held without bail or otherwise
 pending court processing. The President's legal advisor
 reported in July that the Government had provided legal
 defense for 163 farmers charged with the illegal takeovers of
 private property, leading to their release. An additional 50
 to 60 farmers similarly charged were urged to turn themselves
 in and take advantage of the opportunity to resolve their
 cases. Current plans are for the Honduran court system to
 receive several million dollars in U.S. assistance over the
 next several years to strengthen the judicial career system
 and create a corps of public defenders.
 The Supreme Court, consisting of nine magistrates, is
 appointed by the National Congress and in turn appoints
 approximately 400 judges at lower levels. The Constitution
 provides for a judiciary equal to and independent of the other
 branches of government. However, continued charges of
 political influence on judicial decisions led the Supreme
 Court President in February 1987 to form an investigatory
 commission to review charges of corruption and judicial
 irregularities. The ongoing work of the commission resulted
 in a number of dismissals from the bench during 1987.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government respects the constitutionally provided rights
 to personal and family privacy, and the inviolability of the
 home and private communications. Telephonic and written
 correspondence is generally free from monitoring, although, as
 provided for by law, official review of such communications
 may be authorized by judicial order for specific purposes such
 as criminal investigations or national security. Similarly,
 private homes may be searched with a specific judicial order
 or in "urgent cases" in order to "impede the commission of
 crimes or avoid grave harm to persons or property." There
 were no known violations of these rights during 1987.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press,
 rights that are vigorously exercised. The communications
 media present political viewpoints ranging from left-of-center
 to right. The media freqly criticize both the Government and
 Armed Forces. Although the press is in turn criticized for
 sensationalism or bias, there have been no efforts to silence
 it or to take reprisals.
 Local radio stations--there are over 100--broadcast numerous
 programs which allow free expression of opinion. The four
 television stations, which broadcast throughout the country,
 are privately owned. During 1987 there was at least one case
 in which the media sharply criticized the police for impeding
 access to the site of a police operation, although journalists
 were allowed into the area after a short delay.
 The Government and Armed Forces fully respect academic freedom
 in Honduras. This is reflected in the intense activity of
 
 
 527
 HONDURAS
 university and secondary school academic and political
 organizations, many of which are ideologically left of
 center. Discipline of these often unruly, even violent,
 groups is generally left to academic administrators rather
 than the security forces,'
 While there-were no cases in 1987 of restrictions on either
 freedom of the press or expression by the authorities, in
 October two radio stations'were taken over by force by
 self-proclaimed members of a 1Marxist-Leninist guerrilla group
 known as the Cinchoneros. After tying up station employees,
 the guerriblas forced the technicians at gunpoint to broadcast
 a tape commemorating Cue Luevara and two deceased meinbers-of
 the group,and threatening further violence in pursuit of their
 goals.%
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful- assembly for political, religious, or
 other purposes is clearly spelled out in the Constitution. No
 prior authorization or permit is necessary for such assembly
 although open-air assemblies may require a permit for the
 "sole purpose of-guaranteeing public order." There were no
 known cases where peaceful outdoor assembly was prohibited
 during 1987. The Government respects these freedoms, and they
 are routinely exercised'in demonstrations,'marches, 'and
 meetings of labor unions, political parties, professional
 organizations, students, and human rights groups--many -"
 expressing opposition to official policies.
 Labor unions enjoy a 35-year history and are independent,
 strong, and varied in political orientation. Most large
 enterpriqes have a -unionized labor force,' and workers are free
 to organizer'  bargairi dol]ectively, and strike. Hondurask
 trade-union movement.ma-intaihs -close ties withfintdrnational
 trade union org~nizatiohs. The' largest union group, the
 Confederatiow of- iHonduran Workers, is an affiliate of the
 International Confederation of Freeï¿½Tr-ade Unions.- Next in
 size is the General'-Worjers Ceitgral;affIliated-with the
 Christian-Democratic World Confederation of Labor. The
 Unitarian'Eederation: -of..ondra& Workers is an- affiliate of
 the Communisk-dominaed World-Federation-of Trdde'Unions. The
 three labor.brganization-.cla7Im'to rTpresent about 20 percent
 of alliHonduran'orkers, Thdlucing a substantial number of
 peasants and rural laborers.
 Honduran labor and peasant organizations play an integral role
 in the political process. They are consulted routinely by the
 Government- on issues affecting their interests and play a
 watchdog- role-inrelation to th6 Presidont, his Cabinet,; and
 the Congress'. Labor unions were actively involved in    - "
 monitoring the honesty and fairness of the last general-
 elections. Union leaders regularly travel to international
 meetings, and severar are members-of the. national legislature.
 c. Freedom of Religion          -
 Although a'predominantly Roman Catholic country, Honduras has
 no state religion. All forms of religious expression arp
 constitutionally guaranteed, and foreign missionaries,
 including manyAmericans, operate in many parts of the
 countrr- The only restriction on religious activity is the
 Constitution's express provision that no minister of any
 religion may hold a public office or engage in political
 propaganda based on religious motives ot beliefs.
 
 
 528
 HONDURAS
 While there is no attempt to control or impede the free
 expression of religious beliefs in Honduras, the clergy is not
 immune from detention for secular offenses. In July a
 Belizean seminarian was detained by security forces as an
 undocumented alien and held incommunicado for 5 days before
 being deported to Belize. It was later stated that the
 seminarian had been carrying allegedly subversive literature.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Hondurans freely travel within and outside Honduras. There
 are no permanent travel restrictions for Hondurans or resident
 foreigners, although national security concerns have led to
 increased police checks for personal identification, which by
 law must be carried at all times.
 Exit visas are required to leave Honduras and constitute a
 form of control over international travel. They are nearly
 always granted without dispute unless the applicant is wanted
 in connection with a crime.
 Under the.Constitution, Hondurans may be neither extradited
 nor turned over to the authorities of another state.
 Hondurans returning from Communist or Arab nations may be
 questioned at length about their travels, and any Honduran
 found to be involved with terrorist groups abroad is subject
 to prosecution. For security reasons, citizens of all
 Communist and most Arab nations need special permission to
 enter Honduras.
 Honduras has offered asylum to substantial numbers of refugees
 from neighboring countries, although during 1987 there were
 few ne  inflows of refugees. Most of the new additions to the
 camps nder the protection of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) were people who had been
 living on the local economy for the last several years and who
 decided to take advantage of the UNHCR's programs.
 During 1987 there were as many as 20,000 Salvadoran, 26,000
 Nicaraguan, and 550 Guatemalan refugees in Honduras living
 under the protection of the UNHCR. Refugee experts estimate
 that an additional 55,000 Nicaraguans (7,000 to 10,000 of whom
 are Indians) have taken refuge in Honduras since 1979. Local
 press reports place the number of unregistered refugees as
 high as 150,000.
 During 1987 the dominant theme in Honduran refugee affairs was
 voluntary repatriation.- This includes unregistered refugees
 as well as those assisted by the UNHCR. On October 10-11,
 4,213 Salvadoran refugees returned to their homes of origin in
 the largest single group repatriation in the region. In 1987,
 5,600 Salvadoran refugees repatriated, and 3,700 Nicaraguan
 Indian refugees repatriated to Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast area.
 Non-Indian Nicaraguans are the exception to the pattern.
 During 1987 only 122 repatriated, in spite of Sandinista
 government inducements to do so at the border point of Las
 Manos.
 Although conditions in the UNHCR camps are good, protection
 problems continue in the Salvadoran refugee camps and in some
 of the Nicaraguan Miskito settlements. There have been
 credible reports of forced recruitment and intimidation by
 political organizers linked to the Salvadoran guerrillas, in
 
 
 529
 HONDURAS
 some casbes tboptevent foluntary repatriation. Although
 attempts by'the' HondutanGovernment to control such abuses in
 the camps are considered threatening by some outsiders, the
 Government continues to respect the authority of the UNHCR.
 As a result, of 66nfrpntations between Nicaraguan refugees and
 Hondurans' living in the"fali area, th Hbnduran Government

 HONDURAS
 domestic and international inquiries concerning human rights
 and has sought to provide full information despite its limited
 resources.
 Within Honduras, the viewpoints, complaints, and criticisms
 expressed by human rights organizations are given ample
 publicity in the four daily newspapers and broadcast media.
 The most vocal of the human rights-related organizations is
 the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras
 (CODEH), headed by Ramon Custodio. Although CODEH has been
 aggressive in drawing attention to human rights abuses, most
 Hondurans consider it to be a partisan organization. CODEH is
 publicly identified with the support and defense of leftist or
 radical causes, a political orientation evident in the written
 materials distributed abroad by the organization. CODEH's
 politicization and reluctance to speak in defense of victims
 of the violent left led to public demonstrations against it in
 May 1987, following the deaths of two persons and the wounding
 of a DNI officer by what were assumed to be Communist
 guerrillas. Under public pressure, the president of CODEH
 eventually criticized the attack. Despite efforts by the
 Inter-Institutional Commission on Human Rights to work with
 CODEH toward the resolution of specific complaints, CODEH has
 failed to respond to requests to make available for
 investigation its pending cases.
 The Government has cooperated with inquiries into cases of
 alleged human rights abuses and has opened its own
 investigations when charges have.been brought to its
 attention. This cooperation has extended to such
 international bodies as the Inter-American Court of Human
 Rights, the jurisdiction of which has been accepted
 unconditionally by Honduras. During September 1987, Honduras
 defended itself before the Court in three cases of persons
 alleged to have disappeared in the 1981-82 period. (These are
 the first such cases ever brought in Latin America. The only
 other Latin American country that has accepted unrestricted
 jurisdiction by the Court is Costa Rica.) A decisibn in these
 cases is pending. The complaints were brought before the
 court by CODEH, which took a leading role in the prosecution.

 women are limited in some careers because of strongly held
 cultural values and attitudes, despite the absence of any
 overt impediment.. There are seven women in the national
 Congress, 'Ethnic minorities, while they enjoy full equality
 under the' law, continue to be the object of some social
 discrimination.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Constitution and the labor code require that all labor be
 fairly paid and limit the hiring of children under 16 years of
 age. Although minimum wages, working hours, vacations, and
 occupational safety are regulated by law, such regulations are
 frequently ignored in practice. The daily minimum wage varies
 by occupation, ranging from $2.30 to $3.55 per day. There is
 no widespread pattern of wage discrimination against women in
 the work force, although some work-commonly performed by
 women, such as domestic and secretarial jobs, is compensated
