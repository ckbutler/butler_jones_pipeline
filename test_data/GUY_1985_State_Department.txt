 GUYANA
 Guyana is a republic headed by an executive president, with a
 parliament, an independent judiciary, and a multiparty
 system. For twenty years Guyana's politics were dominated by
 Linden Forbes Sampson Burnham, who died unexpectedly on August
 6, 1985 of a heart attack. His People's National Congress
 (PNC) first came to power in a coalition government with the
 United Force (UF) Party in British-supervised elections in
 December 1964.
 Upon Burnham's death, Prime Minister Hugh Desmond Hoyte became
 President and was elected as leader of the PNC. The 1980
 Constitution was followed to the letter, with Hoyte replacing
 Burnham in an orderly succession. President Hoyte dissolved
 Parliament on October 29, and national and regional elections
 were held on December 9, 1985. According to official results,
 the PNC won 78.5 percent of the vote. Its closest rival, the
 People's Progressive Party (PPP), won 15.8 percent of the
 vote. In the 1980 elections, the PNC got 77.6 of the vote.
 Prior to elections, several Guyanese electoral practices were
 revised which in the past had helped to call into question the
 fair and free character of Guyanese elections. However, these
 changes were insufficient to ensure that the voting and ballot
 counting processes were not marred by serious charges by
 opposition parties and by some civic organizations of election
 rigging.
 On December 12, 1985, Desmond Hoyte was sworn in as Guyana's
 president for a 5-year term. The next day, five opposition
 parties held a public rally to protest what they described as
 widespread election fraud by the PNC. PPP leader Dr. Cheddi
 Jagan said he would call for strikes and demonstrations to
 bring down the Government. President Hoyte responded by
 saying he would not tolerate any attempt to disrupt the peace
 and create unrest. By year's end, calm prevailed despite
 continued allegations by critics of the PNC that they were
 being harassed by the Government in retaliation for condemning
 the elections as fraudulent.
 Race apparently was less of a factor in the 1985 elections
 than previously. Although some members of the Indo-Guyanese
 community allege that the Government discriminates against
 them on grounds of race, the Government has denied these
 allegations. The Government and party leadership include a
 significant proportion of Indo-Guyanese, both Muslim and
 Hindu.
 Individuals are free to pursue private interests, and rights
 to private property are respected. Social services and
 employment in the public sector seem to be open to all
 citizens on a racially nondiscriminatory basis. Indo-Guyanese
 continue to dominate the entrepreneurial aspects of the
 economy while Afro-Guyanese dominate the public sector,
 including the civil service.
 In 1985, the human rights climate improved. There were fewer
 allegations of police killings of criminal suspects or of
 wanted criminals, and security personnel at Timehri
 International Airport conducted fewer random body searches.
 The Mirror, the newspaper of the opposition PPP, was allowed
 to receive part of a shipment of newsprint which it had been
 sent as a gift. There was more publication of opposition
 viewpoints in the government-owned media, although opposition
 views were still given very selective treatment. The
 
 
 560
 GUYANA
 Government continued its refusal to permit the independent
 Catholic Standard newspaper to import free gifts of newsprint.
 International human rights activists were barred from coming
 to Guyana to investigate electoral conditions. Guyana Trades
 Union Congress (TUC) president George Daniels was confronted
 by progovernment efforts to undermine his TUC leadership.
 Police failed to prevent a progovernment group from totally
 disrupting the annual general meeting of the Guyana Council of
 Churches on March 12.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings or summary
 executions in Guyana.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no politically motivated disappearances,
 clandestine detentions, or abductions in Guyana.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture isprohibited by the Constitution. In March, the
 government-owned Guyana Chronicle carried an editorial in
 support of Amnesty International's week-long observance of
 abolition of torture. There have been no allegations of the
 use of torture in Guyana as a deliberate tool of political
 control. However, human rights activists believe that
 confessions are often forced from prisoners by police. The
 Government admits that during its ongoing campaign against
 criminal activities, some mistreatment of criminal suspects
 has taken place due to undisciplined police. In its annual
 report covering August 1984 to August 1985, the Guyana Human
 Rights Association (GHRA) alleged five cases of cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment in 1985.
 The GHRA has charged that physical conditions within prisons
 are "deplorable," although it concedes some improvement.
 While prison conditions are Spartan, the Government claims
 adequate diet and medical facilities are available.
 I d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Constitution, no person may be deprived of personal
 liberty except as authorized by law. The right of habeas
 corpus exists and is generally respected. There have been a
 few allegations of individuals arrested and held for periods
 of from several hours to several days and up to 3 weeks.
 In June 1985, the National Security Act was renewed. It
 provides that persons suspected of crimes under the act may be
 held up to 3 months without charges, after which they must be
 released or charged. It also authorizes searches without a
 warrant. No one has been detained under the Act since 1977.
 The GHRA questioned the renewal when "there is no political
 unrest or external threat to the country."
 
 
 561
 GUY~ANA
 In the past, the Government has tried to use the legal system
 for political purposes. The courts have frequently dismissed
 charges which were obviously politically motivated; however,
 the litigation has been time-consuming and expensive for
 members of the political opposition. Such actions have
 constituted a form of harassment.
 There have been no exiles from Guyana.
 The Constitution provides that "no person shall be held in
 slavery or servitude and no person shall be required to
 perform forced labour." Government opponents claim that
 "voluntary" labor by civil servants one Saturday a year on
 Hope Estate, a government-owned coconut plantation, is forced
 labor because government employees are afraid of losing their
 jobs if they do not attend these work sessions. The practice
 of offering volunteer workers at Hope the opportunity to
 purchase scarce goods at favorable prices is used as an
 inducement to attract workers.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Guyana maintains a British common law system and legal
 procedures. Many lawyers and members of the Guyanese
 judiciary were trained in the United Kingdom. The
 Constitution protects the right of anyone charged with a
 criminal offense to a hearing by a court established by law.
 This right is respected in practice. Guyana has a functioning
 bail system, and defendants are accorded fair public trials
 and represented by counsel, who are court-appointed when
 necessary. Timely charges are presented, and appeals can be
 made to higher courts. There are no special courts for
 political security cases nor any political prisoners.
 Although opponents of the Government have asserted that "as an
 institution" the judiciary "has shown an increasing inability
 to resist the encroachment of politics," they cite no specific
 legal cases to support their allegations. No trials have been
 held in private. The independence of the judiciary and the
 integrity of the judicial process have been respected.
 There are apparent delays in the judicial proceedings, due in
 part to shortages of trained personnel and materials. The
 GHRA believes the judiciary places too much emphasis upon
 enforcing the Government's policies against "economic crimes."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In addition to the National Security Act's continued
 authorization of searches without a warrant, a rice bill
 became law this year which contained a provision to prevent
 smuggling of rice by granting appropriate authorities the
 right to "enter and search any premises.. .where padi or rice
 is stored;...or stop and search any aircraft, ship, carriage,
 animal or thing." However, there were no complaints or abuses
 under this new law.
 The Government. generally respects the right to privacy of
 those persons who are not actively engaged in any effort to
 express public views or to work in active political opposition
 to the Government. Some Working People's Alliance (WPA) and
 PPP activists have complained of politically motivated
 searches without a warrant for weapons, ammunition, or
 contraband. Under the National Security Act, such searches
 
 
 562
 GUYA
 are legal. In December, police revoked Dr. Jagan's license to
 possess a firearm. The GHRA reports that the constitutionally
 questionable practice by Timehri International Airport
 authorities of randomly conducting "body seaches" has
 "diminished." Forced resettlement of the population has not
 occurred in Guyana.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution affirms freedom of speech and press.
 However, the Government has control over the media both
 directly through ownership of the country's only daily
 newspaper and only radio station and indirectly through
 licensing of the importation of newsprint and printing presses
 used by other publishers. The PNC presents its views in the
 government-owned Guyana Chronicle and the ruling party's New
 Nation. Opposition viewpoints are freely expressed without
 prior censorship in several weekly papers, which, because they
 have only limited access to newsprint, resemble news sheets
 more than newspapers. In 1985, the Government reversed its
 previous policy of not permitting the importation of donated
 newsprint by allowing the PPP's newspaper, The Mirror, to
 receive a gift of newsprint from the Soviet Union, on
 condition, however, that the newsprint be distributed among
 all newspapers in proportion to their circulation figures. In
 fact, the gift was divided between the PPP's Mirror and the
 PNC's "New Nation" with the latter getting most of it. In
 addition, the Government promised to assist The Mirror by
 facilitating the importation of a new printing press. However,
 the Catholic Standard, weekly newspaper of the Roman Catholic
 Church, has not been permitted to receive donations of
 newsprint despite repeated requests to the Government. Apart
 from restrictions on newsprint, opponents of the Government
 allege that libel suits have been used as an "intimidatory
 device" against opposition weeklies. But there may have been
 some instances when careless investigation of reports and
 exaggerated rhetoric by weeklies legitimately invited libel
 suits.
 Guyanese receive printed materials from abroad, but scarce
 foreign exchange is generally not available for subscriptions
 to foreign publications. The Caribbean Contact, a monthly
 regional newspaper which is published in Barbados and which
 has been unrelenting in its hostility to the Government, is
 freely available and sold locally for Guyana currency.
 Foreign and regional radio broadcasts, including Voice of
 America, can be received.
 The Government owns the country's only radio station, the
 Guyana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC), which broadcasts the
 BBC World News Service twice daily. GBC is highly selective
 in reporting the views and activities of opposition parties,
 although in 1985 it appears to have aired the views of the
 parliamentary opposition parties--the PPP and the UF--more
 frequently than in previous years. This year Guyana's
 elections commission allocated free radio time to opposition
 political parties. The Chronicle published objective
 summaries of these broadcasts and publicized opposition
 meetings. However, the WPA filed suit against the GBC for
 refusing to sell it air time in addition to what was provided
 gratis. Because the Government believes that the media should
 serve "developmental" needs, which in practice is defined as
 
 
 563
 GUYANA
 supporting government policies, journalists employed by the
 government-owned media employ self-censorship; unfavorable or
 objective reporting has cost such journalists their jobs on
 occasion. The Guyana News Agency (GNA) edits items which the
 government media receive from wire services. In the past, GNA
 largely relied on the Soviet news agency TASS and the Cuban
 news agency Prensa Latina for the bulk of the international
 articles appearing in the government-owned Guyana Chronicle.
 By the end of 1985, GNA drew much more frequently on American
 and other wire services for its news articles. As a result,
 reporting on world events became more balanced than in past
 years.
 The Government record on academic freedom is good. Several
 opposition Working People's Alliance leaders and Guyana Human
 Rights Association activists teach at the University of
 Guyana. Opposition parties have organized student groups
 there.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and
 association, and in general, individuals can freely
 associate. However, under the Public Order Act, police
 permits are required for public political meetings. At his
 discretion, the police commissioner can refuse permission for
 a meeting without explanation. In March 1985, the court
 decided an action brought by a WPA activist in October 1981,
 concerning the constitutionality of the police commissioner's
 refusal to grant permission to hold several public meetings in
 various locations. The commissioner based denial of the
 request on the "volatile social climate." The case was
 dismissed on the grounds that the activist had applied to the
 wrong police station for holding the meetings.
 In general, opposition political parties complain of delays in
 receiving permission from the police to hold public political
 meetings or of inadequate police protection to prevent some of
 their meetings from being disrupted by toughs allegedly
 associated with the ruling party. However, opposition
 political parties held public rallies which were not
 disrupted. According to Guyana's police commissioner, parties
 applied to hold over 700 public meetings during the 6-week
 campaign period. Of those, he said few had to be rescheduled
 due to conflicts with other meetings. The Government did not
 attempt to disrupt the public rally sponsored by opposition
 parties on December 13.
 Workers in Guyana are legally free to join unions and to
 strike. Legislation setting out democratic procedures
 enabling unorganized workers to choose a union and organized
 workers to change unions has been proposed but not yet
 enacted. Guyana has militant and powerful unions which oppose
 the Government. Strikes in the government-owned sugar
 industry are common, and strikers are generally not
 penalized. However, strikes in other public sectors have met
 more resistance. After a 1983 strike in the government-owned
 bauxite industry many workers, including all shop stewards,
 were dismissed. The Guyana Trade Union Congress (TUC) is
 still negotiating for their reinstatement. The Government has
 the authority to declare any strike "political or illegal."
 Although it has not exercised that right since 1979, some
 trade unionists believe that the mere existence of this
 authority has an intimidating effect on independent trade
 union activity.
 
 
 564
 GUYANA
 The TUC is the sole national trade union center; its 70,000
 members and 24 affiliates constitute the entire unionized work
 force. It is responsible for centralized collective
 bargaining although a court challenge to legislation which
 gave it this status is still pending.
 Seventeen TUC unions support the ruling Government while seven
 unions, including the two largest, oppose the Government and
 are either affiliated with the opposition PPP or the WPA or
 are politically independent. Until September 1984, the
 progovernment unions, which have disproportionate voting power
 in electing the TUC's executive board, dominated the
 organization. At the 1984 annual TUC conference, the
 dissident unions narrowly won control of the executive board.
 Since that election, the new TUC leadership has been
 embattled. Legal actions brought against unions which are in
 opposition to the Government seem to be designed to frustrate
 union activity. In spring 1985, progovernment dissidents in
 the Public Service Union (PSU) obtained injunctions against
 ,the holding of PSU elections and its annual conference, thus
 virtually paralyzing union operations and forcing it to incur
 large legal expenses. Another suit brought by a progovernment
 faction is pending against the opposition Guyana Mine Workers
 Union. Even if the unions are ultimately victorious in the
 courts, the delay and expense of the court procedures weaken
 and intimidate them.
 In May 1985, the Government pulled PNC-affiliated unions out
 of traditional TUC-sponsored Labor Day rallies and mounted
 government/PNC-sponsored rallies which overshadowed and
 seriously diminished the effectiveness of TUC rallies.
 Arbitration, mediation, due process, and judicial review are
 all available to unions in Guyana. Unions, trade
 associations, private associations, and professional bodies
 freely maintain relations with recognized international bodies
 in their fields, both public and private.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion and there is
 complete tolerance of religious faiths in Guyana. Christians
 (44 percent), Hindus (42 percent), Muslims (12 percent), and
 Baha'is (2 percent) are free to practice their religions
 without restrictions. There is no favored or official state
 religion. Foreign missionaries are permitted to enter the
 country to proselytize. Adherence to a particular faith does
 not confer any advantage in civil, political, economic,
 military, or other secular status.
 On March 12, a demonstration by a PNC-formed ad hoc group
 called "Concerned Christians," supported by adherents of the
 "House of Israel," a paramilitary religious cult led by a
 fugitive from U.S. justice, forced the Guyana Council of
 Churches (GCC) to cancel its annual general meeting. The
 demonstration was apparently prompted by a GCC working paper
 critical of the Government's economic policies and accusing
 the Government of political repression and of eroding human
 rights. On March 18, the government-owned radio station
 carried an "official commentary" characterizing the GCC
 document as "nothing short of treason." In addition, Anglican
 Bishop Randolph George was singled out for abuse in a
 government-owned media campaign which lasted several weeks. A
 suit was filed against Bishop George in November by a member
 of the Anglican Church who was reportedly active in the
 
 
 565
 GUYANA
 "Concerned Christians" group. The suit charges that the April
 16 and 17 Diocesan elections were fraudulent. In a possible
 effort to reconcile political differences between the
 Government and certain religious groups, one of the first
 official acts of President Hoyte was to form a religious
 advisory committee. However, it was not apparent by the end
 of the year that this committee was serving a concilliatory
 role.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Guyana is guaranteed by the
 Constitution and is permitted. However, since the colonial
 period, travel to certain Amerindian areas has required
 government permission. In the past, permission has at times
 been withheld, apparently on political grounds, but there were
 no such reports in 1985.
 Guyanese are free to travel abroad, to emigrate, and to return
 to Guyana. Occasionally opposition politicians have been
 stopped and searched at the international airport, but reports
 of such searches diminished in 1985.
 During 1985, no Guyanese had his citizenship revoked or his
 passport taken permanently for political reasons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Critics of Forbes Burnham had charged that he maintained
 himself in power for over 20 years through control of the
 security apparatus, rigged elections, harassment and
 intimidation of the opposition, as well as through state
 control of the economy and public sector jobs. Prime Minister
 Hugh Desmond Hoyte, who became President in a smooth and
 orderly constitutional succession on Burnham's death in August
 has activated three new mechanisms to channel the
 participation of Guyanese who are not members of the PNC into
 the decisionmaking processes of the State. He has established
 two 15-member presidential advisory committees, one on the
 private sector and another on religious affairs. The third
 mechanism for increasing popular participation in governmental
 decisionmaking is the 123-member National Economic and Social
 Council which met for the first time on September 14, 1985,
 even though its creation was provided for in the 1977 State
 Planning Act. The Council is supposed to facilitate the
 widest possible participation of the Guyanese people in the
 policy-making, planning, monitoring, and evaluation connected
 with development programs.
 Despite an effort by the Marxist-Leninist PPP to get PNC
 agreement to postpone elections indefinitely, constitutionally
 mandated parliamentary elections were held on December 9,
 1985. The elections were marred by allegations of fraud by
 opposition parties, by some civil organizations, and by the
 bishops of the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches. The
 Government admits some irregularities but denies that they
 were extensive. The PNC won 78.5 percent of the vote which
 gave the party 42 seats in the National Assembly, a gain of
 one seat. The PPP won 8 seats, losing 2 from the 1980
 elections. With 3.4 percent of the vote, the UF retained its
 2 seats. The WPA which boycotted the 1980 elections got 1.3
 percent of the vote and was given one seat. Three other
 
 
 566
 GUYANA
 opposition parties ran in the elections but won no seats. The
 PNC won a similar victory in elections for seats on the
 regional democratic councils of Guyana's 10 administrative
 regions.
 Constitutionally, all citizens 18 years of age or older were
 eligible to participate in the political process and to vote;
 citizenship has not been denied on political grounds.
 Opposition parties and other critics of the Government mounted
 a pre-election campaign for free and fair elections. The
 Government was partially responsive by eliminating postal
 balloting and by severely restricting overseas and proxy
 voting. Also, it gave preliminary voters' lists to all
 political parties in a timely manner to permit identification
 of possible errors and allowed additional time for opposition
 parties to appoint agents to monitor polling stations and
 counting centers. Nonetheless, these and other measures
 failed to ensure that the 1985 elections would be perceived to
 have been completely free and fair. The Government admitted
 foreign journalists to cover the elections but did not allow
 admission of foreign human rights observer groups. Under the
 "Representation of the People-Act," the Government may or may
 not choose to count the ballots at the polling stations as
 demanded by the opposition.
 Opposition parties charged there was widespread
 disenfranchisement of their supporters, multiple voting by PNC
 members, and instances in which opposition polling agents were
 prevented from carrying out their functions. The PPP and WPA
 withdrew their polling agents in protest of alleged fraudulent
 practices before the polls closed. In response to such
 criticism, the GBC carried an official commentary in which the
 Government admitted to imperfections in the election process
 which it said even caused some of its own supporters to be
 denied the opportunity to vote. The commentary claimed that
 these imperfections did not constitute fraud and suggested
 that if opposition parties were serious about their
 allegations they could refer them to the courts.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has regarded outside criticism of its human
 rights practices as interference in its internal affairs. In
 1985, the government media paid more attention to human rights
 matters. Their reaction to the "1984 Country Report on Human
 Rights Practices" was moderate. The Government has responded
 to past criticisms and has moved to correct some human rights
 abuses such as police killings, instances of police brutality
 bordering on torture and complaints about the deteriorating
 social infrastructure of the country such as water,
 electricity and sewerage.
 In February 1985, the Government refused visas to a "Joint
 Mission" from the British Parliament Human Rights.Group
 (PHRG), Americas Watch (AW) and the International Commission
 of Jurists (ICJ), which was proposing to visit Guyana "to
 inquire into and to make recommendations concerning the
 legislation and procedures governing national elections in
 Guyana." The Government said the Mission constituted
 interference in Guyana's internal affairs and warned that the
 groups would not be allowed entry into Guyana under any
 circumstances. Despite the Government's public rejection of
 
 
 567
 GUYA
 the "Joint Mission," Americas Watch and the PHRG went ahead
 with the proposal. The ICJ dropped out. The Joint Mission
 conducted its "investigation" from Port of Spain, Trinidad,
 and met with representatives of many of the opposition
 groups. Lord Chitnis, a member of PHRG, headed the panel.
 The "Interim Report of the joint mission to Investigate
 Political Freedom in Guyana" concluded that although "to some
 extent freedoms still exist in Guyana and some of the worst
 human rights abuses taking place in other countries of the
 region are not found here, there are serious grounds for
 concern, especially about the guarantees necessary for free
 and fair elections and the functioning of authentic
 democracy." The report of the "Joint Mission" was widely
 publicized in the opposition press in Guyana.
 The Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA) is a
 nongovernmental organization formed in late 1979 with support
 from trade unions, professional organizations, and churches.
 It issues periodic press releases and an annual report on
 human rights observance in Guyana.
 The association has attempted to draw international and
 regional attention to the human rights situation in Guyana but
 has been hampered in its campaign by insufficient
 documentation of the alleged human rights abuses. The GHRA
 claims that, to preserve its objectivity, political activists
 are discouraged from holding executive positions. Yet its
 executive committee is dominated by leading critics, if not
 opponents, of the Government. Government media have denounced
 the GHRA as an opposition entity, and the Government is
 clearly irritated by the GHRA's reporting, which it labels
 "antinational and unpatriotic." Nevertheless, there has been
 no physical violence against human rights activists in Guyana.
 Guyana generally has not been active in international human
 rights forums, but the Government has taken a leadership role
 in criticizing human rights violations in South Africa,
 Namibia, and "Palestine," openly conceding in these cases that
 human rights transcend international frontiers and that
 concern for human rights does not constitute interference in
 internal affairs.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Guyana has a population of about 800,000, which is estimated
 to be growing at the rate of 0.4 percent per year. Many
 Government opponents question these population figures,
 however, arguing that Guyana's population has actually
 declined to about 650,000 as a result of emigration. Guyana's
 "official" economy is comprised of public, private, and
 co-operative sectors, with the public sector dominating.
 Agriculture and mining are the most productive activities with
 sugar, bauxite, and rice accounting for approximately 80
 percent of export earnings. There is also a large and vibrant
 black market economy which is fueled by the illegal exports of
 gold, diamonds, shrimp, rice, and practically any other
 locally-produced commodity which can be sold abroad. Although
 opinions differ and statistics are impossible to obtain, some
 observers believe that this black market accounts for nearly
 50 percent of the economic and commercial activities in the
 country. In 1984, the Guyanese economy underwent a mild
 recovery, growing approximately 2 percent over a disastrous
 1983. There was some recovery of production in the sugar and
 bauxite industries. However, the medium-term economic outlook
 
 
 568
 GUYANA
 for Guyana is bleak. World market prices for sugar and
 bauxite are extremely low. Declining production, obsolete
 plants and equipment, emigration of skilled personnel, and the
 absence of incentives for private investors (both foreign and
 domestic) have all contributed to the current economic crisis,
 as have high prices for imported goods, adverse weather
 conditions affecting rice and sugar production, and
 inefficient management. Unemployment is estimated at about 35
 percent; however, statistics in these areas are hard to obtain
 and their accuracy is open to question.
 The Government has taken various measures to cope with the
 economic crisis. In 1985 it announced new price incentives
 for the rice, beef, dairy, and peanut industries.
 Negotiations to reach an agreement with the International
 Monetary Fund (IMF) on a standby facility continue, but in May
 1985 the IMF declared Guyana ineligible to make further
 drawdowns from the fund's resources, and the Government
 publicly stated that it was not prepared to accept the IMF's
 "harsh and unsuitable terms of conditionality."
 In 1985, the Government began efforts to reverse the
 deterioration of essential services such as water,
 electricity, sanitation, and health care, utilizing local
 funds and financial assistance from the Netherlands, the
 Inter-American Development Bank, and the.European Economic
 Community.
 Guyanese have a life expectancy at birth of 70 years; the
 infant mortality rate is 33.6 percent per 1,000 live births.
 Many school buildings are in poor condition, text and exercise
 books are in short supply, and the number of teachers has
 declined. According to World Bank figures, in 1980, the
 adjusted primary school enrollment rate was 103 percent for
 males and 105.8 percent for females. In 1970, Guyana has an
 estimated adult literacy rate of 91.6 percent. Since 1975,
 the Government has had a formal policy of providing free
 education from nursery school to university; however, it has
 proven costly to maintain. Opponents accuse the Government of
 politicizing education and allege that this is the principal
 cause of declining educational standards.
 In Guyana, children under age 14 may not be employed in
 factories or related enterprises, or on ships, but may be
 employed by their parents as long as their employment does not
 interfere with school attendance. Women and children under
 fourteen may not work at night except in special
 circumstances. The Government is empowered by law to
 prescribe minimum wages, and, in November 1985, a joint
 Government-TUC agreement was announced stating the 1986
 minimum wage in the public sector would be raised from $15.10
 per day to $16.80 per day. The TUC had called for a minimum
 wage of $25 per day which, it claimed, was the minimum
 necessary to sustain an urban family of six. Wages in the
 private sector which are governed by collective bargaining
 agreements tend to be higher than public sector wages. In
 1984 the Ministry of Manpower instituted 17 prosecutions for
 failure to pay prescribed wages, allow holidays, pay overtime
 rates, or produce required wage registers. Substantial fringe
 benefits for both private and public sector workers, such as
 vacation, transportation, housing allowances, annual automatic
 step increases, etc. make it difficult to generalize about
 real income.
 
 
 569
 GUYANA
 The Government may, by law, prescribe the daily or weekly
 working hours, but hours are generally negotiated between
 organized labor and employers. In November 1985, a joint
 Government-TUC committee was established to implement a
 reduction of the public sector work week from 44 to 40 hours.
 Laws regulate the health, welfare, and safety of workers,
 setting minimum standards of cleanliness and general
 maintenance. In 1984, the Ministry of Labor made 565
 inspections of work places, investigated 600 complaints, and
 instituted eight prosecutions. The Government runs
 occupational safety and health campaigns regularly, urging
 workers to consider such things as fire safety.
 The Guyanese population is divided into 51 percent East
 Indian, 43 percent African and mixed Africans, 4 percent
 Amerindian, and less than 2 percent European and Chinese.
 Many Indo-Guyanese allege that the Government discriminates
 against non-PNC members in the allocation and distribution of
 social services and employment in the public sector.
 However, historical, cultural, religious, and demographic
 factors, rather than any overt discrimination, seem to be
 largely responsible for the existing racial patterns. Most
 Indo-Guyanese parents prefer their children to be businessmen,
 independent farmers, or professionals rather than civil
 servants, policemen, firemen, or soldiers.
 The Government has emphasized the role of women in development
 and acted to promote and to protect women's rights. There is
 still discriminatory legislation against women in Guyana's
 statutes, but the 1980 Constitution clearly makes
 discrimination against women illegal and therefore
 unconstitutional. While most Guyanese women continue to
 occupy their traditional roles as homemakers, a number have
 moved into important positions in government, business, and
 the professions and serve as role models for other women.
 Mrs. Viola Burnham, the wife of the late President, was
 appointed Vice President for Education and Social
 Development. Afro-Guyanese women are among the principal
 supporters of the ruling People's National Congress.
