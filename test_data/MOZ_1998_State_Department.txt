 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambique has a constitutional government headed by President Joaquim
 Chissano, who was elected in the country's first multiparty elections in October
 1994. President Chissano and the leadership of his party, the Front for the Libera-
 tion of Mozambique (FRELIMO), which has ruled the country since independence
 in 1975, dominate policymaking and implementation. The Assembly of the Republic
 is a multiparty parliament that provides useful debate on national policy issues and
 generates a large number of independent proposals. During legislative sessions, the
 Assembly's FRELIMO majority increasingly influenced the executive branch on
 some policy issues, and opposition parties in the Assembly, working with FRELIMO,
 were able to develop and enact legislation successfully. The Constitution provides
 for an independent judiciary; however the executive branch dominates the judiciary,
 which is largely ineffectual and lacks resources.
 The lack of resources and an overall planning strategy continued to hamper the
 development of a nonpartisan professional army. Many former military personnel of
 all ranks work in the government security forces. There are several forces respon-
 sible for internal security under the Minister of the Interior-the Criminal Inves-
 tigation Police (PIC), the Mozambican National Police (PRM), and the Rapid Reac-
 tion Police (PIR). The State Information and Security Service (SISE) reports directly
 to the President. Members of the Security forces committed numerous serious
 human rights abuses.
 Mozambique is a very poor country. Approximately 75 percent of the population
 is employed in agriculture, mostly on a subsistence level. More than 70 percent of
 the population lives below the poverty line. Major exports are shrimp, sugar, cotton,
 and cashew nuts. The continued transition to a market economy showed positive re-
 sults. Privatized state-owned enterprises number 900. The Gross Domestic Product
 grew 12.5 percent in 1997 and an estimated 8 to 10 percent during the year. Infla-
 tion was below 6 percent in 1997 and was near or below zero percent during the
 year. The economy and the Government's budget remained heavily dependent on
 foreign aid. The economy had a $520 million (6 trillion meticias) trade deficit in
 1997, down from a $613 million (7 trillion meticias) deficit in 1995. The annual per
 capita income was approximately $145 (1,740,000 meticias) and high unemployment
 and underemployment in the formal wage sector continued. Corruption continued to
 be a problem in the public and private sectors.
 The Government's human rights record continued to suffer from numerous prob-
 lems. Numerous police abuses, including extrajudicial killings, excessive use of force,
 torture and other abuse, continued. Police beat and sometimes tortured detainees,
 and abused street children. Prison conditions remained harsh and life-threatening;
 many prisoners died due to harsh conditions and torture. Police continued to use
 arbitrary arrest and detention, and lengthy pretrial detentions remained a problem.
 Fair and expeditious trials were not possible due to an inefficient, understaffed, and
 underfunded judiciary, which is subject to executive influence. The Government con-
 tinued to restrict press freedom. Media outlets owned by the government and state
 enterprises largely reflected the views of factions within the ruling party, but many
 of them also carried significant criticism of the Government's handling of the local
 elections. The number of independent media increased, and their criticism of the
 Government, its leaders, and their families largely is tolerated. However, govern-
 ment officials still interfere with editorial policies, prevent reporters from getting
 certain information, and resort to threats or intimidation when unfavorable stories
 are published. The Government limited freedom of assembly, and the law imposes
 some limits on freedom of association. The Government at times infringed on free-
 dom of movement. The country's movement toward decentralization and expanding
 democracy faltered with unsuccessful local elections in June. Most political parties
 claimed that some election officials manipulated regulations and restricted the ac-
 cess of opposition candidates to a place on the ballots. However, independent groups
 were able to run candidates successfully in 13 cities and towns. Security forces did
 not restrict the right of assembly for purposes of political campaigning when the
 Government held the long delayed elections. However, there were a few allegations
 of vote tampering and one egregious case of fraud. The unanimous passage of elec-
 toral legislation at the end of the year pertaining to the 1999 elections removed the
 points of dispute between the parties that had marred the local elections. Non-
 governmental organizations are hindered by onerous registration requirements.
 Widespread discrimination against women in the areas of employment and prop-
 erty rights, as well as violence against women, remained problems. The abuse and
 criminal exploitation of street children increased in larger cities, and child prostitu-
 
 
 284
 tion was a problem. Discrimination against the disabled, child labor, and instances
 of forced child labor remained problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known cases of politi-
 cal killings, but there were reports of extrajudicial killings. The League of Human
 Rights (IHR) received 10 complaints of suspected police homicide. In all cases, the
 police officers responsible were charged and trials were scheduled or underway at
 year's end. In January police killed a striking worker (see Sections 2.b. and 6.a.).
 In the northern province of Nampula, the Nacala-Porto Paralegal Center inves-
 tigated the death in police custody of Intipa Faque. Relatives reported that the
 young man had been tortured and allowed to bleed to death by policemen who had
 invaded several homes searching for a video machine that Faque supposedly was
 hiding. The local police buried the victim. The nongovernmental organization (NGO)
 representing Faque's family wrote to members of the Government requesting expe-
 ditious investigation and handling of the case. The police had not responded by
 year's end.
 A journalist in Cabo Delgado province reported that in October an accused thief,
 Cabral Manica, died because of police torture. The Attorney General ordered an in-
 vestigation into Manica's death.
 Police shot and killed one demonstrator and wounded several others during a
 labor strike at a security services company (see Sections 5, 6.c., and 6.d.).
 Extremely harsh prison conditions and torture resulted in the deaths of many per-
 sons in custody (see Section 1.c.). In Nampula prison, 39 persons died during the
 year. In May human rights NGO workers in Nampula province asserted that detain-
 ees died in jails at Mozambique island and Nampula city (see Section 1.c.). The pro-
 vincial police commander denied the charges and accused the NGO's of sowing ter-
 ror.
 In September four police officers were sentenced to 7 years in prison for torturing
 to death Frenque Tchembene in 1996. A Maputo court ordered each officer to pay
 approximately $3,300 (39 million meticais) to the victim's family in this widely pub-
 licized case. An NGO spokesman stated that all four officers had been removed from
 the force. However, the LHR asserts that Tchembene's family has yet to receive pay-
 ment from any of the officers. One of the officers was released from custody, pro-
 moted, and transferred to another police station. The other officers remained in pris-
 on. Under the Constitution, the State is responsible for damage resulting from ille-
 gal acts committed by its agents.
 At the end of 1997, a RENAMO party official in Gaza province reported that PIR
 police officers in the village of hissano fatally shot a young miner, Eduardo
 Machava, allegedly for refusing a shakedown attempt. Police in the province re-
 sponded that Machava had been stopped for an alleged curfew violation and had at-
 tacked a police officer. The victim's family sued for compensation, but there was no
 resolution of the case by year's end.
 The LHR attributed the 1997 shooting death of Abel Zefanias dos Anjos to rogue
 police officers. They allegedly detained and tortured the 21-year-old victim, extorted
 money from his girlfriend for his release, and ultimately freed him. However, the
 police reportedly hunted him down and shot him, and then allegedly carried his
 body from the outskirts of Maputo to the city morgue as an unidentified casualty.
 Several months earlier, in October 1997, the LHR reported that the older brother
 of dos Anjos, Crescensio Sergio Muchange, had been accused of car theft, beaten,
 tortured, and killed while in police custody at Matola. The victims' family allowed
 the LHR to photograph Muchange's battered corpse at the central hospital morgue,
 where police failed to appear even after the LHR requested their presence. Police
 deny wrongdoing and have not yet referred either brother's case to the criminal in-
 vestigation branch.
 Occasional mob and vigilante killings continued in both urban and rural areas.
 In August a mob in central Maputo attacked and beat to death a carjacker as he
 tried to pull a motorist from his vehicle. There were also other violent, but non-le-
 thal mob attacks (see Section 1.c.).
 Some of the 1 million land mines still in the ground after decades of civil war
 caused 34 deaths during the year.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The fate of thousands of citizens who disappeared during the civil war still re-
 mains unresolved.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly prohibits torture and cruel or inhuman treatment, but
 
 
 285
 
 police continued to commit serious abuses. There were credible reports of police tor-
 ture, mistreatment, beating, illegal detention, and threats at gunpoint. For example,
 in March, seven PIR agents took former RENAMO fighter Pesado Rasquiva to their
 headquarters in Inhaminga, beat him on the head with a club, pierced his -hand
 with a knife, cut off his ear, and tied him naked to a tree all night because he was
 unable to show an identity card. A journalist in Cabo Delgado province reported
 that in October an accused thief, Cabral Manica, died because of police torture (see
 Section L.a.). In Caia police waited outside a Catholic Church and ambushed and
 took money from persons leaving a service. Maputo police patrolman Fabilo Alvaro
 Namuine was severely beaten and thrown into jail for 5 days in May without charge
 by police unaware of his identity. Namuine attracted his colleagues' attention when
 he quarreled with a bus conductor. With assistance from a human rights NGO, he
 was reinstated in his job. No action was taken against the police officers responsible
 in these cases. Police torture also has resulted in deaths (see Section l.a.).
 Corruption in the police forces extends throughout the ranks, and the PRM used
 violence and detention to intimidate persons from reporting abuses. There were con-
 tinued reports of police collusion with carjackers.
 Newspapers continued to report that police extort money from street vendors,
 many of whom are widowed or divorced women, sometimes beating them and often
 confiscating their merchandise. There were reports of police abuse of street children
 (see Section 5). Police also beat striking workers (see Sections 2.b. and 6.a.) and ex-
 torted money from travelers (see Section 2.d.).
 The police have not yet responded substantively to inquiries from the LHR about
 most cases the League investigated, some several years old. Longstanding police
 problems of inadequate training, low pay (about $45 (540,000 meticais) per month
 for ordinary PRM officers), and low force levels continued. Fewer than 19,000 of the
 target level of 50,000 ordinary police are in service, about half with 6 years or less
 of formal schooling. In response to these problems, international agencies and donor
 countries financed training programs that included human rights education, and
 have graduated 600 PRM officers to date in the ongoing curriculum. Alhough SISE
 personnel have a reputation for better discipline than the police do, reports per-
 sisted of some human rights violations on their part.
 In his state of the nation address in April, President Chissano acknowledged that
 police reform was far from complete, and that public confidence had to be restored.
 In a speech marking law day and the 23rd anniversary of the police in November,
 Chissano said that respect or human rights was closely linked with police work.
 A spokesman for the National Police Command said that investigations of extortion,
 bribe taking, and brutality by police personnel continued through the year, with
 punishments ranging from suspension to demotion and expulsion. During the year
 the police expelled a total of 322 members for incorrect behavior. The Minister of
 the Interior also criticized the police for misconduct.
 Mob violence and vigilante justice remained a problem. In March villagers near
 Boane in Maputo province publicly flogged three men accused of sorcery and can-
 nibalism. Also in March, vigilantes beat women accused of witchcraft in Matatuine.
 Such violence also resulted in the death of some victims (see Section l.a.).
 Prison conditions in most of the country are extremely harsh and life-threatening,
 but showed slight improvement according to NGO monitors. Prison life continued
 to pose a severe threat to inmates' lives and health. Sanitary conditions remain
 below minimum international standards. Health workers dispense almost no medi-
 cal care inside prison walls. Latrine facilities are, in most cases, primitive; in some
 prisons, inmates must keep human waste in their cells until they persuade or bribe
 attendants to remove it. Food is insufficient and some prisoners eat only once a day.
 Throughout the year there were documented reports of many inmate deaths in
 Nampula from torture, and other reports of prison deaths from cholera, tuberculosis,
 and AIDS-relatd illness, as well as reports of extortion, and physical and sexual
 abuse by guards. In the latter half of the year, the League of Human Rights branch
 in Nampula reported receiving a letter from inmates in the Nampula jail, describing
 torture, death threats and unexplained disappearances of some prisoners. The in-
 mates also claimed they were deprived of medical care  a s and  lisitand inves-
 tigators from the Attorney General's office, the Provincial Justice and the Peace
 Commission, and Amnesty International, had difficulty gaining access to the prison
 cells. The provincial police commander accused the LHR of inciting fear in local pop-
 ulations, and stated that recruiting police personnel without adequate background
 investigations may explain some inadvertent human rights violations. In November
 one newspaper reported the discovery of a clandestine prison in Buzi District, Sofala
 Province, where police allegedly detained prisoners in underground cisterns. Local
 authorities denied the existence of this ismegal prison, which is being investigated
 by the Attorney General's office.
 
 
 Two National Directorates of Prisons (DNP's), one under the Ministry of Justice
 (MOJ) and the other under the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), operate prisons in
 all the provincial capitals. According to NGO sources, MOI inmates are generally
 detainees who may have been tried by a judge but not sentenced, and some are in-
 terned for years (see Section 1.d.). MOJ inmates generally have been tried and sen-
 tenced in a normal process. The DNP's also hold prisoners at an agricultural peni-
 tentiary in Mabalane and industrial penitentiaries in Nampula and Maputo. In
 most of the prisons, inmates under MOJ jurisdiction are held alongside those under
 MOI jurisdiction. In a few cases, such as in Machava maximum-security prison,
 MOI inmates are held separately.
 Detention facilities remained severely overcrowded, generally holding four to six
 times the number of prisoners they were built to accommodate. At the end of the
 June, Quelimane held 586 prisoners in a prison built to hold 90; Manica held 708
 in a prison built to hold 300; and Beira held 882 in a prison built to hold 200. Tete
 provincial prison held 411 in a prison built to hold 90; Machava maximum-security
 prison near Maputo held about 2,100 prisoners in a facility built for 500. Maputo
 City Jail, built in 1955 for 250 persons, actually held 685 prisoners. Maputo Central
 Prison, built to hold 800 held 2,300 person, of whom 1,570 were awaiting trial. How-
 ever, the Operational Brigade (B.O.) maximum-security section of the prison, with
 a capacity of 600, held only 297 inmates. Military and civilian prisoners are held
 in the same prisons.
 There are many prisoners under the age of 16. Pretrial detainees who are minors
 are incarcerated with adult inmates. The League of Human Rights stated that 14-
 and 15-year-olds were imprisoned without charge in the Machava maximum-secu-
 rity prison. A special rapporteur from the African Human Rights Commission noted
 that the country's prisons have an unusually high population of young inmates. A
 Beira newspaper reported that the citys centralj  from   e to time houses chil-
 dren as young as age 3, brought there by mothers sentenced for long periods.
 Early in the year, Minister of Justice Jose Abudo acknowledged that irregularities
 and abuses continued to take place in prisons throughout the country. He mentioned
 a high profile incident in the Tete provincial prison, where a  ard was bribed to
 allow three men convited of killing a British couple to flee.~ Inanother instance,
 the secretary of Machava central prison was the target of media criticism for driving
 a Mercedes allegedly purchased by an inmate. In May the head of Chokwe prison
 was arrested and charged with accepting a bribe after releasing four alleged arms
 dealers.
 During the year 230 new guards were trained by the Ministry of Justice and re-
 ceived, along with veteran guards in refresher courses, a 6-month program of
 human rights instruction.
 The LHR prison monitoring and reform office reported that inmate treatment and
 facilities in the Maputo jails improved slightly during the year. In the Maputo Cen-
 tral Prison, reportedly the country's largest, running water finally was made avail-
 able 24 hours a day, substantially improving sanitation. To improve prison condi-
 tions, the Ministry of Justice continued to expand the prison food garden program
 started in 1996. In addition, the Ministry of Justice allocated considerable funds for
 rehabilitating facilities in 1997 and during the year; for example, a $5 million
 Mabalane penitentiary project was begun to relieve overcrowding at Machava cen-
 tral prison. The new women's prison at Ndlavela designed for 200 inmates largely
 was completed but remained unoccupied, due to the lack of a security complement
 and some unspecified equipment. Independent newspapers criticized the National
 Directorate of Prisons under the Ministry of Justice for allowing the facility to be-
 come a grazing ground for cattle and a de facto brothel.
 International as well as national human rights groups may have access to pris-
 oners at the discretion of MOJ and MOI authorities, but officials sometimes cite un-
 sanitary conditions or security risks as reasons to delay or cancel visits. A
 rapporteur from the African Human Rights Commission toured the country's prisons
 for 10 days (see Section 4).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that the dura-
 tion of preventive imprisonment be set by law; however, the police continue to arbi-
 trarily arrest and detain citizens. Under Law 2/93, the maximum preventive impris-
 onment is 48 hours. Within that time period, a detainee has the right to have his
 case reviewed by judicial authorities, arwhch he can be detained up to another
 60 days while   e case is investigated by the PIC. In cases where a person is ac-
 cused of a very serious crime requiring a sentence of more than 8 years, he or she
 may be detained up to 84 days without being charged formally. If a court approves,
 such detainees may be held for two more periods of 84 days each while the police
 complete the investigation process. In practice, however, the police continue to ar-
 rest and detain citizens arbitrarily. In many cases the authorities are either un-
 
 
 aware of these regulations or ignore them, often also ignoring a detainee's constitu-
 tional right to counsel and to contact relatives or friends. In December the state-
 owned Noticias Newspaper reported that a journalist, Fernando Quinova, was de-
 tained without charge for 23 days after he reported on Radio Mozambique that a
 prisoner died while in the custody of the police.
 In his speech marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights in November, President Chissano acknowledged that illegal deten-
 tion and other human rights violations continue in the country's prisons. In mid-
 November the assistant Attorney General, a group of judges, and police investiga-
 tors worked directly with prisoners in Maputo Civil Jail, to determine how many
 inmates were being held illegally, and to raise the awareness of public officials as
 to the urgent need to improve the situation. The visitors found one man who had
 awaited trial for 6 years and several others who had waited longer than 2 years.
 Most citizens are unaware of their rights, particularly those granted under the
 1990 Constitution, Law 2/93, and the Penal Process Code (under revision by the
 Ministry of Justice with assistance from civil society groups). As a result, detainees
 can spend many weeks, months, and even years, in pretrial status. The law provides
 that if the prescribed period for investigation has been completed and no charges
 have been brought, the detainee must be released; in practice, however, this provi-
 sion often is ignored, either because of the shortage of administrative personnel,
 trained judges, and lawyers to monitor the judicial system, or because of intentional
 neglect.
 Drug cases are subject to a special regime. A 1996 law specifies that the legal pe-
 riod of preventive detention in drug trafficking cases is 10 days. The same law au-
 thorizes a long period of investigation-up to 9 months--in cases involving drug
 smuggling, drug production and transfer, and criminal association.
 The bail system remains poorly defined, and prisoners, their families, and NGO's
 continued to complain that police and prison officials take bribes to release those
 who can afford to pay. A large number of prisoners awaiting trial are incarcerated
 with convicts in detention facilities. For example, of 411 inmates held in Tete pro-
 vincial prison, 199 were pre-trial detainees, and in Maputo central jail there were
 1,015 pretrial detainees among the 1,998 inmates. According to the Mozambican
 League of Human Rights, the Beira central jail held 882 inmates, of whom 438 were
 pretrial detainees. At prisons in Niassa province the figures were 105 pre-trial de-
 tainees out of 200 inmates, and in Cabo Delgado province 268 pretrial detainees out
 of 370 inmates.
 The 1990 Constitution expressly prohibits exile, and the Government does not use
 exile as a form of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary and specifically states that the decisions of the courts take precedence over
 all other authorities and individuals and must be obeyed; however, the executive,
 and by extension the FRELIMO party, continued to dominate the judiciary, which
 is understaffed and manned by inadequately trained appointees. Judges largely
 owed their positions to the ruling FRELIMO party.
 The President appoints the President and Vice President of the most important
 tribunal, the Supreme Court. Supreme Court selections then are sent to the Assem-
 bly of the Republic for approval. For lower court appointments, the Supreme Higher
 Magistrate's Council (CSMJ)--the body responsible for overseeing professional be-
 havior among magistrates-assembles a list of qualified persons; however, the presi-
 dent selects the justices from this list. No Assembly approval is needed for these
 choices. In the ongoing national discussions over constitutional revision, the goal of
 strengthening the independence of the judiciary emerged as a crucial concern.
 There are two complementary formal justice systems: the civil/criminal system,
 which includes the customary courts, and the military system. Civilians are not
 under the jurisdiction of, or tried in, military courts. A 1991 law empowered the Su-
 preme Court to administer the civil/criminal system; it also hears appeals, including
 military cases, although the Ministry of Defense administers the military courts.
 Below the Supreme Court there are provincial and district courts. There are also
 courts that exercise limited, specialized jurisdiction such as administrative courts,
 customs courts, fiscal courts, maritime courts, and labor courts. Minors 16 years old
 and younger fall under the jurisdiction of a court system for minors. Through this
 legal channel the Government can send minors to correctional, educational, or other
 institutions. The Penal Code contains legal guidelines for the judicial treatment of
 minors and forbids the imprisonment of minors below the age of 20. However, there
 are many reports that minors are incarcerated in prisons throughout the country
 without having been tried (see Section 1.c.). As with the provincial and district
 courts, the specialized and minor court systems are ineffective due to a lack of quali-
 fied professionals. Outside of the formal court system a number of local customary
 
 
 courts handle matters such as estate and divorce cases. These courts are staffed by
 respected local arbiters who have no formal training but who exercise a substantial
 judicial and executive role.
 Persons accused of crimes against the State are tried in regular civilian courts
 under standard criminal judicial procedures. The law provides definitions of crimes
 against the State, such as treason, terrorism, and sabotage, but the Government re-
 tains the discretion to determine what crimes constitute security offenses. The Su-
 preme Court has original jurisdiction over Members of Parliament and anyone else
 who is immune from trial in the lower courts. The Constitution calls for the creation
 of a constitutional council, but the Government has not yet passed implementing
 legislation for this council. In the absence of this body, the Supreme Court is tasked
 with ruling on issues of constitutionality (which it did in assessing the results of
 the local elections).
 A judge may order a trial closed because of national security interests or to pro-
 tect the privacy of the plaintiff in cases of rape.
 In regular courts, all accused persons are in theory presumed innocent and have
 the right to legal counsel and the right of a ppeal, but the authorities do not always
 respect these rights. The great majority of the population is either unaware of these
 rights or does not possess the means to obtain any form of legal counsel. Although
 the law specifically provides for public defenders, such assistance is not available
 in practice. Instead, citizens can receive legal help from the Government's National
 Institute for Legal Assistance and Representation (IPAJ), which has legal assistants
 working in over half of the administrative districts of the country.
 There continued to be a'shortage of qualified judicial personnel. There are appeals
 courts in all provinces, but fewer than half of these courts are staffed by formally
 trained judges. According to the Minister of Justice, not a single presiding judge in
 the provinces of Tete, Sofala, and Niassa, holds a law degree, even though the Judi-
 cial Magistrates Statute requiressuch training. In August the Minister estimated
 that the country needs about 100 judges with advanced degrees, but has barely 40.
 Some districts have no formal courts or judges at all. Several donor initiatives to
 remedy these shortages continued, including Danish and World Bank-financed
 training of district court judges and public prosecutors. The Attorney General's of-
 fice completed a yearlong training course for 30 persons to become district attorneys.
 A new Center for Judicial and Juridical Studies moved toward completion as the
 country's first facility for continuing legal education.
 Speaking at the opening of the Supreme Court session in March, Chief Justice
 Mario Mangaze complained that a number of judges and others responsible to the
 courts are guilty of unacceptable practices including corruption, chronic absence, un-
 equal treatment, and deliberate delays and omissions in handling cases. Justice
 Mangaze also presides over the CSMJ, the body responsible for overseeing profes-
 sional behavior among magistrates. The CSMJ reported that 23 of a total of 134
 judges were expelled for corruption between 1994 and 1998, with more cases under
 consideration. Four judges were expelled during the year, and fifth judge received
 a 90-day suspension. The chief judge of the Manica provincial court, accused of mur-
 dering his domestic servant, still presides.
 A lack of licensed attorneys exacerbates the judicial s stem's weakness. There are
 fewer than 150 licensed attorneys in the country; most ived in Maputo. In an effort
 to replace the defunct public organization previously responsible for providing coun-
 sel for indigent defendants, some NGO's such as the LHR and the Mozambican As-
 sociation of Women in Judicial Careers offered limited legal counsel at little or no
 cost. By September the number of LHR paralegals countrywide rose to 18, and had
 handled 463 cases by year's end. The IP    and the LHR offer legal counsel to pris-
 oners.
 Efforts to reintegrate RENAMO-controlled zones into central administrative struc-
 tures were virtually completed.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right of privacy and expressly forbids the use of sur-
 veillance techniques. By law police need a warrant to enter homes and businesses.
 There were no documented reports of such search activity, but some political groups
 suspected that their telephones were tapped by government intelligence agencies,
 and claimed that security forces kept watch on their activities.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution, the 1991 Press Law, and the
 1992 Rome Peace Accords provided for freedom of expression and of the press, with
 restrictions only in cases involving national defense considerations; the Government
 generally respected these provisions. While criticism of the President is not prohib-
 
 
 289
 ited legally, the 1991 Press Law holds that in cases of defamation against the Presi-
 dent, truth is not a sufficient defense against libel. Although the law has not been
 tested in court, it has resulted in considerable self-censorship in past years. Various
 critiques of the President's family were published during the year, but did not pro-
 voke a court test of the 1991 Press Law. In December the state-owned Noticias
 Newspaper reported that a journalist, Fernando Quinova, was detained without
 charge for 23 days after he reported on Radio Mozambique that a prisoner died
 while in the custody of the police.
 Government and state-owned media largely reflected the views of the ruling
 party, but many such media sources also carried significant criticism of the Govern-
 ment's handling of the local election administration. The Government and state en-
 terprises own the greater part of the country's media, including the country's only
 daily newspapers, the only Sunday newspaper, and the only weekly newsmagazine.
 However, the weekly independent newspaper Savana sold more newspapers than
 the largest state-owned daily newspaper, Noticias. Most radio and television sta-
 tions are owned by the Government, but there are local and independent broadcasts
 in almost all urban areas. The Government's wire service, the Mozambican News
 Agency, includes reports from all independent media in its daily English and Por-
 tuguese transmittals. Radio Mozambique, the public's most important source of in-
 formation, is government owned, but its news coverage is considered unbiased and
 fair. It receives the largest single subsidy from the state budget of any public com-
 pany. Government media are showing greater transparency in reporting and some
 independence of editorial content. State-funded Radio Mozambique (RM) is the na-
 tion's most important source of information. It broadcasts in Portuguese and a num-
 ber of indigenous languages; its external service broadcasts in English as well as
 in Portuguese for the Mozambican community in neighboring South Africa. RM reg-
 ularly broadcasts public debates that include a variety of participants with differing
 opimons.
 A large number of periodicals and broadcasting entities have been licensed since
 1992, but only a minority actually function due to financial constraints. Independent
 media criticisms of government leaders and their families largely is tolerated. There
 were 21 printed periodicals and additional 7 periodicals that transmitted daffy edi-
 tions electronically. The influential faxed dailies do not need government licenses
 since media with print runs of under 500 copies are unregulated. Independent print
 media based in Maputo continue to expand in number and variety, with more exten-
 sive national distribution and ability to influence government policy. Nascent com-
 munity newspapers and faxed sheets are struggling for survival in eight provincial
 capitals. Only a small minority of the population receives news directly through ei-
 ther television or the print media. National newspaper sales average 95,000 per day
 in a nation of 16 million persons, but newspapers usually are shared among mul-
 tiple readers. Seven weekly newspapers (two state-owned and five independent)
 have a combined circulation of 76,500. The circulation of independent newspapers
 more than doubled since December 1997, accounting for 51,500 sales. Six daily or
 weekly fax sheets have about 1,500 subscribers.
 Independent (primarily church-supported) and state-controlled radio stations,
 most using local languages in addition to Portuguese, have spread to over a dozen
 cities with more approved during the year. One such station, Radio Terra Verde,
 is linked directly to the principal opposition party. Foreign radio programs (British
 Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Radio France International (RFI), Radio Diffusao
 Portugal (RDP)-Africa and Voice Of America (VOA)) reach all major population cen-
 ters and report local news via Mozambican-based stringers; the BBC and the RFI
 carry news in Portuguese but broadcast most of the day in English and French, re-
 spectively. Portuguese Television for Africa (RDP-Africa) offers a second source of
 televised news to Maputo and Beira. Privately-owned television transmission contin-
 ues in Maputo and has been approved for Quelimane. Direct satellite reception of
 international television stations is widespread in wealthy enclaves; less expensive
 cable television, due to start in Maputo in the latter half of the year, had not begun
 by year's end. TV Mozambique moved into a new Portuguese-built studio and prom-
 ised nationwide network broadcasting for 1999.
 In June the country's first-ever local elections in 33 municipalities brought intense
 scrutiny of the state-controlled broadcast media, as well as scrutiny of the legal pro-
 visions for campaigners' access to the media, and of the National Electoral Commis-
 sion's responsiveness to journalists' inquiries. The independent media thoroughly re-
 ported several cases where state-owned Radio Mozambique journalists apparently
 were transferred to less prestigious provincial jobs after broadcasting interviews
 with opposition politicians or critics of the electoral process. Call-in programs on
 both Radio and Television Mozambique provided an innovation in media coverage
 of the campaign, but FRELIMO candidates failed to appear for televised debates
 
 
 with opposition candidates in Maputo and Beira. Maputo's state-controlled news-
 papers and television joined independent journalists in harsh criticism of the Elec-
 toral Commission for harassing journalists trying to report on the Commission's al-
 legedly inadequate compliance with various procedures stipulated by the electoral
 law. The state-controlled papers Noticias and Domingo continued this criticism long
 after the elections.
 The National Union of Journalists (SNJ) completed its transformation from a gov-
 ernment-controlled entity and opened its Maputo headquarters and regional offices
 during the year. In May the SNJ held meetings in Pemba and Tete, and at its
 Beira, Nampula, and Maputo facilities, to produce its first annual report on the
 "Principal Problems of Journalists." The SNJ document reported contractual dis-
 putes with the independent print media as well as staff complaints against the
 state-supported Mozambique News Agency (AIM), and newspapers and provincial
 radio stations belonging to the government-run Institute of Social Communication.
 The SNJ's report on the dismissal of a Radio Mozambique part-time correspondent
 following a controversial interview on upcoming elections with the Archbishop of
 Beira provided a defense of journalists' rights. By contrast, the government-ap-
 pointed Higher Council of Social Communication (CSCS)-a supposed watchdog for
 media fairness-never spoke out against efforts by the directors of Radio Mozam-
 bique to limit the broadcast of independent and opposition comments at the start
 of the local election campaign.
 The Prime Minister's weekly press conferences are increasingly important oppor-
 tunities for journalists to discuss politics and government policies. The Prime Min-
 ister's information office seeks to facilitate international press access to key govern-
 ment officials and to provide policy guidance on how new media should be regulated.
 The Prime Minister's information office continues to informally monitor press con-
 tent.
 There are no formal restrictions on academic freedom. Press reports on university
 forums routinely cite opinions from public as well as private university students and
 teachers. Private educational institutions, both church-related and secular, are well
 established and expanding in several cities. A new Islamic university in the north-
 ern region was announced during the year. Students from Beira's Catholic Univer-
 sity played a key role in monitoring local elections there and in nearby areas.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association; however, the Government limited this right in
 a few instances by intervening forcefully in labor demonstrations. The law regulates
 public demonstrations and establishes the judicial regime for the exercise of this
 right. The law does not cover private gatherings, held indoors and by individual in-
 vitation, nor does it cover religious gatherings or election campaigning.
 Although the law permits the exercise of the right to gather or demonstrate peace-
 fully, it specifies some time limitations. The law states that marches, parades, and
 processions cannot be held on Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, or between 5:00 p.m.
 and 12:30 a.m. on other days. The law provides for possible exceptions to this regu-
 lation, if justified, but such decisions are not made in an open and established man-
 ner. Further, the law states that any organizers of gatherings or demonstrations
 must submit a notice to civil and police authorities, with at least 10 signatures, for
 the holding of any such demonstration, along with a justification of the purpose of
 the gathering. The law stipulates that the Government must remit any objection to
 such proposals within 2 days of receiving the request, and that no response within
 this period shall be understood to mean governmental acceptance.
 In late January, the elite Rapid Intervention Police (PIR) was called to a strike
 demonstration by employees of a security services company. The company claimed
 that strike organizers had assaulted managers and taken them hostage before the
 police arrived and charged the crowd of 300 demonstrators with their batons. Police
 fired at the crowd killing one person and wounding four others. Some media and
 a veteran's association, AMODEG, accused the Government of trying to intimidate
 the workers. The Mozambique Worker's Organization (OTM), the country's largest
 labor union, complained to the Minister of the Interior about the use of the PIR.
 An early government inquiry indicated that the fatal round strayed from a volley
 fired over the demonstrators' heads by poorly trained regular police. However, many
 witnesses told the independent press that the victim was shot in the back while flee-
 ing, at some distance from the site of the demonstration. The promised disciplinary
 action against the police commander responsible had not been taken by year's end
 (see Sections l.a. and 6.a.).
 Also in January, police injured 20 workers at the Pescamar Fishing Company in
 Beira. According to the company, its employees began an illegal strike while wage
 and benefit negotiations were still in progress (see Section 6.a.).
 
 
 In the period prior to local elections on June 30, scores of public political meetings
 were organized and held throughout the country by candidates of the ruling party,
 as well as by independent and opposition candidates. Representatives of some oppo-
 sition parties also organized rallies in the provinces to urge citizens to refrain from
 voting. Newspapers and party representatives reported occasional incidents in
 which citizens were harassed or arrested by police for destroying voter identity
 cards in protest of alleged irregularities in registration. However, there were no re-
 ports of overt government or opposition attempts to abridge the right of assembly
 for political purposes.
 The law provides for freedom of association, with some limitations. Legislation
 promulgated in 1991 sets forth the process for the registration of political parties.
 There are over 20 registered, active political parties. Under 1992 legislation, a politi-
 cal party must demonstrate that it has no racial, ethnic, or religious exclusiveness
 and secure at least 2,000 signatures of citizens in order to be recognized legally.
 The Government requires nonpolitical groups, except religious organizations, to
 register. Although the registration process is not always transparent and can take
 many months, the authorities rarely reject applications from new associations.
 There were no reports of government attempts to impede the right of association
 for political or other purposes.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides that all citizens have the free-
 dom to practice or not to practice a religion and gives religious denominations the
 right to pursue their religious aims freely, and the Government respects these rights
 in practice. The Government does not require religious organizations or missionaries
 to register, and routinely grants visas and residence permits to foreign missionaries.
 The Constitution also gives religious groups the right to own and acquire assets,
 and these institutions are allowed by law to operate schools.
 There were periods of stress in relations between the Government and religious
 organizations as some Catholic leaders and clergy publicly criticized the conduct of
 local elections. A journalist who reported critical remarks by the Archbishop of Beira
 was effectively demoted. Nevertheless, a conference of bishops, including Catholic
 and Anglican members, meets regularly and consults with the President of the Re-
 public.
 The Catholic Church continued to press for the return of properties nationalized
 in 1975 after independence. While title to places of worship reverted to the church
 several years ago, the Catholic Church only this year successfully negotiated for the
 return of many educational, social and residential facilities that had remained in
 state hands. Muslim leaders also called for the return of properties that had be-
 longed to Islamic groups before independence.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right to live anywhere within national
 territory and to travel within the country and abroad; however, at times authorities
 infringed on these rights.
 Police traffic checkpoints occasionally affected freedom of movement. In an effort
 to reduce harassment and confiscation of travelers' possessions, especially on the
 main road to and from the South African border, traffic police commanders levied
 disciplinary fines against abusive police officers. In January the Interior Minister
 (who described the traffic police as "widely despised") ordered the suspension and
 training of all officers nationwide who were not licensed drivers. In large cities the
 police regularly stop foreign pedestrians and order them to present original pass-
 ports, sometimes refusing to accept notarized copies, and fining those who failed to
 show proper documents (most people do not like to carry the originals of documents
 due to the risk of theft). Police also routinely detain local citizens for failure to carry
 identity papers and try to extort money; the PRM public relations chief in Matola
 called such detention illegal.
 The law includes provisions for the granting of refugee and asylee status in ac-
 cordance with the provisions of the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of
 Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. Mozambique continued to offer shelter to approxi-
 mately 500 refugees from 11 African countries, Afghanistan, and Russia. In coopera-
 tion with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Gov-
 ernment operates two transit centers near Maputo. Niassa and Tete provinces have
 scattered groups of transients from Burundi, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of
 Congo, Somalia, and Liberia; local authorities claimed that some of these so-called
 refugees were smugglers or criminals. Refugee camp conditions continued to be poor,
 and some refugee claim to fear attack by fellow refugees on the basis of ethncity.
 The UNHCR makes alternative shelter available to those who feel threatened. Mo-
 zambique offers first asylum, although it was not granted to any asylum seekers
 during the year.
 
 
 There were nine cases of voluntary repatriation and no reports of the forced re-
 turn of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides that citizens have the right to elect their representa-
 tives by universal, direct, secret, and periodic elections. In October 1994, citizens
 freely exercised for the first time their right to vote in multiparty elections, which
 national and international observers declared to be free and fair. President Chissano
 was elected, with the ruling FRELIMO party winning 129 of the 250 assembly
 seats. The largest opposition party, RENAMO, made a strong showing in the elec-
 tions, winning 122 assembly seats and majorities in five of the country's most popu-
 lous provinces. However, FRELIMO's majority ensured that the National Assembly
 did not provide a significant check on the power of the executive branch. FRELIMO
 members hold all cabinet positions and provincial governorships, even in provinces
 where RENAMO had won overwhelming majorities in the 1994 elections. Thus the
 President and the FRELIMO leadership continued  to control policymaking and im-
 plementation.
 Voter disenchantment as well as political manipulation byaoth FRELIMO and
 RENAMO seriously disrupted the process of local elections in June. However, those
 elections were marked by the conditions necessary to effect a free change of govern-
 ment: the right to organize parties, to campaign, and to vote without widespread
 fraud or intimidation. There were tensions between the Government and the
 RENAMO-led opposition over the cd           e Election Commission (ONE) and
 Election Administration (STAE) in registering voters and political parties. Opposi-
 tion leaders blamed officials for alleged losses of voter registers from the 1994 elec-
 tion census, missing entries in voter records, and excessive delay in registering can-
 didates. Advisors and diplomats determined that many of the opposition's charges
 were credible, but also found that poor ,administrative performance, especially by
 the STAE, stemmed from the authorities' dependence on temporary personnel from
 government agencies, many ofh wm were partisan or unmotivated.
 RENAMO, the small parliamentary coalition Democratic Union (UD), and vir-
 tualiy all extra-parliamentary opposition parties, withdrew from the local elections
 process by June in protest of perceived electoral abuses by the Government. Several
 independent candidates continued to run in Maputo and a few provincial cities, but
 after a brief 2-week campaign, the June 30 elections attracted fewer than 15 percent
 of registered voters, and gave an inevitable overall victory to FRELIMO candidates
 that included a sweep of the 33 mayoral seats. However, independent candidates
 won a significant number of seats in the municipal councils of the two largest cities
 and a smaller number of seats in a handful of smaller towns.
 In some locations, delays and inefficiency marred the voting process, although
 there were virtually no incidents of violencea a  attempts to impede voters from
 participating. There were no reports of significant fraud; however, police fined and
 imprisoned one opposition candidate, Miguel Mabota, for destroying election mat-
 rials in Xai-Xai. The press detected one egregious case of ballot box stuffteg by
 FRELIMO in Dondo, Sofala province.       .
 In the absence of a constitutional court, which has not yet been created, the Su-
 preme Court took responsibility for validating the outcome of the June 30 elections.
 The electoral law provided no basis for invalidation due to low voter turnout, and
 the Court, despite the obvious fraud in Dondo and certain reporting and procedural
 irregularities, let stand FRELIMO victories in all 33 municipalities. However, two
 of the justices formally dissented; one found that low voter turnout compromised the
 legitimacy of the results, and the other found that several allegations of irregular-
 ities in the electoral process should have been scrutinized more closely.
 There were some indications of an increased pariamentary role in the legislative
 process. During the Assembly's second session, the ruling party accepted the opposi-
 tion's proposals for a new law on elections and the National Election Commission,
 allowing a unanimous vote on the law that would guide the country's 1999 general
 elections. The Assembly also debated a slate of proposed constitutional reforms de-
 veloped by a study commission, and sponsored debates on the proposals to name the
 Prime Minister as head of government, to make his selection more democratic, and
 to create an ombudsman to assist citizen dealings with the Government.
 There are no legal restrictions hindering women's involvement in government, but
 cultural factors inhibit their effectiveness in public life. There are 62 women in the
 250-seat National Assembly, or 24.8 percent. However, some of these women com-
 plained regularly in the press that they have no significant role in decision making
 within their parties, even though FRELIMO's policy mandates that at least 30 per-
 cent of the party's two governing bodies must be female. The Political Commission
 
 
 293
 met this mandate, while the Central Committee fell short by about 2 percent. In
 July President Chissano appointed Acucena Duarte as Minister for Social Action Co-
 ordination. She is the only woman in his Cabinet. There are three female vice min-
 isters.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no legal obstacles to the formation of local human rights groups, al-
 though registration procedures applying to NGO's are onerous and expensive (see
 Section 2.b.). During the year, two new human rights groups were established: the
 Children's League, some of whose members are receiving paralegal training from
 the LHR for children's advocacy activities; and the Counseling and Rehabilitation
 Center, a group working in the fields of juvenile delinquency and juvenile imprison-
 ment.
 An established human rights groups, the LHR reported that its legal offices had
 a caseload of 987 human rights violations in 1997, and that during the year there
 were over 1200 violations. Among the complaints that were not investigated or adju-
 dicated were police homicides, domestic violence, labor disputes, and land conflicts.
 The organization Democracy and Human Rights focuses on human rights education
 seminars and workshops for a wide range of audiences including -political parties,
 security agencies, businesses, and NGO's.
 The Government responded to human rights-related inquiries from Amnesty
 International, Transparency International, and other rights-oriented groups. A
 rapporteur from the African Human Rights Commission toured the country's prisons
 for 10 days early in the year (see Section 1.c.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution forbids discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or disability,
 but in practice the Government does not ensure that such discrimination does not
 occur.
 Women.-Although official statistics are not kept, according to health officials,
 women's groups, and other sources, domestic violence against women-particularly
 beating and rape-is widespread, especially in rural areas. Many women believe
 that their spouses have the right to beat them, and cultural pressures discourage
 women from taking legal action agalnst abusive spouses. There is no civil law that
 defines domestic violence as a crime. A group of women's NGO's, including Women
 in Law and Development, Mozambican Women in Education, Women in Judicial Ca-
 reers, and the FRELIMO-sponsored Mozambican Women's Organization, support
 the organization Everybody Against Violence, which serves as a monitoring and edu-
 cational group for issues of domestic violence and sexual abuse of women and chil-
 dren. The group registered 1,352 cases in 1996-97, and expanded its activities from
 Maputo to Sofala and Nampula provinces early in the year. The League of Human
 Rights reported approximately 100 complaints of domestic violence during the year,
 about the same as in 1997. All participating groups worked to involve police in the
 education and enforcement process, portraying domestic violence as a public order
 issue. The police do not normally intervene in domestic disputes. Cases that do
 reach the courts deal with specific charges such as rape, which can be prosecuted
 as a crime, and battery and assault. Hospitals do not usually register physical abuse
 cases as being caused by domestic violence. Sexual harassment in the workplace is
 widespread.
 Despite constitutional protections providing for the equality of men and women
 in all aspects of political, economic, social, and cultural life, the civil and commercial
 legal codes that predate independence contradict each other and the Constitution.
 The Law of the Family and Inheritance is being revised by the Ministry of Justice
 with participation from civil society. The Land Law adopted by the legislature in
 1997 has not yet come into force because the Government has not issued regula-
 tions; civil society groups currently are debating the draft regulations. The husband
 or father is thehead of the household, and both wives and daughters must obtain
 male approval of any and all legal undertakings. For example, a woman must have
 the written approval of her husband, father, or closest male relative in order to start
 a business. Without such approval, a woman cannot lease property, obtain a loan,
 or contract for goods and services. The legal domicile of a married woman is her
 husband's house, and she may work outside the home only with the express consent
 of her husband.
 Family law dictates further that a couple's possessions belong to the husband, and
 that he has full authority to decide on the disposition of these goods. When a hus-
 band dies, a widow is only fourth in line (after sons, fathers, and brothers) to inherit
 
 
 294
 the household goods. A contradictory provision of the law states that a widow is en-
 titled to half of the goods that were acquired during the marriage, but in practice
 women rarely know of or demand this right.
 Customary law varies in different parts of the country. In some situations it offers
 women less protection than family law. Unless a marriage is registered, a woman
 has no recourse to the judicial branch for enforcement of the few rights provided
 to women by the civil codes.
 A portion of the Land- Law relating to rural lands legislature in 1997 came into
 force in December after some delay in publishing the text and issuing implementing
 regulations. Sections of the Land Law on urban land were not expected to take ef-
 fect until early 1999. Women are the primary cultivators of family land in rural
 areas, where over 80 percent of the population live; however, under customary law
 they often have no rights to the disposition of the land. The revised Land Law spe-
 cifically permits women to exercise rights over community land held through cus-
 tomary rights. However, local NGO's such as the Rural Women's Development Asso-
 ciation and Rural Mutual Assistance Association caution that a considerable invest-
 ment of time and education are necessary before the new rights granted to women
 can supercede traditional practice.
 The Constitution discriminates against women because it grants citizenship to the
 foreign-born wife of a Mozambican man, but not to the foreign-born husband of a
 Mozambican woman.
 Women constitute 51.5 percent of the population and are responsible for 52.4 per-
 cent of active economic production. Of this 52.4 percent, according to the latest
 available data, 91.8 percent are in the agro-fisheries sector.
 Women continued to experience economic discrimination in practice. The Presi-
 dential Minister for Social and Economic Affairs reported that women in the work-
 p lace receive lower pay than men in the same positions. Women often are dismissed
 frst du.ing layoffs. Women in the workplace are subject to discrimination in hiring
 because of potential absences for maternity leave. Although the Labor Law entitles
 a woman to 60 days of maternity leave, employers often violate this right.
 In the health sector the Government targeted maternity and infant health and fo-
 cused on immunizations for women in childbearing years and for young children.
 The mortality rate for infants is 134 deaths per 1,000 infants, and for children
 under the age of 5 is 200 deaths per 1,000 children. A new NGO, the Association
 for Family Development, became active in the northern provinces, sponsoring con-
 tinuing education for women and girls on sexual and reproductive health at classes
 in Pemba. Numerous other health and community development NGO's also empha-
 size programs to improve women's health.
 In August the Ministry of Social Action Coordination focused new attention on the
 Governmenfs post-Beijing Plan of Action 1997-2000, based on the declaration of the
 U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women and on recommendations of the fourth
 subregional post-Beijing conference held in Gaborone. The plan's objectives, with
 particular reference to regional issues, are relief of poverty and inequality among
 women, relief of domestic violence and rape, and assistance to war victims. In the
 political arena, goals are for 50 percent representation of women in Parliament, 40
 percent in government bodies, and 80 percent in local governments. The Govern-
 ment confirmed its intent to ratify international conventions regarding women.
 Children.-The Government has not made children's rights and welfare a priority,
 but admits that some children are in trouble. The educational system is over-
 crowded and there is considerable evidence of corruption. Primary education is not
 compulsory. Newspapers frequently reported that the parents of school children had
 to bribe teachers, or that girls exchanged sex with teachers for passing grades. The
 National Institute of Educational Development estimates that some 62 percent of
 children between the ages of 6 and 10 are in primary school. Only a fraction of those
 children continue with secondary studies.
 Women continued to have less access than men do to schools above the primary
 level. Very few girls continue studies beyond the primary level. About the same
 number of male and female children enter primary school, but by secondary school
 only 36 percent of students are female, and at technical or higher levels, only 20
 percent are female. In some provinces the percentage of female students is even
 lower. Recent surveys show that about 67 percent of women over 15 years of age
 are illiterate. Outside the main cities, there are a few secondary schools. Students
 often travel great distances to attend these schools, and require boarding facilities.
 In a case that gained national attention in November, residents of Morrumbene dis-
 trict in Inhambane Province demanded the exclusion of girls from the dormitories
 at the Cambine secondary school. In the absence of separate boarding facilities, local
 residents blamed schoolgirls for immoral behavior in the community and pressured
 authorities to comply with the illegal demand, which effectively prevented many
 
 
 295
 girls from attending the school. The few out-of-town girls who remained to study
 were forced to live in unprotected shacks. The Government's 1998-2001 Education
 Sector Strategic Plan emphasizes increasing the number of girls in school, as well
 as the number of female teachers, which at present is very small.
 NGO's and the Government took some steps to protect and reintegrate street chil-
 dren all over the country into families or other supervised conditions. There are an
 estimated 4,000 street children, with 700 to 1,200 in Maputo alone. All monitoring
 groups acknowledge that the actual number of street children exceeds the estimates.'
 The Vice-Minister of Social Welfare Felipe Mandlate acknowledged in July that
 state institutions, including the police who often beat street children, and schools,
 are among the major violators of children's rights. Street children also are often vic-
 tims of sexual abuse. Some programs sponsored by government agencies and private
 organizations to help street children continued and included programs on education,
 information dissemination, health care and family reunification. The Maputo City
 Social Action Coordination Office continued its program of rescuing abandoned or-
 phans and assisting single mothers who head families of three or more persons, but
 could not fund a planned business activity to assure sustainability. The same group
 offered special classes to almost 5,000 children of broken homes in local schools.
 Other NGO groups sponsored food, shelter, and education programs in all major cit-
 ies. The Association for Mozambican Children in Beira, also provided counseling to
 parents who have expelled children from home, usually when a wife has children
 unacceptable to a new husband.
 In August the organization Restore Hope launched a campaign to reintegrate
 child soldiers into family settings and civil society with the support of the Govern-
 ment, political parties, and religious organizations. Restore Hope is lobbying par-
 liament to exclude former child soldiers from registration for compulsory military
 service and in October the organization obtained promises from the Defense Min-
 istry that former child soldiers would not be called or service.
 Authorities in several provinces took steps to combat child prostitution, usually
 defined as sexual abuse and exploitation of persons below age 15. In Sofala province,
 where child prostitution flourishes all along the Beira development corridor, the
 public social action coordinator, Antonia Charre and Judge Osvalda Joane estab-
 lished information centers. Workers at these centers give information to families
 and friends of children who are raped and exploited, counseling them on how to deal
 with the police, public prosecutors, and judges. In Manica Province, there are 300
 girls and boys living in prostitution and the local government's Social Action Coordi-
 nator created a committee to rehabilitate the children and return them to normal
 life.
 There were reports that children often were used as bargaining chips to settle fi-
 nancial and other disputes in rural areas. According to Domingos do Rosario, a soci-
 ologist with the Cultural Patrimony Department, children sometimes were used as
 labor to settle outstanding economic accounts in rural areas. There are numerous
 reports that children are incarcerated with adults in prisons throughout the coun-
 try, often without having been charged (see Sections 1.c. and i.e.).
 People With Disabilities.-Although the Constitution states that "disabled citizens
 shall enjoy fully the rights enshrined in the Constitution," the Government provided
 few resources to make this a reality. Representatives of disabled groups and wound-
 ed veterans frequently protested that discrimination continues against disabled per-
 sons. In September 1997, Vice Minister for Social Welfare Felipe Mandate acknowl-
 edged that such discrimination exists. Wounded veterans and victims of land mines
 are among the most visible disabled citizens. In July disabled veterans criticized
 President Chissano for failing to honor his pledge to provide housing, pensions, and
 other assistance to them. At the disabled veterans' center in Matola, at least 7 of
 38 residents died due to lack of adequate food and care, according to the veterans'
 organization ADEMIMO.
 Disabled women protested in August that the Government provides only four
 schools nationwide for hearing and visually impaired persons and for the physically
 and mentally disabled. There are few job opportunities for disabled persons.
 Social workers in Sofala province discovered that some parents of disabled chil-
 dren in several districts, including the populous towns of Gorongosa and Dondo, did
 not allow their disabled children to leave their homes. Provincial social action offi-
 cials began an educational campaign in July to reverse traditional attitudes toward
 disabled children.
 The Government continued to rely on NGO's to assist the disabled. Founded in
 1991, the Association of Mozambican Disabled addresses social and economic needs.
 Smaller NGO's also have formed, notably the Association of Handicapped Military
 and Paramilitary Mozambicans, which represents disabled demobilized soldiers, and
 the Association of Blind and Visually Impaired Mozambicans. A new organization
 
 
 296
 for:hearing-impaired persons was formed in Pemba. In September the Ministry of
 Social Action Coordination began a program to standardize sign language to im-
 prove communication and employability, and in December adopted a sign language
 curriculum for special schools.
 The only provisions that the Government has enacted for accessibility to buildings
 and transportation for the disabled were in the electoral law governing the country's
 first multiparty elections, which addressed the needs of disabled voters in the poll-
 ing booths. In other places, special access facilities are rare.
 NationalIRacial /Ethnic Minorities.-There was no systematic persecution or dis-
 crimination on the basis of race or ethnicity, although the FRELIMO Government
 traditionally has included at all levels a disproportionate number of southerners,
 mostly from the Shangan ethnic group. However, the Government has taken some
 steps to address this imbalance since the 1994 elections by appointing provincial
 governors native to their respective provinces. The Government also includes per-
 sons originally from the northern part of the country.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifies that all workers are free
 to join or refrain from joining a trade union. The 1991 Labor Law further protects
 workers' right to organize and to engage in union activity at their place of employ-
 ment. The le    aton gave existing unions the right to register independently from
 the Organization of Mozambican Workers.
 Until 1992 the ony trade union federation was the OTM which was affiliated
 with, and dominated by, the FRELIMO party. After passage of the 1991 legislation,
 three unions broke away from the OTM in 1992 and by 1994 had formed their own
 central union, the Free and Independent Union of Mozambique (SLIM). In January
 the Ministry of Labor recognized this second central union as a legal entity, known
 as the Confederation of Free and Independent Unions of Mozambique (CONSILMO).
 CONSILMO can participate in national negotiations on the minimum wage with the
 Consultative Labor Commission, a body inciuding representatives from labor, em-
 ployers, and government. CONSILMO mantained SLIM's working relationship with
 the OTM, and includes the powerful 28,000-member SINTICIM construction trades
 union, an early champion of the rights of female workers.
 In May 1994, the oTM declared itself free of commitments to any political party,
 companies, ur religious groups, and ruled that members affiliated with any political
 party could not hold elected union offices. Independent unions maintain that the
 OTM is not independent of the government.
 The Constitution explicitly provides for the right to strike, with the exception of
 civil servants, police, military personnel, and other essential services (which include
 sanitation, fire fighting, air traffic control, health care, water, electricity, fuel, post
 office, telecommunications, and grave digging). There were strikes around the coun-
 try throughout the year, notably in the textile sector. Workers' demands usually
 centered on the issues of salary arrears or increases in wage levels, especially in
 companies privatized during the past few years. Continuing a strike begun in 1997,
 1,200 workers at the Texlom textile mill in Matela, managed by a Portuguese firm,
 went without pay for nearly a year and asked the Government to take over the fim
 until new private managers could be found. In July the company's board of directors
 left the country. At Texmoque, another textile firm in Nampula, over 1,000 workers
 went on strike in July for payment of 9 months' back wages.
 The Labor Law forbids retribution against strikers, the hiring of substitute work-
 ers, and lockouts by employers. Specific labor disputes generally are arbitrated
 through ad hoc workers' committees, formally recognized by the Government.
 Two members of the workers' committee of a security services company were sus-
 pended from.their duties after giving advance notification of a January strike action
 to company management. The law specifies that strikers must notifa police, govern-
 ment, union, and employers 48 hours in advance of intended strikes. The fir
 charged the two with illegally representing employees who were protesting the com-
 pany's failure to answer a wage and benefits appeal made in late 1997 and with
 allegedly assaulting company managers. Their case has not yet been resolved. In the
 course of the strike demonstration, one worker was killed and several others were
 wounded or beaten by police (see Sections l.a., s , teand 2.b.).
 In January 20 workers at the Pescamar Fishing Company were injureda when po-
 lice attempted to disrupt their strike (see Section 2.b.).
 The Constitution and labor legislation give unions the right to join and participate
 in international bodies. The OTM is a member of the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and the Southern African Trade Union Coordinating Council.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivey.-The Labor Law protects the
 right of workers to organize and engage in collective bargaining. It expressly pro-
 
 
 297
 hibits discrimination against organized labor. In 1991 the Government decreed that
 it would no longer set all salary levels. Negotiation of wage increases was left in
 the hands of existing unions. The Consultative Commission on Labor, which com-
 prises the unions, employers' associations, and the Government, met periodically to
 negotiate increases in the minimum wage. For the first time since independence, the
 country's banks signed a collective bargaining agreement, regulating the labor rela-
 tionship between banks and their staffs. The National Teachers' Organization, for-
 merly a socio-professional group, transformed itself into a trade union in January.
 Legislation provides for the creation of export processing zones (EPZ's) and con-
 struction began on the first EPZ.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law. There were no reports of such practices in the formal economy. The
 law does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, and such
 practices are known to occur. Children in rural areas sometimes are used as labor
 to settle economic accounts. Families sometimes delegate their children to work for
 limited periods to settle economic accounts or repay services owed to others (see Sec-
 tions 5 and 6.d.).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Child
 labor is regulated by the Ministry of Labor, although there are no specific child
 labor statutes. The law does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by
 children, but such practices are known to occur in rural areas (see Sections 5 and
 6.c.). Also in rural areas, children sometimes work alongside their parents or inde-
 pendently in seasonal harvests on commercial plantations. Employers do not nor-
 mally pay children wages for such work, but compensate them with gifts such as
 school supplies and books, which are very costly on the local economy.
 In the wage economy, the minimum working age is 18 years. Although, the re-
 cently adopted revised Labor Law sets the minimum working age at 15, enabling
 regulations have not yet come into force. Children between  eages of 15 and 18
 may work with the permission of their parents and the Ministry of Education. Chil-
 dren younger than age 15 are not ermitted to work. The minimum wage laws apply
 and the maximum workweek for children is 38 hours (compared with 44 for adults).
 Because of high adult unemployment, estimated at around 50 percent, few chil-
 dren are employed in regular wage positions. However, children, including those
 under age 15, commonly work on familyr farms or in the urban informal sector,
 where they perform such tasks as guarding cars, collecting scrap metal, or selling
 trinkets and food in the streets. The informal labor sector is unregulated. Children
 also are employed in domestic positions.
 Primary education is not compulsory, and only 62 percent of school age children
 attend classes. Children not in school frequently are employed in the agricultural
 and informal sectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The industrial minimum wage is about $27
 (311,795 meticais) per month, which is set by ministerial decree, although the level
 is recommended through an administrative process. There is also an agricultural
 minimum wage of about $18 (209,960 meticais) per month, which is set by ministe-
 rial decree after informal consultation with agricultural unions. The minimum wage
 is not considered sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for an average
 urban worker and family, and many workers must turn to a second job, if available,
 as well as work garden plots to survive. The minimum wage is sufficient to provide
 a decent standard of living for a rural worker and family. The OTM estimated in
 April that the minimum wage would buy- only 38.4 percent of a basket of basic ne-
 cessities. The union calculates that the real minimum wage fell in value by 33 per-
 cent in the past decade. -
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing the minimum wage rates in the
 private sector, and the Ministry of Finance in the public sector. Violations of mini-
 mum wage rates usually are investigated only after workers register a complaint.
 It is customary for workers to receive benefits such as transportation and food in
 addition to wages. There is no obligation for workers or employers to participate in
 a social security scheme, although they may voluntarily create and contribute to pri-
 vate accounts or plans with the National Institute of Social Security, to cover retire-
 ment, unemployment, and emergency benefits. Worker complaints about employers
 who deduct social security contributions from wages but failed to pay them into ac-
 counts grew in number.
 The standard legal workweek is 44 hours, with a weekly 24-hour rest period. In
 the small modern sector, the Government has enacted health and environmental
 laws to protect workers. However, the Ministry of Labor enforces these laws ineffec-
 tively, and the Government only occasionally closed firms for noncompliance. During
 the parliamentary debate on revision of the Labor Law, delegates noted that there
 continued to be significant violations of labor legislation in many companies and
 
 
 services. Workers have the right to remove themselves from work situations that
 endanger their health or safety without jeopardy to their continued employment.
