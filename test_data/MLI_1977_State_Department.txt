 MALI
 Mali's governing Military Committee of National Li-
 beration is moving toward return to full civilian
 government in 1980, after the new constitution comes
 into full force in mid-1979. The new constitution
 confirms human rights defined by the Universal De-
 claration of Human Rights, but current law gives the
 military government the authority to override these
 rights in the national interest. Mali appears to be
 genuinely prepared to move toward greater respect for
 human rights, but at a rate determined and controlled
 by the military government. National reconciliation is
 one of the primary objectives of the military govern-
 ment's program, and progress has been made.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are no reports of the use of torture in Mali.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 There are no reports of such treatment or punishment in
 Mali, nor are there any reports of arbitrary deprivation
 of life. We have no indication that prison conditions
 are unduly harsh.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Although uncommon, there have been confirmed incidents,
 of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment in con-
 nection with "political offenses." In 1975, pro-
 claimed the "year of reconciliation" by President
 Traore, many -- but not all -- political prisoners
 were released. Amnesty International's 1977 Report
 notes twenty-eight adoptees and one investigative
 case in Mali. In late 1977 the government pardoned
 a number of dissident students detained earlier in
 the year.
 
 
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution provides this right, and it is
 usually observed in practice. Six Tuareg seces-
 sionists were, however, imprisoned from 1963 until
 their trials in 1977. Death sentences imposed on the
 six at that time were later in the year commuted to
 life imprisonment.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The new constitution provides that the home is in-
 violable, and a search requires a warrant which may be
 obtained only under appropriate conditions specified by
 law. However, house-to-house warrantless searches have
 occurred sporadically, usually as the result of some
 specific political incident, such as during the
 spring 1977 student strikes.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 aid Education
 Mali's present governmental policies are focused on
 responding to the needs of the poor. Mali ranks among
 the three or four poorest nations of the world ac-
 cording to UN estimates. Economic development programs
 are aimed at improving the livelihood of the country's
 overwhelmingly rural agricultural and nomadic popula-
 tion.
 Corruption, is a growing problem. Its first significant
 appearance can be traced to the time of the 196R-74
 Sahel drought, when diversion of commodities and
 misappropriation of funds were noted by almost all
 donors. There are almost constant warnings by
 President Traore against dishonest practices, occa-
 sional corruption trials, and the removal of egre-
 giously corrupt officials. Corruption cannot at this
 time be considered a serious drain on the country's
 development resources. It does, nonetheless, have a
 braking effect and diverts some resources from those
 in need.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, In-
 cluding
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Mali has been ruled since 1968 by a military committee,
 and organized political activity is prohibited.
 Freedom of speech is, therefore, restricted.
 Fifteen persons were arrested for distributing a
 pamphlet opposing the June 2, 1974, constitutional
 referendum, and in June 1977, the government used force
 to control a series of street demonstrations which on
 several occasions had resulted in vandalism and de-
 struction of property. Malians are free to assemble
 for social and professional purposes, although the
 labor unions, women's and other groups are required
 to follow the government's direction on political
 questions. There is freedom of religion. The
 press is government controlled.
 Mali's National Union of Malian Workers is expected
 to play an important role in Mali's political future
 and has already secured a voice in the management of
 Mali's enterprises. It has, however, often acted as a
 conduit for policies enunciated by the ruling Military
 Committee of National Liberation. The statues for
 the new political party to come into existence at
 the end of military government in June 1979, give
 two ex-officio seats to union representatives on the
 Party's National Council, the main policy-making
 organization. The Secretary General of the Union is
 also represented on the 17-member Executive Office,
 which will run the Party's daily affairs.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement within Mali is generally un-
 restricted, although inter-city travelers are
 subject to frequent police checks, which are
 allowed by the law. The present military govern-
 ment won its popularity in part by removing most
 barriers to travel common under the previous
 
 
 77
 regime. There are no barriers to emigration or
 foreign travel.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The new Malian constitution, which comes into full
 force in 1979, foresees the election by universal
 suffrage of a president and national assembly, and
 the nascent political party, the Democratic Union of
 the Malian People, will at least theoretically
 represent all the people. The constitution guar-
 antees equality under the law for all except members
 of the pre-1968 regime.
 4. Governmental Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-Governmental Investi-
 gation of alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no requests for independent, outside
 investigations of alleged human rights violations in
 Mali. Since 1968 Amnesty International has urged
 the release of political prisoners and in 1974
 organized a campaign to publicize the prisoners'
 plight. The National Academy of Sciences Commission
 on International Relations has expressed interest in
 the situation of a mathematician-imprisoned in 1974
 for unlawful distribution of political tracts during
 the constitutional referendum.
