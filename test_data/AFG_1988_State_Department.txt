 AFGHANISTAN
 Following its invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the Soviet
 Union installed Babrak Karmal as new state and party leader
 but replaced him with a new leader, former secret police chief
 Najibullah, in 1986. The replacement came in apparent
 frustration over Karmal's failure to subdue armed opposition
 to his regime, notwithstanding the support of some 120,000
 Soviet troops and large amounts of Soviet aid. Soviet resolve
 to continue the war weakened significantly during 1987-1988
 due to increased mujahidin military success and a more
 realistic foreign policy approach adopted by General Secretary
 Gorbachev.
 On April 14, after lengthy negotiations in Geneva, the Soviet
 Union agreed to withdraw all of its troops from Afghanistan by
 February 15, 1989, marking a major turning point in
 Afghanistan's struggle for freedom from foreign domination.
 By August 15 the Soviet Union had withdrawn half of its
 troops. As the Soviet role on the ground wound down,
 mujahidin pressure on the regime increased. In late August,
 the mujahidin took Bamian Province, in the center of the
 country, and by September had made significant gains against
 regime forces in the north and south. Soviet forces, however,
 continued to provide regime units with massive air and
 artillery support, and continued to supply large amounts of
 military aid to the regime. By November the Soviets had
 halted their withdrawal in the face of increased mujahidin
 successes and escalated their military operations against the
 resistance, deploying high-performance aircraft and Scud
 missiles.
 The war has generated over 5 million refugees, one-third of
 the population of Afghanistan before the war. International
 observers estimate that over 1 million Afghans have died as a
 direct consequence of the Soviet invasion and occupation.
 Moscow has pursued a policy of Sovietization of those areas
 still under the control of Soviet and Republic of Afghanistan
 (RA) forces. In addition to placing thousands of advisers in
 the regime structure, the Soviet Union has taken thousands of
 Afghan children to the Soviet Union for political
 indoctrination in values that are alien to the Afghan people's
 Islamic heritage. This process has continued during the
 Soviet withdrawal.
 During 1988 Soviet and RA forces abandoned some areas and
 ceased offensive operations in others. Some Afghan refugees
 have begun to repopulate a few of these areas, reconstituting
 farmland under mujahidin protection. However, a large-scale
 return of refugees, predicted by some observers, did not occur
 for several reasons: the continuation of hostilities; the
 failure of the regime's so-called national reconciliation
 policy to attract refugees; and the presence of millions of
 mines, most sown by Soviet forces, along transportation routes
 and in areas of potential resettlement.
 Internal security functions are carried out in
 regime-controlled areas primarily by the secret police,
 formerly known as KHAD but renamed the Ministry of State
 Security (WAD). More than 25,000 Afghans, supervised by
 Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB) advisers, work for
 the Ministry. The regime's principal tools of control and
 manipulation are surveillance, imprisonment, interrogation,
 torture, and execution.

 AFGHANISTAN
 Afghanistan's economy has been shattered by the war. During
 1988 Soviet reprisal raids and depopulation campaigns-, some of
 them against the few areas which had previously escaped
 large-scale devastation, led to damage that will require many
 years to repair.
 There was no basic change in the human rights situation in
 1988, and individual human rights continued to be denied and
 suppressed on a massive scale. Basic improvement in the human
 rights environment depends on total withdrawal of Soviet
 forces and restoration of independence to a freely chosen
 Afghan government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Arbitrary killing and other acts of violence against suspected
 regime opponents continued to be commonplace. Reports from
 prison inmates released in 1988 and Afghan staff members at
 prison facilities tell of executions in RA prisons. Afghans
 report that, from mid-January to mid-March, 200 prisoners,
 predominantly mujahidin or mujahidin supporters, were hanged
 at Pol-e-Charkhi prison.
 Soviet and RA forces as well as some mujahidin groups have
 executed prisoners in the field. In one instance, Amnesty
 International (AI) reported that 12 mujahidin were taken
 prisoner on January 16 in Kolalgu village of Paktia Province
 by combined Soviet and regime units and that, according to 2
 survivors, 9 of the 12 were killed when their captors marched
 them into the village mosque and blew it up. The explosion at
 the mosque also killed seven children in an adjacent house.
 The mujahidin generally interrogate and release captured Kabul
 regime enlisted men and hold some captured Soviet personnel as
 prisoners; however, some killings of captured Soviets have
 been reported, such as the execution in April of a downed
 Soviet pilot near Charikar whose aircraft had been involved in
 attacks on local mujahidin positions. When asked about their
 policy on Soviet prisoners, mujahidin generally state that
 Soviets are more valuable to them alive, since they can be
 used to trade for mujahidin prisoners at ratios of up to 25 to
 1. Nevertheless, allegations of mujahidin assassinations of
 Soviet personnel and RA officials continued in 1988. Many of
 the political killings reported in Kabul appeared to result
 from factional infighting within the ruling People's
 Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). Soviet and resistance
 representatives met in Islamabad in November and December to
 discuss future prisoner exchanges.
 Regime accusations that the mujahidin summarily executed
 regime officials following the capture of Konduz in August
 have not been substantiated, and the regime has not allowed
 Western reporters to go to Konduz to investigate these
 allegations. However, resistance sources themselves
 acknowledge that the mujahidin who entered Konduz behaved in
 an undisciplined manner.
 In 1988 Soviet and RA forces again launched numerous attacks
 against civilian targets, resulting in massive destruction of
 homes, entire villages, croplands, and infrastructure as well
 
 
 1269
 AFGHANISTAN
 as death and injuries to uncounted numbers of civilians.
 Throughout the year there were reprisal attacks against
 civilian populations suspected of sympathizing with the
 mujahidin. There were also civilian casualties resulting from
 the deployment of a napalm-like substance against the
 resistance. The major threat of injury to civilians is
 increasingly posed by millions of landmines throughout the
 country. U.N. requests that the Soviets and the regime supply
 maps of minefields placed by their armed forces have not been
 fulfilled. Moreover, Soviet and regime claims to have cleared
 hundreds of minefields are not borne out by the available
 evidence. Indeed, newly arrived refugees in Pakistan have
 reported that new minefields have been laid by the RA and
 Soviets.
 Mujahidin actions in 1988 also resulted in loss of life and
 injuries among civilians. The mujahidin were believed
 responsible for bomb attacks in Jalalabad and Kabul which
 resulted in significant civilian casualties. Mujahidin rocket
 attacks against Kabul and other regime-controlled cities,
 although aimed primarily at military targets, inevitably took
 a toll among civilians estimated in the thousands by regime
 officials and in the hundreds by impartial observers.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances continued to be common in areas under regime
 control. In some cases, unexplained disappearance of young
 males is due to impressment into military service (see Section
 l.d.). In other cases, Afghans are arrested and imprisoned or
 summarily executed for political offenses or because they are
 relatives of mujahidin. Persons having past associations with
 governments currently hostile to the regime often
 "disappear." Some persons also disappear as a result of the
 action of mujahidin, who frequently abduct or capture regime
 military and civilian cadre and suspected regime
 collaborators.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Regime authorities frequently employ torture to punish or to
 extract information or confessions. The policy is widespread,
 indicating that it has official sanction. Victims often claim
 that Soviet officials monitor and indirectly control the
 torture sessions. Torture techniques include both physical
 and psychological abuse. Use of electric shock to sensitive
 parts of the body, immersion in water, and beatings are common
 forms of physical abuse reported by victims and witnesses.
 Threats of abuse against family members and prolonged sleep
 deprivation are typical forms of psychological abuse.
 Persistent reports describe cases of mental disturbances
 induced by torture in regime prisons. Political prisoners are
 usually not segregated from criminal or mentally ill
 prisoners. Medical care is commonly described as minimal at
 Pol-e-Charkhi, where prisoners are generally required to wait
 at least a month before being allowed access to medical
 personnel. According to reliable reports, many prisoners died
 in 1988 as a result of inadequate diet, corporal punishment,
 and torture.
 One former prisoner interviewed during 1988 reported that he
 was tortured at Sadarat Prison in downtown Kabul.
 Interrogators tore out his beard in clumps, and he and others
 were made to stand, chained to a cold, wet cement floor
 
 
 1270
 AFGHANISTAN
 overnight. Repeated sessions caused him and others to develop
 severe pain in their joints, especially in the knees. Another
 prisoner, recently released, says that electric current was
 used in his torture/interrogation sessions, which eventually
 caused severe internal bleeding, kidney damage, and
 hospitalization. Both persons said that Soviet personnel were
 on hand during the sessions, but usually out of view. Torture
 was used to elicit information and for disciplinary purposes.
 Prison officials interviewed about conditions in Pol-e-Charkhi
 told reliable sources that electricity was not provided to
 cells because too many prisoners used the current to commit
 suicide through electrocution.
 The regime continues to impede or deny access by embassies to
 their imprisoned nationals. French journalist Alain Guillo,
 released from Pol-e-Charkhi in May, reported that he
 personally witnessed periodic unprovoked beatings of Iranian,
 Pakistani, and Tunisian prisoners. Wardens entered the cells
 early in the morning and beat prisoners seemingly at random.
 Diplomats report that imprisoned Italian journalist Fausto
 Biloslavo, released in June, was whipped across the back and
 shoulders by a Soviet officer.
 In its 1988 Report, covering 1987, AI noted that it had
 continued to receive reports of torture and ill-treatment of
 the regime's prisoners, although on a lesser scale than in
 previous years. AI also took note of Aghanistan's
 ratification of the U.N. Convention Against Torture. AI said
 it also continued to receive reports of the torture of Soviet
 and Afghan soldiers and regime supporters by opposition groups.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no legal safeguards to prevent arbitrary arrest or
 detention. Afghans in areas controlled by the regime face
 unwarranted seizure by security personnel. Often, detainees
 are either not told of the charges against them before trial
 or are simply not brought to trial. Arrest warrants are not
 issued, nor is the right to judicial determination of the
 legality of detention respected. Detainees typically are held
 incommunicado, sometimes for years, as is the case with
 several hundred prisoners held in the WAD sections of
 Pol-e-Charkhi prison. Although bail is sometimes granted, it
 is not a standard feature of the regime's legal procedures.
 Formal charges may come only after months of interrogation.
 Instances of arbitrary detention increased still further in
 1988, principally as a result of the impressment of civilians
 into military service in Kabul and, to a lesser extent, in
 other regime-controlled cities. The Kabul regime's military
 and secret police cadre continue to impress large numbers of
 underage boys into the military, taking them from the street
 and sometimes from classrooms and homes. Regime authorities
 do not inform the parents of the young men of their
 impressment. Relatives of soldiers who desert are often
 arrested by the regime to punish the deserters and to deter
 others from deserting. In August the regime stepped up its
 drive for new recruits, and with increasing frequency began
 taking underage boys and old men, in addition to
 reconscripting persons who had already served their military
 stints. The induction center at Kandak-e-Tajammu was notable
 for the presence of mothers of missing children scanning the
 draft lists to see if their sons had recently "volunteered."
 
 
 1271
 AFGHANISTAN
 As an indication of the regime's need for new recruits, in
 August two foreign diplomats were accosted by plainclothesmen
 who told them that unless they could produce the appropriate
 documents, they would be inducted on the spot into the Afghan
 army.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All courts are controlled by the ruling PDPA. Laws governing
 their organization and jurisdiction cite as a first priority
 the protection of the "revolution." As a consequence,
 plaintiffs may be denied their legal rights because of charges
 regarding'their political beliefs. Most persons accused of
 nonpolitical crimes are tried in the civil court system under
 the norms of preinvasion judicial codes. Those political
 detainees who are charged and brought to trial are usually
 arraigned on allegations of treason, espionage, or terrorism,
 and are tried and sentenced in secret. As a rule, they must
 provide their own defense without benefit of counsel. Death
 sentences generally are carried out quickly after a
 perfunctory review by the authorities. There is no mechanism
 to appeal a death sentence. According to the Constitution,
 death sentences are carried out after the approval of the
 President. In areas not controlled by the regime, civil and
 criminal cases are tried by Islamic judges (qazis) and
 community elders under Islamic, or Shari'a, law and according
 to Afghan custom.
 No precise estimate is available on the number of political
 prisoners held by the Kabul regime, but it is at least several
 thousand. The mujahidin are not known to hold political
 prisoners, although they do detain Soviet and regime personnel
 for extended periods. In its 1988 Report, AI noted that more
 than 7,000 political prisoners were said by the regime to have
 been released by the end of July 1987, following the
 announcement of a general amnesty in January, but that some
 political prisoners remained in prison. Reportedly among
 those released were three Kabul University professors who had
 been arrested for membership in a human rights monitoring
 group.
 f; Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 The Kabul regime and the Soviet occupation forces do not
 recognize the right to privacy. Civilian areas are frequently
 cordoned off and subject to search, often by Soviet troops.
 Afghans complain that regime and Soviet forces routinely
 confiscate property, including homes. In response to
 increasing mujahidin penetration of Kabul, the regime is
 resorting even more to house-to-house searches, 'which are
 frequently carried out in predawn hours. Telephones are
 frequently tapped and correspondence monitored. Citizens are
 warned not to listen to foreign broadcasts except from states
 friendly to the regime.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The regime tolerates almost no criticism of the Soviet Union
 in the public media, and private criticism can result in
 detention and arrest. There is no academic freedom. All
 
 
 1272
 AFGHANISTAN
 media are owned and controlled by the regime and tightly
 supervised by Soviet officials. The press, radio, and
 television are used exclusively to convey regime policy and
 the Soviet interpretation of world events. Soviet
 publications, films, and television are widely available in
 local languages to reinforce those views. The unlicensed
 import and sale of non-Soviet video and audio tapes,
 magazines, books, and posters are forbidden, though this ban
 is generally ineffective. Western radio broadcasts in local
 languages are frequently jammed, although some programs do get
 through.
 Afghans are guarded in their conversations lest antiregime or
 anti-Soviet comments be reported to the secret police. For
 example, about 20 residents of Khair Khana in Kabul who were
 vocal in their accusations that Soviets were responsible for a
 rocket attack on their neighborhood were arrested and
 interrogated by WAD personnel.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There is no freedom of peaceful assembly or association in
 areas controlled by the regime. A party decree passed by the
 Revolutionary Council in 1987 supposedly provided a framework
 for expression of political views at variance with the views
 of the ruling PDPA, but the party continues to set the bounds
 for acceptable dissent. The regime regularly stages so-called
 "spontaneous" gatherings to convey the impression of popular
 support, including mass demonstrations in front of diplomatic
 missions. Unauthorized peaceful assemblies are dealt with
 forcefully. Parents have been warned that their children
 would be forced out of school if they refused to join official
 youth organizations. Large numbers of people from the upper
 and middle classes have fled the country because of severe
 restrictions on political and social activity.
 State-sponsored trade associations are closely modeled after
 those in the Soviet Union.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Afghanistan is an Islamic nation. Sunnis predominate, though
 there is an important Shi'a minority primarily concentrated in
 the Hazarajat region in central Afghanistan. Small enclaves
 of Hindus, Sikhs, and Jews traditionally have lived peacefully
 alongside their Muslim neighbors.
 Since the 1978 coup, the regime has sought, with marginal
 success, to strictly supervise all religious organizations.
 The regime's policy pronouncements routinely invoke religious
 terminology in a cosmetic effort to appeal to the populace,
 and it has made some effort to win support from Muslims. In
 an attempt to win legitimacy, the regime sponsored a World
 Islamic Conference in 1988 which was attended mainly by front
 groups and shell organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration,-and Repatriation
 Domestic travel remains severely restricted by wartime
 conditions. According to Afghans, in 1988 the regime loosened
 its requirements and lowered the charge for obtaining a
 passport for foreign travel. Applicants for travel abroad
 
 
 1273
 AFGHANISTAN
 previously had to post a bond of about $900 or their principal
 residence as security. This requirement has been dropped in
 most cases, and the regime is reportedly issuing many more
 passports than in the past.
 Extensive Soviet and regime mining of principal overland
 routes and passes creates serious risks for returning
 refugees, and has caused a large number of casualties. The
 regime estimates that over 150,000 Afghans have come back to
 Afghanistan in response to its appeals to return. No
 international organization regards this figure as credible.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have neither the right nor the ability peacefully to
 change their government. Afghanistan is a totalitarian state
 under the control of the PDPA, which is kept in power by the
 Soviet Union. The ruling PDPA is modeled closely on the
 Soviet Communist Party, and Soviet military and civilian
 advisors sit in virtually all regime offices and make or
 approve all significant decisions. Under military pressure
 from the mujahidin, the PDPA is discussing various ways of
 changing the Republic of Afghanistan's form of government in
 an attempt to preserve the ruling role of the PDPA. However,
 the plans discussed so far envisage the surrender of no real
 power.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The regime has continued to resist efforts by international
 humanitarian organizations to investigate human rights
 practices in Afghanistan. In January 1987, the Prime Minister
 granted the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 permission to visit all persons detained in Afghanistan. At
 the same time, the ICRC launched a major program of medical
 assistance in Kabul. Negotiations on the terms for ICRC
 registration of, and visits to, prisoners at Pol-e-Charkhi
 prison, however, were subject to frequent breakdowns.
 Eventually, by mid-1988, the ICRC was able to visit most
 prisoners at the prison, but was barred from many of the WAD
 prison areas (some of which the regime denies exist), where
 large numbers of prisoners have been held without trial for as
 long as 10 years. In addition, the ICRC has been denied
 access to detention facilities--at least three major
 installations exist in Kabul--where torture reportedly is
 routine.
 The regime invited the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Human
 Rights in Afghanistan to visit in September. Critics point
 out that the regime has been consistent in its attempts to
 deceive him. During a visit in January to Spin Buldak, for
 example, the Special Rapporteur was introduced to a group of
 people described as returned refugees. According to two
 residents of the area, however, these people in fact were
 civilian and military supporters of Esmatullah Muslim, a
 mujahidin turncoat and now an army general. In a January
 visit to Pol-e-Charkhi prison, the Rapporteur interviewed
 prisoners who in reality were reported to have been soldiers
 who donned prison garb. The regime carried out similar
 deceptions with foreign journalists who visited Kabul in
 August in connection with the Soviets' withdrawal of half
 their troops. In one instance, journalists were taken to a
 
 
 1274
 AFGHANISTAN
 purported resettlement house for returning refugees whose
 residents were later exposed by the journalists as
 fraudulent. For the most part, the journalists were confined
 to tightly planned itineraries; few, if any, were permitted to
 interview prisoners or see detainees, though many pressed for
 permission. Journalists who seek to report independently on
 developments in Afghanistan are often at risk. A Norwegian
 journalist, Astrid Morker, was killed on July 22 by a land
 mine while traveling with the mujahidin; she was accused by
 the regime media of being a spy. Western journalists
 imprisoned by the regime are often denied the most elementary
 rights, are denied contacts with consular officers and are
 often beaten by their jailers.
 Some mujahidin groups periodically have permitted the ICRC and
 journalists to visit prisoners under their control,
 particularly Soviet prisoners. Others, however, have refused
 to cooperate with the ICRC and have prevented the ICRC from
 visiting prisoners held inside Pakistan. In 1988 some
 mujahidin commanders offered to allow the ICRC access to
 prisoners in their custody in return for ICRC access to
 prisoners held by the regime. The regime has granted the ICRC
 some access to prisoners in its custody. The ICRC reported a
 30 percent increase in the prisoner population at Pol-e-Charki
 during the fall of 1988.
 In its 1988 Report, AI noted a number of instances in which it
 had raised matters of concern with the regime in 1987, and
 said that it had failed to receive any response to its
 requests.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The participation of Afghan women in activities beyond the
 home and field is limited by traditional beliefs, customs, and
 religious practices. In areas under resistance control, the
 role of women follows traditional lines. The social position
 of some women, generally those associated with the PDPA, has
 improved somewhat in Kabul and other regime-controlled
 cities. Access of young women to higher education has
 increased in Kabul after the loss of large numbers of young
 men because of conscription into the RA military, joining the
 mujahidin, or refugee flight. For similar reasons, the role
 of women in some nontraditional occupations such as banking,
 television, radio, and the civil service has expanded. Few
 women, however, hold responsible, decisionmaking positions.
 Afghanistan is home to several religious sects and a number of
 ethnic, tribal, and linguisitic groups whose relations to one
 another have traditionally been marked by rivalry and,
 occasionally, hostilities. The regime reflects these
 rivalries, but also takes advantage of them for its own
 purposes. For example, the regime continued its practice of
 dispatching troops drawn from one ethnic group to parts of the
 country where that group is not represented, often resulting
 in hostilities between the groups. This practice continued in
 primarily Pushtun Kandahar where hundreds of Uzbek troops from
 the north were reintroduced in the autumn. These troops
 reportedly looted and raped at will, resulting in a breakdown
 of law and order, killings, and new refugees. Shi'a Muslim
 resistance groups are not represented in the seven-party
 resistance Alliance, in part because of traditional antipathy
 and discrimination on the part of Afghan Sunnis toward their
 Shi'a countrymen.

 AFGHANISTAN
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution and the labor law (enacted in 1987) assert
 that individual workers have the right to form trade unions.
 Trade unions are theoretically independent of state organs but
 are overseen by the Central Council of Trade Unions, an
 umbrella organization controlled by the ruling PDPA. In
 practice, however, the structure of union organization is
 modelled on that of the Soviet Union, and there is no evidence
 of worker participation in decisionmaking. There is no
 provision in RA law for the right to organize independent
 unions, and there is no right to strike. Workers have been
 threatened with loss of jobs or imprisonment for refusal to
 join party organizations.
 The Central Council of Trade Unions is affiliated with the
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Within the constraints mentioned above, workers have the
 theoretical right to organize and bargain collectively.
 According to the labor law, in large economic organizations,
 at the end of each Islamic year, a new collective contract is
 signed following negotiations "between the administration and
 the Council of Representatives after the confirmation of the
 workers' collective." In practice, there is no genuine
 labor-management bargaining and the workers' collective rubber
 stamps decisions taken by officials.
 There is no indication that there are any special economic or
 export processing zones, and labor laws and practices appear
 to be uniform throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution forbids the imposition of forced labor, but
 notes that the "performance of compulsory labor in wartime,
 natural calamity, and other states of emergency which threaten
 public life and order shall be excluded from this." Given
 that wartime conditions exist, this provision is in effect a
 dead letter. The most frequent manifestation of the use of
 forced labor is the "voluntary" labor engaged in by students
 who are seconded for a short time to the military for
 construction projects and then returned to school. For
 example, in January approximately 400 Kabul youths were sent
 to Kandahar where they spent 2 months working on military
 construction projects, after which they were sent back to
 their classroooms.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The labor law specifies the conditions of work for adolescents
 (those aged 13 to 18), noting that adolescents aged 13 to 15
 should only work a maximum of 30 hours per week, and those
 aged 16 to 17 should not work more than 35 hours per week.
 The law also specifies that adolescents should receive the
 same pay as persons 18 and older.
 
 
 1276
 AFGHANISTAN
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor law stipulates that the usual hours of work on
 average should not exceed 40 hours in a week, and that on
 Thursdays working time should not exceed 5 hours. Provision
 is made for time off for prayers, meals, holidays, weekends,
 annual leave, sick leave, and emergency leave. No information
 on any statutory minimum wage is available. There are general
 provisions which set out the employer's responsibility to
 ensure healthy and safe conditions of work, and accident
 compensation. With regard to enforcement mechanisms to ensure
 fair and safe labor practices, there appear to be none that
 are effective. The State Committee on Labor and Social
 Security is understaffed and, like most ministries and state
 committees of the current regime, not very active. There has
 been some discussion about setting up labor courts and other
 mechanisms for the resolution of disputes, but no action has
 been taken.
