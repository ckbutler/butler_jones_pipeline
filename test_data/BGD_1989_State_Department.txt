 BANGLADESH
 The Bangladesh Constitution provides for a presidential form
 of government and a unicameral Parliament of 300 members. The
 President appoints the ministers, 20 percent of whom do not
 have to be members of Parliament. The Prime Minister, also
 appointed by the President, serves more as the leader of the
 parliamentary majority than as leader of the Government. H.M.
 Ershad, then the Army Chief of Staff, took power in 1982 in a
 bloodless coup and, after retiring from the military, was
 elected President in 1986 in elections boycotted by the major
 opposition parties.
 The present Parliament, composed of 252 members from the
 President's Jatiyo Party and 48 members from smaller parties,
 was formed in elections held in March 1988 which were marred
 by the absence of major opposition parties, sporadic violence,
 low voter turnout, and fraudulent vote counts. Parliament
 held two sessions in 1989 and passed limited autonomy
 legislation for the three Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT)
 districts and a Ninth Constitutional Amendment which provides
 for an elected Vice President and limits both the President's
 and Vice President's tenure to two consecutive 5-year terms.
 In view of continued questioning of the current PArliament's
 representative character, the Government has offered to hold
 midterm parliamentary elections, but the major opposition
 parties have refused to participate because they do not
 believe there can be free and fair elections under President
 Ershad.
 The police and paramilitary forces, all of which are
 controlled by the Home Affairs Ministry, bear primary
 responsibility for maintaining internal security.
 Paramilitary forces include the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), which
 guards the borders, the Bangladesh Ansars (a home guard which
 assists the police in maintaining law and order), and the
 Village Defense Parties (VDP), a uniformed but normally
 unarmed local militia. The army plays an internal security
 role in the CHT, where attacks by tribal insurgents against
 security forces, Bengali settlers, and other tribals continued
 in 1989. Tribars have accused security forces of
 participating in or instigating attacks by settlers. Despite
 these accusations, there were no confirmed reports in 1989 of
 retaliation by army troops in the area.
 Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest and most densely
 populated countries. The Government's key programs aim at
 economic development through reduced population growth,
 increased crop yields, decentralization of administration, and
 development of the private sector. The economy recovered
 somewhat from the devastating floods of 1988, and below-normal
 rainfall prevented serious flooding in 1989.
 Overall, there were no major changes in the human rights
 situation in 1989. The internalIy divided opposition's
 inability to remount its campaign to oust the present
 Government brought, a year of relative political stability,
 with fewer reported instances of human rights abuses than in
 1988. Municipal elections conducted during the year were
 relatively peaceful, as were local government council
 elections in June in the three CHT districts. However, a
 parliamentary by-election in September was marred by
 allegations of voting irregularities. Significant
 restrictions remained on the ability of citizens to change
 their government, freedom of the-press, and a variety of
 
 
 1348
 BANGLADESH
 women's rights, and there remained concerns regarding abuse of
 prisoners and detainees and arbitrary detentions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 While January elections in 80 of Bangladesh's 86
 municipalities were relatively peaceful, sporadic violence
 resulted in at least 6 deaths and over 500 injuries, including
 injuries to a numaber of law enforcement officials. Police
 fired above the heads of crowds to disperse them, but
 apparently no fatalities were inflicted by law enforcement
 authorities. There was also violence on university campuses
 throughout the year as student wings of various political
 parties clashed repeatedly. These encounters often caused
 injuries and sometimes resulted in deaths.
 For a discussion of killings related to the CHT insurgency,
 see Section l.g.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed reports of disappearance resulting
 from official actions in 1989. As in the past, however, armed
 tribal insurgents in the CHT kidnaped a number of persons in
 raids on Bengali villages.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution forbids torture and cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading punishment or treatment. Despite several
 allegations, there were no confirmed reports of such incidents
 in the CHT in 1989, but Amnesty International (AI) and local
 uman rights groups continue to monitor this area and to
 encourage the Government to safeguard the rights of tribal
 people. In response to previous requests, the Government
 submitted a report to Al on several alleged instances of
 torture in the Hill Tracts dating from 1986.
 Police treatment of accused criminals is usually rough and can
 include abusive interrogations and beatings. Reports of
 fatalities from such treatment are relatively rare; however,
 local'buman rights groups have begun increasingly to
 investigate individual cases and confirmed five such deaths in
 1989. The Government has not interfered in such
 investigations. In its 1989 Report, covering 1988, AI noted
 that it had renewed reports of torture of criminal suspects in
 police custody, several of whom were alleged to have died as a
 result. Mistreatment of ordinary citizens frequently goes
 unpunished, but police and jail officials involved in
 mistreating prisoners are sometimes disciplined in cases where
 the victim or his family and friends can attract publicity or
 persuade human rights groups to investigate the allegations.
 There are also occasional reports of abusive treatment of
 citizens by a variety of lower level government officials,
 party bosses, and labor leaders--who intimidate others through
 violence or threats of violence.
 
 
 1349
 BANGLADESH
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Special Powers Act of 1974 (SPA), the Government can
 detain an individual without charge for an initial period of
 30 days to prevent the commission of "any prejudicial act" as
 defined in the legislation. The Government is obligated to
 charge the detainee formally by the end of this period or
 release him if it fails to file a charge. The individual can
 legally be held until completion of an investigation if the
 Government brings a charge. In practice, though not in the
 law, the detainee has 15 days to respond to the specific
 charge in writing to the Home Affairs Ministry, which can
 grant early release. Detentions under the SPA are not subject
 to judicial review until after 6 months, at which time a
 committee of three jurists examines the case to ascertain
 whether there is sufficient reason to continue the detention.
 Although the detainee is theoretically entitled to see a
 lawyer at the time he is detained, in practice a lawyer is
 generally not allowed to see the detainee until a specific
 charge has been filed.
 Forty alleged activists in a Hindu separatist movement were
 detained under the SPA in the early part of 1989. Twenty-six
 remain incarcerated. Human rights activists fear that the SPA
 is increasingly used against political opponents in rural
 areas and to detain indefinitely suspected criminals against
 whom the Government has insufficient evidence for a formal
 charge. Human rights activists and some press accounts note
 that the Government often issues new detention orders against
 individuals as soon as the original detention has expired or
 been vacated by the courts.
 The Government put the number of SPA detainees at 2,157 as of
 April 30, although human rights groups believe the actual
 figure is higher. Persons detained under the SPA are often
 subsequently charged under criminal statutes.
 The right of a detainee to a judicial determination of the
 legality of his detention exists in local law. Bangladeshi
 legal and human rights organizations, however, continued to
 report cases of suspects who were arrested on minor charges
 but who remained in jail for long periods without trial.
 There were no reports of persons being exiled in 1989.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section-6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Supreme Court is generally considered independent,
 although pressure is sometimes brought to bear in political or
 security cases. Civilian courts hear civil and criminal cases
 in public trials, and the right of counsel is respected..
 Though generally considered fair, civil courts are
 overburdened and effectively available only to those who can
 afford representation. In addition, the time-consuming and
 expensive process of pursuing cases discourages many from
 seeking redress through the courts. There are few legal aid
 programs to assist litigants and no public defenders.
 Although the legal time limit for disposal of criminal cases
 is 240 days at the district level and 120 days at the
 magistrate level, a shortage of judges and a backlog of over
 500,000 criminal and civil cases makes longer delays a common
 occurrence. The continuation of a 1-day-a-week boycott of the
 Supreme Court by barristers who oppose several court-related
 government decisions hampered the timely dispensation of
 
 
 1350
 BANGLADESH
 justice even further. A relatively small number of the cases
 in the backlog involves detainees.
 A Bangladeshi nonprofit human rights group, with funding from
 The Asia Foundation (TAF), has established a training program
 for new lawyers. A TAF training program for judges has to
 date trained 255 assistant judges and 45 midlevel judges, and
 TAF continues to support the legal outreach program of a local
 human rights group.
 The Government claims to hold no political prisoners.
 Bangladesh human rights groups assert, however, that some
 persons detained under the SPA are actually political
 prisoners. Currently such groups do not maintain statistics
 on the number of political prisoners in the country, and
 estimates vary considerably.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Bangladesh law requires a judicial warrant before authorities
 enter ahome, and courts require evidence supporting a
 reasonable suspicion before issuing a warrant. However, the
 SPA permits authorities to search premises without a warrant
 under certain circumstances, and authorities have in the past
 entered the homes of opposition leaders, detained individuals,
 and searched their premises without warrants. The
 Government's civilian and military intelligence services are
 widely believed to monitor the opposition by such means as
 selective wiretaps and interception of mail.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Despite government efforts to address tribal grievances in
 1989 through limited autonomy legislation for the CHT, the
 longstanding Shanti Bahini (Peace Force) insurgent movement
 remained active. This insurgency began in the early 1970's
 and has been sustained by the tribal people's fears that their
 traditional way of life and special status in the hill areas
 are being undermined by settlers from the overpopulated
 plains. During the past 4 years, government policy has
 discouraged settlement in the Hill Tracts. Some 300,000
 ethnic Bengalis remain in the 3 hill districts along with
 approximately 500,000 tribals.
 Due to restricted access to the Hill Tracts, the veracity of
 accusations of atrocities committed by the tribals or security
 forces cannot be confirmed. Shanti Bahini attacks on Bengali
 settlements, military personnel, and tribals, many of which
 resulted in deaths and destruction of property, continued in
 1989 and escalated in late July following the June CHT local
 government council elections. Precise figures are not
 available, but the Government estimates that these attacks
 killed at least 300 persons by mid-September and drove more
 than 1,500.tribals to refugee camps in neighboring India.
 Others put the number of new refugees at a much higher level.
 A number of tribals alleged to be Shanti Bahini insurgents
 also died in clashes in 1989 with military personnel. In
 addition, between 16 and 36 tribals were killed and
 approximately 500 were injured in May when the alleged Shanti
 Bahini assassination of a county council chairman provoked
 reprisals by settlers against tribals. Although some sources
 charge that goveinment security forces instigated the
 reprisals, or at least were slow to restore order, there is no
 
 
 1351
 BANGLADESH
 evidence of military complicity in the Bengali settlers'
 attacks on the tribals. In 1989 there was no confirmed
 evidence that the security forces disobeyed strict government
 orders to avoid reprisals against the tribal people and to
 prevent others from such retaliations. Complaints of human
 rights violations in the Hill Tracts continued to be far fewer
 than those received as recently as 1987, and despite Shanti
 Bahini threats to kill candidates and voters, June elections
 to fill seats on the newly created CHT district councils were
 for the most part peaceful. The Government offered amnesty to
 Shanti Bahini insurgents on two occasions in 1989.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Presq
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and expression
 and freedom of the press, subject to "reasonable restrictions"
 in the interest of national security, international relations,
 and public order, decency, and morality. In practice, the
 Government has a variety of means to attempt to control the
 press, including formal and informal censorship, "guidance"
 from the Press Information Department, temporary closures of
 newspapers, and arrest or intimidation of journalists. The
 SPA allows the Government to ban domestic publications, to
 hold any newspaper employee responsible for the paper's
 content, and to compel journalists to reveal news sources.
 Most publications are heavily dependent upon advertisements
 from the Government or government-owned corporations; these
 advertisements reportedly account for as much as 75 percent of
 advertising revenues. Although all newspapers are
 theoretically eligible to receive public sector advertising if
 they meet minimum circulation requirements, publishers
 complain that the placing and withholding of advertising, as
 well as payment for it, are often used as a means of
 influencing the press.
 In 1989 several Bengali-language weeklies--which tend to be
 censored more heavily than dailies--were banned for
 "objectionable" statements or commentary. A number of other
 publications banned between 1984 and 1988 remained closed in
 1989. Bans on these newspapers have been in effect for
 varying lengths of time, with some appearing to be permanent.
 The Government owns and operates all radio and television
 facilities. In the print media, it owns two Dhaka newspapers,
 including one English-language daily and one Rajshahi daily.
 The Government also owns BSS, the national news service. Two
 wire services, Eastern News Agency and the United News of
 Bangladesh, are privately owned.
 Bangladesh has 74 dailies and 290 weeklies and periodicals.
 Three of the Dhaka English-language dailies and most
 Bengali-language periodicals and newspapers are privately
 owned and reflect the views of various political parties. All
 major newspapers report on both government and opposition
 activities, although coverage of the opposition is less
 extensive in the government-owned publications. Articles and
 editorials critical of the Government appear, but criticism of
 President Ershad, his family, or the armed forces is not
 tolerated. The weekly Robbar, banned in June 1988 for
 printing commentary critical of the President, remained closed
 in 1989, and hearings on a legal challenge filed by Robbar's
 publisher were repeatedly postponed.
 
 
 1352
 BANGLADESH
 Three journalists were detained in 1989. The editor of the
 Bengali-language daily Shakti was arrested in June for
 publishing an "objectionable report." He was released on bail
 the following day. The chairman of Purabi and the editor of
 Runner, two Jessore dailies, were arrested and held for 3 days
 in September for publishing a "defamatory report" on the State
 Minister for Religious Affairs.
 Opposition political parties also exert pressure on newspapers
 and magazines hostile to them in efforts to intimidate them.
 Tactics include anonymous threatening telephone calls and
 threats of arson.
 Although 56 foreign publications (18 dailies and 38
 periodicals) are generally available in Bangladesh, the
 Government has sometimes used the Customs Act of 1969 to
 prevent the importation of foreign publications critical of
 President Ershad. The Government invoked the Act in 1989 to
 -ban one issue of the London-based weekly Natun Din for
 printing an "undesirable" article. The Government also banned
 the book "The Satanic Verses" and issues of foreign
 publications dealing with the controversy for a few weeks. No
 foreign journalists were arrested, barred from entry, or
 expelled in 1989. In June, foreign journalists were invited
 to'cover the CHT district council elections under government
 escort.
 The Government retains the authority to require drama groups
 to obtain certificates of approval to perform. No drama group
 in Dhaka bothers to apply for such authorization in practice,
 but the law is enforced outside the capital. Drama groups are
 required to submit scripts to the district commissioner, and
 actors who perform in unauthorized plays are theoretically
 subject to arrest.
 The Government censors films primarily to ban pornography.
 All films from South Africa and Israel are prohibited.
 Students are generally free to express a wide range of
 political opinion through campus organizations and
 publications, and opposition parties sometimes use student
 fronts to organize antigovernment demonstrations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution assures every citizen the right to form
 associations, subject to "reasonable restrictions" in the
 interest of morality or public order. In practice,
 individuals are free to join private organizations and
 associations, and permits are usually not required for public
 meetings. There are no restrictions on affiliation with
 international organizations.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Bangladesh, 87 percent of whose people are Muslims, has
 recognized Islam as its state religion since the passage in
 June 1988 of the Eighth Constitutional Amendment. This
 amendment also states that all other religions may be freely
 practiced. Although conversion is possible, there is strong
 social resistance to conversion from Islam. Members of
 religious minorities have also reported being questioned by
 
 
 1353
 BANGLADESH
 the security service about conversion activity. Proselytizing
 by Bangladeshi citizens, which is permitted by the
 Constitution, is mostly directed toward such minority groups
 as Hindus and tribal people.
 Government policy continues to permit various religions to
 establish places of worship, train clergy, travel for
 religious purposes, and maintain links with coreligionists
 abroad. Missionaries, including foreign clergy who serve
 expatriate congregations, are permitted but they may not
 proselytize Muslims. Some missionaries perceive the various
 bureaucratic obstacles they face, including lengthy delays in
 obtaining or renewing security clearances and residence visas,
 as intended to curb Christian influence by reducing the number
 of missionaries and limiting their humanitarian activities.
 Appeals to the Government have sometimes been successful in
 removing such obstacles.
 Despite official assurances of freedom of religion and
 equality of treatment, the establishment of Islam as the state
 religion continued to cause concern in 1989 among the Hindu,
 Christian, and Buddhist minorities. Some minority group
 members complain that this constitutional change has
 emboldened Muslim fanatics and criminal elements hostile to
 the minorities. As in 1988, there were reports of harassment,
 robbery, vandalism, and encroachment on property owned by
 non-Muslims.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bangladeshi citizens are free to move about within the
 country, except in designated areas of the CHT. Travel by
 foreigners is also restricted in the CHT and some other border
 areas. Bangladeshis are generally free to visit and emigrate
 abroad, subject to foreign exchange controls, but civil
 servants wishing to travel abroad must obtain permission from
 the Government. In some instances, persons considered to be
 security risks are barred from traveling abroad. One former
 minister was barred twice from leaving the country. Though
 the Government rarely hinders citizens wishing to return from
 abroad, in 1989 a Bangladeshi student was detained upon
 arrival in Dhaka from London, reportedly on the grounds that
 he had engaged in "anti-Bangladeshi activities." The right of
 repatriation is observed.
 Approximately 250,000 non-Bengali Muslims, known as Biharis or
 "stranded Pakistanis," remain in Bangladesh pending
 resettlement in Pakistan. After independence in 1971, these
 persons opted for Pakistani citizenship and Pakistan agreed to
 accept them, provided financing for resettlement costs was
 made available from outside sources. A Saudi Arabia-based
 social organization has been trying for several years to raise
 money for this purpose and claims that sufficient funds could
 be found if permission was granted for the Biharis to
 resettle. The main obstacle to resettlement is communal
 tensions and recurrent violence between Biharis already in
 Pakistah and other ethnic groups, which makes the addition of
 250,000 more Biharis a politically difficult issue for the
 Government of Pakistan at this time. Anti-Bihari
 demonstrations in Pakistan delayed indefinitely a modest
 repatriation effort by the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) planned for January. This contributed to
 increased frustration in the Bihari community and prompted a
 
 
 1354
 BANGLADESH
 hunger strike and other demonstrations during the summer
 months.
 The Biharis, most of whom still-reside in 66 camps throughout
 Bangladesh, may seek employment and conduct other activities,
 but they face disadvantages as noncitizens. Biharis may apply
 for Bangladeshi citizenship at any time, and those who do so
 are granted full rights of citizenship.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The governing party's dominance of the electoral process and
 the fraud and violence which have characterized national
 elections in recent years raise serious doubts about the
 ability of Bangladeshi citizens to change their government
 peacefully and democratically. In addition, the political
 polarization between the Government and the opposition and
 internal divisions within the opposition continued to prevent
 agreement on the holding of parliamentary elections.
 After assuming power in a bloodless military coup in 1982,
 Bangladesh's current leader, H.M. Ershad, assumed the
 presidency in December 1983. He was elected to the presidency
 in an election in 1986 which the major opposition groupings,
 including the Awami League/Eight Party Alliance, the
 Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and the Islamic fundamentalist
 Jamaat-E-Islami, boycotted.
 Bangladesh's present Parliament was elected in March 1988
 elections that were marred by a boycott by major opposition
 parties, sporadic violence, low voter turnout, and voting
 fraud. The Parliament passed most legislation by wide margins
 and with little-debate.
 The Constitution does not require new parliamentary elections
 before 1993. The Government has publicly stated its
 willingness to hold midterm parliamentary elections, but the
 major opposition parties have thus far refused to participate
 as long-as President Ershad remains in power. The Government
 has met with human rights activists to discuss ways to hold
 free and fair elections; however, human rights observers,
 while welcoming such meetings as a positive step, remain
 doubtful of the Government's sincerity about ensuring the
 holding of such elections. In September the Government began
 updating its 1983 electoral rolls.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to international opinion regarding
 human rights issues. Although there were no visits to
 Bangladesh in 1989 by AI or similar groups, the Government
 made efforts to respond to outside inquiries by submitting
 reports to AI on its investigation into several allegations of
 mistreatment dating from 1986. The Government also shared
 with Al its findings on the settler reprisals which took place
 in Langdu in the CHT in May (described in Section l.g.). In
 addition, the Government invited and provided facilities for
 members of the diplomatic community and foreign press who
 observed the CHT local government council elections in June.
 International human rights organizations represented in
 Bangladesh include the International League for Human Rights,
 The Law Association for Asia and the Western Pacific, and The
 
 
 1355
 BANGLADESH[
 International Commission of Jurists. There are also a number
 of local human rights organizations which monitor developments
 through their rural branches, investigate allegations of
 abuse, and seek to prosecute human rights violators. Human
 rights groups are also active in promoting awareness of human
 rights and the law among the country's largely uneducated
 rural majority. The Government generally does not hamper
 these groups' activities.
 Bangladesh is an active member of the U.N. Commission on Human
 Rights. In August the U.N. Subcommission on Prevention of
 Discrimination and Protection of Minorities dropped all cases
 against Bangladesh regarding alleged human rights abuses in
 the CHT and decided unanimously to "thank the Government of
 Bangladesh for its cooperation and express its satisfaction
 with the progress made in respect to the treatment of its
 tribal population."
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 By custom and Islamic tradition, women occupy a subordinate
 place in society and a family's ability to seclude its women
 is a symbol of middle or high social status. These underlying
 attitudes and social barriers circumscribing the participation
 of women in activities beyond the home are strongly entrenched
 and show few signs of weakening. For the approximately 86
 percent of Bangladeshi women who live in rural areas, early
 marriage, high childbearing rates, and long hours of household
 and farm labor leave little opportunity for nonfamily
 interests or outside employment. Even in urban areas and
 among the affluent, the traditional social system makes women
 economically dependent upon their husbands and other male
 relatives. Except in the export-oriented garment industry,
 women are virtually absent from the cash-earning work force.
 The daily press testifies to a pattern of domestic violence
 against women: murder, rape and other physical abuse, breach
 of matrimonial contract, denial of inheritance rights, and
 desertion. The suicide rate among women is reportedly almost
 three times higher than among men. Laws to protect women
 include the Anti-Dowry Prohibition Act of 1980; the Cruelty to
 Women Act of 1983; the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1984;
 and the Illegal Trafficking of Women Act of 1988, but
 enforcement of these laws is lax. It is a capital offense to
 traffic in women, to kill a woman in the course of rape, or to
 murder a woman for dowry. Even so, dowry killings, in which
 the husband or his family attack and sometimes murder the
 bride for nonpayment of a supposedly promised dowry, are
 believed to occur frequently in rural areas. Although
 newspapers frequently print reports in which a husband accused
 of dowry killing is tried and punished, the vast majority of
 these cases are believed to go unreported.' The recently
 created National Advisory Committee Against Repression of
 Women plans to set up local branches in rural areas to address
 the problems of abused women, but there is still little
 recourse for victims of crimes committed within the family or
 home.
 Members of minority religious groups are disadvantaged in
 practice, though not in the law, in their access to government
 jobs and political office. In the years immediately following
 Bangladesh's independence, members of some minorities,
 principally Hindus, lost or had serious difficulty retaining
 their properties as a result of the prejudicial administration
 
 
 1356
 BANGLADESH
 of vested property laws. These laws permitted the Government
 to use or even sell property belonging to persons who left
 what is now Bangladesh between 1965 and 1971. Although the
 President in July reiterated a 1984 executive order requiring
 the return -of such property to the original owners, some human
 xights activists contend that property is still occasionally
 seized under these laws.
 Discrimination against the tribal people in the CHT with
 -respect to property-rights has been a persistent issue. Until
 1985, tribal land, for which there is frequently no deed, was
 parceled out by authorities to Bengali Muslim settlers in the
 CHT. Tribal peoples' property rights were also violated by
 the issuance of false deeds, physical attacks, actions taken
 follbwing the failure to meet mortgage payments, or
 confiscation by the army in areas where the tribal insurgency
 is active. There were no reports of such violations in 1989,
 and the Government's CHT local government councils
 legislation, which grants land allocation and regulation
 authority to elected, tribal-dominated district councils,
 affirmed the tribals' land rights. The legislation also gives
 the councils authority over local law enforcement, housing,
 health, and educational facilities. Even so, concern over
 these issues lingers among many of the hill people.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of association,
 subject to restrictions imposed by law. The Constitution also
 provides for the right to form labor unions, subject to
 governmental approval. Although the Government has the legal
 right to suspend unions, it took no such action in 1989.
 Workers in trade associations or unions may draw up their own
 constitution and rules, elect officers, develop programs, and
 conduct business without government interference. There are
 no restrictions on joining confederations or affiliating with
 international organizations. However, union members need
 governmental clearance to travel to international labor
 meetings. No such clearances were withheld in 1989.
 The right to strike is not specifically recognized in the law
 but is an accepted form of protest in-Bangladesh. Numerous
 strikes were held in 1989. The Essential Services Ordinance
 of 1958 permits the Government to bar strikes for 3 months in
 any sector deemed "essential." Labor unions represent only 3
 percent of the work force, a reflection of the low level of
 industrialization. Nevertheless, unions are powerful and
 important in such sectors as jute, tea, and transportation.
 There are several national labor centrals in Bangladesh. Most
 labor -unions and federations are associated with a political
 party. The Workers-Employees United Council (SKOP), the
 largest trade union federation, is sympathetic to the
 opposition.
 The Committee of Experts (COE) of the International Labor
 Organization in 1989 noted that Bangladesh's law contains a
 number of defects affecting freedom of association and
 collective bargaining rights, including restrictions as to the
 range of persons who can hold office in trade unions,
 wide-ranging supervisory powers vested in the registrar of
 trade unions, and a rule requiring that a union organize at
 
 
 1357
 BANGLADESH
 least 30 percent of the workers in an establishment before it
 can be registered.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 By law, workers have a limited right to collective
 bargaining. Public sector employees cannot form unions or
 bargain collectively. There is no formal process of
 mediation. Except in the Chittagong Export Processing Zone,
 unions in the private sector can generally bargain
 collectively without government interference. The Government
 suspended union activity in the Chittagong Export Processing
 Zone in 1985 and the suspension remains in effect.
 Workers have participatory rights in union business in theory,
 but both union leaders and employers often violate them in
 practice. Union leaders allegedly make decisions without
 first consulting members, and allegations have been lodged of
 irregularities in union elections. For their part, employers
 frequently ignore laws prohibiting antiunion discrimination, a
 practice which is particularly prevalent in the garment
 industry, where the work force is predominantly female.
 Employers have also been accused of harassing union leaders
 and of firing workers for union activities. Although laws
 against such practices exist, the difficulties of prosecuting
 a court case against an employer discourage union attempts to
 have them enforced.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor.
 Although this prohibition is substantially respected, there
 have been unsubstantiated reports of bonded labor on some tea
 and rubber plantations. The Government actively seeks to
 prevent the trafficking of bonded laborers into other South
 Asian countries.
 The COE in 1989 requested the Government to repeal a law of
 1952 (which the Government said was no longer operable) making
 it a punishable offense for a government employee to terminate
 employment without the consent of the employer. The COE also
 asked the Government to correct a law dealing with the
 forcible conveyance of seamen on board ship to perform their
 duties.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Employment of Children Act prohibits the offering of
 employment to any person under the age of 14, but the act is
 not enforced. Sanctioned by tradition and encouraged by dire
 economic necessity, child labor is a serious problem. Legal
 minimum ages for various types of employment, which range from
 12 to 17, are seldom enforced, and the country's poverty is
 such that children are regularly engaged in all available
 jobs. 'There is no compulsory education. The Bureau of Labor
 Statistics estimated the number of child laborers at
 approximately 3 million in 1986. These children pedaled
 rickshaws, served as domestic servants, worked as helpers in
 transport services, carried loads at railway stations and
 river terminals, labored at construction sites, and were
 employed in great numbers in agriculture.

 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Regulations regarding minimum wage rates, hours of work, and
 occupational safety and health'are not strictly enforced.
 Income levels, which average $1 to $2 per day with the minimum
 wage at approximately $.07 per hour, are not sufficient to
 -sustain- decent standard of living. The Factories Act of
 1965 and the Shops and Establishments Act of 1965 limit normal
 working hours to a maximum of 8 hours per day and 48 hours per
 week. With overtime, the workweek may not legally exceed 60
 hours. Although the law stipulates that overtime work is to
 be compensated by double the hourly rate, overtime pay
 practices do not conform to these requirements. Safety
 equipment and precautions are largely unknown, and the small
 number of safety inspectors-are frequently untrained and
 underpaid.
