 SERJTREA
 Eritren became an independent state in 1993, following an internationally mon-
 itored referendum in which citizens voted overwhelmingly for independence from
 Ethiopia. The Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), which led the 30-year war
 for independence, has controlled the country since it defeated Ethiopian armed
 forces in 1991; its leader, Isaias Afwerki, serves as President. The People's Front
 for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), the core of the former EPLF, which split off from
 the Government in 1994 is the sole political party. The Government did not fulfill
 its stated program to hold elections mn 1997; elections are planned for 1998. How-
 ever, there was some progress in democratization. In 1994 the National Assembly,
 partially appointed by the PFDJ leadership and partially elected, created a 50-mem-
 a Nion      Constitutional Commission to draft a constitution After a broad proc-
 ess of consultation and civic education, the Constitution was ratified by a constitu-
 ent assembly elected from newly elected local assemblies on May 24. It provides for
 democratic freedoms, but public understanding of its implications remains limited.
 The judiciary remains independent but weak.
 The police are generally responsible for maintainig internal security, although
 the Governent may call on the 40,000-member armedforces, the reserves, and d-
 mobilized soldiers in times of internal disorder. The army is responsible for external
 and border security. Since 1993 the army has been forced to deal with the Eritrean
 Islamic Jihad (EI ), a small, Sudan-based insurgent group that has mounted terror-
 ist attacks in northern and western Eritrea. Increased Ei activity, coupled with a
 buildup of Sudanese forces along the Western border, led the Government to in-
 crease security and deploy much the army to the West. Some members of the secu-
 rity forces committed human rights abuses.      k
 Eritrea began a transition from a deteriorating centrally planned economy to a
 free-market economy through the privatization of formerly state-owned enterprises
 and the liberalization of investment and trade. While trade, services, and manufac-
 turing provide the greatest portion of gross domestic product, the rural economy is
 largely based on subsistence agriculture, with more than 70 percent of the popu-
 lation of 3.6 million involved in farming and herding. The small industrial sector
 consists mainly of light industries, many using outmoded technologies. International
 economic assistance has accounted for a significant portion of external revenues,
 with loans replacing grants. The country is extremely poor, with an average annual
 per capita income of less than $238.
 The Government generally respected the rights of its citizens in some areas, but
 serious problems remain. Citizens do not have the right to change their government,
 which is dominated by the PFDJ. Although a constituent assembly ratified a new
 constitution, the Government did not fulfill its stated program for a transition to
 democracy by 1997. The Government does not permit-prison visits and arbitrary ar-
 
 
 106
 rest and detention is a problem. An unknown number of persons suspected of asso-
 ciation with the Ethiopian Mengistu regime, radical Islamic elements, or terrorist
 organizations remain in detention. The undeveloped judicial system limits the provi-
 sion of speedy trials, and the use of military courts limits due process. The Govern-
 ment restricts press reeedom, including the rights of the religious media, and limits
 freedom of association. The Government restricts religious freedom and freedom of
 movement. There are no domestic or international human rights organizations. Soci-
 etal discrimination against women is a problem, and female genital mutilation
 (FGM) remains widespread.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punshment.-
 The Ethiopian Penal Code, as modified by the transitional Penal Code of Eritrea,
 prohibits torture, and there were no reports that the authorities employed it.
 Prison conditions are Spartan. The Government does not permit prisoners to cor-
 respond with family and friends and restricts visitation privileges. There were no
 confirmed reports that prisoners were beaten or that any prisoner died due to lack
 of proper medical care; however, there were persistent unconfirmed reports of mis-
 treatment of persons in detention
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of conditions in deten-
 tion facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.--The Penal Code stipulates that detainees
 may be held for a maximum of 30 days without being charged with a crime. In prac-
 tice the authorities sometimes hold persons suspected of crimes for much longer pe-
 rods. In 1995, on the second anniversary of independence, the Government par-
 doned and released 91 detainees who had been held for upto 4years for collabora-
 tion with the Mengistu regime. An unknown number of ad ion  susected collabo-
 rators remain in detention without charge, despite a statement by President Isaias
 later in 1995 that their cases would be considered soon. An unspecified number of
 persons associated with radical Islamic elements or suspected terrorist organiza-
 tions also remained in detention without char e. There were unconfirmed reports
 that the Government arbitrarily holds severls Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF)
 members. Military authorities sometimes arbitrarily arrest and detain former com-
 batants who violate the military's unwritten code of conduct (see Section i.e.).
 The Government detained a journalist in March for inaccurate reporting, and con-
 tinued to hold her indefinitely without trial at year's end (see Section 2.a.).
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent but weak, although
 there were no known incidents of executive interference in the judicial process dur-
 in g the year.
 The judiciary consists of lower courts and an Appellate Court. The undeveloped
 judicial system suffers from a lack of trained personnel, adequate funding, and in-
 frastructure that in practice limits the State's ability to grant accused persons a
 speedy trial. At independence the Government chose to retain the Ethiopian legal
 system. Under this Code, aimple crimes are brought to the lower court and are
 heard by a single judge. Serious crimes are tried publicly by a panel of three judges,
 and defendants have access to legal counsel, usually at their own expense.
 Although there is no formal public defender's office, the Government has success-
 fully requested that attorneys work without fee to represent defendants accused of
 serious crimes who are undble to afford legal counsel. Defendants may appeal ver-
 dicts to the Appellate Couro, which is composed of a president and five judges.
 As a result of the lack c f legally trained personnel, the Ministry of Justice was
 unable to process a large baolume of civilian corruption cases, which were bandied
 by the Ministry of Defensel In 1997 the Eritrean Press reported that 2,431 civilians
 had been tried by special military courts. Approximately half were fined and impris-
 oned, while 360 were found not guilty. In military courts there ar usually no de-
 fense lawyers and no right of appeal. The continued handling of civilian cases by
 military courts ralses problems of due process.
 Since the population is largely rural, most citizens only have contact with the
 legal system through traditional courts. Village judges, appointed by a panel of gov-
 enmient magistrates, provide justice in civil matters. Criminal cases are transferred
 to magistrates versed in criminal law. Many local issues-for example, property dis-
 putes and most petty crimes-are adjudicated by local elders according to customs
 
 
 107
 or, in the case of Muslims, Shari'a law. The traditional courts cannot impose sen-
 tences that involve physical punishment.
 Crimes allegedly committed by members of the military forces are handled by
 military courts. Senior former fighters are often held to a stringent unwritten code
 of conduct, and violations of this code are handled within the governing circle out-
 side the normal judicial process. Some former fighters accused of violating this circle
 of trust have been arrest and held without formal charge. Senior government offi-
 cials are summarily relieved of their duties if they in any way overstep their role
 or make mistakes.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the law, warrants are required before the Government can monitor mail, telephones,
 or other means of private communication. Warrants also are required in routine
 searches and seizures, except in cases where authorities believe individuals may at-
 tempt to escape or destroy evidence. There is no evidence that the Government mon-
 itors or has monitored private mail or telephone service. The Government has not
 yet allowed access to the Internet through the telecommunications system. The Gov-
 ernment may ban the import of any foreign publications (see Section 2.a.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press- however, individuals must be cautious in stating their views in
 public since the Ministry of Internal Affairs detained one person whose remarks it
 considered inappropriate. The June arrest of an Eritrean-American citizen for re-
 marks allegedly made while in the United States underscored the authority of the
 Ministry to arrest people based on suspicion.
 The Government controls all media, which include three newspapers, one radio
 station, and one television station. The Government may ban the import of any for-
 eign publication, and the press proclamation forbids the local reprinting of articles
 from banned publications. The Government continued to restrict the rights of the
 religious media to comment on politics or government policies. In theory nonreli-
 gious print media are free to criticize the Government. Nonetheless, criticism tends
 to be limited and fairly mild. Although there is no formal censorship body, the
 media practice self-censorship. The arrest and detention without trial in March of
 an Agence France Presse correspondent and a PFDJ member in March for falsely
 reporting remarks made by President Isaias raised further doubts about press free-
 dom. The open-ended jail sentence the reporter received without a trial denied her
 due process.
 The Government's press proclamation allows for individuals to publish news-
 papers, and *rivate newspapers and magazines began to publish toward the end of
 the year. It oes not allow or private ownership o any broadcast media or foreign
 ownership of any media. The proclamation requires that all newspapers obtain ali-
 cense from the Ministry of Information before publication and that all reporters reg-
 ister with the Ministry. The Government may also punish "whosoever insults,
 abuses, defames, or slanders the Government or one of the constituted legislative,
 executive, or judicial authorities," and forbids the publication of any matter that
 contravenes general morality. This authority has hindered the development of print
 or broadcast media critical of the Government.
 Academic freedom is respected at the one institution of higher education, the Uni-
 versity of Asmara.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government requires a
 permit from the Ministry of Internal Affairs for a public meeting or demonstration.
 In general permits are granted freely for nonpolitical meetings or gatherings, and
 although no political demonstrations have occurred, there were no reports that per-
 mits for political demonstrations were denied.
 The Constitution states that every citizen shall have the right to form organiza-
 tions for political, social, economic, and cultural ends. However, the PFDJ has stated
 its opposition to the formation of any religiously or ethnically based parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom of reli-
 gion, the Government has banned religious organizations from involvement in poli-
 tics. The Government has discouraged foreign religious groups and NGO's from
 proselytizing, as it believes this could create unnecessary friction in the delicate bal-
 ance between the Muslim and Christian populations. In a 1995 proclamation, it de-
 scribed specific guidelines on the role of religion and religion-affiliated NGO's in de-
 velopment and government, stating that development, politics, and public adminis-
 tration are the sole responsibility of the Government and people. As a result, reli-
 gious organizations may fund, but not initiate or implement, development projects.
 The proclamation also sets out rules governing relations between religious organiza-
 tions and foreign sponsors.
 
 
 108
 The Constitution provides for the "freedom to practice any religion and to mani-
 fest such practice." However, government persecution of the small community of Je-
 hovah's Witnesses continued. In 1994 the Government revoked the trading licenses
 of Jehovah's Witnesses and dismissed those who worked in the civil service. This
 governmental action resulted in economic, employment, and travel difficulties for Je-
 hovah's Witnesses, especially former civil servants and businessmen. In addition, in
 April, the government labor office issued a form to all employers in Asmara and the
 surrounding area requesting information on any personnel who were Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses.
 Jehovah's Witnesses have refused universally on religious grounds to participate
 in national service or vote in a referendum. This spurred widespread criticism that
 the members were collectively shirking their civic duty. The harsh measures for re-
 fusal to participate in national service were applied only to Jehovah's Witnesses. In
 addition to the Government's continued denial of passports, Jehovah's Witnesses are
 also denied identification cards, trading licenses, and government housing. However,
 they are not barred from meeting in private homes.
 Authorities closed a foreign-based NGO associated with an evangelical church be-
 cause, according to the Government, its proselytizing activities in a Muslim district
 could have caused religious friction. The Government restricts the rights of the reli-
 gious media to comment on politics or government policies (see Section 2.a.).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides fully for the rights of movement and emigra-
 tion. In general citizens may live where they choose and travel freely throughout
 the country. Some areas are restricted for security reasons, however. In particular,
 clashes between government forces and Eritrean Islamic Jihad members have led
 the Government to restrict travel along much of the border with Sudan. Some areas
 remain heavily mined, a legacy of the war for independence, and occasionally new
 mines are set by the EIJ, leading to additional travel restrictions.
 Citizens are largely free to travel outside the country, although Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses, former ruling party members, those who have not completed national serv-
 ice, and intending emigrants have been denied passports or exit visas and can only
 leave the country by traveling overland to Ethiopia. In general citizens have the
 right to return. Instances in which citizens living abroad have run afoul of the law,
 contracted a serious contagious disease, or been declared ineligible for political asy-
 lum by other governments are considered on a case-by-case basis.
 The Government cooperates with the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The
 Government provides first asylum and provided it to Sudanese refugees from the
 conflict in Sudan during the year. The Eritrean Relief and Refugee Commission, a
 government agency, is the principal organization for refugee issues.
 A pilot refugee return program resulted in the repatriation of 25,000 refugees
 from Sudan in 1995. However, a further 100,000 of the estimated 150,000 to 300,000
 Eritrean refugees remaining in Sudan were not repatriated under a program spon-
 sored by the UNHCR because of the failure of the governments of Eritrea and
 Sudan to conclude an agreement on the modalities of such a repatriation. All
 UNHCR foreign staff members were expelled from Eritrea in May because of activi-
 ties that the Government alleged were inconsistent with the UNCR mandate.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the Constitution provides this right, citizens have not been able to
 change their government in multiparty elections since 1991. Credible reports sug-
 pest that authority within the Government is very narrowly held. The Government
 is dominated by the PFDJ. The PFDJ did not fulfill the ambitious program that it
 had outlined for transition to a democratically elected government by 1997. Its lead-
 ership stated that public education and institutional structures were needed before
 multiparty democracy would be established.
 In an effort to encourage broader participation by women in politics, the PFDJ
 named 3 women to the Party's executive council and 12 women to the central com-
 mittee. Women participated in the Constitutional Commission, are represented in
 local assemblies, and hold senior government positions, including the position of
 Minister of Justice.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Internal Affairs are jointly
 responsible for handling human rights inquiries. All NGO's also must register with
 the Eritrean Relief and Refugee Commission. There are no domestic or international
 
 
 109
 human rights organizations. In April the Government proclaimed a policy to restrict
 NGO's to supporting the Government in the sectors of health and education. The
 Government reported no applications or registrations of human rights NGO's during
 the year. It expelled all UNHCR foreign staff members from the country in May (see
 Section 2.d.).
 In 1995 the Government proclaimed that religious organizations, including reli-
 gious-based NGO's, could not engage in development activities. The Government
 also removed religious-based indigenous NGO's completely from relief work in order
 to prevent the development of church-based organizations receiving money from
 abroad. It closed one religious NGO.
 A governmental proclamation issued in May 1996 required that all private NGO's
 hire those who have completed their national service. This proclamation was part
 of the Government's effort to establish a national service program as a legal obliga-
 tion of all citizens regardless of their religious beliefs.
 All foreign staff members of NGO's (or of any nondiplomatic organization) who
 live and work in the country for more than 183 days must pay the highest income
 tax rate, 38 percent of their salaries and allowances. This tax situation has encour-
 aged the departure of NGO's; most NGO's left at the Government's request.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The transitional civil code prohibits discrimination against women, children, and
 people with disabilities, and the Government generally enforces it.
 Women.-The Government has publicly taken a firm stand against domestic vio-
 lence; health, police, and judicial authorities report that no serious domestic violence
 problem exists.
 The Government consistently advocated improving the status of women, many of
 whom played a significant role as fighters in the struggle for independence. Since
 women have enjoyed the rights to equal educational opportunities, equal pay for
 equal work, andlegal sanctions against domestic violence. In 1994 the Third Party
 Congress advocated more rigts for women, including parity in the right to the use
 of land and other property, However, much of society remains traditional and patri-
 archal, and most women have an inferior status to men in their homes and commu-
 nities. The law provides a framework for improving the status of women, but laws
 are unevenly implemented, because of both a lack of capacity in the legal system
 and ingrained cultural attitudes. In practice, males retain privileged access to edu-
 cation, employment, and control of economic resources, with more disparities in
 rural areas than in cities.
 The law requires that of ages 18 to 40 participate in the national service program.
 Children.-The Ministry of Labor and Human Welfare is responsible for govern-
 ment policies onerning the rights and welfaire of children. The Government in
 1996 reorganized and created under the Ministry of Labor and Human Welfare a
 department that includes the Children's Affairs Division. The Children's Affairs di-
 vision covers child care, counseling, and probation. Due to a shortage of schools and
 teachers, half the country's children are unable to attend school.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is practiced extensively
 on girs at an early age. The Government, through the Ministry of Health and the
 National Union of Eritrean Women, discourages this practice.
 People With Disabilities.-The long war for independence left thousands of men
 and women physically disabled from injuries they received as guerrillas and as civil-
 ian victims. The Government spends a large share of its financial resources to sup-
 port and train these war disabled, who are regarded as heroes, and does not dis-
 criminate against them in training, education, or employment. There are no laws
 mandating access for the disabled to public thoroughfares or public or private build-
 ings.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-There are no government restrictions regarding the
 formation of unions, including in the military forces, the police, and other essential
 services. Labor association is encouraged by the Government, which promulgated
 Proclamation 8 in 1991 providing workers with the legal right to form unions and
 to strike to protect their interests. The Government continued to rewrite the Labor
 Code. The National Confederation of Eritrean Workers, which was part of the EPLF
 during the war, is independent of both the Government and the PFDJ. It represents
 over 20,000 workers from 129 unions and receives some funding the International
 Labor Organization (ILO), the AFL-CIO, and European unions. The largest union
 is the Textile, Leather, and Shoe Federation.
 
 
 There were no strikes reported in 1997.
 Unions may affiliate internationally, but none has attempted to do so.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Eritrea is a member of the
 ILO, which provided assistance in 1993 to prepare the draft labor code, which pro-
 hibits antiunion discrimination by employers and establishes a mechanism for re-
 solving complaints of discrimination. The Government has indicated its intention to
 ratily several key IO conventions on labor-freedom of association, the right to
 barain, a labor administration system, and prohibition against child labor-but
 stifhas not done so. The Ministry of Labor and Human Welfare indicated that rati-
 fication of the conventions may not occur for some time. Wages are determined by
 the market.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no law prohibiting forced
 or compulsory labor, but it is not known to occur. All citizens between 18 and 40
 are required to participate in the national service program, which includes military
 training as well as civic action programs. High school students are also required to
 participate in a summer work program, for which they are paid.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 does not prohibit forced or bonded labor, including that performed by children, but
 there were no reports that it occurred (see Section 6.c.).The legal minimum age for
 employment is 18 years, although apprentices may be hired at age 16. While the
 Ministry of Labor and Human Welfare is responsible for enforcement of laws per-
 taining to employment of children, there is no inspecion system in place to monitor
 compliance. The Government has not ratified the ILO Convention on the Prohibition
 of Chld Labor. According to labor officials, 50 percent of chldren are not able to
 attend school due to a shortage of schools and teachers. Rural children who do not
 attend classes often work on their family farms, while in urban areas, some children
 are street vendors of cigarettes, newspapers, or chewing gum.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are two systems regulating employment
 conditions, the civil service system, and the labor law system There is no legally
 mandated minimum wage in the private sector. In the civil service sector wages
 vary from $40 to $473 (250 to 3000 birr) per month, with factory workers (in govern-
 ment-owned enterprises) earning the highest wages. The minimum wage does not
 provide the average worker and family with a decent standard of living.
 The standard workweek is 48 hours, but many people work fewer hours. There
 is no legal provision for a day of rest, but most workers are allowed 1 to 1 /2 days
 off per week. The Government has instituted occupational health and safety stand-
 ards, but inspection and enforcement vary widely among factories. The draft labor
 law includes a number of provisions concerning women, including one that states
 that women during pregnancy shall not be assigned to jobs that could endanger
 their lives or the lives of their unborn children. Workers are permitted to remove
 themselves from dangerous work sites without retaliation.
