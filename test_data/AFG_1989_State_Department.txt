 AFGHAN.ISTAN*
 The Peoples' Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) came to
 power in a coup in 1978 and imposed a totalitarian system
 backed by a Soviet invasion in 1979. Since its establishment,
 the regime has faced continuous armed opposition--supported by
 a large portion of the population. Unable to subdue the
 resistance of tens of thousands of armed "mujahidin" fighters,
 the Soviet Government began a 9-month troop withdrawal which
 was completed on February 15, 1989. The regime's control has
 been'reducad to Kabul and other population centers, garrisens
 to protect them, and some lines of communication if the regime
 uses sufficient military force to protect them. While the
 regime has been able to stave off a final victory by mujahidin
 troops, it has been unable to expand its area of control. In
 February the regime declared a state of emergency and put
 political power in the hands of a 20-member Supreme Military
 Council for the Defense of the Homeland. Fighting between
 regime and resistance forces continued throughout 1989.
 During its war of occupation, the Soviet Union employed
 massive air and artillery bombardments and emplaced millions
 of mines. The fighting generated over 5 million refugees,
 one-third of Afghanistan's prewar population. International
 observers estimate that over 1 million Afghans have died as a
 direct consequence of the war.
 For its part, the resistance has sought to attain a greater
 degree of political unity and offer an alternate form of
 government while continuing its efforts to oust the Kabul
 regime. Disunity among resistance groups, however, has
 contributed to the regime's ability to survive. In February
 1989, representatives of the major resistance parties formed
 the Afghan Interim Government (AIG) to oversee a transfer of
 power. Since its establishment, the AIG has been organizing
 its ministries and seeking to broaden its support, although by
 year's end much work remained to be done.
 Internal security functions in regime-controlled areas are
 performed primarily by the secret police under the Ministry of
 State Security (WAD). More than 25,000 Afghans are thought to
 work for the Ministry, with Soviet security advisers.
 The Afghan economy is basically agricultural, with land tenure
 in the hands of individuals or family/tribal groups. An
 entrepreneurial/trading class and some small scale
 manufacturing exist. Continued fighting through 1989 added to
 the already tremendous dislocation suffered by the economy in
 the war. As a result of war damage, as well as abandonment
 and neglect, the economic infrastructure will require years to
 recover.
 There was little change in the human rights situation in
 1989. On the one hand, the regime allowed a political group,
 the National Salvation Society, to form, and published a list,
 with profound apologies, of the names of 11,000 people
 executed during the first 20 months following the coup in
 *Since the American Embassy in Kabul was closed for security
 reasons in January 1989, the United States has no official
 observers in Afghanistan. This report therefore draws to a
 large extent on unofficial sources.

 1978. On the other hand, the February state of emergency
 limited still further freedom of expression and public
 assembly and the right to privacy. Virtually all of the
 categories of human rights discussed in this report are denied
 outright or are severely restricted. The U.N.'s Special
 Rapporteur, in his report issued on October 30, 1989, sets the
 number of political prisoners at 3,000, with the conditions of
 prisoners awaiting trial or verdict described as deplorable.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Arbitrary killing and other acts of violence against suspected.
 opponents of the Kabul regime were commonplace. Executions
 continued in Afghan prisons, often following summary trial and
 conviction--sometimes for political offenses--by special
 courts. Reportedly, regime forces and some mujahidin groups
 have executed prisoners in the field. The fierce fighting
 early in the year around the city of Jalalabad involved
 reported mujahidin executions of regime troops who had
 surrendered.
 There have also been murders of Afghans both inside and
 outside Afghanistan which have been ascribed to mujahidin
 groups as well as to WAD agents.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances continued in areas under regime control. This
 is frequently the result of the impressment into military
 service of males as young as13 years old. Some persons also
 disappear as a result of the action of mujahidin, who have
 been reported to have abducted or captured regime military and
 civilian cadre and suspected regime collaborators.
 In its October report, Asia Watch cites five cases of
 disappearances of intellectuals and alleges that throughout
 the conflict the distribution of arms and aid has been an
 important factor in the conflict among resistance groups and
 that aid workers and intellectuals have been a frequent target
 of attack.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Regime authorities frequently use torture to punish or to
 extract information or confessions. The practice is
 sufficiently widespread to indicate that it has official
 sanction. Torture techniques include both physical and
 psychological abuse; the use of electric shock to sensitive
 areas of the body, immersion in water, and beatings are common
 forms of abuse reported by victims and witnesses. Threats of
 abuse against family members and prolonged sleep deprivation
 are typical forms of psychological torture. Some reports
 describe cases of mental disturbances induced by torture in
 regime prisons.
 In its 1989 Report, covering 1988, Amnesty International (AI)
 noted that it had continued to receive reports of the torture
 and ill-treatment of prisoners, although again, as noted in
 its 1988 report, on a smaller scale than in previous years.

 AFGHANISTAN
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no legal safeguards to prevent arbitrary arrest or
 detention. Afghans living in areas controlled by the regime
 face unwarranted seizure by security personnel. Often,
 detainees are either not told of the charges against them
 before trial or are simply not brought to trial. Arrest
 warrants are not issued, and the right to judicial
 determination of the legality of detention is not accorded.
 Detainees typically are held incommunicado, sometimes for
 years, as is the case with several hundred prisoners held in
 the WAD sections of Pol-e-Charkhi prison. Although bail is
 sometimes granted, it is not a standard feature of the
 regime's legal procedures. Formal charges may come only after
 months of interrogation.
 There were continuing instances of arbitrary detention in
 1989, principally as a result of the impressment of civilians
 into military service in Kabul and, to a lesser extent, in
 other cities controlled by the regime. The Kabul regime's
 military and secret police continue to impress large numbers
 of underage boys into the military, taking them from the
 street and sometimes from classrooms and homes. The
 authorities do not inform the parents of the young men of
 their impressment. Relatives of soldiers who desert are often
 arrested by the regime to punish the deserters and deter
 others from deserting. Since the Soviet departure, regime
 impressments have been stepped up.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All courts are controlled by the ruling PDPA, and defendants
 may be denied their legal rights because of charges regarding
 their political beliefs. Most persons accused of nonpolitical
 crimes are tried in the ordinary criminal court system under
 the norms of judicial codes in existence before the PDPA coup
 of 1978. Those political detainees who are charged and
 brought to trial are usually arraigned on allegations of
 treason, espionage, or terrorism and are tried and sentenced
 in secret. As a rule, they must provide their own defense,
 without benefit of counsel.
 Death sentences generally are carried out quickly after a
 perfunctory review by the authorities. There is no mechanism
 to appeal a death sentence. The U.N.'s Special Rapporteur for
 Afghanistan, in his report of October 30, 1989, notes this as
 a contradiction to Article 14(5) of the International Covenant
 on Civil and Political Rights, to which Afghanistan is a
 party. According to the 1987 Constitution, death sentences
 are carried out after the approval of the President. In areas
 not controlled by the regime, civil and criminal cases are
 tried by Islamic judges (qazis) and community elders under
 Islamic,. or Shari'a, law and according to Afghan custom. Asia
 Watch reports that trials of Afghan prisoners by mujahidin
 parties during the war do not conform to internationally
 recognized standards of fair trial.
 No precise estimate is available on the number of political
 prisoners held by the regime, but observers agree that it is
 at least 3,000. The mujahidin are not known to hold political
 prisoners, although they do detain Soviet and regime personnel
 for extended periods.- An unknown number of Soviets, captured
 prior to the withdrawal, are still being held by the
 
 
 1323
 resistance in the hope of exchanging them for prisoners held
 by the regime and, the resistance claims, by the U.S.S.R.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Constitutional protections were suspended by the February 17
 declaration of a state of emergency. Afghans complain that
 regime forces routinely employ sweeps through residential
 areas and confiscate property, including homes. Telephones
 are frequently tapped and correspondence monitored.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Prior to its withdrawal in mid-February, the Soviet Union
 launched an intense campaign of bombardment along supply and
 evacuation routes as well as in areas where regime garrisons
 were hard pressed by resistance forces. These attacks caused
 large numbers of casualties indiscrimately among the civilian
 population. Following Soviet withdrawal, the Kabul regime
 continued high altitude bombing and began frequent launches of
 inaccurate yet powerful Scud surface-to-surface missiles. At
 least 1,000 Scuds were launched between February and late
 October, causing, together with bombings and artillery
 barrages, hundreds of additional civilian deaths and
 injuries. Regime and Soviet forces placed millions of
 landmines around fortifications or scattered them by artillery
 or aircraft during the Soviet occupation. More have been used
 by the regime since the Soviets left (and a lesser number of
 mines, especially antitank mines, have been sown by the
 mujahidin). Nothing has been done by the Soviets or the
 regime to remove them or help the U.N. accomplish the task.
 Although the U.N. has sponsored a program to detect and remove
 mines, the mines will pose a significant hazard to civilians
 for years.
 Mujahidin rocket attacks against airfields and military
 positions under government control have also caused numerous
 civilian casualties. Asia Watch, in a report published in
 November, focused on allegations of human rights abuses
 perpetrated by various resistance groups, most frequently the
 Hezb-e-Islami of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. These included
 politically motivated murders and kidnapings of Afghan refugee
 intellectuals, killing of prisoners, and indiscriminate
 attacks on government-controlled civilian targets.
 Section 2 Respect for Civlil Liberties, Including:
 a. Fr~edom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional provisions regarding freedom of expression were
 suspended under the February 17 declaration of a state of
 emergency. The regime tolerates almost no criticism in the
 public media, and private criticism can result in detention
 and arrest. Afghans are guarded in their conversations lest
 antiregime comments be reported to the secret police. There
 is no academic freedom, leading to a continuing exodus of
 academics and intellectuals, and the educational infrastructure
 is seriously at risk. All media are owned and controlled by
 the regime and tightly supervised. The press, radio, and
 television are used exclusively to convey the regime's policy
 and interpretation of world events. The unlicensed import and
 sale of non-Soviet video and audio tapes, magazines, books,
 and posters are forbidden, although this ban is generally
 
 
 1324
 AFGHANISTAN
 ineffective. Western radio broadcasts in local languages are
 frequently jammed, although some programs do get through.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There is no freedom of peaceful assembly and association in
 areas controlled by the regime. The February declaration of a
 state of emergency put further limits on constitutional rights
 to assemble. A 1987 party decree passed by the Revolutionary
 Council theoretically provided for the expression of political
 views at variance with those of the PDPA, but the party
 continues to set the bounds for acceptable dissent. While
 political demonstrations do occur, they are invariably staged-
 by the Government. Attempts to hold unauthorized peaceful
 assemblies are dealt with forcefully. Large numbers of people
 from the upper and middle classes have fled the country
 because of severe restrictions on political and social
 activity.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unioni, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population of Afghanistan is overwhelmingly Muslim.
 Although Sunnis predominate, with 80 to 90 percent of the
 population, there is an important Shi'a minority primarily
 concentrated in the Hazarajat region of central Afghanistan
 and, since the war began, in Kabul. Small enclaves of Hindus
 and Sikhs traditionally have lived peacefully alongside their
 Muslim neighbors.
 Since the 1�78 coup, the regime has sought, with marginal
 success, to supervise strictly all religious organizations.
 The regimels policy pronouncements, including statements by
 President Najibullah, routinely invoke religious terminology
 in what is seen by most Afghans as a cynical effort to appeal
 to the populace. The regime has made some effort to win
 support from Muslims through the construction and repair of
 mosques and religious schools. Within the last year, the
 regime has declared its dedication to Islamic ideals and does
 not interfere with the practice of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic travel remains severely restricted by wartime
 conditions. In 1988 the regime reportedly loosened its
 requirements and lowered the charge for obtaining a passport
 for foreign travel.
 The large numbers of mines remaining from the Soviet
 occupation and additional mining by regime forces, since the
 Soviet withdrawal, of the principal overland routes and passes
 (as well as the smaller number of mines sown by the mujahidin)
 have caused a large number of casualties among the civilian
 population and creates serious risks for returning refugees
 who travel over these routes.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Afghan citizens have neither the right nor the ability
 peacefully to change their government. The regime-controlled
 areas of Afghanistan have a totalitarian government under the
 
 
 1325
 
 control of the PDPA, which is kept in power by the Soviet
 Union. The ruling PDPA is modeled closely on the Soviet
 Communist Party. Under military pressure from the resistance,
 the PDPA has presented proposals for various ways to change
 the country's form of government, including creation of a
 coalition transition government. However, under these
 proposals, the PDPA would cohtinue to hold the reins of real
 power.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The regime's relationships with international humanitarian
 organizations investigating human rights practices in
 Afghanistan is now less obstructionist than in the past. The'
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was granted
 permission in 1988 to visit persons detained by the
 Government, and such visits are now taking place. The ICRC
 also continues to conduct a medical program in Kabul.
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Afghanistan, Felix Ermacora,
 visited Kabul in September, at the invitation of the
 Government, to gather material for his fourth report on human
 rights in Afghanistan which he submitted in an interim form in
 October. His report covers a wide range of human rights
 abuses and issues on both sides and offers a series of
 recommendations. In its 1989 Report, covering 1988, AI noted
 that in April it had appealed to President Najibullah and to
 Soviet authbrities to ensure that allegations of torture and
 extrajudicial executions would be fully investigated and that
 those found responsible be brought to justice; there was no
 indication that a response had been made.
 Some mujahidin groups have permitted the ICRC and journalists
 sporadically to visit some Soviet and Afghan prisoners held by
 them. In June leaders of the Afghan Interim Government (AIG)
 met with a 6roup of private-citizens from the U:S.S.R., which
 included relatives of Soviet soldiers missing in action.
 During the year other private individuals and organizations
 met with AIG leaders on the prisoner-of-war (POW) issue. In
 November two Soviet POW's were released to their families and
 returned to the Soviet Union.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, and Social Status
 In traditional Afghan society, the participation of women in
 activities beyond the home and field is limited by long
 established beliefs, customs, and religious practices. The
 social position of some women, generally those residing in
 Kabul, has improved somewhat over the past decade. The
 disruption of the war and diversion of large numbers of males
 to military service and combat have affected the lives of
 women living in areas controlled by both the regime and the
 resistance. Under the regime, the role of women in some
 nontraditional occupations such as banking, the media, and the
 civil service has expanded. Women have suffered because of
 social and ideological pressures in the refugee community in
 Pakistan. What little freedom they had before has been
 greatly circumscribed. Attitudes towards women's roles remain
 a subject of debate within the resistance, including
 assertions by some fundamentalist parties that there should be
 further restrictions on public appearances by women. But even
 among fundamentalists some change is detectable. One of the
 
 
 1326
 AFGHANISANi
 fundamentalist parties, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezbi-e-Islami,
 has issued membership cards conferring voting rights on
 females. The Special Rapporteur noted in his report that a
 special matter of concern is the abduction and mistreatment of
 Afghan women.
 Violence against women is known to occur in Afghanistan, but
 little is known about its extent. Abuse within the family is
 seldom mentioned publicly in this traditional society, and the
 regime does not acknowledge the existence of a problem. There
 are no official statistics on the subject.
 Afghanistan is home to several religious sects and a number of
 ethnic, tribal, and linguistic groups whose relations to one
 another have traditionally been marked by rivalry and
 occasionally by hostilities, both within the regime and the
 resistance. Local loyalties often override those to the
 nation as a whole. A particularly strong line of cleavage
 along religious, ethnic, and geographic lines lies between the
 minority Shi'a and and the traditionally dominant Sunni
 Afghans. Internal regime politics reflect these rivalries,
 but the PDPA also tries to take advantage of them for its own
 purposes. This includes dispatching troops belonging to one
 ethnic group to other parts of the country where they are not
 normally present. This continues a longstanding practice--
 which predates the Communist takeover--aimed at making it
 easier to repress the local population and to prevent military
 defections, but it also heightens hostilities between groups
 and sparks frequent violence. Shi'a Muslim resistance groups
 are not represented in the'seven-party resistance Alliance, in
 part because of traditional antipathy and discrimination on
 the part of Aghan Sunnis toward their Shi'a countrymen.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constiution and the labor law (enacted in 1987) assert
 that individual workers have the right to form trade unions,
 and such unions are theoretically independent of state
 organs. In practice, however, the structure of'union
 organization is modeled on that of the Soviet Union,
 individual unions are overseen by the Central Council of Trade
 Unions, an umbrella organization controlled by the ruling
 PDPA, and there is no evidence of worker participation in
 decisionmaking. There is no provision in law for the right to
 organize independent unions, and there is no right to strike.
 Workers have been threatened with loss of jobs or imprisonment
 for refusal to join party organizations. The Central Council
 of Trade Unions is affiliated with the Communist-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions.- Afghanistan has been a
 member of the International Labor Organization (ILO) since
 1934 but has ratified neither ILO convention 87 regarding'
 Freedom of Association nor Convention 98 on Collective
 Bargaining.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Within the constraints mentioned above, workers have the
 theoretical right to organize and bargain collectively.
 Acording to labor law, in large economic organizations at the
 end of each Afghan year, a new collective contract is signed
 following negotiations between the management and the councils
 of representatives of the trade union organizations at the
 primary level with the consensus of the workers' collective.
 
 
 1327
 AFGHANISTAN
 In practice, there is no genuine labor-management bargaining
 and the workers' collective rubber stamps decisions taken by
 officials. There has been some discussion about setting up
 labor courts and other mechanisms for the resolution of
 disputes, but no action has been taken.
 There is no indication that there are any special economic or
 export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution forbids the imposition of forced labor, but
 notes that the "performance of compulsory labor in wartime,
 natural calamity, and other states of emergency which threaten
 public life and order shall be excluded from this." Given
 that wartime conditions exist, and that the regime imposed a
 state of emergency in February, this constitutional provision
 is, in effect, superseded. The most frequent manifestation of
 the use of forced labor is the "voluntary" labor engaged in by
 students for short periods for construction projects during
 their annual vacations, during a time when they are seconded
 to the military.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The labor law specifies the conditions of work for adolescents,
 noting that persons aged 13 to 15 should work a maximum of 30
 hours a week, and those aged 16 to 17 should not work more
 than 35 hours a week. The law also specifies that adolescents
 should receive the same pay as persons 18 and older.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor law stipulates that the usual hours of work on
 average should not exceed 40 hours a week, and that on
 Thursdays working time should not exceed 5 hours. Provision
 is made for time off for prayers, meals, holidays, weekends,
 annual leave, sick leave, and emergency leave. No information
 on any statutory minimum wage is available. There are general
 provisions which set out the employer's responsibility to
 ensure healthy and safe conditions of work, and accident
 compensation. There appear to be no effective enforcement
 mechanisms to ensure fair and safe labor practices. The State
 Committee on Labor and Social Security is understaffed and,
 like most ministries and state committees of the current
 regime, not very active.
