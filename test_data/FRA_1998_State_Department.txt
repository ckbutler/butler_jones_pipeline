 FRANCE
 France is a constitutional democracy with a directly elected president and Na-
 tional Assembly and an independent judiciary.
 The law enforcement and internal security apparatus consists of the Gendarmerie,
 the national police, and municipal police forces in major cities, all of which are
 under effective civilian control. Members of those police forces committed some
 human rights abuses.
 The highly developed, diversified, and primarily market-based economy provides
 residents with a high standard of living.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary provide a means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. There
 were instances of unwarranted use of lethal force and the abuse of detainees, par-
 ticularly foreigners, by law enforcement officers. Long delays in bringing cases to
 trial and lengthy pretrial detention are problems. Violence and threats against eth-
 
 
 1252
 nic and religious minorities continued to decline. The Government has taken impor-
 tant steps to deal with violence against women and children. Women continue to
 face wage discrimination. Claude Erignac, the Government's Prefect in Corsica, was
 killed in February in Ajaccio.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government officials.
 Law enforcement officers have used excessive force-particularly directed against
 immigrants-resulting in deaths, although there is no evidence of a pattern of such
 abuses. There were also a number of deaths in detention due to official negligence
 (see Section 1.c.).
 In March the authorities investigated two police officers in the "Bouziane affair,"
 which involved the December 1997 fatal shooting of 16-year-old Abdel-Kader
 Bouziane. The police claimed self-defense when they fired at Bouziane's car as it ap-
 proached them head-on, shooting him when he attempted to break through a road-
 block near Fontainbleau. Ballistics experts stated that the shots were fired after
 Bouziane's vehicle passed through the roadblock.
 In Lyon in December 1997, Fabrice Fernandez, who was handcuffed and arrested
 by the anticrime brigade, was shot and killed while undergoing interrogation at the
 police station. The police officer who fired the fatal shot with a confiscated shotgun
 was suspended from duty, detained, and charged with manslaughter, which was
 later increased to murder by the investigating judge. Also in Lyon an unemployed
 24-year-old was killed during interrogation at police headquarters in the same
 month.
 In March 1997, gendarmes killed two homeless men who were robbing a store in
 Machecoul (Loire-Atlantique). The police claimed self-defense, but witnesses said
 that the men were unarmed. Two investigations were opened regarding the incident,
 one to investigate the cause of death of the two men, and one to determine if it was
 murder.
 In December 1997, the appeals court in Aix-en-Provence overturned the decision
 that the border police officer who shot and killed 8-year-old Serbian refugee Todor
 Bogdanovic in 1995 acted in self-defense. Border police were accused of using exces-
 sive force in attempting to halt a convoy of refugees that ran a border checkpoint.
 The case was passed on to the Court of Assizes on a charge of manslaughter.
 In November 1997, the gendarme who shot and killed Franck Moret was released
 by the correctional court in Valence, prompting the family of the deceased to appeal
 the judgment. Also in November 1997, the family of Ibrahim Sy, a Senegalese youth
 who was shot and killed by a gendarme in 1994, appealed the Rouen Court of Ap-
 peals judgment that no grounds for prosecution existed in the case to the Court of
 Cassation.
 In January 1997, the judicial inquiry into the 1993 shooting and killing of 19-
 year-old Algerian Mourad Tchier by a police officer was passed to the Attorney Gen-
 eral, and the policeman was suspended from active duty in March 1997. Charges
 were filed, and in October 1997 the officer was sentenced to a suspended 5-year
 prison term.
 An administrative inquiry was opened into the 1991 death of 18-year-old Assa
 Ihich, who was allegedly beaten by police officers and subsequently died of an asth-
 matic attack because he was allegedly refused medication.
 In May the Interior Minister released a study that acknowledged that government
 authorities hid the scope of a 1961 crackdown on Algerians who were beaten, shot,
 and thrown into the Seine River during a 1961 protest tied to Algerian independ-
 ence. The Interior Ministry report stated that it was likely that "dozens" of persons
 died on October 17, 1961. Prior to the release of the report, officials insisted that
 only seven persons were killed. Government authorities at the time of the incident
 stated that only three persons were killed.
 Four skinheads were sentenced in May for their roles in the 1995 killing of a Mo-
 roccan (see Section 5).
 In February the Prefect for Corsica, Claude Erignac, was killed in Ajaccio. While
 no one has claimed responsibility, the investigation continues to focus on separatist
 groups. The Corsican separatist group FLNC-Canal Historique claimed responsibil-
 ity in May for bombings in Marseille and Aix-en-Provence and in August for the
 July 21 drive-by shooting attack on the national police compound at Aspretto, as
 well the July 31 bombing of a gendarmerie station at Avignon. During 1998 there
 were approximately 132 terrorist attacks or attempts in Corsica, but there were no
 other fatalities.
 
 
 1253
 
 In November 1996, the trial began of 41 Algerian extremists in connection with
 the wave of bombings in Paris in 1995 that killed 8 persons and injured over 170
 others. Of the 41, 3 were tried in absentia and 38 were present at the trial. The
 group was accused of providing financial support, false documents, and other assist-
 ance related to the bombings to Algerian extremists. Most of the defendants were
 convicted and sentenced in February to jail terms ranging from 4 to 10 years.
 Reza Mazoulman, an Iranian deputy education minister under the Shah, was shot
 and killed in Paris in 1996. Two Iranian nationals are suspected in the shooting:
 one is suspected of having fled to Iran; the other was extradited from Germany
 where he had fled, and an investigation is continuing.
 The investigating magistrate completed his investigation into the 1989 terrorist
 bombing of UTA flight 772 and forwarded the case for trial. The six Libyan nation-
 als accused in the case were expected to be tried in absentia in early 1999. The
 brother-in-law of Libyan dictator Mu'ammar Al-Qadhafi is included in the group.
 The police arrested German national Hans-Joachim Klein, who was subject to an
 international arrest warrant issued through the European Union Schengen Accords,
 in early September in northern France where he had lived under another identity
 for more than 5 years. Klein was wanted for murder and attempted murder for his
 participation with internationally known terrorist Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, also
 known as "Carlos the Jackal," in the 1975 hostage taking at OPEC headquarters
 in Vienna that resulted in several deaths.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and the authorities punish officials who employ
 them. However, there were credible reports that law enforcement officers used ex-
 cessive force, particularly against/immigrants. Isolated instances of police abuse oc-
 curred, but there is no evidence of a pattern.
 In March a police officer and former member of the National Front was sentenced -
 to 8 months in prison for assaulting a North African who was taken into custody
 for disrupting the peace.
 In March police in New Caledonia fired rubber bullets at Chinese refugees,
 wounding several (see Section 2.d.).
 The United Nations Human Rights Committee expressed concern in July 1997
 about the number and gravity of allegations of mistreatment of detainees by law en-
 forcement officials and the unnecessary use of force and firearms which resulted in
 a number of deaths. According to the Committee, such mistreatment was more often
 prevalent in cases of foreign detainees. The Committee also cited lengthy proceed-
 ings involving law enforcement officers and investigations of alleged human rights
 violations bylaw enforcement officials that "lacked vigor" as potential problems. Ad-
 ditionally, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), an organ
 of the Council of Europe, in a June report criticized the National Police forces of
 Paris, Marseille, and Montpellier for the mistreatment and poor conditions of de-
 tainees in police stations. Most of the complaints came from persons of North Afri-
 can or African origin.
 In February 1997, a French Communist Party supporter and his wife, both from
 Paris, were allegedly beaten in the Paris suburb of Val-d'Oise by several police offi-
 cers claiming to be part of the extreme-right political group, the National Front
 (FN). The victims brought charges against the officers involved.
 An administrative investigation was launched after a few dozen persons dem-
 onstrating against the FN in March 1997 in Marseille were beaten by-riot police.
 To keep the anti-FN demonstrators away from their FN counterparts, the police, ac-
 cording to eyewitnesses, allegedly used excessive force by beating demonstrators and
 using tear gas grenades.
 Prison conditions generally exceed minimum international standards. The 1998
 report of the French international nongovernmental organization International Ob-
 server of Prisons (IOP) noted a decrease in the number of deaths of inmates, which
 reversed the previous year's increase. In 1997 there were 203 deaths of persons in
 custody, compared with 272 in 1996. A lack of response or the poor medical care
 and supervision of prison personnel were often the causes of several deaths. The
 IOP cited the case of Carole Debuine as an example. With medical treatment sus-
 pended since the beginning of her incarceration, she waited 3 weeks to be trans-
 ferred to a hospital for tests before she died on September 11, 1997, from severe
 encephalitis. The report also noted that despite the implementation of preventive
 policies at 11 sites, suicide continued to be the leading cause of death of imprisoned
 inmates. There were 125 suicides in detention in 1997, compared with 138 in 1996.
 In addition, the report criticized incidents of brutality, particularly against prisoners
 of African origin, by prison officials-incidents that resulted in the number of dis-
 ciplinary sanctions against surveillance personnel increasing threefold. In Grasse
 
 
 1254
 
 during the night of December 31, 1997, seven inebriated prison guards brutalized
 eight inmates of African origin, of which three were minors, strangling one.
 In its 1998 report reflecting conditions in 1996, the CPT found that police holding
 cells did not satisfactorily accommodate prisoners' needs. For example, police prison
 cells frequently had inadequate natural light, sleeping space, and blankets. In addi-
 tion, prisoners received inadequate meals, outdoor exercise and medical care, ac-
 cording to the CPT.
 In an attempt to reduce prison overcrowding, a December 1997 law called for ex-
 perimentation with the "electronic bracelet" in 1998 for inmates serving less than
 a 1-year sentence or ior those finishing their sentences. The IOP report also high-
 lighted a increase in the number of minors incarcerated in 1997.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 A 1994 case continues against 6 of 26 resident non-French Muslims detained by
 police on suspicion of supporting Algerian terrorists. After several weeks' detention,
 20 of the detainees were deported in 1995.
 There are no provisions for exile, and it does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for an independent judiciary,
 and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides citi-
 zens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 There is a system of local courts, 35 regional courts of appeal, and the highest
 criminal court, the Court of Cassation, which considers appeals on procedural
 grounds only.
 The judicial system has been criticized by credible sources for its inability to proc-
 ess suspects quickly. Some spend many years in prison before a trial even starts.
 According to the IOP, over 40-percent of all inmates are, suspects awaiting trial. A
 system of bail exists.
 The mass trial of the "Chalabi network"-was completed in October, and those con-
 victed received sentences ranging from 4 months to 10 years' imprisonment. The
 case involved 138 suspects, most of North African origin, who were accused of pro-
 viding logistical support in France for terrorists in Algeria. Arrested by police be-
 tween November 1994 and June 1995, 27 had been in detention since that period.
 Because the Government feared that adequate security could not be assured at the
 main tribunal in central Paris, the trial was held outside Paris in a converted gym-
 nasium on the grounds of the National School for Penitentiary Administration. At-
 torneys for the accused as well as the -nongovernmental organization League of
 Human Rights criticized the-'circus" atmosphere of-a mass trial and boycotted the
 proceedings, in protest at their stated inability to provide a fair defense for such
 a large number of clients at once.
 In September Omar Raddad, the Moroccan gardener accused and convicted of bru-
 tally killing his, employer in 1994, was released from prison on conditional terms
 after having served 4 years and several months of his 18-year sentence, which was
 reduced by President Jacques Chirac in 1996. Raddad and his attorneys continued
 to insist that the court, in Nice denied him an adequate and fair trial. According
 to Raddad's attorney, immigration officials expelled a key witness for his defense
 because the witness did not have proper residence papers. His attorney is submit-
 ting a motion for a retrial.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 In April Prime Minister Lionel Jospin called for an individual examination of each
 wiretapping case deemed inappropriate by the National Commission for the Regula-
 tion of Wiretapping (NCRWT). According to the most recent report compiled by the
 NCRWT, the number of wiretaps by police authorities increased slightly in 1997.
 However, other official wiretaps, of which the number is set by the Prime Minister,
 increased by 30 percent in 1997. Wiretapping is legally recognized as a right of the
 government, but its improper use during former president Mitterrand's tenure led
 to Jospin's action.
 Section 2.,Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and of
 the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent
 press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine
 to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 In 1994 the Government enacted a law mandating the use of the French language
 in certain limited circumstances. In 1997 a Paris court dismissed on technical
 
 
 1255
 grounds a lawsuit against an institution affiliated with Georgia Tech University.
 The suit alleged that the organization violated the law because its Internet site was
 not available in French. The suit was resolved amicably out of court after the orga-
 nization agreed to publish its site in French and English.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for the separation of church and state
 and for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right in
 practice. However, the Government took some actions during the year that targeted
 reli *ous minorities that it describes as "sects."
 The State subsidizes private schools, including those that are church affiliated.
 Central or local governments also own and provide upkeep for other religious build-
 ings constructed before 1905, the date of the law separating church and state. A cat-
 egory of groups known as "cultural associations" with religious affiliations may also
 qualify for government subsidies. For historical reasons, contrary to practice in the
 rest of the country, the Jewish, Lutheran, Reformed, and Roman Catholic religions
 in three departments of Alsace and Lorraine enjoy special legal status. Adherents
 of these four religions may choose to have a portion of their income tax allocated
 to their church in a system administered by the central Government.
 Debate continues over whether denying some Muslim girls the right to wear
 headscarves in public schools constitutes a violation of the right to practice their re-
 ligion. In 1989 the highest administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat, ruled that the
 "ostentatious" wearing of these headscarves violated a law prohibiting proselytizing
 in schools. After much media attention-mainly unfavorable-to the wearing of such
 headscarves, the Ministry of Education issued a directive in 1994 that prohibits the
 wearing of "ostentatious political and religious symbols" in schools. The directive
 does not specify the "symbols" in question, leaving school administrators consider-
 able authority to do so. The highest administrative court affirmed in 1995 that sim-
 ply wearing a headscarf does not provide grounds for exclusion from school and sub-
 sequently struck down some decisions to expel girls for wearing headscarves.
 In 1995 the National Assembly created a pariamenay commission (known alter-
 natively as the Gest or Guyard Commission, after the names of its chairman and
 rapporteur respectively) that was "charged with studying the phenomenon of sects
 and of proposing, if necessary, the adaptation of existing laws' to address sects. In
 1996 the commission issued a report %at identified 172 groups as sects, including
 Jehovah's Witnesses and the Church of Scientology. The report was prepared with-
 out the benefit of full and complete hearings regarding the groups identified on the
 list. The ensuing publicity contributed to an atmosphere of intolerance and bias
 against minority religions. Some religious groups reported that their members suf-
 fered increased intolerance after having been identified on the list. According to the
 International Helsinki Federation, in its November report to the OSCE Human Di-
 mension Implementation Meeting in Warsaw, the identification of the 172 groups
 "resulted in media reports libeling minority religions, the circulation of rumors and
 false information, and incitement of religious intolerance." The Commission's find-
 ings also led to calls for legislative action to restrict the activities of sects, which
 the Government rejected on freedom of religion grounds. Instead, the Justice Min-
 istry issued a directive to all government entities to be vigilant against possible
 abuses by sects, and government offices were instructed to monitor potentially abu-
 sive sect activities.
 In 1996 the Government created an interministerial working group on sects
 (known as the Observatory on Sects) to analyze further the phenomenon of sects
 and to develop proposals for dealing with them. The working group's final report
 (issued during the summer) proposed to: (1) give legal standing to organizations that
 oppose sects, thereby allowing them to initiate civil actions against sects; (2) modify
 the law to require associations to divulge information regarding the sources and
 management of their finances in order to obtain tax-exempt status; (3) limit the al-
 location of public campaign funds to groups and parties having over 2 percent of
 the eligible voting population's support; (4) place a "resource" representative in each
 prefecture to communicate information to local officials regarding sects; (5) create
 a permanent commission at the European Union level to reinforce international and
 European cooperation in controlling sect activities; and (6) implement measures to
 restrict group members' entry into professional training programs.
 In October the French government issued a new decree creating an "Interministe-
 rial Mission to Battle Against Sects" ("mission interministerielle de lutte contre les
 sectes"). The new decree disbanded the Observatory on Sects. Although the decree
 instructs the commission to "analyze the phenomenon of sects," the decree itself
 does not define what is meant by sect or how sects differ from "religions." The com-
 mission also is charged with serving as a coordinator of periodic interministerial
 
 
 1256
 
 meetings at which government officials are to exchange information and coordinate
 their actions against sects. Some observers are concerned about the creation of a
 commission that targets groups not on the basis of their presumed illegal activities
 but on the basis of their religious or other beliefs.
 In December the Ministry of Justice issued a circular urging state prosecutors to
 cooperate with the new commission in bringing actions against sects. In December
 the National Assembly also created a new parliamentary commission to study the
 way that sects are financed.
 According to the 1905 law separating church and state, religious associations are
 not taxed on voluntary donations that they receive, but the Government does not
 recognize Jehovah's Witnesses or the Church of Scientology as qualifying religious
 associations. For tax purposes the Government therefore treats them as commercial
 enterprises, which makes them subject to a 60 percent tax on all donations they re-
 ceive. Although international human rights standards prohibit discrimination on the
 basis of religion or belief, the Government used this distinction to find that certain
 groups are not qualifying religious associations for tax purposes.
 In January 1996, the tax authorities began an audit of the French Association of
 Jehovah's Witnesses, and in May the tax authorities formally assessed the 60 per-
 cent tax against donations received by Jehovah's Witnesses from September 1992
 through August 1996. In June tax authorities began proceedings to collect the as-
 sessed tax, including steps to place a lien on the property of the National Consistory
 of Jehovah's Witnesses. The total amount claimed (including taxes, penalties, and
 interest) is over $50 million (300 million francs). According to the International Hel-
 sinki Federation's 1998 report, Jehovah's Witnesses "have been singled out for close
 scrutiny" and their "fiscal management has been examined with an intensity that
 suggests harassment."
 The authorities previously took similar action against the Church of Scientology.
 Tax -claims asserted in 1994-95 against several Scientology churches forced them
 into bankruptcy. In the case of the Paris church the Ministry of Finance refused to
 grant the church authorization to import funds to pay the claimed taxes even
 though the church offered to pay the total amount of all taxes assessed, a percent-
 age of which would have come from outside the country. Subsequently, in December
 1997, the Government fied a legal actiofi for the claimed amount against the former
 officers of the Paris church and against the Church of Scientology International, a
 California nonprofit religious organization.
 Hearings in this legal action have been deferred pending a decision on an underly-
 ing administrative claim by the Paris church that the Ministry of Finance acted im-
 properly in refusing to allow the church to import the funds needed to pay the as-
 sessed taxes.
 In July 1997 a Court of Appeals in Lyon recognized Scientology as a religion in
 its opinion in the conviction of Jean-Jacques Mazier, a former leader of the
 Scientologists, for contributing to the 1988 suicide of a church member. In response
 the Minister of the Interior stated that the court had exceeded its authority and
 that the Government does not recognize Scientology as a religion. The Government
 appealed the Court of Appeals decision.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 The Government provides first asylum and provided it to approximately 17,200
 persons in 1996 (latest available statistics). The Government generally cooperates
 with the United Nations (U.N.) High Commissioner for Refugees and other humani-
 tarian organizations in assisting refugees. However, in July 1997 the United Na-
 tions Human Rights Committee raised concerns about reports of unreasonable delay
 in the Government's processing of asylum seekers in airport waiting areas and
 about the Government's efforts to limit U.N. access to these areas. The Committee
 questioned the Government's practice of penalizing air and ship carriers that trans-
 ported refugees without legal documentation, arguing that the policy disadvantaged
 legitimate refugees. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country
 where they feared persecution.
 However, the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (NCCHR) ex-
 pressed concern about the methods that the authorities employed in attempting to
 force 110 "Chinese boat people" to leave New Caledonia in March after they had
 taken refuge on the island for 4 months (beginning in November 1997). Police fired
 rubber bullets at the Chinese refugees, who refused to descend from rooftops,
 wounding several. The Government subsequently suspended the expulsion.
 In June 1997, the newly elected Prime Minister ordered local authorities to accel-
 erate the process for considering the issuance of residence papers to illegal immi-
 grants using criteria established in 1996 by the NCCHR. Between June of 1997 and
 
 
 1257
 the end of 1998, approximately 143,000 illegal aliens requested residence papers
 and approximately 80,000 of these requests were granted. An immigration law
 passedby the National Assembly in May 1998 establishes the new rules applicable
 to resident illegal aliens. Such aliens who applied for but did not receive residence
 papers between June 1997 and the end of 1998 can apply for residency under the
 new law.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women in politics or govern-
 ment, but they remain significantly underrepresented in public offices, especially at
 the national level. Nine of 27 cabinet members, 5.6 per cent of senators, and 10 per-
 cent of deputies in the National Assembly are women. The European Union Par-
 liament includes a larger French female presence, with 30 percent of the country's
 elected representatives being women. To increase women's participation, some par-
 ties have established quotas for them on electoral lists or in party management. The
 President and the Prime Minister continued discussions on modernizing the coun-
 try's political institutions, including measures to encourage a greater number of
 women in political, social, and public positions.
 The citizens of the "collective territory" of Mayotte and the territories of French
 Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia determine their legal and politi-
 cal relationships to France by means of referendums, and they elect Deputies and
 Senators to the French Parliament, along with the overseas departments. In Novem-
 ber the citizens of New Caledonia approved a referendum modifying their political
 system. The referendum provides that for a period of from 15 to 20 years the terri-
 tory will be governed by executive officials elected on a proportional basis by the
 legislative body (the New Caledonia Congress). Then, between the years 2014 and
 2018, the citizens of New Caledonia will have an opportunity to vote (through an-
 other referendum) for independence.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of local and international human rights organizations operate free-
 ly, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government
 officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views. The NCCHR-
 which has nongovernmental as well as government members-also monitors com-
 plaints and advises the Government on policies and legislation. It is an independent
 body in the Office of the Prime Minister.
 A parliamentary commission convened in the spring was charged with investigat-
 ing government actions in Rwanda during the genocide of 1994. It concluded its
 public hearings and investigations after conducting broad-ranging interviews of rel-
 evant government and foreign officials. The Commission's report was expected to be
 issued in December. The Commission was convened in response to press allegations
 that France supplied arms to the Hutu-dominated Rwandan army forces, which
 used them in the genocide committed against Tutsis in violation of the May 1994
 U.N. Security Council embargo forbidding such sales.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Statutes ban discrimination based on race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or po-
 litical opinion, and the Government effectively enforces them.
 Women.-The Penal Code prohibits abuse as well as violence against women. Wife
 beating is a felony. There were 6,540 reported rapes or sexual assaults in 1995 (lat-
 est available statistics). Some 15,700 incidents of wife beating (including 98 which
 resulted in death) were reported to police in 1993 (latest available statistics). The
 Government offers shelter, counseling, and financial assistance, and operates a tele-
 phone hot line. The welcome centers for battered women added 500 staff members
 in 1995. About 60 private associations also help battered women.
 Although in general France serves primarily as a transit point rather than a des-
 tination, there were cases in which women were trafficked to France for prostitu-
 tion. For example, in March a judge began an investigation into an alleged inter-
 national prostitution ring that lured girls into prostitution by promising them acting
 jobs. Early in the year, Paris police uncovered a network of pimps in the Bois de
 Vincennes involving African women. Police also dismantled another organization
 that promised work as flight attendants to around 40 women, mostly Russians who
 were brought to France on fake Croatian passports, and subsequently forced them
 
 
 1258
 
 into prostitution. There is a government agency, OCRTEH, the Central Office on the
 Treatment of Human Beings, that deals with the problem, but the Government pri-
 marily relies on Lyon-based Interpol to combat the illegal trafficking of women.
 While prostitution is legal, acting as a pimp is not.
 The law requires that women receive equal pay for equal work, but this require-
 ment is often not the reality. Large salary disparities between men and women per-
 sist. According to recent statistics, on average, men earn 22.5 percent more than
 women, down from 29 percent in 1991. While women earned less than men in gen-
 eral, women were more likely to be affected by long-term unemployment: in 1994
 (latest available statistics) the rate for women was 4 percentage points higher than
 that for men. Among persons earning or receiving less than $650 per month, 80 per-
 cent are women.
 The law prohibits sex-based job discrimination and sexual harassment in the
 workplace. Thus far these laws have encountered difficulties in implementation.
 Women's rights groups criticize the scope of the law as narrow and the fines and
 compensatory damages as often modest. For example, the law limits sexual harass-
 ment claims to circumstances where there is a supervisor-subordinate relationship
 but fails to address harassment by colleagues or a hostile work environment.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. The Ministry for Family Affairs oversees implementation of the Government's
 programs for children.
 There are strict laws against child abuse, particularly when committed by a par-
 ent or guardian. In 1995 (latest available statistics) there were 20,000 reported
 cases of mistreatment (physical violence, sexual abuse, mental cruelty, or severe
 negligence) of children, an 18 percent increase from 1994. Of these cases, 5,500 in-
 volved reports of sexual abuse. Special sections of the national police and judiciary
 are charged with handling these cases. The Government provides counseling, finan-
 cial aid, foster homes, and orphanages, depending on the extent of the problem. Var-
 ious associations also help minors seek justice in cases of mistreatment by parents.
 Some immigrants from countries where female genital mutilation (FGM) is cus-
 tomary subject their children to this practice, which is widely condemned by inter-
 national health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. Au-
 thorities prosecute FGM cases under the provisions of the Penal Code, which states
 that acts of violence towards children that result in mutilation shall be tried in the
 highest criminal court. Since 1993 the Government and private associations have
 undertaken a campaign to inform immigrants that FGM is contrary to the law and
 will be prosecuted.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse against children.
 Between October 13 and October 20, thousands of high school students conducted
 three nationwide demonstrations-for better schools and more teachers. The students
 were joined on the margins by other young people from the suburbs who committed
 various acts of property damage. During an October 15 demonstration, 5 people, in-
 cluding 2 policeman, sustained minor injuries, and 110 people were arrested. During
 an October 20 demonstration 300 people were arrested.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. A 1991 law re-
 quires new public buildings to be accessible to the physically disabled, but most
 older buildings and public transportation are not accessible.
 Religious Minorities.-The annual NCCHR report on racism and xenophobia, re-
 leased in March, confirmed a downward trend in the number of threats or attacks
 against Jews since 1992: a total of 80 threats and 3 acts of violence in 1997 com-
 pared with 90 and 1 in 1996, respectively.
 In April a Bordeaux court sentenced Maurice Papon to 10 years' imprisonment for
 his actions as secretary general of the Prefecture of Gironde from 1942 to 1944.
 Papon was found guilty of complicity in committing crimes against humanity for his
 role in the deportation of hundreds of Jews to Nazi concentration camps during the
 World War II German occupation.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Anti-immigrant sentiments sparked inci-
 dents including occasional attacks by skinheads on members of the large Arab/Mus-
 lim and black African communities. The annual NCCHR report noted a continuing
 decrease in the number of reported incidents of racist violence and threats: down
 to 112 threats in 1997 from 199 in 1996 and 5 cases of violence, down from 9 in
 1996. One death attributable to racist violence was recorded in 1997.
 The Government strongly condemns such actions and attacks and has strict
 antidefamation laws. Government programs attempt to combat racism and anti-
 Semitism by promoting public awareness and bringing together local officials, police,
 
 
 1259
 and citizen groups. There are also antiracist educational programs in some public
 school systems.
 The annual NCCHR report warned against "racism with a new face." The Com-
 mission noted increasing job discrimination against youth of North African origin
 and it highlighted the overrepresentation of youths of Arab origin in unemployment
 statistics. It cited the example of a technical high school in the Parisian region that
 maintains lists of companies that offer internships to students, with some compa-
 nies specifying "no Arab names." The report noted the ineffectiveness of existing
 laws to combat this form of racism, as well as the difficulty in proving discrimina-
 tory intentions. The Commission suggested the implementation of several voluntary
 measures, including a type of affirmative action program. If such a "quotW' arrange-
 ment were not selected, the Commission suggested that public authorities encourage
 good practices using their power to allocate contracts.
 In a 1997 poll, 18 percent of respondents admitted to being "quite racist;" 40 per-
 cent said they could be "tempted" by racism; 33 percent said neither of the first two
 categories applied to them; and 9 percent had no opinion.
 In Vitrolles the city government led by the National Front (NF) instituted a sys-
 tem of bonuses ("national preference") offering couples of European origin a one-
 time bonus of approximately $800 (Fr 5,000) for children born after January 1,
 1998. Eligible parents must have lived in the city of Vitrolles for 2 years and must
 originate from member states of the European Union. In April a Marseille adminis-
 trative tribunal ruled that the bonus system was illegal. A similar measure was~m-
 plemented in Paris in 1985 with the intent of maintaining the "demographic ejui-
 librium" of the city. The Paris administrative tribunal struck down the earlier Paris
 law in 1986 on the basis that it conflicted with the legal principal of equality. The
 NF also uses its "national preference" dictum in the allocation of jobs in municipali-
 ties under its control.
 The reformed law concerning French nationality, originally passed by the Na-
 tional Assembly in November 1997, came into effect in September and was pub-
 licized by a government campaign that is to last until 1999. The new law grants
 children born in France of-foreign parents full citizenship at the age of 18 and re-
 placed the stricter 1993 "Mehaignerie Law" which required persons to apply for
 French nationality upon turning 21 years of age. Under the new law, youths can
 obtain certificates of nationality by proving that they were born in France and have
 lived at least 5 years, continuous or not, on French territory since the age of 11.
 A youth can apply for nationality as early as the age of 16, or a child's parents,
 with his or her agreement, may apply when the child reaches the age of 13.
 The press reported that authorities continued to deny residence status to Daniella
 Dragotel, the 5-year-old daughter of Romanian immigrants. Daniella was born in a
 house trailer outside the Strasbourg city hall. Authorities cited uncertainty as to the
 infant's date and place of birth as the reasons for the denial of civil status. Accord-
 ing to the law, in the event of any uncertainty in the child's place of birth, the re-
 sponsible tribunal is that for the area in which the guardian resides, with the sole
 condition being that said guardian resides in France. Daniella's parents both pos-
 sessed legal residence permits. According to court precedent, uncertainty as to the
 date of birth is insufficient grounds to deny residence status. The same court prece-
 dent states that every individual is obligated by law to have civil status.
 The press reported that in November 1997 the authorities at Reze (Loire-
 Atlantique) refused the naturalization of Moroccan national Khaddouj Tahir, who
 had been a resident of France since 1977, because she wore a hejab veil on her head
 during her final interview. In February newspapers quoted naturalization officials
 who stated that her garments signaled a "refusal to integrate into the French com-
 munity. . . if she wants to be French, she must dress like a French woman." Ac-
 cording to the law, applicants for naturalization must demonstrate their assimila-
 tion into French society as well as their loyalty to the French nation.
 In May a court sentenced four skinheads for their role in the 1995 killing of Mo-
 roccan Inbrahim Bouraam. Mickael Freminet was sentenced to 8 years' imprison-
 ment for pushing Bouraam into the Seine River. David Halbin, David Parent, and
 Christophe Calame were sentenced to prison for 5 years-4 of them suspended-for
 failing to assist a person in danger.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association
 for all workers. Trade unions exercise significant economic and political influence,
 although less than 10 percent of the work force is unionized. Unions have legally
 mandated roles (as do employers) in the administration of social institutions, includ-
 ing social security (health care and most retirement systems), the unemployment in-
 
 
 1260
 
 surance system, labor courts, and the Economic and Social Council, a constitu-
 /tionally mandated consultative body.
 Unions are independent of the Government, and most are not aligned with any
 political party. However, many of the leaders of the General Confederation of Labor
 and its unions belong to the Communist Party.
 Workers, including civil servants, are free to strike except when a strike threatens
 public safety. One-fourth of all salaried employees work for the Government. The
 number of workdays lost to strike action in the private sector reached a postwar
 low in 1998. Most of the widely publicized national strikes or protests occurred in
 the public sector or affected state-owned companies, and were called principally over
 salaries, privatization/ reorganization plans, and working conditions (of which hours
 and staffing were the primary issues). Teachers and health care workers mounted
 several strikes and protests over pay, personnel levels, and government efforts to
 reform the educational and health care systems. Railway workers disrupted train
 service during peak travel periods during the spring and late fall in support of man-
 ning levels, pay claims, and to force government concessions on reorganization
 plans. Rail unions supported a 1-day European rail strike in December over plans
 to privatize freight services. Prison workers in April mounted a limited strike over
 personnel levels and working conditions. A 2-month strike at a military shipyard
 in Toulon from April to June disrupted some operations at a nearby naval base. An
 Air France pilots strike in May and June over the establishment of a two-tier per-
 sonnel system and pay issues led to the suspension of nearly all Air France flights
 and the serious disruption of other air traffic. French truckers in September blocked
 international border crossings and some major highways as part of a European-
 wide, 1-day action to protest low wage rates in the trucking sector. Public transpor-
 tation workers in Paris and other major cities struck throughout the year but par-
 ticularly in October over mounting violence directed against them. In December
 journalists again struck for retention of a special tax break threatened by the Gov-
 ernment. Workers at some museums and national monuments in Paris struck in the
 late fall over staffing, pay, and work hours, while workers at the National Library
 struck over working conditions and malfunctioning equipment.
 The law prohibits retaliation against strikers, strike leaders, and union members,
 and the Government effectively enforces this provision. In September Peugeot set-
 tied a legal claim of discrimination against members of the General Confederation
 of Labor by agreeing to compensate 169 affected workers.
 Unions can freely join federations and confederations, including international bod-
 ies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers, including those in
 the three small export processing zones, have the right to organize and bargain col-
 lectively. The law strictly prohibits antiunion discrimination; employers found guilty
 of such activity are required to correct it, including the reinstatement of workers
 fired for union activities.
 A 1982 law requires at least annual bargaining in the public and.private sector
 on wages, hours, and working conditions at both plant and industry levels but does
 not require that negotiations result in a signed contract. In case of an impasse, gov-
 ernment mediators may impose solutions that are binding unless formally rejected
 by either side within a week. If no new agreement can be reached, the contract from
 the previous year remains valid. Over 90 percent of the private sector work force
 is covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated at national or local levels.
 Trilateral consultations (unions, management, and government) also take place on
 such subjects as the minimum wage, temporary work, social security, and unem-
 ployment benefits. Labor tribunals, composed of worker and employer representa-
 tives, are available to resolve complaints.
 The law requires businesses with more than 50 employees to establish a works
 council, through which workers ire consulted on training, working conditions, profit
 sharing, and similar issues. Works councils, which are open to both union and non-
 union employees, are elected.every 2 years.
 The Constitution's provisions for trade union rights extend to France's overseas
 departments and territories.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor, in-
 cluding that performed by children, is prohibited by law, and the Government effec-
 tively enforces this provision.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-With a
 few exceptions for those enrolled in certain apprenticeship programs or working in
 the entertainment industry, children under the age of 16 may not be employed. Gen-
 erally, work considered arduous or work between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.
 may not be performed by minors under age 18. Forced or bonded child labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and the Government effectively enforces this prohibition (see Section
 
 
 1261
 
 6.c.). Laws prohibiting child employment are enforced effectively through periodic
 checks by labor inspectors, who have the authority to take employers to court for
 noncompliance with the law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The administratively determined minimum
 wage, revised whenever the cost-of-living index rises 2 percentage points, is suffi-
 cent to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The hourly
 wage was changed to $7.18 (Fr 40.22) as of July 1. The legal workweek is 39 hours,
 with a minimum break of 24 hours per week. Overtime work is restricted to 9 hours
 per week.
 In June the President signed legislation lowering the legal workweek to 35 hours
 for firms with more than 20 employees, to become effective on January 1, 2000.
 Firms with less than 20 employees are to have until January 2002 to adjust to the
 new law.
 The Ministry of Labor has overall responsibility for policing occupational -health
 and safety laws. Standards are high and effectively enforced. Workers have the
 right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations. The law requires each
 enterprise with 50 or more employees to establish an occupational health and safety
 committee. Over 75 percent o a  enterprises, covering more than75 percent of all
 employees, have fully functioning health and safety committees.
