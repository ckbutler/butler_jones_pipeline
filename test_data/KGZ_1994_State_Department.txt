 KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
 The Kyrgyz Republic became an independent state in 1991. Although the 1993
 Constitution defines the form of government as a democratic republic with substan-
 tial civil rights for its citizens, the President, Askar Akayev, continues to dominate
 the Government. First elected President by the Kyrgyzstan Supreme Soviet in 1990,
 he was "reelected" in a 1991 referendum in which he was unopposed. His term of
 office was reaffirmed in a January 1994 referendum. Following a series of presi-
 dential decrees in September, an October 22 national referendum approved constitu-
 tional amendments allowing the Constitution to be amended by future referendums
 and calling for the formation of a new 105-member bicameral Parliament. Par-
 liamentary elections scheduled for December 24 were postponed until February
 1995.
 The Committee on National Security (KNB) has inherited much of its personnel
 and infrastructure from the Soviet Committee for State Security, or KGB. The KNB
 Chairman is a member of the Cabinet. The KNB appears to be under the full control
 of the Government, and it must conform its actions to the law.
 The Kyrgyz Republic is a poor, very mountainous country, with a predominantly
 agricultural economy highly dependent on trade with the other states of the former
 Soviet Union. The Government is committed to establish a market economy, encour-
 age privatization, and attract foreign investment. In 1994 it made significant
 progress in controlling inflation and stabilizing the currency, but industrial produc-
 tion and the standard of living continued to fall.
 The major human rights question raised in 1994 was whether the Government
 was manipulating the political system to ensure its retention of power. It closed two
 newspapers that had criticized its policies and engineered a parliamentary boycott,
 at least in part to prevent investigation of government corruption and to create a
 more malleable legislative body. Other human rights problems include executive
 branch domination of the judiciary (with concomitant lack of protection against arbi-
 trary detention and assurance of fair trial), and ethnic discrimination.
 In response to the exodus of the Russian-speaking people, the President issued
 two decrees acknowledging that discrimination was one of the factors in their deci-
 sion to leave. In the same decrees, the President postponed the adoption of Kyrgyz
 as the official language until the year 2005, made Russian the official language for
 work in technical and scientific fields, and recommitted the Government to fighting
 discrimination. The more than 40 percent of the population that is non-Kyrgyz wel-
 comed this approach. Nevertheless, discrimination by ethnic Kyrgyz government of-
 ficials against non-Kyrgyz citizens remained a common complaint of the Russian-
 speaking and Uzbek population.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integriy of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Ex rajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of such killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances or abductions attrib-
 utable to government authorities or others.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Local independent newspapers have run numerous stories about police brutality. In
 most instances, it involved police physically abusi  uspects taken into custody. In
 the fall of 1994 over the course of 1 month, the police detained and beat two jour-
 nalists. When the press questioned a government minister, he said they had been
 beaten not as journalists but as citizens of Kyrgyzstan.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The judicial system continues to operate
 under the laws and procedures of the Soviet period. The procurator's office deter-
 mines who may be detained, arrested, and prosecuted. TheMinistry of the Interior,
 the KNB, and the General Procurator's office carry out investigations. Since 1990
 everyone arrested or charged with a crime has the right to defense counsel. The
 procurator's office responsible for the investigation often nominates the defense
 counsel, who is required to visit the accused within the first 3 days of initial incar-
 ceration. The old procedure, however, in which the accused had access to defense
 counsel only after the case comes to trial, is often followed.
 The Criminal Code permits the procurator to detain a suspect for up to 72 hours
 before releasing him or informing him of the crime he is suspected of having com-
 mitted. If the procurator elects to accuse a suspect, he must immediately advise de-
 fense counsel of that decision. The accused remains in detention while the procu-
 rator investigates the case and prepares to present it to the court. At the procu-
 rator's discretion, he may keep the accused in pretrial detention for up to 1 year.
 Upon expiration of the year, the procurator must release the accused or ask the Par-
 liament to extend the period of detention. Since independence there have been no
 known instances in which the Supreme Soviet voted for such an extension. The
 procurator, not the judge, is in charge of the criminal proceedings, and thus the
 courts continue to be widely perceived as a rubber stamp for the procurator and not
 a protector of citizens' rights. In addition, judges' salaries are abysmally low, which
 has led to the apparentfy we - grounded view among the population that judges'
 decisions can be easily bought.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tia.-The court system remains largely unreformed
 since the Soviet period. Once the procurator is ready, he brings the case of the ac-
 cused to court and tries it before a judge and two people's assessors (pensioners or
 citizens chosen from labor collectives). The accused and defense counsel have access
 to all evidence gathered by the procurator. They attend all proceedings, which are
 generally public, and are allowed to question witnesses and present evidence. Wit-
 nesses do not recapitulate their testimony before the court; instead they affirm or
 deny their statements in the procurator's files. Defendants in criminal cases are
 treated in a demeaning manner by being kept in cages in the courtroom.
 The court may render one of three decisions: innocent, guilty, or indeterminate
 (i.e the case is returned to the procurator for further investigation). Both the de-
 fendant and the procurator may appeal the verdict to the next higher court or to
 the General Procurator's office. However, the decision of a court to return a case
 to the procurator for further investigation may not be appealed, and the accused is
 returned to the procurator's custody where he or she may remain under detention.
 The Court of Appeal may review lower court decisions irrespective of whether a
 party to the decision has appealed. Changes to the lower court s decision frequently
 result in the imposition of a more severe penalty, and almost invariably so in crimi-
 nal cases.
 The Government has recognized the need to reform the system. Certain Western
 practices, including the presumption of innocence of the accused, have been intro-
 duced. However a deteriorating economy and a system staffed largely by officials
 trained during the Soviet period continued to impede reforms.
 The appointment of ethnic Kyrgyz to key positions in the judicial system has led
 to charges by non-Kyrgyz that the system is arbitrary and unfair, and that the
 courts treat Kyrgyz more leniently than members of other groups. Although system-
 atic discrimination is not clearly evident, it is credible in individual cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 1993 Constitution prohibits unlawful entry into a home against the wishes of the
 occupant and states that a person's private life, privacy of correspondence, and tele-
 phonic and telegraphic communications are protected by law. Current law and pro-
 cedures require the General Procurators's approval for wiretaps, searches of homes,
 interception of mail, and similar procedures.

 Personnel and organizations responsible for violations during the Soviet period
 have remained largely in place; however, no widespread and systematic violations
 of the privacy of citizens were reported in 1994, but the local press often cited har-
 assment of individuals by police on the street as a problem. Some citizens active
 in politics or interested in human rights believe that the privacy of their commu-
 nications was violated in 1994. Credible evidence is not available.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Pres.-In 1994 the Government restricted these rights.
 In 1992 the Supreme Soviet passed a law which calls for freedom of the press and
 mass media but also provides guidelines proscribing publication of certain informa-
 tion. The law supports the right of journalists to obtain information, to publish with-
 out prior restraint, and to protect sources. However, it also contains provisions that
 the Government used to restrict press freedom. For example, the law prohibits pub-
 lication of material that advocates war, violence, or intolerance toward ethnic or re-
 ligious groups; desecration of national norms, ethics, and symbols like the national
 seal, anthem, or flag, publication of pornography; and propagation of "false informa-
 tion." The law also states that the press should not violate the privacy or dignity
 of individuals. It requires all media to register with the Ministry of Justice and to
 await the Ministry's approval before beginning to operate.
 While a few fully independent newspapers and magazines exist in the capital, the
 Government continues to control the press in various ways. For example, President
 Akayev in July sharply criticized the press for alleged irresponsibility and proposed
 lega    ion to shut downthe parliamentary newspaper Svobodniye Gory. A Bishkek
 court in August ordered the closing of Svobodniye Gory, which had been outspokenly
 critical of the President. The newspaper's August 19 edition was impounded at the
 vernment printing house. The procurator brought a suit against Svobodniye Gory
 fallegedly pubishing "deliberately distorted information aimed at discrediting the
 President, circulating material which violates ethical norms, and deliberately insult-
 ing the leaders of foreign states and their symbols, thus significantly damaging the
 interests and integrity of the State and threatening its stability."
 On August 19, the President issued a decree establishing a council on the activi-
 ties of the mass media. According to the government newspaper Slovo Kyrgyzstan,
 "the council will help journalists in their work and prevent the use of the media
 from causing political instability and upsetting interethnic accord and civic peace."
 On August 23, the Ministry of Justice ordered the state-owned printing house to
 stop printing the weekly newspaper Politika, which had been a frequent critic of the
 President and the Government. The Ministry of Justice claimed that Politika was
 not registered as a newspaper, although it was a supplement to the legally reg-
 istered newspaper Delo, whose name appeared above Politika's masthead. Other
 newspapers, including government ones, print weekly supplements without having
 them registered separately.
 The Government owns all radio and television facilities, with the exception of a
 television station in the capital, which runs mostly videos copied in violation of
 international copyright laws, and two radio stations that play music and report
 news. No prior restriction or censorship existed for the electronic media during the
 first half of 1994, but Kyrgyz television remained government controlled.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Under the 1993 Constitution,
 citizens have the right to assemble and associate freely and did so without govern-
 ment interference. Permits are required for public marches and gatherings but re-
 portedly are routinely available.
 The 1991 Law on Public Organizations, which includes labor unions, political par-
 ties, and cultural associations, requires them to register with the Ministry of Jus-
 tice. A bureaucratic mentality, carried over from the Soviet period, is at least partly
 responsible for the difficulties some organizations find in registering, although ulti-
 mately all organizations have been able to register.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There are no governmental impediments to the revival
 and practice of all religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Government policy supports free travel within and outside Kyrgyzstan.
 However, certain policies imposed during the Soviet period remain in effect and con-
 tinue, to varying degrees, to restrict internal migration and resettlement and im-
 pede citizens ability to travel abroad.
 Under the    Soviet-era  law, citizens need   official government permission
 ("prpiska") to work and settle in a particular area of the country. Home and apart-
 ment owners are legally restricted to selling their property to buyers with such per-
 mission. However, this law has increasingly become irrelevant as people for eco-
 
 
 nomic reasons relocate within the country, freely selling their homes and busi-
 nesses.
 There is no law on emigration. Administrative procedures permit movement of
 people; however, citizens who apply for international passports must present a letter
 of invitation from the country they intend to visit or to which they intend to emi-
 grate. This policy was instituted during the Soviet period snd impedes unrestricted
 foreign travel. There were no reports, however, that citizens, after~presenting such
 a letter, were denied a passport or an exit visa. Emigrants reportedly were not pre-
 vented from returning to Kyrystan.
 To ease the difficulties for te members of the Russian- speaking minority to emi-
 grate and to handle in a more systematic manner the arrival of Tajik refugees, the
 Government began in 1993 to negotiate agreements with bth Russia and Tajikistan
 on management of the resettlement process and protection of migrants' rights. Is-
 sues bloc    the signing of a bilateral agreement with Russia are the legal status
 of their respective nationalities in each other's countries, and the procedure for al-
 lowing individuals to regain their citizenship if they wish to return to Kyrgyzstan
 once they have emigrated to Russia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to effect a peaceful change of government
 but do not have the ability to do so. The Government has maintained its hold on
 power by means of two one-sided referendums, the closure of two newspapers, the
 manipulation of the Parliament's closure, and a series of presidential decrees.
 In January President Akayev asked that the people confirm through a referendum
 their desire that he should complete his term of office. Few people took at face value
 the Government's claim that 95.94 percent of the electorate had voted and that
 96.43 percent of these had cast ballots in favor of the President. Most observers at-
 tribute these percentages to overzealousness on the part of the President's circle of
 advisers and local offcials, most of whom employed Sovit-style methods to get out
 the vote and to make sure it was overwhelmingly positive.
 In August the President asserted that Communists had caused a political crisis
 by preventing the legislature from fulfilling its role. Many observers suggested, how-
 ever, that the Government was motivated by a desire to squelch corruption inves-
 tigations and create a more malleable Parliament. A majority of deputies boycotted
 the last scheduled parliamentary session and prevented a quorum, thus making it
 impossible for Parliament to conduct any legislative business before its term expires
 on February 15, 1995. Deputies made public claims of being instructed to sign a
 "boyott" statement. The Setember 7 edition of Vecherniy Bishkek quoted a num-
 ber of purported "boycotters who said that they had never signed the document at-
 tributed to them in the government press.
 On September 20, the President issued a decree calling for a referendum to
 amend the Constitution and announcing the formation of an election commission
 composed of 15 people. However, Article 58 of the Constitution provides that only
 Parliament may create a central election commission. The commission appointed by
 the President consisted of 3 representatives of political parties, of whom 2 were
 members of parties established by the Government, and 12 persons from organiza-
 tions funded or otherwise controlled by the Government.
 On September 22, the President set forth by decree an outline of the structure
 and functions of local government organs. However, Article 93 of the Constitution
 provides that only laws, not decrees, can regulate the principles of the organization
 and activity of local government, thus placing it under the jurisdiction of the Par-
 liament and not the President. In addition, the President proposed that local gov-
 ernment administrative officials be eligible for election to the regional house of his
 newly propsed bicameral Parliament, despite the Constitution's ban on parliamen-
 tary membership for such officials. The decree also called for elections to local gov-
 ernment organs to take place on October 22, although the election districts had not
 yet been announced or the candidates nominated.
 On September 23, a presidential decree set October 22 as the date for a national
 referendum, propsing two amendments to the Constitution. One amendment stipu-
 lated that the Constitution could be changed by means of a referendum (the Con-
 stitution at that time did not allow this). The other amendment provided for a bi-
 cameral parliament, in which one house would have 35 permanently sitting mem-
 bers, the "lawmaking" house, while the other would have 70 members convened pe-
 riodically to approve the budget and confirm presidential appointees. The decree
 providedthat, based on the results of the referendum, the future parliament would
 make "the appropriate changes and additions" to five sections of the Constitution.
 The referendum contravened the procedures set forth in Article 96 of the Constitu-
 
 
 868
 tion, which provide clear guidelines for amending the Constitution. Both referendum
 questions were approved by over 80 percent of the votes cast. The election commis-
 sion reported an 86-percent voter turnout.
 Russian speakers also allege that a "ceiling" exists in government employment
 which precludes their promotion beyond a certain level The representation of ethnic
 Kyrgyz at high and intermediate levels of government is proportionally much great-
 er than the percentage of ethnic Kyrgyz in the general population. Russian speakers
 have been replaced m many positions in government, industry, and education by
 ethnic Ky     This gives credence to perceptions that career opportunities are lim-
 ited for those who are not ethnic Kyrgyz.
 There are no laws that restrict women or minorities from participating in politics
 or government, and recently a women's party was regtered in Kyrgyzstan. How-
 ever, out of the 22 ministries and state committees, ethnic Kyrgyz men head all but
 3; only 1 is headed by a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not restrict the activities of local human rights monitors or
 the delegations and representatives of international and nongovernmental human
 rights groups that visit Kyrgyzstan. There are two human rights groups, the
 Kyrgyz-American Human Rights Bureau and the Human Rights Organization. The
 former has publicly criticize dthe Government's violation of the Constitution. In ad-
 dition, in connection with the independent newspaper, Delo No, it has publicly taken
 up the causes of those who appear to have suffered injustices at the hands of the
 police.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government expresses strong commitment to protecting the rights of mem-
 bers of all ethnic religious, and linguistic groups as well as those of women. Articles
 15 to 20 of the onstitution protect the rights and freedom of individuals and pro-
 hibit discrimination, including on the basis of language. In an estimated population
 of 4.46 million, some 56.5 percent are Ky  , 18.8 percent Russians, 13.5 percent
 Uzbeks, and the rest Ukrainians, Tajiks, Kazakhs, and others.
 Women.-The law gives equal status to women in Kyrgyzatan, and women are
 well represented in the work force, professions, and institutions of higher learning.
 In rural areas, women are still seen only in the role of homemaker, mother, and
 wife. The press often reports abuse and violence against women, which is usually
 associated with abuse of alcohol. Normal law enforcement procedures are used in
 cases of domestic violence. The Government has not established programs to address
 these issues.
 Children.-In April Parliament ratified the U.N. Convention on Children. Since
 Parliament did not convene in the fall, it did not adopt local laws to bring
 Kyrgyzstan into compliance with the U.N. Convention. Authorities continue to rely
 on former Soviet law in this sphere. There is no monitoring of children's rights in
 Kyryzstan. Children in rural areas are commonly used to pick crops.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Reported complaints of discrimination cen-
 ter on the treatment of citizens who are not ethnic Kyzgyz. These groups, which
 make up over 40 percent of the population, are often an   the Russian-speaking
 minority. Members of this minority allege discrimination in hiring, promotion, and
 housing. They complain that government officials at all levels favored ethnic
 Kyrgyz.
 TKe 1993 Constitution designates Kyrgyz as the official language but provides for
 the preservation and equal and free development of Russian and other languages
 used in the country. However, many Russian speakers, particularly ethnic Russians
 and Ukrainians, still feel disadvantaged because they cannot speak Kyrgyz. They
 have called on the Government to adopt a policy of bilingualism. The Government
 has not established a universally available program of Ky   instruction for adult
 non-Kyrgyz speakers, although limited instruction is available.
 In general, adults who do not speak the language do not demand Kyrgyz-language
 instruction. On June 14, President Akayev issued a decree designed to protect the
 rights of the Russian- speaking minority and thereby reduce the outflow of Russian
 speakers. The decree states that the exodus of Russians from the country is caused
 by social and political reasons--ethnic hostility and job discrimination-and is hurt-
 ing the national economy. The decree stipulates that the Russian language will have
 official status alongside Kyrgyz in regions and at enterprises where Russian speak-
 ers constitute a majority, as well as in sectors, such as health services and technical
 sciences, where use of Russian is particularly appropriate. It also provides for the
 
 
 869
 fair representation of the Russian-speaking population in the national Government,
 local state administration, and on the boards of state organs and enterprises.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no special law to protect disabled individuals,
 nor any law mandating accessibility. Former Soviet law continues to remain the
 basis for any resolution of complaints. Government officials are inattentive to the
 issue, partly due to the difficult economic situation and the state of the budget.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 Labor Law provides for the right of all
 workers to form and belong to trade unions, and there is no evidence that the Gov-
 ernment tried to obstruct the formation of independent unions. However, the Fed-
 eration of Trade Unions of the Kyrgyz Republic, successor to the former official
 union, remains the sole trade union umbrella organization in the country. The same
 leaders are in charge, managing the State's social fund and retaining the possession
 of its previously held properties, as well as some of the resorts and sanatoriums fi-
 nanced by the official Soviet trade union council.
 In 1994 the Federation continued to be critical of government policies especially
 its policy of privatization, and their impact on working class living standards. Nev-
 ertheless, the Federation still regards itself as in a process of transition in which
 it is adjusting its relations with the Government with other unions in the former
 Soviet Union, and with unions abroad. The Federation remains affiliated to the
 Moscow-based General Confederation of Trade Unions, which succeeded the Soviet-
 era All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions.
 Nineteen of Kyrgyzstan's 20 union organizations are affiliated with the Federation
 and claim a total membership of 1.4 million. The exception is the growing Union
 of Entrepreneurs and Cooperative Members, which as of October claimed a member-
 ship of 100,000.
 While the right to strike is not codified, strikes are not prohibited. In 1994 there
 were no strikes. The threat of a strike by miners in the south was sufficient to in-
 duce the Government to address the group's concerns. There were no retaliatory ac-
 tions against this group, nor were there instances of human rights abuses directed
 at unions or individual workers.
 The law permits unions to form and join federations and to affiliate with inter-
 national trade union bodies. The Labor Law calls for practices consistent with inter-
 national standards. Since independent unions are still in their infancy, no meaning-
 ful affiliation with international trade union bodies has taken place.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law recognizes the right
 of unions to negotiate for better wages and conditions. Although overall union struc-
 ture and practice remain relatively unchanged since the Soviet era, there is growing
 evidence of active union participation in state-owned and privatized enterprises.
 However, the Government sets wage levels by decree in most sectors of the economy,
 although many state-owned factories have introduced systems of bonuses and other
 incentives in keeping with the Government's commitment to develop a market econ-
 omy. In the private sector, employers set their own wage levels.
 The law protects union members from antiunion discrimination, and there were
 no recorded instences of discrimination against anyone because of union activities
 in 1994. However, because the old management and labor leadership continues to
 dominate the labor movement, anyone who wishes to form an independent union
 faces formidable obstacles. This, along with a deteriorating economy, may discour-
 age independent union activity. According to Federation officials, in the course of
 the privatization process the workers of some enterprises, possibly under pressure
 from management, dissolved their primary trade union organizations. The Federa-
 tion also cited one example in which the organization charter of a newly privatized
 entity precluded its workers from engaging in union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law forbids forced or compul-
 sory labor, and it is not known to occur.
 d. Minimum Age for EmpZ     ent of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 18 years. Students are allowed to work up to 6 hours per day in summer or in
 part-time jobs from the age of 16. The law prohibits the use of child labor (under
 age 16); the Ministry of Education monitors enforcement. However, families fre-
 quently call upon their children to work to help support the family.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets a national, legally man-
 dated minimum wage at a level theoretically sufficient to provide minimal subsiste.
 ence. As of December 15, the minimum wage was about $6.00 (68 soms) per month.
 In practice, even the higher median wage is considered insufficient to assure a de-
 cent standard of living for a worker and family. The Federation is responsible for
 enforcing all labor laws, including the Law on Minimum Wages. As the Government
 
 
 870
 provides the overwhelming proportion of empoment, minimum wage regulations
 are largely observed. However, enforcement of labor laws is nonexistent in the grow-
 ing underround economy. Market forces help wages in the unofficial sector to keep
 pace with official wage scales.
 The standard workweek is 41 hours, usually within a 5-day week. For state-
 owned industries, there is a mandatory 24-hour rest period in the workweek.
 Safety and health conditions in fa tories are poor. The deteriorating economy hin-
 dered enforcement of existing regulations and prevented investment to improve
 health and safety standards. The April 1992 law established occupational health
 and safety standards, as well as enforcement procedures. Besides government in-
 spection teams, trade unions are assigned active roles in assurin compliance with
 these measures, but once again the rapidly deteriorating economic situation in the
 country has made the compliance record of businesses spotty.
