 FINLAND
 Finland is a constitutional republic with an elected head of state (president), par-
 liament, and head of government (prime minister), and with an independent judici-
 arhe security apparatus is effectively controlled by elected officials and supervised
 by the courts.
 Finland has a mixed economy, primarily and extensively market based.
 During 1996 there were no reported violations of fundamental human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From: r
 a. Political and Other Extmjudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrjudicial killings.
 
 
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials employed
 them.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for the right to fair public trial,
 and an independent judiciary vigorously enforces this right. The President appoints
 Supreme Court justices, who in turn appoint the lower court judes.
 Local courts may conduct a trial behind closed doors in juvenile, matrimonial, and
 guardianship cases, or when publicity would offend morality or endanger the secu-
 rity of the State. In national security cases, the judge may withhold from the public
 any or all information pertaining to charges, verdicts, and sentences. The law pro-
 vides for sanctions against violators of such restrictions.
 There were no reports of plitical prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of the press, and
 the Government respects this right in practice. An independent press, an effective
 judici  , and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom
 of spe    and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 . Freedom of Religion.-The law provides fr freedom of religion, and the Govern-
 ment respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 mpractice.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Approved refu-
 gees and asylum seekers are processed directly for residence. The issue of the provi-
 sion of first asylum has never arisen. There were no reports of forced expulsion of
 those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to peacefully change their Gov-
 ernment, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Women are fairly well represented in government. There are 67 in the 200-mem-
 ber Parliament, and 7 in the 18-member Cabinet. The Ministers of Foreign Affairs
 and Defense as well as the Associate Minister of Finance are women, as are the
 Speaker of Parliament and the President of the Bank of Finland. In 1995 Par-
 liament passed quota legislation for all state committees, commissions, and ap-
 pointed municipal bodies, requiring a minimum of 40 percent membership from each
 sex.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights gups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their fIdings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are very cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits any discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability, lan-
 guage, or social status, and the Government effectively enforces these provisions.
 Assaults by local "skinheads" on a black American in November 1995 focused at-
 tention on racism and xenophobia in Finland. President Ahtisaari mentioned the
 danger of xenophobia and racism in his New Year's speech to the nation. A ministe-
 rial group was established to devise a government program against racism by year's
 end,-initial plans include improved human rights training for olice and other offi-
 cials and more antidiscrimination education. Antiracism public relations activities
 increased and include projects targeting elementary and secondary schoos.
 Women.-The law provides for stringent penalties for violene against women;
 this provision is vigorously enforced by the police and the courts. The Union of Shel-
 
 
 936
 ter Homes as well as the municipalities maintain such homes for female, male, and
 child victims of violence in homes all over the country. The total number of shelter
 units is around 55. Studies show that the opening of a shelter home in an area
 brings cases of family violence out into the open. The concept of family violence in
 Finland includes negligence in care, psychological violence, and economic abuse. The
 annual number of calls to the police relating to domestic violence is no longer cen-
 trally compiled but is estimated at some 10,000 to 12,000. Shelter officials state that
 the figure is less than half of the number of actual incidents. Police statistics from
 January to June show an overall rise of 10 percent'in the number of assaults (statis-
 tics not broken down by sex). There were 100 cases of rape reported to police during
 this period. Government experts note no evidence of a significant change in the inci-
 dence of rape in rcnt years but say that as many as half of all rapes may go unre-
 ported.
 The government-established Council for Equality coordinates and sponsors legisla-
 tion to meet the needs of women as workers, mothers, widows, or retirees.
 In 1985 Parliament passed a comprehensive equal rights law which mandates
 equal treatment for women in the workplace  including equal pay for "comparable"
 jobs. In practice comparable worth has not been implemented because of the dif-
 ficulty of establishing criteria, but the Government, employers, unions, and others
 continue to work on implementation plans. Women's average earnings are 80 per-
 cent of those of men, and women still tend to be segregated in lower paying occupa-
 tions. While women have individually attained leadership positions in the private
 and public sectors, there are disproportionately fewer women in top management
 jobs.industry and finance, the labor movement, and some government ministries re-
 main male domated. Women are permitted to serve in the military. The Govern-
 ment's Equality Ombudsman monitors compliance with regulations against sexual
 discrimination. Of the 100 complaints processed by the Ombudsman between Janu-
 ary 1 and June 30, 29 cases were established as violations of the law.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. There is no pattern of societal abuse of children, and the national consensus
 supporting children's rights is enshrined in law.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the law has required since the 1970's that
 new public buildings be accessible to people with physical disabilities, many older
 buildings remain inaccessible to them. There is no such law for public transpor-
 tation, but each municipality subsidizes measures to improve accessibility to vehi-
 cles. Local governments maintain a free transport service that guarantees 18 free
 trips per month for a disabled person. The deaf and the mute are provided interpre-
 tation services ranging from 120 to 240 hours annually. The Government provides
 subsidized public housing to the severely disabled.
 Indigenous People.--Sami (Lapps), who constitute less than one-tenth of 1 percent
 of the population, benefit from legal provisions protecting minority rights and cus-
 toms. Semi language and culture are supported financially by the Government. The
 Sami receive subsidies to enable them to continue their traditional lifestyle, which
 revolves around reindeer herding. Sami have full political and civil rights and are
 able to participate in decisions affecting their economic and cultural interests.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the rights of trade
 unions to organize, to assemble peacefully, and to strike, and the Government re-
 spects these provisions. About 87 percent of the work force is organized. All unions
 are independent of the Government and political parties. The law grants public sec-
 tor employees the right to strike, with some exceptions for provision of essential
 services. In the first quarter of 1996, there were 36 strikes, 35 of which were wildcat
 strikes.
 Trade unions freely aflfliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 .to organize and hargain ollectively. Collective bargaining agreements are usuallyv
 based on inomes policy agements between employee and employer central organi
 zations and the Government. The law protects workers against antiunion discrimi-
 nation. Complaint resolution is governed by collective bargaining agreements as
 well as labor law, both of which are adequately enforced.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced or
 compulsory labor, and this prohibition is honored in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Youths under 16 years of age can-
 not work more than 6 hours a day or at night, and education is compulsory for chil-
 
 
 937
 dren from 7 to 16 years of age. The Labor Ministry enforces child labor regulations.
 There are virtually no complaints of exploitation of children in the work force.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated minimum wage, but the
 law requires all employers-including nonunionized ones-to meet the minimum
 wages agreed to in collective bargaining agreements in the respective industrial sec-
 tor. These minimum wages generally afford a decent standard of living for workers
 and their families.
 The legal workweek consists of 5 days not exceeding 40 hours. Employees working
 in shifts or during the weekend are entitled to a 24-hour rest period during the
 week. The law is effectively enforced as a minimum, and many workers enjoy even
 stronger benefits through effectively enforced collective bargaining agreements.
 The Government sets occupational health and safety standards, and the Labor
 Ministry effectively enforces them. Workers can refuse dangerous work situations,
 without risk of penalty.
