 The People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia is a
 self-proclaimed Marxist state headed by President Mengistu
 Haile-Mariam, who came to power in 1977 following political
 infighting for leadership of the 1974 revolution which
 unseated Emperor Haile Selassie. A new Constitution in 1987
 created new organs of government: a Council of State, a
 Council of Ministers, and a Parliament (the Shengo). The most
 powerful institution in the country, however, is the
 Marxist-Leninist Workers' Party of Ethiopia (WPE). Despite
 the trappings of representative government, power remains in
 the hands of President Mengistu, who is Chief of State,
 General Secretary of the WPE, and Commander-in-Chief of the
 Armed Forces. Ethiopia is in a state of civil war, with the
 regime seriously challenged by armed, active insurgencies
 which during 1989 moved beyond regional borders.
 Ethiopia's armed forces are the largest in sub-Saharan Africa,
 numbering between 250,000 and 275,000. Cuban troops withdrew
 in September after a 12-year presence. An extensive security
 apparatus under the Ministry of Internal Affairs attempts to
 control the population through a combination of surveillance
 and informers. The Government justifies these security
 measures and the size of its defense expenditures (estimated
 at 60 percent of the government budget) on the basis of
 external threats and internal insurrections. Military
 setbacks in 1988 and 1989 compelled the Government to seek
 diplomatic rapprochement with its neighbors and to try to
 negotiate settlements with some internal opponents, most
 notably with the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF),
 through the good offices of former U.S. President Carter, and
 with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), under
 Italian auspices.
 The Ethiopian economy is based on agriculture, which
 contributes 45 percent to the gross national product and more
 than 80 percent of exports and employs 85 percent of the
 population. Although the Government promotes the formation of
 collectives and cooperatives, peasant farms still account for
 about 93 percent of crop production, state farms for about 6
 percent, and producers' cooperatives 1 percent. The major
 agricultural export crop is coffee, providing 65 to 75 percent
 of foreign exchange earnings. In 1988. the controversial
 forced "resettlement" program of moving people vast distances
 to unpopulated areas was suspended for lack of funds, but the
 -mandatory "villagization" program to move families into
 villages in the same area continued in 1989, with no reports
 of accompanying violence. Periodic drought and famine, the
 Government's war effort, and Socialist economic policies have
 made Ethiopia the world's poorest country, according to the
 World Bank.
 In 1989 the overall human rights situation in Ethiopia
 remained generally deplorable. Major concerns included:
 widespread abuses such as summary executions by all parties to
 Ethiopia's civil strife; the use of torture as an accepted
 practice in interrogation; arbitrary, incommunicado
 detentions; the lack of fair public trials; serious
 restrictions on freedom of speech and press, assembly and
 association, and the right of citizens to change their
 government; and limitations on women's and worker rights. In
 May there was a coup attempt by the military leaders in which
 atrocities were committed on both sides. However, in
 September the Government announced.the release of remaining
 
 
 111
 ETHIOPIA
 members of the royal family and 84 other political prisoners.
 The Government has shown new tolerance of religious
 organizations and activities, including unacknowledged
 emigration of Ethiopian Jews as part of improved relations
 with Israel. While emigration remains restricted, the
 Government issued passports in unprecedented numbers. It
 allowed relief groups relative freedom in pursuing
 humanitarian concerns.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The May coup attempt resulted directly from military
 disenchantment with the regime and followed the loss of the
 Tigray region to insurgents in February. The attempted coup
 resulted in the executions of an unknown number of
 generals--one estimate stated 38 senior officers were
 executed--and other senior military officials and in the
 imprisonment of nearly 200 others. Atrocities occurred on
 both sides, with coup plotters murdering the Minister of
 Defense, and loyalists killing rebellious generals. In
 December the trial of the 14 most senior officers arrested in
 the aftermath of the coup attempt began.
 As a consequence of military setbacks in Tigray, the
 Government resorted to the forced conscription of youths in
 their early teens in April and May, which fed public
 discontent at the time of the coup. After new military
 reverses in the autumn, the Government launched a particularly
 brutal conscription campaign in November. Some youths who
 resisted conscription were shot. Reports also surfaced in
 1989 that guards used lethal force against children
 demonstrating at a government-run orphanage in November 1988,
 resulting in four deaths. The guards responsible for the
 deaths were arrested and charged. The results of this case
 remain unknown.
 Security forces used excessive force following the coup
 attempt to quash student demonstrations, reportedly killing
 two students (see Section 2.b.).
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports during 1989 of politically motiVated
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The 1987 Constitution notably omits a passage from the 1955
 constitution prohibiting cruel and inhuman punishment.
 'Torture has been used against members of most opposition
 groups, including the EPLF, the TPLF, and the Oromo Liberation
 Front (OLF).
 Political prisoners are initially taken to central
 investigation centers operated by the Ministry of Internal
 Affairs, such as the central prison and the notorious "Third
 Police Station" in Addis Ababa or the Mariam Gimki Center in
 Asmara. Interrogation is often combined with physical abuse,
 especially for those suspected of affiliation with an
 opposition or insurgent group. Common methods of torture
 include beating on the soles of the feet, suspension from a
 
 
 112
 ETHIOPIA
 rope in a contorted position, death threats, mock executions,
 sleep deprivation, and submergence to the point of
 unconsciousness in tanks of water.
 Following the May coup attempt, Addis Ababa's political
 detention centers were reportedly the sites of torture, as was
 the basement of the Menelik (or Grand) Palace. Ethiopian
 television showed film footage of the mutilated body of one of
 the coup plotters. Additionally, both sides desecrated the
 corpses of generals involved in the attempt. Coup
 sympathizers reportedly exhumed the body of the murdered
 Minister of Defense, dismembered it, and left the remains in a
 ditch. On the other side, loyalists in northern Ethiopia
 beheaded the corpse of General Demissie Bulto (a coup -
 sympathizer and former commander of the Second Army) and
 paraded the head through the streets of Asmara.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The 1987 Constitution provides for arraignment in court within
 48 hours, arrest warrants, a fair trial, protection against
 self-incrimination, and the right to counsel; however,
 Ethiopians suspected of antigovernment actions or sentiments
 continue to be subject to arrest or detention by the police
 without charge or judicial review. In politically sensitive
 arrests, the Government generally prefers to operate in
 secret, taking the suspect from home at night.
 Reports of arrests and detentions following the May coup
 attempt attest to the fact that these practices continued in
 1989. Additionally, family members of some alleged coup
 participants were arrested in broad daylight in a surprise
 move by authorities reacting to public rumors that arrests
 would only happen at night. Treatment of officers arrested in
 the coup attempt reportedly improved substantially by the end
 of 1989.
 On September 2, the Government released 8-7 prominent political
 prisoners, some of whom had "disappeared" in previous years.
 These prisoners were part of a larger amnesty on the eve of
 the Ethiopian New Year. In addition to the release of three
 grandsons of former Emperor Haile Selassie, the release
 included former Ambassador to Canada and Permanent U.N.
 Representative Berhanu Dinka, who "disappeared" in 1986, and
 long-missing members of political movements who fell out of
 favor with the Government during the turbulent late 1970's.
 In the wake of the amnesty, Ethiopia's remaining political
 detainees are estimated at between 400 and 500. At least 17
 members of the EPLF, TPLF, OLF, and other groups are held in
 two prisons in the Addis Ababa area. As in the past, sketchy
 information, especially as regards the situation in northern
 Ethiopia, prevents accurate estimates of the total number of
 opposition group members remaining in prison.
 A state of emergency declared in 1988 remains in effect in
 Eritrea and Tigray. Under it, security forces are empowered
 to stop, detain, and hold indefinitely without court or
 prosecutor's warrant, any person who has violated or is
 suspected of having violated the special emergency decree or
 who in any manner disturbs law and order within the emergency
 areas.
 An unspecified number of refugees from the Somali camps at
 Aware in eastern Ethiopia were arrested for selling food
 
 
 113
 ETHIOPIA
 ration coupons. At year's end, they were being held without
 trial by local Ethiopian authorities.
 In Erittea, 60 EPLF members took advantage of a government
 amnesty offer and surrendered for reeducation and
 reintegration into society. Voluntary repatriation, however,
 has not greatly reduced the number of Ethiopians who remain in
 exile, unable to return to Ethiopia for fear of persecution.
 As many as I million Ethiopians are believed to have taken up
 refuge in neighboring countries.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Ethiopia's judicial system remains bifurcated in practice if
 not in theory. While nonpolitical civil and criminal
 offenders are usually granted fair public trial, military and
 political cases are subject to official manipulation and
 executive meddling. The definition of what constitutes a
 "political" case is sometimes farfetched and usually relates
 to the Government's preoccupation with internal security.
 The Supreme Court is at the apex of the judicial system.
 Other judicial'bodies include a newly announced Supreme Court
 Council, a Worker's Control Committee, and military courts in
 contested areas. Kebeles (urban neighborhood organizations
 controlled-by the WPE) have since the 1974 revolution been the
 primary loal units of judicial decisionmaking and law
 enforcement. Their work has been marked by arbitrariness and
 a failure to follow procedures that would ensure the right to
 a fair trial supposedly guaranteed by the 1987 Constitution.
 When the Ministry df Internal Affairs allows political trials
 to take Place, they are almost always held in secret, with
 only the verdict (if even that) publicly announced. Even
 prisoners cleared of charges or whose terms have been
 completed may-not be promptly released from prison. Some of
 the most senior officers detained after the coup attempt were
 arraigned in December befbre a military tribunal in public
 session attended by local and foreign journalists. While this
 does not by itself guarantee a fair trial, it is at least less
 arbitrary than priot practices.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The 1987 Constitution provides for the "inviolability of the
 house" and protects against unlawful entry into private
 homes. In practice, warrants are not used for searches of
 offices or private homes. In Eritrea and other war-torn areas
 the state of emergency affords the armed forces great latitude
 in searching or even confiscating suspected premises.
 In the aftermath of the attempted coup in May, some families
 of suspectdd coup plotters were subjected to searches of their
 homes and seizure of their property, even though the targeted
 suspect may have already been in custody.
 Surveillance of persons, both visual and electronic, is not
 subject to legal restraints. All mail is subject to
 government monitoring. Ethiopian citizens can be called in at
 any time for questioning by authorities and for mandatory
 kebele meetings, political rallies, or marches. Refusal to
 appear for any of the events may result in imprisonment
 without hearing.
 
 
 114
 ETHIOPIA
 Local kebele association officials monitor urban Ethiopians,
 whereas peasant association leaders perform the same function
 in the countryside. These officials monitor visitors, items
 brought in and out of houses, any meetings, and adherence to
 local curfews. The scope of such surveillance and petty
 interference in the private lives of Ethiopian citizens
 depends heavily on the makeup of the kebele and its leadership.
 There are some indications that kebele control has diminished
 somewhat over the last year as a result of the general decline
 in the authority of the Government among many Ethiopians. The
 Government has also taken some steps to remove unpopular
 measures by: reducing pressure to join the WPE; no longer
 requiring party uniforms to be worn in government offices; and
 lifting the ban on Sunday driving.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 The major-events influencing human rights in Ethiopia during
 1989 were fighting in the northern parts of the country during
 the spring and fall, and the coup attempt against President
 Mengistu in May. Ethiopia's civil war, now in its 28th year,
 continues to dominate the decisions of a government pursuing
 its self-preservation at all costs. Both the Government and
 the various insurgent movements have practiced forced
 conscription, imprisonment without recourse, violence against
 civilian populations, torture, and extrajudicial killing.
 These abuses have taken place during a civil war and under a
 declared state of emergency in the northern part of the
 country.
 Major insurgent groups include the EPLF, active in Eritrea;
 the TPLF, active in Gonder, Shewa, Tigray, and Welo; the OLF,
 active in southeastern and western Ethiopia; the Ethiopian
 People's Revolutionary Party (EPRP), active in areas of Gonder
 and Meketel; and a new umbrella group calling itself the
 Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF),
 comprising the TPLF and its ally, the Ethiopian People's
 Democratic Movement (EPDM). There are another half-dozen
 minor insurgent groups.
 Insurgent forces made major advances in 1989 with the capture
 of Tigray and lightning thrusts south within 70 miles of Addis
 Ababa. According to press reports, the rebels claimed to have
 killed, wounded, or captured an estimated 30,000 to 40,000
 .government. soldiers and seized millions of dollars worth of
 military equipment during an autumn campaign. Also, in
 September the Air Force recommenced the terror bombing of
 Tigrayan townsmon crowded market days. When government forces
 bombed Mekele, the capital of Tigray, school children were
 among the casualties.
 The-poor showing of government forces in 1989 could be traced
 to poor morale, use of forced conscription, and to the loss of
 over 200 military officers in the May coup attempt.
 Eyewitnesses reported that government security forces killed
 and wounded teenagers resisting conscription. Ethiopian
 authorities also reportedly tried to impress a number of
 Somali Isaak refugees from refugee camps close to the Somali
 border; however, the refugees were released after they had
 been positively identified as Somalis by camp personnel.
 Recent Ethiopian returnees from Somalia were explicitly
 exempted from conscription by the government.
 
 
 ETHIOPIA
 During 1989 there were credible reports that all major parties
 to Ethiopia's civil war engaged in abduction, imprisonment
 without trial, torture, and summary execution of internal and
 external opponents. Factional disputes within and between
 insurgent groups were particularly violent, and included
 assassination of leaders. There are credible reports that the
 TPLF has forcibly conscripted teenagers and others as porters
 and support workers. In some areas the EPLF, the TPLF, and
 the OLF abducted local officials. There are numerous, albeit
 unconfirmed, accounts from TPLF-controlled areas of closed
 churches, destroyed clinics and schools, and destruction of
 basic infrastructure by the insurgents.
 Little information is available on the treatment of prisoners
 of war-(POW's). One insurgent group, the TPLF, as a matter of
 practice releases ordinary soldiers upon capture, after
 disarming them and donfiscating their footwear. The rationale
 for this action by the TPLF appears both humane (as a
 guerrilla group they cannot care for large numbers of POW's)
 and tactical, since it encourages some GPDRE units to
 surrender. On December 31, the EPLF announced plans to
 release 10,000 POW's under its control.
 Both the Government and the insurgents have seized upon the
 desperate need for food relief in 1989/90 as a political
 issue. Delfberately or not, the Government has underestimated
 the need for~food relief in some insurgent-controlled areas.
 The EPLF and:TPLF initially insisted on complete control over
 food distribution in areas held by them. By the end of 1989,
 however, there appeared to be some flexibility on all sides.
 Relief organizations and volunteer groups were allowed
 relative freedom in pursuing their humanitarian activities in
 all areas controlled by the Government. The International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), however, has been denied
 access to Eritrea following a dispute with the Government.
 The TPLF and EPLF have allowed these relief groups only
 limited access into areas under their control. There were no
 reported attacks on relief workers during 1989 by either
 government or rebel forces, although Ethiopian staff members
 were killed in riots at refugee camps in southwestern Ethiopia.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no freedom of speech or press in Ethiopia. The
 Government closely monitors the pronouncements of public
 officials; academicians, and clergy. Some instructors and
 professors in secondary schools and at the university have
 resisted the politicization of education. Academic freedom,
 although s~riously circumscribed, still finds limited
 expression at the university.
 The Government owns and operates all information media and
 exercises censorship through editorial boards and the Ministry
 of Information. Expression of unauthorized political opinions
 or of'views at variance with the official government line can
 result in imprisonment. Political, economic, and social
 policies are formulated at the top levels of the government-
 controlled media and government-organized citizen groups.
 Books and magazines are confiscated if deemed to contain
 sentiments opposed to the regime. Foreign magazines and
 newspapers are not readily available since foreign exchange is
 
 
 116
 ETHIOPIA
 not granted to purchase them. Foreign radio broadcasts and
 those of opposition groups are widely listened to by
 Ethiopians.
 During the search for the late U.S. Representative Mickey
 Leland and his party, the local press gave relatively open,
 accurate, and extensive coverage of the operation, and the
 Government allowed the foreign press corps freely to enter the
 country and to file reports without interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Notwithstanding constitutional provisions, assembly of any
 sort not previously approved by the Government is forbidden.
 In contrast, attendance at government-sponsored rallies,
 meetings, and parades is frequently mandatory and enforced by
 a wide range of sanctions. However, whereas frequent or close
 association with foreigners in the past may have resulted in
 government harassment and occasional detention, this is
 generally no longer the case. Trade and professional
 associations, such as the Rotary and Lions Clubs, are allowed
 to operate, although their membership and activities are
 monitored by the Government.
 In late May, students at Addis Ababa University attempted
 several demonstrations against the Government in the wake of
 the attempted coup. However, internal security forces,
 including special commandos, used excessive force to beat back
 the students before actual demonstrations began, reportedly
 killing 2 students and arresting at least 100. Similar
 incidents occurred at the local commercial and technical
 schools. Additional reports indicate the police broke up a
 student demonstration in Addis Ababa's Revolution Square by
 firing warning shots into the air. No one was killed,
 injured, or arrested on that occasion.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Ethiopian nationalism and traditional values, including
 religion, are an integral part of the national culture.
 Government policy no longer ignores or tries to suppress
 religion. In fact, religion is now being factored into
 aspects of national planning. This planning, though, extends
 to the selection of religious leaders sympathetic to party
 policy. The Government nationalized most church property
 (thought to include as much as 30 percent of all land holdings
 in Ethiopia at the time) when it took power in 1974, and the
 Ethiopian Orthodox Church reportedly is dependent on annual
 government compensation payments to cover clerical salaries.
 The Government's new attitude toward religion has resulted in
 increased respect for freedom of worship and proselytism for
 the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Islam as provided in the
 1987 Constitution. The Government continues to monitor
 religious practice and any teaching which might be contrary to
 its political views.
 Party members are officially prohibited from worshiping, but'
 this ban is not enforced. According to press reports, kebele
 officials often discourage church attendance, generally by
 scheduling mandatory meetings on Sunday mornings. The
 Goyernment expunges reference to any deity from official
 
 
 117
 ETHIOPIA
 statements and publications, television programs, and films,
 although government-controlled media still give routine
 coverage to church affairs and religious festivals. Ethiopian
 Orthodox church and Islamic holidays are recognized by the
 Government, and officials of both religions are allowed to
 exercise jurisdiction over civil matters such as marriage.
 Foreign Protestant evangelical organizations have experienced
 a general trend of greater tolerance from central and local
 government officials over the last 3 years. Local government
 officials allowed a number of churches that had been closed to
 reopen. The September 2 amnesty included the release of the
 leaders of the Ethiopian Evangelical Mekane'Yesus Church, some
 of whom were arrested over 5 years ago. The Government issues
 permits-to foreign missionaries to enter and work in Ethiopia
 in limited numbers, although ostensibly as development
 specialists, not as missionaries. The Jehovah's Witnesses,
 however, remain banned.
 Ethiopia's small Jewish population, known as Beta Israel or
 "Falasha" (a word meaning immigrant or outsider), lives in
 Gonder and Tigray, areas often associated with recurring
 insurgent activity. There have been no reports this year of
 atrocities or discrimination toward Ethiopian Jewry at the
 hands of Ethiopian authorities. Incidents of murder and
 thievery reported in late 1988 were Attributed to long-running
 social conflicts in which land disputes and criminal activity
 are seen as motivating factors; those Ethiopian Jews who were
 victims were not-attacked primarily because of their religious
 beliefs.  The Government permit5 foreign-sourced development
 assistance directed at Jewish areas, including assistance used
 for the construction of synagogues. The burning of a
 synagogue near Gonder city in November resulted from a fight
 between two Jewish communities over the location of a new
 synagogue.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel,' Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Ethiopia increased markedly during
 1989. While-insurgent-held areas in Tigray remain
 inaccessible to both Ethiopians and foreigners, the Government
 allowed resumption of travel by citizens between Addis Ababa
 and Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. The Government's
 controversial internal resettlement program remained suspended
 for lack of funding. Reports indicate that some of those
 previously resettled have been trickling back to their
 original home areas.
 The Government's mandatory villagization campaign, which
 collects scattered rural farmers into newly created villages,
 continued in.1989. It is sanctioned under the 1987
 Constitution, which states that "the state shall encourage the
 scatterqO rural population to aggregate in order to change
 their backward living conditions and to enable them to lead a
 better life-." The Government has announced plans that call
 for 50 percent of the rural population to. be moved into
 villages by 1993. Unlike in prior years, there were no
 reports during 1989 of violence associated with villagization.
 Travel abroad by Ethiopians was much freer in 1989 than in
 prior years, as the Government began issuing passports in
 unprecedented numbers. However, the processing of passport
 applications remains long and laborious. Exit visas must be
 used within 15 days of issue, and renewal can be difficult.
 
 
 118
 Foreigners wishing to travel within Ethiopia must still obtain
 travel permits, and access to areas of conflict remains
 restricted. For diplomats, however, the process of obtaining
 permits to travel to areas not in conflict has become largely
 a formality. Dur-ing 1989, only one permit request was denied
 to U.S. Embassy personnel.
 Emigration remains highly restricted, though marriage to or
 adoption by foreign nationals is allowed. The Ethiopian
 Government responded sharply to the U.S. Government's 1989
 immigrant visa lottery. Ethiopian postal authorities
 reportedly destroyed 100,000 applications mailed by those
 wanting to participate in the program. People coming to the
 Embassy for applications were beaten back by police at the
 Embassy's gates.
 Illegal emigration remains punishable by imprisonment or, in
 exceptional cases, by death. Nonetheless, considerable
 illegal emigration occurs either under the subterfuge of
 travel abroad for business or to visit relatives, or by
 overland treks and surreptitious crossing of borders.
 The Government recognizes the right of voluntary repatriation,
 and its proclamation of amnesty for Ethiopians living abroad
 (numbering more than I million) remains in effect. Most of
 these are in neighboring countries, mainly in refugee camps.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 repatriation programs have successfully repatriated
 approximately 10,000 Ethiopians from Djibouti, Somalia, and
 Sudan since 1986. As of 1989, these official and spontaneous
 returnees came under the purview of a new tripartite
 commission composed of the Ethiopian and Somali Governments
 and the UNHCR.
 There are no reports that returnees were mistreated or
 discriminated against upon their return. Ethiopian refugees
 -in northern Somalia also may have returned to Ethiopia in an
 effort to flee civil strife in that country.
 Instability in neighboring countries has stimulated a
 large-scale refugee,movement into Ethiopia, with almost
 800,000 entering the cauntry--over 450,000 from Sudan and
 350,000-from.Somalia. Limited access to refugee camps by the
 international community has made it possible to monitor the
 level-of relief and protection provided, although the
 Gove-rnment h-s denied UNHCR permission to stay in the camps
 overnight.
 There have been no reports that the Government has
 systematically denied aid to refugees in Ethiopia. Also,
 there were no reports of forcible repatriation. violence at
 Somali refugee camps during July and early August was mostly
 among refugees themselves, although an Ethiopian guard was
 killed. Ethiopian staff members were killed during uprisings
 at Sudanese refugee camps at Fugnido and Itang during late
 September, which resulted from tribal tension between local
 Anuak people and Dinka and Nuer refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 Citizens of Ethiopia are not free to change their government.
 The 1987 Constitution institutionalizes all power in the WPE,
 the President, his advisers, and the 23-member Council of
 
 
 119
 ETHIOPIA
 State. Political and economic policies are still dictated to
 the populace with little opportunity for public debate.
 The WPE and its mass organizations purport to offer Ethiopian
 citizens a means of participation in government, but their
 real role is to ensure adherence to Marxist-Leninist
 principles. Official pressure on higher-level government
 officials to join the WPE has slacked off'in recent years.
 Many members of the bureaucracy have declined party membership
 without an adverse effect on their careers. Kebeles, the
 primary party/government control mechanisms at the local
 level, control housing allocation, basic food rationing,
 political indoctrination, and implementation of other
 government policies, such as registration and selection of
 youths'for national military service.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government resists attempts by international and
 nongovernmental organizations to investigate human rights
 cases. It did not respond to Amnesty International's call in
 1988 for an impartial investigation into reports of
 extrajudicial killings and lengthy and arbitrary detentions,
 particularly in Eritrea and Tigray. Ethiopian authorities did
 respond positively in 1989 to an international human rights
 organization's request for a list of the 87 political
 prisoners covered by the September 2 amnesty. There is no
 governmental or private body to investigate alleged human
 rights violations. Ethiopia is not a signatory to any of the
 United Nations human rights documents or the African Charter
 of Human and Peoples' Rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for the equality of all Ethiopians
 irrespective of nationality, sex, religion, occupation, social
 or other status. The highest government echelons are no
 longer dominated by the Amhara ethnic group but include many
 Oromos and a few Eritreans and Tigrayans. However, almost all
 senior government and political figures are of Christian
 origin, although the population is approximately 50 percent
 Muslim.
 American visitors to areas inhabited by Ethiopian Jews report
 the existence of some economic discrimination. The general
 poverty of the Jews has been aggravated by the Government's
 villagization campaign, which is true of other farmers forced
 to relocate from their traditional farming areas.
 The rights of women are protected and women are promised
 additional government support by the Constitution. However,
 sex discrimination persists in Ethiopia's tradition-bound
 culture. Various U.N. studies note cultural and traditional
 biases, marriages imposed at a very young age, hard and
 time-consuming labor, inadequate employment opportunities, and
 below-average wages in urban areas.
 Village leadership is invariably male, and all clergy are
 male. However, women in the principal Ethiopian cultures
 (Oromo, Amhara, Eritrean, and Tigray) enjoy certain economic
 rights equal to those of men. They may inherit, sell or buy
 property, and engage in business. In some rural areas, women
 
 
 120
 ETHIOPIA
 have a subservient status within the home, and child marriages
 remain common, despite opposition by the Government.
 Cultural attitudes about violence against women have improved
 since the 1974 revolution. While wife beating continues to be
 a problem, it is no longer as common as it once was. An
 Ethiopian woman does have redress to police protection if she
 is subjected to beatings by her husband, but the police are
 sometimes slow to respond. Women have successfully
 adjudicated many domestic violence cases in kebele courts,
 with offending husbands sometimes placed in kebele detention
 centers.
 Long established practices, such as female genital mutilation
 (circumcision), remain common among Ethiopian Orthodox
 Christian and Muslim families. The Ministry of Health,
 religious organizations, the Revolutionary Women's Association
 (created in 1980 with the goal of improving the status of
 women), and nongnvernmental organizations have engaged in an
 education and health campaign at the village level to
 sensitize the populace against female circumcision, early
 marriage, and harmful nutritional practices. A central tenet
 of this campaign is that female circumcision is itself an act
 of violence against women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 These is no independent labor movement in Ethiopia. The labor
 force is organized into two umbrella mass organizations under
 the control of the only legal political party. The Government
 sees its own interests and those of working people as
 identical and considers a single trade union structure
 necessary to build a developed, Socialist society. The right
 to strike is not recognized, and strikes are rare.
 The Ethiopian Trade Union (ETU) embraces industrial and urban
 workers with a combined membership of 318,000 (1988). Many of
 ETU's top leaders have been trained in Eastern Europe, and as
 an organization the ETU seeks to implement government policy,
 expand control over the workplace, and prevent work
 stoppages. The ETU is a member of Africa's continent-wide
 official trade union body, the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity, and is affiliated with the Communist-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions.
 Rural workers are organized under the Ethiopian Peasants'
 Association (EPA), which has 5.7 million members. The EPA is
 an umbrella organization of some 20,000 smaller peasants'
 associations, and in addition to being an implement of
 government control, promotes literacy and advances
 agricultural techniques. In some areas the local peasants'
 associations have tax collection and militia responsibilities.
 Despite guarantees on the freedom of association in the 1987
 Consitution (Article 47), farmers and workers are not
 permitted to organize outside the two recognized mass
 organizations. Ethiopia has consistently been criticized by
 the International Labor Organization (ILO) Governing Board for
 failure to observe ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of
 Association, which Ethiopia has ratified.
 In 1989 the ILO's Committee of Experts noted that a draft
 labor code is being drawn up and expressed the hope that it

 would correct existing defects such as the imposition of a
 single trade union system, the legal obligation of trade
 unions and peasants' associations to disseminate among workers
 the Government's development plans and Marxist-Leninist
 theories, the right of the ETU to affiliate with international
 organizatfons, restrictions on the right to strike, and
 nonrecognition of trade union rights for public servants and
 domestic personnel.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 In practice, collective bargaining does not exist. There are
 no export processing zones.
 c: Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Slavery was officially abolished in Ethiopia in 1942, but the
 legal code does not otherwise address the issue of forced or
 compulsory labor. In Socialist Ethiopia, citizens are
 sometimes called on to perform certain civic obligations,
 including "volunteer" assistance in community work projects
 such as road-building and emergency repair. In factories,
 workers are also expected to "volunteer" extra hours at no
 pay, so production quotas can be met.
 In 1989 the expanding civil conflict led to an often violent
 forced conscription of teenage youths. Beginning in April,
 there were eyewitness accounts of trucks picking up youths as
 young as 13 from Addis Ababa's market area. The latest round
 up of teenagers in Addis Ababa occurred in November. Forced
 conscription was also reported in other areas of the country.
 The young conscripts were often under armed guard and, by some
 accounts, sometimes chained together to prevent their escape.
 Quotas were established for each of Addis Ababa's kebeles.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The contract employment of children under the age of 14 is
 prohibited in Ethiopia. This restriction appears to be
 respected in factories, shops, and among domestic workers,
 although children under 14"are frequently seen as street
 vendors or beggars.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Current working conditions vary according to occupation and
 region, but hours are generally long, conditions poor, and
 wages low. Given high unemployment, there is pressure for
 existing jobs in the modern economy. The minimum wage in
 Ethiopia is 93 cents per day. Even in a country with the low
 per capita GDP of $106, such a low minimum wage is not
 sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for an urban
 worker and family. On the other hand, only unskilled day
 laborers usually receive such a low wage.
 Fringe benefits not required by law (transportation, meals,
 shelter) raise the effective minimum wage. In some
 corporations, fringe benefits reportedly account for almost
 half of the payroll. Low-paid workers often supplement their
 income by holding multiple jobs, receiving help from the
 extended family, and engaging in subsistence farming.
 Government wages have been frozen for 15 years. Some internal
 government surveys reveal that as many as two of every five
 salaried government workers earn less than what is required to
 purchase a typical Ethiopian "grocery basket."

 ETHIOPIA
 The law establishes 8-hour workdays and 48-hour workweeks.
 The maximum legal workweek is generally respected in practice,
 but as noted there is much uncompensated "volunteer" labor to
 meet factory or office quotas. Health and safety codes for
 the workplace are rudimentary and remain unenforced.
 Compensation for occupational injuries and disabilities is
 mandatory.
