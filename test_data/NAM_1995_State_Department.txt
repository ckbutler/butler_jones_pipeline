 NAMIBIA
 Namibia is a multiparty, multiracial democracy, headed by President Sam
 Nujoma, leader of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which
 won Namibia's first free elections in November 1989. President Nujoma and the
 SWAPO party received just over 70 percent of the vote in the December 1994 presi-
 dential and National Assembly elections, which despite some irregularities, were
 generally regarded as free and fair.
 The Namibian police, supervised by the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Na-
 mibian Defense Force (NDF), supervised by the Ministry of Defense, share respon-
 sibility for internal security. The Government continued its policy of detaining civil-
 ians trying to cross the border from Angola, occasionally shooting at those who did
 not respond to orders to "stop." There continued to be unconfirmed reports that NDF
 forces murdered several persons along this border. Police officers occasionally com-
 mitted human rights abuses.
 Namibia's modern market sector produces most of its wealth while a traditional
 subsistence agricultural sector (mainly in the north) supports most of its labor force.
 Mining, ranching, and fishing, the mainstays of the market sector, are still largely
 controlled by white Nanibians and foreign interests. However, government policy is
 to "Namibianize" the increasingly important fishing sector, so that more indigenous
 entrepreneurs are able to participate, and to provide opportunities for black
 Namibians in the potentially lucrative and labor-intensive tourism industry. There
 remains a wide disparity between income levels of blacks and whites which perpet-
 uates social and economic tensions in the country. The Government began imple-
 menting land reform legislation, enacted late in 1994.
 Citizens enjoy a wide range of constitutionally provided civil, political, and eco-
 nomic liberties. Nevertheless, there continued to be credible reports that police
 abused criminal suspects. SWAPO continued to delay providing a complete account-
 ing for missing detainees held during the preindependence period. Prison conditions
 remain harsh. Abiding by a High Court ruling that Namibian citizens had the con-
 stitutional right to return to their homeland, the Government permitted former
 counterinsurgency fighters-"Koevoets-to return to Nanibia. Inherited problems
 of racial discrimination and glaring disparities-epecially in education, health, em-
 ployment, and working conditions-continued in 1995, despite sustained efforts by
 the Government to reduce them, Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination
 based on race and gender, in practice women continued to exprience serious legal
 and cultural discrimination. Violence against women and chilren, including rape
 and child abuse, has risen to alarming levels. Societal discrimination against indige-
 nous people persists.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed reports of
 political or other extrajudicial killings. However, there were repeated, though
 unconfirmed, reports that NDF members murdered between three and five civilians
 along the country's northeastern border with Angola. NDF members were reportedly
 enforcing a "shoot to kill" order from the President effectively sealing the border
 with National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)-held territory
 in Angola. There is no indication that the Government has taken any action to in-
 vestigate NDF officers accused of the 1994 shooting of civilians along the border.
 In January the Prosecutor General decided to reopen the 1989 inquest into the
 death of SWAPO activist Anton Lubowski. Although in 1994 the court determined
 that he had been killed at the behest of the former South African Civil Cooperation
 Bureau (CCB), the Attorney General later ruled there was insufficient evidence to
 prosecute successfully Lubowski's assassins.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 Nevertheless, the public and political parties continued to focus on the unexplained
 disappearances of persons detained by SWAPO prior to independence. Roughly 200
 former SWAPO detainees are still unaccounted for. In 1994 senior SWAPO officials
 promised a omplete accounting of everyone who had died or disappeared during the
 eration struggle, but at year's end ths document had not been produced. This
 issue will likely remain controversial until the Government conducts a full inves-
 tigation and releases its results.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that "no persons shall be subject to torture or to cruel, inhu-
 man, or degrading treatment or punishment." There were credible reports, however,
 that members of the police beat or otherwise abused civilians, primarily during ar-
 rest and initial interrogation. Human rights organizations maintain that complaints
 of police brutality are not taken seriously by police officials in the northern part of
 the country, and that these officials have refused to accept criminal complaints
 against police officers. The case against three NDF soldiers who were accused of an
 unprovoked attack on two persons in Outjo in 1993 was dropped and the policemen
 were reinstated. The 1994 court case involving four police officers accused of beating
 prisoners in Oshakati police cells was similarly dropped; the police officers in ques-
 tion were reportedly reinstated during the year.
 Prison conditions are harsh, but do not generally threaten the life or health of
 prisoners. Human rights organizations continued to complain about overcrowded
 prisons and severe disciplinary action taken against prisoners. The Government ad-
 mitted serious resource constraints leading to overcrowded detention facilities, but
 in March it began important administrative reforms by creating a Ministry of Pris-
 ons and Correctional Services. This new Ministry, charged with administering the
 country's prisons and jails, has put special emphasis on correctional and rehabilita-
 tion functions, including vocational training. The Government also took an impor-
 tant step by deciding to end the practice of holding youthful offenders in the same
 cells as adult criminals. At year's end, the new policy had been put into effect only
 in the Windhoek area. It also stepped up the training of police and prison officials
 and continued to grant lrgal counsel, nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), and
 diplomatic officials regulir access to prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution forbids arbitrary arrest
 or detention, and the Government generally respected these provisions in practice.
 According to the Constitution, persons who are arrested must be informed of the
 reason for their arrest, and must be brought before a magistrate within 48 hours
 of their detention. A trial must take place within "a reasonable time," or the accused
 must be released. The accused are entitled to defense by legal counsel of their
 choice; the State provides counsel for the indigent.
 Some traditional leaders reportedly continued to detain and imprison persons ac-
 cused of minor offenses without recourse to plice or judicial review. The Govern-
 ment repeatedly condemned these actions and called upon the public to report such
 practices to the authorities. It also continued training traditional leaders on the
 legal limits to their authority.
 The Government does not use exile for political purposes, but until a court ruling,
 it temporarily blocked the return of former members of the preindependence
 counterinsurgency group, Koevoets who were in self-exile in South Africa (see Sec-
 tion 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 
 
 187
 The formal court system has three levels: magistrate's court, the High Court, and
 the Supreme Court. The latter also serves as the court of appeals and as a constitu-
 tional review court. Most rural Namibians first encounter the legal system through
 the traditional courts, which deal with minor criminal offenses, such as petty theft
 and infractions of local customs, among members of the same ethnic group. A spe-
 cial commission, created to make recommendations on the prospective jurisdiction
 of traditional courts, concluded that traditional cultural practices and structures
 should be maintained, provided they were consistent with constitutional protections
 and existing laws. At year's end, the Government had not yet presented its draft
 enabling legislation to Parliament.
 The constitutional right to a fair trial, with a presumption of innocence until prov-
 en guilty, is generally afforded by the judiciary. However, problems in the tradi-
 tional system and the long delays in hearing some cases in the regular courts limit
 this right in practice.
 The lack of qualified magistrates and other court officials has resulted in a serious
 backlog of criminal cases. There is also a shortage of attorneys; there were only
 about 140 lawyers engaged in private practice in Namibia in 1995. As a result, the
 courts continued to have a backlog of over 2,400 cases, which in some instances
 translated into a 6-month or longer delay between arrest and trial. To address these
 problems, the Government, together with the University of Namibia, provided in-
 service legal training to magistrates and other court officials at the University's
 training center.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides all citizens with the right to privacy and requires arresting
 officers to secure a judicial warrant for certain listed offenses before conducting a
 search. The authorities respected these rights in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for these fundamen-
 tal freedoms, including academic freedom, and the Government respected them in
 practice.
 The government-owned Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) operates most
 radio and television services. Although the NBC provides significant coverage of the
 opposition and airs viewpoints critical of the Government, there were growing com-
 plainshat the NBC, in particular the television service, became less balanced in
 its coverage of sensitive issues. Human rights groups complained that reporters en-
  and felt pressure to portray the Government favorably.
 adio has a much wider listenership than the television service andis ac-
 knowledged to be much more balanced in its reporting, but there have been allega-
 tions that Herer language programs have been taken off the air because of
 antigovernment rhetoric. There are three private radio stations and a private tele-
 vision cable service which broadcasts Cable News Network and South African news
 programs. A variety of privately owned newspapers operate without government re-
 striction and no apparent self-censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the Government respects these rights in
 practice. During 1995 various organizations, including political parties and religious
 groups, held large meetings and public gatherings without interference.
 In October police forces in the capital used tear gas and rubber bullets on a dem-
 onstration by ex-independence fighters injuring 12 persons. The ex-PLAN (People's
 Liberation Army of Namibia) fighters had taken a deputy minister hostage for sev-
 eral hours while pressing their demands for jobs and monetary payments from the
 Government (see Section 6.e.).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides citizens with the rights to travel freely, both
 domestically and abroad, to reside and settle in any part of-the country, and to repa-
 triate. In practice, the Government respected these freedoms. Following a High
 Court ruling, the Government permitted former counterinsurgency fighters and de-
 pendents (oevoets) who could document their Namibian citizenship, to return
 home. Koevets, members of a notorious counterinsurgency unit organized by the
 South African army, were believed to have committed egregious human rights
 abuses during the preindependence period.
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees officials have observed a marked improve-
 ment in the Government's policy with respect to refugees. Those in the refugee
 camps have been permitted to leave the facilities and some have been allowed to
 
 
 188
 work or study; however, some refugees' status had not yet been decided. The Gov-
 ernment urged the Namibian public to contribute to refugee assistance activities
 and to treat refugees humanely. Some 92 percent of the 1,320 recognized refugees
 in Namibia are Angolans.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised this constitutional right for the second time in December 1994
 in what were generally agreed-despite some irregularities-to be free and fair
 presidential and parliamentary elections. The Government printed and distributed
 useful and informative voter guides with lists of government and opposition can-
 didates and requested international election observers. There were televised debates
 and the opposition parties were able to campaign freely and seek voter support.
 The Constitution establishes a bicameral Parliament and provides for general
 elections every 5 years and regional elections every 6 years. Incumbent President
 Nujoma was reelected to a second 5-year term of office during the country's first
 postindependence elections for the National Assembly and president in December
 1994. The ruling SWAPO party won 53 of the 72 elected National Assembly seats,
 the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, the major opposition party) secured 15
 seats, and three smaller parties obtained a total of 4 seats.
 The DTA challenged the results of the election in January, based on discrepancies
 in four constituencies in northern Namibia where votes cast exceeded the number
 of registered voters. In March the three-member Namibian High Court rejected the
 DTAs challenge ruling 2-to-1 that Namibia's 1992 Electoral Act does not empower
 the judiciary or Electoral Commission to order the inspection of ballots in civil cases.
 The High Court did, however, permit the DTA to appeal to the Supreme Court. At
 year's end, the Court had not ruled on the case.
 Women are increasingly involved in the political process, but remain seriously
 underrepresented. During 1995 women held six positions at the Cabinet or
 subcabinet level and six seats in the two houses of Parliament. An additional three
 women were elected to the National Assembly in the December 1994 elections.
 Historic economic and educational disadvantages have served to limit the partici-
 pation of the indigenous San ethnic group in politics. The only San member of the
 National Assembly died recently, and at year's end had not yet been replaced.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local organizations, such as the National Society for Human Rights (NSHR) and
 the Legal Assistance Centre, operated freely, criticizing the Government's handling
 of the SWAPO detainee issue, the treatment of refugees, misconduct by members
 of the police, and other matters. In addition, other human rights organizations such
 as the Namibia Institute for Democracy, the Human Rights Documentation Center,
 the Center for Applied Social Sciences, and the Media Institute for Southern Africa
 worked openly on a variety of human rights problems affecting women, ethnic mi-
 norities, students, and other groups.
 In January, however, the Government brought charges against the leaders of the
 NSHR, for allegedly contravening a section of the Racial Discrimination Prohibition
 Act of 1991. The charges arose from a report NSHR published that sought to dem-
 onstrate the relationship between ethnicity and voting patterns in Namibia. In Feb-
 ruary the Government dropped the charges.
 Represntatives of international human rights organizations traveled to Namibia
 and discussed human rights issues with governmental and nongovernmental rep-
 resentatives. The Government also invited international observers to witness the
 December 1994 elections.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, creed, gender, or religion,
 and specifically prohibits "the practice and ideology of apartheid. Individual mem-
 bers of the Government have actively decried discrimination against women, the dis-
 abled, and those afflicted with AIDS, but little concrete action has been taken to
 end effectively discrimination in these and other areas.
 Women.-Violence against women, including beatings and rape, is a widespread
 and growing problem. Because of traditional attitudes regarding the subordination
 of women, many incidents of abuse are never reported to the authorities. However,
 in those few grave abuse cases where legal action has been initiated, the courts
 often sentenced male offenders, including spouses, to long terms of imprisonment.
 The courts sentenced convicted rapists to prison terms averaging 6 to 9 years. Dur-
 ing the year, the police opened another Women and Child Abuse Centre in the town
 
 
 of Rehoboth, adding to existing centers in Oshakati, Windhoek, and Keetmanshoop.
 The centers are staffed with specially trained female officers to assist victims of sex-
 ual assaults.
 Despite constitutional protections, women faced persistent discrimination in both
 formal and customary law and, most importantly, in deep-rooted societal practices
 by all ethnic groups. A number of preindependence statutes continued to discrimi-
 nate against women in such area a  property, business, and employment. For ex-
 ample, a married woman may not open a bank account without the approval of her
 husband or other close male relative. Also, under existing community property laws,
 married women of all groups are defied as legal minors and need the written con-
 sent of their husbands before they may legally acquire or purchase property. Tradi-
 tional practices also permit family members to confiscate the property of deceased
 men from their widows and children, particularly in northern Namibia.
 The Government, prodded by women's groups, began to address these inequalities,
 and on December 4 the National Assembly passed the Married Persons Equality Bill
 which would effectively abolish a husband's marital right as sole head of household
 and legal guardian of the children of a marriage. Upon passage by the National
 Council (the other house of the bicameral legislature), women in civil marriages may
 own property, take a job, and open a bank account without their husband's written
 consent.
 Chidren.--Children's rights, including those of protection from economic exploi-
 tation and from work that is hazardous or harmful to their health, education, men-
 tal, spiritual, moral, or social development, are enumerated in the Constitution. In
 practice, the Government has been able to commit only limited resources to the pro-
 tection of children's welfare. Child abuse is a serious and growing problem. The au-
 thorities vigorously prosecuted cases involving crimes against chidren, particularly
 rape and incest, and encouraged discussion and the issuance of printed materials
 in the schools. The Women and Child Abuse Centrs also worked to reduce the trau-
 ma suffered by abused children and provided training to police officials on handling
 this problem. In August the Ministry of Basic Education issued new directives in-
 structing schools to readmit teenage mothers. Previously, pregnant schoolgirls were
 expelled and not permitted to continue their education. The problem of teenage
 pregnancy as a result of sexual contact between teachers and students is widespread
 an  has ed to calls for disciplinary action against teachers who engage in sexual
 relations with students.
 People With Disabilities.-There were no reports of official discrimination on the
 basis of disability, and the Government continued its efforts to provide the disabled
 with appropriate treatment and education. The Government does not legally require
 special access to public buildings for the disabled. However, some municipal govern-
 ments have installed ramps and special curbing at street crossings for the disabled.
 Disabled rights groups have complained, however, about a lack of rehabilitation fa-
 cilities.
 Indigenous People.-The San people, Namibia's earliest known inhabitants, his-
 torically have been exploited by other ethnic groups. The Government has taken a
 number of measures to end this societal discrimination against the San, including
 seeking their advice about proposed legislation on communally held lands and in-
 creasing their access to primary education. By law, all indigenous groups are able
 to participate equally in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and al-
 locations of natural resources. Nevertheless, the San and many otherpindigenous
 Namibians have been unable to exercise fully these rights as a result of historically
 minimal access to education and economic opportunities under colonial rule, coupled
 with their relative isolation in remote areas of the country.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minrities.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination
 based on race and other factors and specifically prohibits he practice and ideology
 of apartheid  Nevertheless, as a result of more than 70 years of South Arican ad-
 ministration, societal, racial, and ethnic discrimination persists, and some apart-
 heid-based statutes have not yet been repealed or replaced by the Parliament. Many
 nonwhites continued to complain that the Government was not moving quickly
 enough to lessen the continuing and serious inequalities in education, health, hous-
 ing,_employment, and access tog and
 Also, some opposition parties, including members of the Herero and Nama ethnic
 groups, claimed that the SWAPO-led government provided more development assist-
 ance to the numerically dominant Ovambo ethnic group of far northern Namibia
 than to other groups or regions of the country. In June the application by the "Bast-
 er community for the Government to return its tradition  an  in the Rehoboth
 area was demed by the High Court which ruled that the community's "traditional
 lands" reverted to the central Government upon independence. The Basters have ap-
 
 
 pealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which in October announced that it need-
 ed more time to consider the case.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association,
 including freedom to form and join trade unions. The 1992 Labor Act extended that
 right to public servants, farm workers, and domestic employees. Trade unions have
 no difficulty registering, and there are no government restrictions on who may serve
 as a union official. No union has been dissolved by government action. The Govern-
 ment's intention to prohibit both labor unions and the application of the 1992 Labor
 Act within the export processing zone (EPZ) in Walvis Ba was successfully chal-
 lenged by the National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW).
 Unions are independent of government and may form federations. The two prin-
 cipal trade union umbrella organizations are the National Union of Namibian Work-
 ers, and the Namibia People's Social Movement (NPSM). The larger NUNW contin-
 ues to maintain its strong affiliation with the ruling SWAPO party. Roughly half
 of the wage sector is organized to some degree, although less than 20 percent of full-
 time wage earners are organed.
 Except for those providing essential services (e.g., jobs related to public health
 and safety), workers enjoy the right to strike once conciliation procedures have been
 exhausted. Under the Labor Act, strike action can only be used in disputes involving
 specific worker interests, such as pay raises. Disputes over worker rights, including
 dismissals, must be referred to a labor court (which is convened on an ad hoc basis
 in the existing magisterial districts) for arbitration. The Labor Act protects legally
 striking workers from unfair dismissal.
 Unemployment, which is near 40 percent, remained a significant problem in Na-
 mibia, awfecting largely the black majority. Apartheid-era attitudes among employ-
 ers contributed to a Namibian labor scene characterized by growing tensions and
 turmoil. The deteriorating state of labor-management relations is evidenced by the
 spate of actual or threatened strikes, and an atmosphere of mistrust.
 Trade unions are free to exchange visits with foreign trade unions and to affiliate
 with international trade union organizations. Unions have exercised this right with-
 out interference. The American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organi-
 zations, through its African-American Labor Center representative in South Africa,
 provided technical assistance to the NUNW during regular visits to Namibia in
 1995.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1992 Labor Act guaran-
 tees employees the right to bargain individually or collectively. Collective bargaining
 is not widely practiced outside the mining and construction industries; wages are
 usually set by employers. As unions become more active, however, informal collec-
 tive bargaining is becoming more common.
 The Labor Act provides a process for employer recognition of trade unions and
 protection for members and organizers. The law also empowers the labor court to
 remedy unfair labor practices and explicitly forbids unfair dismissals, which may be
 appealed to the labor court.
 The Labor Act now applies to the prospective EPZ in Walvis Bay, after a com-
 promise was reached by the Government and NUNW representatives in August. The
 original EPZ legislation, enacted by Parliament early in 1995, exempted the new
 EPZ from the provisions of the Labor Act, thereby outlawing trade union activity
 within the zone. The compromise calls for revision of the EPZ act to allow applica-
 tion of the 1992 Labor Act, but still precludes strikes and lockouts. Labor-related
 issues in the EPZ would be referred to a special "EPZ Dispute Settlement Panel,"
 composed of employers and workers, for expeditious resolution.
 As business activity in the Walvis Bay EPZ has yet to get under way by year's
 end, the effectiveness of this compromise in securing the rights of workers in the
 EPZ could not be determined. Many trade unionists continued to challenge the con-
 stitutionality of the compromise, which effectively bars the fundamental right to
 strike in the EPZ.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law.
 Although there were no formal complaints filed with the Ministry of Labor, there
 were ongoing reports in the media that farm workers often receive inadequate com-
 pensation for their labor and are subject to strict control by farm owners. Ministry
 of Labor inspectors sometimes encountered problems in gaining access to Namibia's
 expansive, privately owned commercial farms in order to document possible Labor
 Code violations. A Wage Commission investigation into the plight of farm workers
 was started in 1995, but was not completed because funds to conduct the survey
 were reprogrammed for drought relief.
 
 
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the 1992 Labor Act, the
 minimum age for employment is 14 years, with higher age requirements for certain
 sectors such as mining, construction, and night work. Ministry of Labor inspectors
 generally enforce mimmum age regulations, -but children below the age of 14 often
 work on family and commercial farms and in the informal sector. Boys in the rural
 areas traditionally start herding livestock at age 7.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no statutory minimum wage law. In
 Windhoek's nonwhite townships, many workers and their families have difficulty
 maintaining a minimally decent standard of living. White Namibians earn signifi-
 cantly more on average than their black compatriots, in large part because whites
 own most of the country's productive resources and had access to education that en-
 abled them to take advantage of the skilled labor shortage.
 In 1995 former members of the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) dem-
 onstrated on several occasions to demand jobs and financial assistance. Although
 the Government established a special commission to find suitable employment for
 the ex-PLAN fighters, PLAN frustrations boiled over in October when the veterans,
 dissatisfied with the Government's compensation package, detained a deputy min-
 ister for several hours against his will. At least a dozen ex-PLAN fighters were in-
 jured when police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the unruly crowd (see
 Section 2.b.).
 After independence, the standard legal work week was reduced from 46 to 45
 hours, and includes at least one 24-hour rest period per week. An employer may re-
 quire no more than 10 hours per week of overtime. The law mandates 24 consecu-
 tive days of annual leave, at least 30 workdays of sick leave per year, and 3 months
 of unpaid maternity leave. In practice, however, these provisions are not yet rigor-
 ously observed or enforced by the Ministry of Labor.
 The Government mandates occupational health and safety standards. The Labor
 Act empwers the President to enfo   them through inspections and crimiMal pen-
 alties. The law requires employers to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of their
 employees and provides for their right to remove themselves from dangerous work
 situations.
