 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines retains the multiparty
 parliamentary system of government which it inherited upon
 independence from the United Kingdom in 1979. Democratic
 traditions and respect for the rights of the individual are
 well established. In July 1984, the New Democratic Party, led
 by James F. Mitchell, defeated the incumbent St. Vincent Labor
 Party, led by then Prime Minister Milton Cato, in peaceful,
 democratic elections. Constitutionally, elections must be
 held again by October 1989.
 The Royal St. Vincent Police is the only security force in the
 country. A small Special Service Unit (SSU) with some
 paramilitary training has been established within the police
 force, and a coast guard serves under police command. The
 Vincentian police maintain traditions of professionalism which
 place a high value on respect for human rights.
 A poor country with a very young population, St. Vincent's
 most serious problem is unemployment. The nation's economy,
 led by the vital banana industry, has largely recovered from
 major setbacks in recent years. A tropical storm in September
 1986 followed by further bad weather in 1987 severely damaged
 the banana crop and sharply reduced export receipts. Although
 agricultural production recovered in 1988, diversification to
 other cash export crops has made only limited progress.
 The country's human rights record remained good during 1988.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 -Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits these abuses, and there were no
 reports that any occurred.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that persons detained for criminal
 offenses be provided legal representation and that their cases
 be reviewed periodically. The Government assiduously follows
 these provisions.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for public trials before an
 independent and impartial court. Criminal defendants have the
 right to legal counsel, are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty, and have the right of appeal, ultimately to the Privy
 Council in London.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, and
 seizure. There were no reports of such abuses or of other
 government intrusions into the private lives'of individual
 citizens.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the
 press. The Government neither censors nor interferes in the
 operation of newspapers, two of which are published by
 opposition political parties and openly and freely criticize
 the Government's policies.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to assemble peaceably is provided for in the
 Constitution and respected in practice.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies
 to labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is complete freedom of religion and proselytization.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are provided for by law and honored in practice.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 St. Vincent has a multiparty parliamentary system of
 government in which the parties are free to espouse their
 views, and citizens have a right in periodic elections to
 choose among them. Constitutionally, general elections must
 be held at least every 5 years. In the 1984 general election,
 the New Democratic Party won 9 of the 13 seats in Parliament
 and ousted the St. Vincent Labor Party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although there is no local body which publicly monitors human
 rights violations, opposition political groups occasionally
 comment on human rights matters. The Government is responsive
 to public and private inquiries on its human rights practices.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under law
 regardless of race, sex, or religion, and these guarantees are
 respected in practice. Women traditionally have played a
 subordinate role in public affairs and in the economy but in
 recent years have begun participating in public education
 programs, health facilities, and family planning programs
 designed to provide more equal opportunities. The

 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 unemployment rate for women is considerably higher than for
 men. This is in part a reflection of the increasing entry of
 women into the labor force.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right to form unions, organize employees, and strike is
 defined by law and generally respected in practice. While St.
 Vincent is not a member of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO), unions are free to affiliate and do
 affiliate with international labor bodies. Unions are not
 controlled by the Government, and personal and property rights
 of trade unionists are given full protection under the law.
 Approximately 15 percent of the work force is organized.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There are no legal obstacles to organizing unions; however, it
 is not legally compulsory for employers to recognize legally
 constituted unions as exclusive bargaining agents. At least
 two such situations were referred to the Ministry of Labor in
 1988 for resolution through official polls to be conducted by
 the Labor Commissioner. There are no sectors or areas,
 including export processing zones, where union organization
 and collective bargaining are legally or administratively
 discouraged or impeded.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is illegal and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum working age is 15. This provision, monitored and
 enforced by the Labor Inspector's Office in the Ministry of
 Labor, is generally respected in practice.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The workweek is 40 hours over 5 days, and workers are
 guaranteed a minimum annual vacation of 2 weeks. The
 Government has made little progress in converting the loose
 arrangements covering occupational safety and health into
 statutes. Minimum wages are established by law for all
 sectors. Many minimum wages would not provide a decent living
 for workers and their families, but the great majority of
 workers earn more than the minimum wage. The current minimum
 daily wage rates range from $3.85 in agriculture to $5.00 in
 industry.
