 FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA
 The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is composed of 607 small islands ex-
 tending over a large area of the Central Pacific. Four states-Chuuk (formerly
 Truk) -Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap--comprise the federation. The population is esti-
 mated to exceed 100,000, mostly of Micronesian origin. The four states were part
 of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands administered by the United States from
 1947 to 1986 pursuant to an agreement wit the United Nations.
 Political legitimacy rests on the popular will expressed by a majority vote through
 elections in accordance with the Constitution. There are three branches of govern-
 ment: a president as chief executive and head of state, a unicameral legislature
 elected from the four constituent states, and a judicial system that applies criminal
 and civil laws and procedures closely paralleling those of the United States.
 Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is responsible for de-
 fense and national security. The FSM has no security forces of its own, aside from
 local police and other law enforcement officers, all of whom are firmly under the
 control of the civil authorities.
 The economy depends heavily on transfer payments from the United States, fish-
 ing, tourism, and subsistence agriculture.
 Traditional customs sustain a value system which distinguishes between people
 on the basis of social status and sex. The continuing breadown of those customs,
 including the breakdown of the extended family, has contributed to violence against
 women and child neglect--the principal human rights problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial K]lling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances or abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There was no known incidence of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal procedures, for the most part pat-
 terned after US. law, provide for due process, which is carefully observed. There
 is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Public trial is provided for in the Bill of Rights,
 and trials are conducted fairly. Juveniles may have closed hearings. The Chief Jus-
 tice of the Supreme Court is appointed by the President, with the advice and con-
 sent of the Congress.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such arbitrary interference, and in practice there is none.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These rights are constitutionally assured and
 observed. Each of the four state governments controls a radio station broadcasting
 primarily in the local language. Local television programming in some states shows
 videotaped and occasionally live cover age of local sports and political and cultural
 events. Subscription cable television, showing major U S. programming, is available
 in Chuuk and Pohnpi. Religious groups operate private radio stations. The national
 Government and the four states publish newsletters.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Asiaio.-The Bill of Rights provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and these rights are honored in prac-
 tice. During political campaigns, citizens often question candidates at public meet-
 ings. Formal associations are uncommon in Micronesia, but student organizations
 exist.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The FSM is hospitable to diverse religions, and mission-
 aries of many faiths work within the nation. The Bill of Rights forbids establish-
 ment of a state religion and governmental restrictions on freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on freedom of movement.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Congress is elected by popular vote from each state; the Congress then choos-
 es the President and Vice President from among its four at-large senators by major-
 ity vote. State governors, state legislators, and municipal governments are all elect-
 ed by direct popular vote. Political campaigning is unrestricted and, as there are no
 
 
 650
 
 established political parties, political support is generally courted from among fam-
 ily and allied clan groupings.
 Although there are no restrictions on the formation of political groups, there have
 been no significant efforts to form political parties.
 For cultural reasons in this male-dominated society, women have not reached any
 senior positions in government with one exception; one of the four state legislatures
 has a female member.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There were no known requests for investigations of alleged human rights viola-
 tions. While there are no official restrictions, no local groups concern themselves
 with human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex; Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Although the Constitution provides explicit protection against discrimi-
 nation based on race, sex, language, or religion, societal discrimination and violence
 against women remain serious problems.
 There are no cultural or institutional barriers to education for women. Statistics
 supplied by the College of Micronesia-FSM as well as by high schools and grade
 schools indicate that the percentage of female graduates at all levels now nearly
 equals that of males. However, women are still at the early stages of finding jobs
 beyond the entry level in both the public and private sectors.
 Women's roles within the family as wife, mother, homemaker, and childrearer re-
 main virtually unchanged from earlier times. Allegations of violence against women
 usually stem from domestic conflict between husband and wife, and wife beating
 under certain circumstances is still condoned among more traditional elements of
 the population. Alcohol abuse increasingly contributes to this problem. While as-
 sault by a husband or other male relative on women and children within the family
 is a criminal offense under law, most women are reluctant to bring formal charges.
 When formal charges are brought by women against men who assault them, the at-
 titude of the authorities is that such issues are best left to the extended family unit
 to resolve. At the same time, the breakdown of the extended family increasingly de-
 nies women even the traditional means of redress.
 In 1992 women began to have organizational representation at the national level
 with the formation of the National -omen's Advisory Council, made up of the Na-
 tional Women's Interest Officer (NWIO) and representatives from each of the four
 states. The NWIO position was funded in 1994, but the incumbent took only ten-
 tative steps to increase women's awareness of their legal rights.
 Children.-While children's rights are generally respected, child neglect has be-
 come increasingly common, a byproduct of the continuing breakdown of the ex-
 tended family. The Government has neither recognized child neglect as a problem
 nor taken steps to stop child neglect.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Non-Micronesians are prohibited from pur-
 chasing land in the FSM. For the most part, non-Micronesians share fully in the
 social and cultural life of the FSM. FSM citizenship for non-Micronesians is granted
 only by individual acts of the national Congress.
 People With Disabilities.-Neither laws nor regulations mandate accessibility to
 public buildings and services for the disabled. FSM schools have established special
 education classes to address problems encountered by those who exhibit learning
 disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.--Citizens have the right to form or join associations,
 and national government employees by law may form associations to "present their
 views" to the Government. However, as yet, neither associations nor trade unions
 have been formed in this largely nonindustrial society.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no law dealing spe-
 cifically with trade unions or with the right to ollective bargaining. Wages are set
 by individual employers. The Government is not a member of the International
 Labr Organization. Micronesia has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits involuntary servitude, and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There is no law establishing a
 minimum age for employment of children. While in practice there is no employment
 of children or wages, they often assist their families in subsistence farming activi-
 ties. The FSM does have a compulsory education law which requires that all chil-
 
 
 651
 dren begin school at the age of 6. Children may leave school when they reach the
 age of 14 or after completing the eighth grade, w nichever comes first.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The four state governments have established
 minimum hourly wages for government workers: $1.49 in Kosrae, effective October
 1992; *1.35 in Pohnpei, effective October 1991; $0.80 in Yap, effective January 1980;
 $1.25 in Chuuk, effective October 1994 (paychecks were sporadic to government
 workers as a result of Chuul's debt crisis in the latter half of 1994). Pohnpei is the
 only state that applies its minimum wage rate to the private sector. These minimum
 wage structures and the wages customarily paid to unskilled workers are sufficient
 to provide an acceptable standard of living under local conditions.
 There are no laws regulating hours of work (although a 40-hour workweek is
 standard practice) or prescribing standards of occupational safety and health. A fed-
 eral regulation requires that employers provide a safe place of employment. The De-
 partment of Health has no enforcement capability, working conditions vary in prac-
 tice.
