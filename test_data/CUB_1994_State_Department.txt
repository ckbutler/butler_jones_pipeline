 CUBA
 Cuba is a totalitarian state controlled by President Fidel Castro, who is Chief of
 State, Head of Government, First Secretary of the Communist Party, and com-
 mander in chief of the armed forces. President Castro exercises control over all as-
 pects of Cuban life through a broad network of directorates ultimately answerable
 to him through the Communist Party, as well as through the bureaucracy and the
 state security apparatus. The Party is the only legal political entity and President
 Castro personally chooses the membership of the select group which heads the
 Party. The Party controls all government positions, including judicial offices.
 Though not a formal requirement, party membership is a de facto prerequisite for
 high-level official positions and professional advancement.
 The Ministry of Interior is the principal organ of state security and totalitarian
 control. The Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) directed by President Castro's
 brother Raul, exercise de facto control over the Ministry. In addition to regulating
 migration and controlling the Border Guard and the police forces, the Interior Min-
 istry investigates nonconformity and actively suppresses organized opposition and
 dissent. It maintains a pervasive system of vigilance through undercover agents, in-
 farmers, the Rapid Reaction Brigades (BRR's), and the Committees for the Defense
 of the Revolution (CDR's). The Government has traditionally used the CDR's as a
 means to mobilize citizens aga t dissenters, impose ideloa conformity and
 root out "counterrevolutionary" behavior. However, given the severe economic decay,
 CDR'a are not as trong as they once were. Other mass organizations also inject gov-
 ernment and Communist party control into every citizens daily activities at home,
 work, and school.
 The Government continued to control the means of production and remained vir-
 tually the sole employer, despite some foreign investment and legalization of some
 types of self-employment. The economy remained in a depression, a result of the se-
 vere inefficiencies of the economic system as much as the collapse of Cuba's relation-
 ship with the former Soviet bloc and the end of $4 to $5 billion in annual Soviet
 aid. Gross domestic product declined to one-half of the 1989 level, and total foreign
 trade remained at around one-fourth of the 1989 level. The Government continued
 its austerity measures known euphemistically as the "special period in peacetime"
 and permitted citizens to hold foreign currency. For the first time in years, the Gov-
 ernment permitted a limited resumption of agricultural markets. The system of
 "tourist apartheid" continued, in which foreign visitors received preference over citi-
 zens for fbod, consumer products, and government services, as well as access to ho-
 tels and resorts from which Cuban tourists were barred.
 The authorities were responsible for the extrajudicial killings of citizens fleeing
 the country. The Government sharply restricts basic political and civil rights, in-
 
 
 366
 cluding the right of citizens to change their government; the freedoms of speech,
 press, association, assembly, and movement; as well as the right to privacy and var-
 ious workers' rights. The authorities neutralize dissent through a variety of tactics
 designed to keep opponents marginalized, divided, and discredited, or to encourage
 them to leave Cuba. Following a large antigovernment protest on August 5, the au-
 thorities detained several hundred people for several days without charges, includ-
 ing about 30 human rights leaders.
 While the Government normally restricts emigration severely, it suspended its
 policy regarding unauthorized departures in August and allowed about 30,000 Cu-
 bans to depart in privately owned boats and homemade rafts. It reinstated the pro-
 hibition on unauthorized departures following the conclusion of the US.-Cuba mi-
 gration agreement on September 9, but it agreed to use "mainly persuasive meth-
 ods" to prevent unsafe departures and did not reimpse criminal penalties for such
 departures.
 Toalesser extent than in the past, the Government continued to employ "acts
 of repudiation," which are attacks by mobs organized by the Government but por-
 trayed as spontaneous public rebukes, against dissident activity. The Government
 also metes out exceptionally harsh prison sentences to democracy and human rights
 advocates whom it considers a threat to its control.
 In March the U.N. Human Rilhts Commission (UNHRC) once again passed a res-
 olution endorsing the report o the UNHRC's Special Rapporteur, which strongly
 criticized Cuba's gross violations of human rights in great detail. As it did with his
 predecessor, the Government continued to refuse the Special Rapporteur permission
 to visit Cuba. However, in November the Government permitted a noninvestigatory
 visit by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, who sought to begin a dia-
 log with the authorities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Klling.-The authorities were responsible for
 the extrajudicial killing of dozens of people. In two separate incidents, government
 vessels rammed and sank boats used by citizens to flee the country. In April the
 Border Guard sank the Olympia, killing three people. In July government vessels
 sank the Trece de Matzo, killing some 40 people (see Section 2.d.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The police and state security officials systematically harassed, beat, and otherwise
 abused human rights activists and political dissidents in public and private as a
 means of intimidation and control. In January state security operatives severely
 beat Rene del Pozo of the opposition Socialist Democratic Current on his way to a
 meeting with another dissident. Four men beat Francisco Chaviano of the Council
 for Civil Rights in his home in March. The men threatened to kill Chaviano and
 then stole his motorcycle, which was spotted early the next morningat a nearby
 Ministry of Interior parking lot. While Lazaro Garcia, a leader of the Marti Associa-
 tion-Golden Age of Cuba, was collecting written allegations of human rights abuses
 from human rights advocates in May, two men attacked and beat him. They told
 him that he had already been warned against continuing his human rights activi-
 ties.
 The authorities continued to use acts of repudiation to intimidate human rights
 advocates and as a pretext for their arrest, although to a much lesser extent than
 previous years. Government security forces staged acts of repudiation by massing
 crowds of people outside homes of activists to harass and ridicule them, yell insults,
 and vandalize property. At time  police forced the targeted activist through the
 crowd, which physically beat or abiued the person. During such acts, police often
 arrested  advocates  "for their own   protection," then  charged  them  with
 counterrevolutionary activity and sentenced them to prison terms. Carlos Urquiza
 Noa, president of the Cuban Workers Union, was the object of an act of repudiation
 on June 4. The following day, a state security official threatened to revoke his house
 arrest and send him to Camaguey prison if he continued his union activities.
 The Constitution prohibits abusive treatment of detainees and prisoners. How-
 ever, police and prison officials often used beatings, neglect, isolation, and other
 abuse against detainees and prisoners convicted of political crimes (including human
 rights advocates) or those who persisted in expressing their views. State security of-
 ficials often subjected dissidents to systematic psychological intimidation, including
 sleep deprivation, in an attempt to coerce them to sign incriminating documents or
 to force them to collaborate.
 
 
 367
 The UNHRC special rapporteur has found prison conditions, which are character-
 ized by habitual beatings of prisoners, severe overcrowding, and the lack of food and
 medical care, to violate Cuban law. Prison officials severely beat Carlos Carrodegua
 Zamora, imprisoned for "enemy propaganda," at Kilo 8 prison when he asked for a
 mattress for his prison cell. He was unconscious for 2 days. Jorge Luis Domingues
 Rivas, imprisoned for "dangerousness," declared himself a prisoner of conscience and
 refused to wear his prison uniform. State security officials handcuffed him and beat
 him repeatedly, before placing him in a small, windowless punishment cell.
 At the Voisin prison in Guinea, eight prisoners died between April and June as
 a result of poor prison conditions, including lack of food and medical attention and
 an outbreak of leptospirosis (rat fever). The authorities denied medical care to politi-
 cal prisoner Guillermo Mejias, held at Boniato prison in Santiago de Cuba, despite
 his personal appeal to the prison director in April. His medical condition causes se-
 vere pulmonary problems involving convulsions.
 The Government claims that prisoners have guaranteed rights, such as family vis-
 itation, adeuate nutrition, pay for work, the right to request parole, and the right
 to petition the prison director. However, according to Cuban human rights advo-
 cates, the authorities frequently withdrew these hypothetical rights, especially from
 political prisoners. There has never been any indication that the authorities inves-
 tigated reports of abuse or took disciplinary action against the agents responsible
 for abuses against political prisoners.
 Jailers often place dissidents in cells with common, and sometimes violent, crimi-
 nals. The Government sentenced Sebastian Aros, vice president of the Committee
 for Human Rights in Cuba (CCPDH), to 4. years' imprisonment for enemy propa-
 ganda in 1992. Other prisoners severely beat the 62-year-old Aros in his ce  ate
 at night in February, ater weeks of threats and harassment. The authorities took
 no action against Arcos' attackers.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.--The authorities routinely use arbitrary
 arrest and detention. The Law of Penal Procedures requires police to ie formal
 charges and either release a detainee or bring the case efore a prosecutor within
 96 hours of arrest. It also requires the authorities to provide suspects with access
 to a lawyer within 10 days of arrest, but they routinely deny these guarantees to
 those detained on state security grounds. The Constitution states that all legaly
 recognized civil liberties can be denied anyone actively opposing the "decision of the
 Cuban people to build socialism." The authorities invoke this sweeping authority to
 arrifylengthy detentions of human rights advocates on the grounds they constitute
 counterrevolutionary elements. The n   C   Special Rapporteur found that the
 legal system lacks laws and institutions providing due process.
 The Penal Code also includes the concept of dangerousness, defined as the "special
 proclivity of a person to commit crimes, demonstrated by his conduct in manifest
 contradiction of socialist norms." Government authorities continue to intimidate crit-
 i and opponents by threatening prosecution under this article. If the police decide
 a person exhibits signs of dangerousness, they may bring the offender before a court
 or subject him to "therapy" or "political reeducation" (see Section 1.c.).
 Following the large antigovernment protest on August 5, the authorities detained
 several hundred people for several days without charges, including about 30 human
 rights leaders, most of whom had not participated in the protests. Several reported
 that the authorities beat them while they were in prison. Gloria Bravo, a member
 of the Association of Mothers for Dignity, had scars on her neck, chest, and arms
 from deep gouges made by long fingernails and welts on her back from a whipping.
 The Government also uses exile as a tool for controlling and reducing internal op-
 position. During the rafters' exodus in August and September, many human rights
 advocates reported that representatives of state security visited them and threat-
 ened them with detention if they remained in Cuba. In some cases, the agents of-
 fered them "assistance" in finding a raft or boat. Through these means, the authori-
 ties succeeded in forcing at least 10 human rights leaders to leave the country dur-
 ing the exodus. State security officials reportedly offered one imprisoned leader,
 Mercedes Parada Antunez, immediate release from prison and a place on a boat for
 herself and her two children if she agreed to accept exile. She refused. The Govern-
 ment also repeatedly offered exile as the condition for release to several prominent
 political prisoners, including Sebastian Arcos, Francisco Chaviano, Rodolfo Gon-
 zalez, and Yndamiro Restano (see Section L.e.), but none of them would accept such
 terms. In December the authorities released Luis Alberto Pita Santos, leader of the
 Association for the Defense of Political Rights, and Pablo Reyes Martinez, on condi-
 tion of their exile to Spain. Santos had been serving a 5-year sentence for illegal
 association, clandestine printing, and disrespect since 1990; Reyes had been serving
 an 8-year sentence for enemy propaganda since 1992.
 
 
 368
 Between mid-October and late November the Cuban Government detained ap-
 prximately 55 human rights advocates, including some of the most prominent dis-
 sident leaders, for periods ranging from several hours to several days. Several were
 detained twice during this period, including Corriente Civica Cubans leader Felix
 Bonne, who was detained for 4 days in October and 3 days in November. The au-
 thorities warned these dissidents against contacts with diplomatic missions, specifi-
 cally the US. Interests Section, and the international press during the November
 visit of U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso. State agents
 visited other activists at their homes and delivered similar warnings. The agents
 variously threatened the dissidents with formal arrest, imprisonment, and retalia-
 tion against their children if they continued to denounce human rights abuses in
 international forums. Some activists reported that agents even threatened them
 with "disappearance" and death. Those detained were held in small, overerowded
 cells without light or ventilation or a sufficient number of beds, forcing many to
 sleep on the concrete floors.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.--Cuban law and trial practices do not meet inter-
 national standards for fair public trials. Almost all cases are tried in less than 1
 day. Although the Constitution provides for independent courts, it explicitly subordi-
 nates them to the National Assembly (ANPP) and the Council of State, which is
 headed by Fidel Castro. The rubberstamp ANPP and its lower level counterparts
 elect all judges. The subordination of the courts to the Communist Party further
 compromises the judiciary's independence. Human Rights Watch/Americas has re-
 ported that "trials staged in courts that lack independence ended in convictions and
 prison sentences that rank among the stiffest for thought crimes in the last 10
 years." There is no known case in which a court has ruled against the Government
 on any political or security matter.
 Civil courts exist at municipal, provincial, and supreme court levels. Panels com-
 posed of a mix of professionay certified and lay judges preside over them. There
 are  no  jury   trials. Military  tribunals  assume  jurisdiction  for  certain
 counterrevolutionary cases. Most trials are public; however, trials are closed when
 state security is allegedly involved. Prosecutors may introduce testimony from a
 CDR member as to the revolutionary background of a defendant, which may contrib-
 ute to either a longer or shorter sentence. The law recognizes the right of appeal
 in municipal courts but limits it in provincial courts to cases such as those involving
 maximum prison terms or the death penalty. The law requires that an appeal be
 filed within 5 days of the verdict.
 Criteria for presenting evidence, especially in cases of human rights advocates,
 are arbitrary and discriminatory. Often the sole evidence provided, particularly in
 political cases, is the defendant's confession, usually obtained under duress and
 without the legal advice or knowledge of a defense lawyer. The authorities regularly
 deny defendants access to their lawyers until the day of the trial. Several dissidents
 who have served prison terms say they were tried and sentenced without counsel
 and were not allowed to speak on their own behalf.
 On September 10, a military court tried 11 alleged partiiants in the August 5
 antigovernment protest. The seven defense attorneys reporte y sought to have the
 cases dismissed for lack of evidence that the defendants even participated in the
 demonstration. Nevertheless, the court found eight of the defendants guilty and sen-
 tenced them to from 6 months to 1 year in prison.
 The law provides an accused the right to an attorney, but the ideological control
 the Government exerts over members of the state-controlled lawyers' collectives, es-
 pecially when they defend persons accused of state security crimes, thoroughly com-
 promises their ability to represent clients. Observers have reported reluctance
 among attorneys to defend those charged in political cases out of fear of jeopardizing
 their own careers.
 In March the State prosecuted Rodolfo Gonzalez Gonzalez, a prominent human
 rights advocate arrested during a government crackdown in December 1992, on
 charges of enemy prpaganda. The prosecution charged that Gonzalez lied about the
 treatment of political prisoners and the existence of civil disturbances in statements
 to the international press. The court admitted in evidence unsworn videotaped testi-
 mony and testimony by persons who admitted they did not witness the events in
 question. Despite strong evidence in Gonzalez's favor and weak evidence against
 him, the court found Gonzalez pilty and sentenced him to the 7 years' imprison-
 ment requested by the prosecution, one of the most severe sentences meted out to
 a human rights advocate in several years. After his imprisonment, the authorities
 twice offered him release if he would agree to accept exile; Gonzalez refused both
 offers, explaining that the State had unfiairly charged him and that it could not con-
 dition his release on obligatory exile.
 
 
 369
 According to human rights advocates there were at least 2,000 people imprisoned
 for various political crimes and probaly far more who were imprisoned for dan-
 gerousness.    The    Penal    Code    contains   several    articles  prohibiting
 counterrevolutionary activity. The authorities often imprisoned advocates for enemy
 propaganda, illicit association, contempt for authority (usually for criticizing Fidel
 Castro), clandestine printing or the broad charge of rebellion. They often bring the
 charge of rebellion against advocates of peaceful democratic change.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-AI-
 though the Constitution provides for the inviolability of one's home and correspond-
 ence, official surveillance of private and family affairs by government-controlled
 mass organizations such as the CDR's, remains one of the most pervasive and re-
 pressive features of Cuban life. The State has assumed the right to interfere in the
 lives of citizens, even those who do not actively oppose the Government and its prac-
 tices. The Communist Party controls the mass organizations which permeate soci-
 ety, although to a lesser extent than in the past because of the collapsing economy.
 Their ostensible purpose is to "improve" the citizenry, but in fact their goal is to
 discover and discourage nonconformity.
 The authorities utilize a wide range of social controls. The educational system
 teaches that the State's interests have precedence over all other commitments. In
 September Minister of Higher Education Fernando Vecino Alegret affirmed that
 commitment to the revolution, including a willingness to defend the revolution in
 the streets, was a condition for admission to the university. The Ministry of Edu-
 cation requires teachers to evaluate students' ideological character and note it in
 records the students carry throughout their schooling, which affect their future edu-
 cational and career prospects.
 The Interior Ministry employs an intricate system of informants and block com-
 mittees (the CDR's) to monitor and control public opinion. Guardians of social con-
 formity, CDR's are neighborhood security committees tasked with closely monitoring
 the daily lives of residents. CDR's often report on suspicious activity, including con-
 spicuous consumption, unauthorized meetings-including those with foreigners-
 and defiant attitudes toward the Government and the revolution.
 State security often reads international correspondence and monitors overseas
 telephone calls and conversations with foreigners. Citizens do not have the right to
 receive publications from abroad. Security agents subject dissidents, foreign dip-
 lomats, and journalists to surveillance. In March the Government lodged a formal
 complaint against two U.S. diplomats for distributing enemy propaganda; the dip-
 lomats had given a few copies of a Miami newspaper to fellow passengers on a train
 to Santa Clara.
 The authorities regularly search people and their homes without probable cause
 to intimidate and harass them. In August police searched the home of Pastor Her-
 rera, a leader of the human rights group "Alternative Criteria," and confiscated
 written human rights allegations, membership information, copies of a Miami news-
 paper, and Herrera's appointment pass to visit the U.S. Interests Section.
 The authorities regularly detained human rights advocates after they visited the
 US. Interests Section, confiscated their written reports of human rights abuses, and
 seized copies of U.S. newspapers and other informational materials. Police stopped
 two women, Isabel del Pino and Maria Valdes Rosado of the dissident religious
 group "Christ the King" on March 9, took them to a nearby police station, and sub-
 ected reporto a strip search. Police carefully searched their belongings and con-
 fscated reports of human rights violations they had written. Two state security offi-
 cials then threatened them with arrest if they did not stop their activities. In No-
 vember the authorities detained several activists following their meetings with a
 visiting Spanish official.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government does not allow criticism of the
 revolution or its leaders. Laws against antigovernment propaganda, graffiti, and in-
 sults against officials carry penalties of from 3 months to 1year in prison. If Presi-
 dent Castro or members of the National Assembly or Council of State are the object
 of criticism, the sentence is extended to 3 years. Local CDR's inhibit freedom of
 speech by monitoring and reporting dissent or criticism. Police arrested Lazaro
 Rivero de Quesada for wearing a T-shirt with the words "Abajo Fidel" ("Down with
 Fidel"), took him to a nearby police station, severely beat him, and then held him
 incommunicado for 8 days. A court subsequently convicted him of contempt and sen-
 tenced him to 6 months in prison. Even implicit criticism is subject to punishment.
 When Angel Luis Rodriguez Barrios asked police why they had not yet found the
 person responsible for robbing and killing his father the previous month, the police
 beat him and broke his jaw.
 
 
 370
 The Government rigidly monitored other forms of expression and often arrested
 people for the crimes of enemy propaganda and clandestine printing. Police arrested
 eight men and three women in April or distributing antigovernment flyers at a Ha-
 vana baseball stadium, and charged them with writing slogans against communism
 on walls. The courts sentenced three of the accused, Ivan and Ileana Curra and
 Jorge Alfonso, to 3 years at a labor camp and the others to from 1 to 3 years' house
 arrest.
 The Constitution states that electronic and print media are state property and
 "cannot become, in any case, private property. The Communist Party controls all
 media as a means to indoctrinate the pubic. All media can only operate under party
 guidelines and must faithfully reflect government views. No other public forums
 exist. The Government continued to jam US.-operated Radio Marti and TV Marti,
 although it usually did not jam other foreign radio broadcasts. Radio Marti broad-
 casts frequently overcame the jamming attempts.
 The Government's control often extends to the foreign press as well. Although the
 Government issued visas to large numbers of foreign journalists in April for a 2-
 day dialog with selected members of the exile community, 1 week later it prevented
 four menbers of a PBS news crew from doing an on-camera interview with noted
 dissident Elizardo Sanchez. While en route to Sanchez's house, three men claiming
 to be police stepped the news crew's car. They forced the crew members out of their
 car and took the car and the television cameras, valued at more than $50,000.
 Cuban authorities claimed the incident was probably an act of banditry and by
 year's end had taken no apparent action. The Government allowed Havana-based
 foreign journalists present for the August 5 antigovernment protests to file stories
 but not to transmit video footage due to unexplained 'technical difficulties" in the
 Government's satellite up-link capability. The journalists had to fly the video foot-
 age out by non-Cuban couriers; the Government subsequently shut these journalists
 out of official press events.
 The Government circumscribes artistic, literary, and academic freedoms. The au-
 thorities fired Marta Vidaurreta Lima from her position as professor at the Institute
 for Industrial Design after she wrote a letter in January to the University Student
 Federation criticizing the Government and its policies. Her dismissal notice stated
 that Vidaurreta Lima 'had exceeded the limits of the possible tolerance of ideas and
 points of view" and that in so doing, she had "lost the essential requisites to teach
 at this center.n" Similarly, the authorities expelled Carmen Gomez Fajo, a high
 school geography teacher, from her job in May because of "her lack of identification
 with the political principles that sustain our teaching." Gomez had expressed her
 disagreement with the government position that the US. economic embargo was the
 cause of all of Cuba's problems.
 In late October, the University of Havana prevented five professors from return-
 ing to their jobs for having submitted a letter in late September to the Rector of
 the University in which they criticized the Government and appealed for greater po-
 litical and academic freedom. The University did not formally dismiss them since,
 as the Rector wrote to one of them, a formal letter of expulsion would only be used
 to "do damage" with "false accusations about human rights."
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution
 grants limited rights of assembly and association, these rights are subject to the re-
 quirement that they may not be "exercised against * * *the existence and objec-
 tives of the Sociaist State." The law punishes any unauthorized assembly, including
 for private religious services, of more than three persons, even in a private home,
 by up to 3 months in prison and a fine. The authorities selectively enforce this pro-
 hibition and often use it as a legal pretext to harass and imprison human rights
 advocates. The authorities have never approved a public meeting of a human rights
 group. In January and a~ain in March, state security forces prevented a meeting
 of the dissident Socialist Democratic Current (CSDC), which was to be held at the
 home of CSDC president Vladimiro Roca, by forcibly barring access to Roca's home
 by group members.
 The Penal Code specifically outlaws "illegal or unrecognized groups." The Ministry
 of Justice, in consultation with the Interior Ministry, decides whether to recognize
 organizations. Apart from recognized churches and one or two carefully monitored
 groups such as the Masonic Order, small human rights groups represent the only
 associations outside the control of the State, the Party, and the mass organizations.
 The authorities continued to ignore numerous applications for legal recognition by
 various human rights groups, which then permits the Government to jail members
 of these groups for illicit association or target them for reprisals. The authorities
 discharged Rubiseyda Rojas Gonzalez, director of a trade school in San Antonio de
 los Banos, in March because of her association with the CSDC. Her dismissal papers
 
 
 371
 noted that "eminently counterrevolutionary" materials were taken from her, includ-
 ing copies of a Miami newspaper and a critical biography of President Castro.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-In recent years, the Government has eased somewhat the
 harsher aspects of its repression of religious freedom. In 1991 it allowed religious
 adherents to join the Communist Party. In July 1992, it amended the Constitution
 to prohibit religious discrimination and removed references to "scientific material-
 ism," i.e., atheism, as the basis for the Cuban State. While the Protestant Ecumeni-
 cal Council praised such actions, the Catholic Church replied with concern over the
 gap between the Government's rhetoric and actions. In late 1993, the Government
 harshly criticized the Catholic bishops' pastoral letter calling for national reconcili-
 ation and dialog.
 Despite legal changes, religious persecution continues. The State prohibits mem-
 bers of the armed forces from allowing anyone in their household to observe reli-
 gious practices. It exempts elderly relatives only if their religious beliefs do not in-
 fluence other family members and are not "damaging to the revolution.'
 The Government continued to use the Penal Code to persecute Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses and, to a lesser extent, Seventh-Day Adventists. The CDR's monitor and
 often harass Jehovah's Witnesses and Adventists because the Government considers
 them to be "active religious enemies of the revolution" for their refusal to accept
 obligatory military service or participate in state organizations. The CDR's also
 maintain surveillance over spiritualists (santeros) who give "consultations.&"
 The Government also harasses other churches. State security agents arrested
 Eliecer Veguilla, executive member of the Western Convention of Baptists, and
 Miguel Angel Leon, a Baptist minister in Cienfuegos province, in late January for
 counterrevolutionary activities and enemy propaganda, respectively. Officials told
 Veguilla's family that he was under investigation because he had associated with
 Western diplomats. They released Veguilla after 2 months; but continued to hold
 Leon
 The Government requires churches and other religious groups to register with the
 provincial registry of associations of the City of Havana and to obtain official rec-
 ognition. The Government prohibits construction of new churches, forcing many con-
 gregations to violate the law and meet in people's homes. Official recognition of all
 religious holidays ended in 1961. At that time, the Government prohibited nearly
 all religious processions outside church grounds and denied churches access to mass
 media. Despite obstacles raised by the Government, church attendance has grown
 in recent years.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foregn Travel, Emigr'ation, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not impose legal restrictions an domestic travel,
 except for persons found to be HIV-psitive, whom it initially restricts to sani-
 toriums for treatment and therapy before conditionay releasing them to the com-
 munity.
 The Government allows the majority of persons who qualify for immigrant visas
 or refugee status to leave the country. However, the authorities delay or deny exit
 permits in certain cases, usually without explanation. Many of the denials involve
 professionals who have tried to emigrate and whom the Government subsequently
 banned from working in their occupational field. The Government refuses permis-
 sion to others because it considers their cases sensitive for political or state security
 reasons. The Government also routinely denies exit permits to young men approach-
 ing the age for military service, even when it has authorized the rest of the family
 to leave.
 Author Norberto Fuentes, denied an exit permit to attend a conference on Ernest
 Hemingway sponsored by the PEN American Center, undertook a much-publicized
 22-day hunger strike before the Government allowed him to leave in September.
 The Government allowed dissident poet Maria Elena Cruz Varela to travel to the
 United States in May to receive an award from an international organization, but
 it refused prominent human rights advocate Elizardo Sanchez an exit visa in March
 to attend a conference in Spain because he criticized the Government's human
 rights record during a previous trip abroad.
 Until August, unauthorized departures by boat or raft were punishable by fines
 and prison terms of from 6 months to 3 years. On April 29, the Border Guard
 rammed and sank the "Olympia," a private vessel which had fled Cuba and was
 about 25 nautical miles north of the coast of Camaguey. Three of the 21 people on
 beard drowned, including two 6-year-old children. The Border Guard detained 10
 adult male passengers for 4 months, using blackmail and threats in an unsuccessful
 effort to obtain declarations that the sinking had been accidental. At year's end, the
 10 men still faced fines and possible prison terms. The Government awarded medals
 and bicycles to the members of the Border Guard responsible for the sinking.
 
 
 372
 In a second such incident on July 13, government vessels fired high-pressure
 water hoses at the tugboat Trece de Marzo in an attempt to prevent those aboard
 from fleeing Cuba. They then rammed and sank the boat. An official government
 statement admitted that there was a 'collision! when the pursuing vessels maneu-
 vered to intercept the Trece de Marzo, causing it to sink. The Border Guard rescued
 31 people, but approximately 40 others, including children, drowned. The Govern-
 ment ignored the Archbishop of Havana's call for a full investigation.
 The Government temporariy suspended its plicy regarding unauthorized depar-
 tures in August and aowed about 30,000 Cubans to depart in privately owned
 boats and home-made rafts. The Government resumed its prohibition folowing the
 conclusion on September 9 of the US.-Cuba migration agment, in which it
 agreed to use "mainly persuasive methods" to prevent unsafe departures. Criminal
 penalties for such departures were not reimposed. There have been no reports that
 the Government used inhumane method or physical force to stp the unsafe exodus
 by boat and raft. Under the terms of the accord, the Government agreed to accept
 voluntary returnees through normal diplomatic and consular channels. By year's
 end, 422 Cubans had returned voluntarily, but the Government had not agreed to
 a reliable mechanism that ensured swift return of all those who wished to return
 to Cuba.
 In August the Government eased restrictions on visits by, and repatriation of,
 Cuban emigrants. Cubans who establish residency abroad, and who are in posses-
 sion of government-issued "permits to reside abroad," may travel to Cuba without
 visas. Cuban emigrants now are able to return to live in Cuba, provided they did
 not engage in what the Government considers to be antigovernment activities while
 abroad.The Government further reduced the age of people eligible to travel abroad
 from 20 to 18 and extended the period for temporary stay abroad from 6 to 11
 months.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Right&- The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have no legal right to change their government or to advocate change.
 The Constitution proscribes any political organization other than the Communist
 Party. A small group of leaders select members of its highest governing bodies-the
 Politburo and the Central Committee.
 The authorities tightly control all elections. In the 1993 elections for the National
 Assembly, a candidacy commission composed of representatives of party-controlled
 mass organizations screened every candidate. The authorities allowed only one can-
 didate per seat. These procedures ensured that only government supporters would
 be on the ballot. Voters had only two options, either vote "yes" or leave the ballot
 blank. The Government forbids the formation of political parties, campaigning, and
 making campaign promises.
 The overnment has ignored calls for democratic reform and labeled activists who
 proposed them "worms" and traitors. It rejects any change judged incompatible with
 the revolution, as well as proposals by Cubans who seek nonviolent political change.
 The Government has systematically retaliated against those who have peacefully
 sought political change.
 Government leadership positions continue to be dominated by men. Although
 blacks and mulattos make up over half the population, they hold only 2 seats in
 the 26-member Politburo. There are very few women or minorities in policymaking
 positions. There are three women on the Politburo; the country's first female provin-
 cial party secretary was not chosen until 1993.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not recognize any domestic or international human rights
 group, nor permit them to function legally. As noted above, the Government subjects
 domestic human rights advocates to intense intimidation and repression. In viola-
 tion of its own statutes, the Government refuses to consider applications for legal
 recognition submitted by human rights groups. The main domestic human rights
 monitoring groups are the Cuban Committee for Human Rights, the National Coun-
 cil for CivilRights, the Human Rights Party of Cuba, and the Cuban Commission
 for Human Rights and National Reconciliation. There are also various umbrella or-
 ganizations that include a number of smaller human rights groups.
 The Government has steadfastly rejected international human rights monitoring.
 In 1991 Cuba's U.N. representative stated that Cuba would not recognize the
 UNHRC mandate on Cuba and would not cooperate with the Special Rapporteur,
 despite being a UNHRC member. The Government's position remains unchanged.
 It consistently refused requests by the Special Rapporteur to visit Cuba. However,
 
 
 373
 the Government did allow a brief visit by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human
 Rights from November 15 to 19. He met with a range of government officials in-
 cluding President Castro, as well as 18 human rights activists. He characterized his
 visit as the beginning of a dialog on human rights and distinguished it from the
 investigatory responsibilities of the Special Rapporteur. The Hig Commissioner re-
 iterated his request that the Cuban Government permit the Special Rapporteur to
 visit Cuba in compliance with his U.N. mandate.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Cuba is a multiracial society with a black and mixed race majority. The Constitu-
 tion forbids discrimination based on race, sex, or national origin, although evidence
 suggests that racial and sexual discrimination often occur.
 Women.-The Family Code states that women and men have equal rights and re-
 sponsibilities regarding marriage, divorce, raising children, maintaining the home
 and pursuing a career. The maternity law provides 18 weeks of maternity leave and
 grants working women preferential access to goods and services. About 40 percent
 of all women work. They are well represented in the professions, although few are
 in policy positions in the Government or Party.
 Information from various sources indicates that domestic violence and sexual as-
 saults occur, but violent crime is rarely reported in the press. There is no publicly
 available data regarding the incidence of domestic violence. The law establishes
 strict penalties for rape, and the Government appears to enforce the law. Prostitu-
 tion has increased greatly in the last few years; press reports indicate that tourists
 from various countries visit Cuba specifically to patronize inexpensive prostitutes.
 Children.-The Constitution states that the Government will protect "family, ma-
 ternity, and matrimony.' It also states that children, legitimate or not, have the
 same rights under the law and notes the duties of parents to protect them. Edu-
 cation is free and is grounded in Marxist ideology. State organizations and schools
 are charged with the 'integral formation of childhood and youth."
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Many blacks have benefited from the social
 changes of the revolution. Nevertheless, there have been numerous instances of po-
 lice harassment of blacks, including black foreigners and diplomats who were mis-
 taken for being Cuban. Many black dissidents also report that the authorities single
 them out for harassment.
 People With Disabilities.-The law prohibits discrimination based on disability,
 and there have been few complaints of such discrimination. There are no laws which
 mandate accessibility to buildings for people with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution gives priority to state or collective
 needs over individual choices regarding free association or provision of employment.
 The "demands of the economy and society" take precedence over individual workers'
 preferences. The law prohibits strikes; none are known to have occurred. Estab-
 lished labor organizations do not function as trade unions and do not promote or
 protect worker rights, including the right to strike. They are under the control of
 the State and the Party. The Party selects the leaders of the sole legal confed-
 eration, the Confederation of Cuban Workers. Its principal responsibility is to en-
 sure that government production goals are met.
 Despite disclaimers in international forums, the Government explicitly prohibits
 independent unions. There has been no change since the 1992 International Labor
 Organization (ILO) findingithat independent unions "do not appear to exist" and its
 ruin g that Cuba violated ILO norms on freedom of association and the right to or-
 ganize.
 Those who attempt to engage in union activities face government persecution.
 Government agents repeatedly harassed Lazaro Corp Yeras, president of the Na-
 tional Commission of Independent Trade Unions, during the year. On the night of
 May 1, for example, Corp was injured while riding his bicycle when the driver of
 a car forced him od the road. The driver then yelled profanities and insulted Corp
 for being a union activist.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining does not
 exist. The State Committee for Work and Social Security sets wages and salaries
 for the state sector. Since all trade unions are government entities, antiunion dis-
 crimination by definition does not exist. There are no independent unions.
 The Government in 1993 removed some of the restrictions on self-employment im-
 posed in 1968 and allowed people to apply for licenses to work in over 125 different
 occupations, ranging from hairdresser to muleteer. However, university graduates,
 employees in sectors determined to be government priorities, or any state employee
 
 
 374
 whose work is ruled necessary are excluded from qualifying. Also excluded are those
 who do not show proper labor discipline, a category which includes dissidents,
 among others. Furthermore, the State may revoke permission to work outside the
 state sector if it decides the worker's services are again needed.
 In May, in a putative effort to crack down on black marketeers, the Government
 approved Decree Law 149 on the "confiscation of goods and income obtained by
 means of improper enrichment," and it announced that it would revoke the licenses
 of many artisans for employing others, an illegal act under the law, or would arrest
 them for using materials of "dubious origin. The decree was to be applied retro-
 actively. Cuban radio reported in October that the authorities had confiscated
 8,485,706 pesos (equivalent to $85,000 at prevailing unofficial exchange rates) and
 a considerable number of vehicles, houses, livestock, and work implements under
 this decree.
 There are no known export processing zones in Cuba.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Neither the Constitution nor the
 Labor Code prohibit forced labor. The Government maintains correctional centers
 where people are sent for crimes such as dangerousness. They are forced to work
 on farms or building sites, usually with no pay and inadequate food. The authorities
 often imprison internees who do not cooperate. The Government employs special
 groups of workers, known as "microbrigades," on loan from other jobs, on special
 building projects. They have increased importance in the Government's efforts to
 complete tourist and other priority projects. Workers who refuse to volunteer for
 these jobs often risk discrimination or job loss. Microbrigade workers, however, re-
 portedy receive priority consideration for apartments. The military channels some
 conscripts to the Youth Labor Army, where they serve their 2-year military service
 requirement working on farms which supply both the armed forces and the civilian
 population.
 The ILO's Committee of Experts criticized Cuba for violating ILO Convention 29
 on Forced Labor, based on information provided by the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions. In response, the Cuban state labor committee in 1993 elimi-
 nated "merits and demerits" from workers' labor records.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum working age
 is 17 years. The Labor Code permits employment of 15- and 16-year-ods to obtain
 training or fill labor shortages. All students over age 11 are expected to devote 30
 to 45 days of their summer vacation to farm work laboring up to 8 hours per day.
 The Ministry of Agriculture uses "voluntary labor" by Student  ork Brigades exten-
 sively in the farming sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage varies by occupation and
 is set by the Bureau of Labor and Social Security. The minimum monthly wage for
 a maid, for example, is 165 pesos ($165 at the meaningless official exchange rate);
 for a bilingual office clerk 190 pesos; and for a gardener 215 pesos. The Government
 supplements the minimum wage with free medical care, education, and subsidized
 housing and food. Even with these subsidies, however, a worker must earn far more
 than the average monthly wage to support a family. The Government rations most
 basic necessities such as food, medicine, clothing, and cooking gas, which are in very
 short supply, if available at all.
 The standard workweek is 44 hours, with shorter workdays in hazardous occupa-
 tions such as mining. To save energy, the Government reduced workdays to 5 hours
 in many institutions. Workplace environmental and safety controis are usually inad-
 equate, and the Government lacks effective enforcement mechanisms. Industrial ac-
 cidents apparently are frequent, but the Government suppresses reports of these.
