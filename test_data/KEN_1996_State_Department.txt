 KENYA
 After 9 years as a single-party state led by the Kenya Africa National Union
 (KANU), a 1991 constitutional amendment restored multiparty politics. However,
 President Daniel arap Moi and his KANU party continued to dominate the political
 system. In addition to his role as President, Moi also commands the military serv-
 ices, controls the security, university, civil service, judiciary, and provincial, district,
 and local governance systems. KANU controls a majority of the unicameral National
 Assembly's 200 seats. The judiciary is subject to executive branch influence.
 The large internal security apparatus includes the Police Criminal Investigation
 Department (CID), the Paramilitary General Services Unit, the Directorate of Secu-
 rity and Intelligence (DSI), and the National Police. The CID and DSI investigate
 criminal activity and also monitor persons whom the State considers subversive.
 Members of the security forces committed serious human rights abuses, but fewer
 than in 1995.
 The economy includes a well-developed private sector in trade, light manufactur-
 ing, and finance. The predominant agricultural sector provides food for local con-
 sumption, substantial exports of coffee, tea, cut flowers, and vegetables, and ap-
 proximately 70 percent of total employment. Tourism remained the largest sing e
 foreign exchange earner. Tight monetary policies kept the annual inflation rate to
 a single digit. Annual per capita gross domestic product is $290.
 The Government's human rights record showed some signs of improvement from
 its very poor level in 1995, but serious problems remain in many areas. Police com-
 mitted numerous extrajudicial killings and tortured and beat detainees. The Gov-
 ernment arrested and prosecuted some police officers responsible for abuses. Au-
 thorities continued to use arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention, although with
 reduced frequency. Prison conditions are life threatening, and authorities infringed
 on citizens' privacy rights. The judiciary is subject to executive branch influence, al-
 though several judges dismissed confessions obtained through coercion. Citizens'
 ability to change their government peacefully has not yet been fully demonstrated
 at the presidential level. The Government continued to harass and intimidate those
 opposed to the ruling party. The Government continued to detain critics of the rul-
 ing party, including opposition parliamentarians, journalists, politicians, clergy,
 members of civic organizations, and human rights activists. However, the number
 of parliamentarians arrested continued to decline. The Government continued to
 limit freedom of speech, assembly, and association, and block opposition leaders' ac-
 cess to their supporters and electronic media. Some journalists practice self-censor-
 ship. It also continued to deny registration to new political parties and to interfere
 with opposition party meetings, though fewer meetings were dispersed in 1996 than
 in 1995. The Government has not addressed the root causes of factional violence in
 the Rift Valley and elsewhere in Kenya. Discrimination against women and against
 and among ethnic groups, and violence against women and children remained seri-
 ous problems. There were few incidents of ethnic violence; however, mob violence-
 at times resulting in death-remained a serious problem.
 The Government established a standing committee on human rights in 1996 and
 made some effort to conduct a dialog with human rights organizations. It responded
 
 
 in print to a detailed critique by one human rights organization; allowed human
 rights organizations to witness autopsies of several people who had died in police
 custody; overturned the 1995 deregistration of Clarion, a human rights nongovern-
 mentalorganization (NGO), and granted bail to members of Release Political Pris-
 oners (RPP) detained for holding an "unlicensed" meeting. The standing committee
 presented its first report to President Moi on December 12, but details of the report
 were not made public.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was one killing with political
 undertones, the murder of Karimi Nduthu, Secretary General of RPP in March. Un-
 known assailants shot and killed Nduthu in his Nairobi home. There was no specific
 evidence tying the Government to the murder, but RPP activists reported that the
 assailants took nothing of commercial value.
 Police frequently used lethal force in attempts to apprehend criminal suspects. Ac-
 cording to government figures, police killed 74 "suspected robbers" between June
 1995 and June 1996. The nongovernmental Kenyan Human Rights Commission
 (KHRC) reported that police killed 88 people in the first 9 months of the year, while
 a second organization reported 74 extrajudicial killings by security forces in the first
 9 months of the year, including 12 by torture. According to the Attorney General's
 office, 12 police officers were charged with brutality and wrongful killing in 1996.
 Human rights groups criticized some of these police shootings, claiming that the
 victims included innocent bystanders, and criticized the Government's failure to
 take appropriate action against the policemen responsible for the killings. The Gov-
 ernment argued that some of the civilian victims mn such cases were killed by crimi-
 nals and that other killings were justifiable killings in pursuit of armed criminals
 in their drive to control rampant crime, a claim disputed by some human rights or-
 ganizations. The Government prosecuted several police officers responsible for
 abuses, two of whom were convicted of murder.
 Several persons died in plice custody, reportedly as a result of torture. In March
 Peter Mukinyo Muhia died in police custody in Bombelulu. An autopsy showed the
 cause of death as internal bleeding and multiple bruises over his body inflicted
 while in police custody. In April Mwiniyi Khamas, a Mombasa security guard, died
 after 3 days in police custody; the post mortem report attributed her death to shock
 and severe bleeding. In May Joseph Kamau Kihara died in police custody in
 Makuyu, reportedly from torture during questioning about a car theft, and Noah
 Njuguna Ndung'u died in police custodin n Kandara, apparently from beatings. The
 autopsy performed by a police pathologist and witnessed by a family doctor and
 human rights organizations found that Ndung'u died after being hit on the head and
 chest with a blunt object which caused severe internal bleeding. There were also
 wound marks on beth buttocks, inflicted by a sharp object. The I C  reported 17
 deaths in police custody due to torture. Many prisoners died in custody due to life
 threatening prison conditions, including inadequate food and medical treatment (see
 Section 1.c.).
 Police investigated some extrajudicial killings by security forces. According to the
 Attorney General's office, about 25 police officers faced charges of brutality and ex-
 cessive force at the begining of the year. A poice officer was charged with the mur-
 der of musician Duncan Muiru Koronjo, who was beaten to death in Nairobi in
 March. However, there have been no effective police investigations into some of the
 more controversial cases of extrajudicial killing. These include the January murder
 in Nairbi of Joseph Kahungu Kama in his shop, which eyewitnesses alleged was
 perpetrated by a plain clothes policeman; the February shooting death of Patrick
 Kariuki and four other men in Nairobi in what his family called a case of mistaken
 identityi and the March king by police dogs of Peter Mukinyo Muhia while in po-
 lice custody in Bombolulu. There was no investigation of the beating death of
 Nichodemus Mang'ri in Nakuru by Youth Wingers of the ruling KANU party allein
 edly because he broke a hotel window. Opposition supporters claim that KAt
 youthwingers usually operate with tacit or explicit police approval. In June the High
 Court sentenced two administrative policemen to death for killing seven men in
 Nairobi in 1992. These were the first policemen known to be convicted of the use
 of excessive force. In June police reservist John Kangu was extradited from Singa-
 pore to face trial for the November 1994 deaths of a teacher and a church attendant
 whom he and another reservist mistook for thieves and killed. There has been no
 investigation of the November 1995 beating death in Murang'a of Jonathan Muni
 by three police officers, one of whom reportedly had a personal disagreement with
 
 
 Muni. The trial of three constables implicated in the death of Charles Ireri, who
 died in police custody in 1994, began in January.
 Police shot and killed three demonstrating students at Egerton and Kenyatta Uni-
 versities on December 16 and 18. The Government announced a "thorough inves-
 tigation" of the Kenyatta University shootings, but to date no report has been made
 public. No investigation into the Egertn slaying has been announced.
 Mob violence remained a serious problem. The KHRC documented 30 cases be-
 tween January and June in which suspected criminals were killed by ang  crowds.
 These cases of "mob justice" included a father and son burned to death by mobs on
 suspicion of being wizards and two policemen killed in separate incidents when mis-
 taken for thieves. The Government condemned the practice of mob justice and inves-
 tigated such cases but has not arrested anyone for participation in the violence.
 1.Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 in 1996.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that "No person shall be subject to torture or to inhuman
 or degrading punishment or other treatment.L"
 There continued to be credible reports that police resorted to torture and brutal-
 ity. The KIRC reported 90 cases of torture by police, including 17 deaths, in the
 first 9 months of 1996. The Attorney General's office reported that 12 police officers
 were charged with brutality and wrongful killing (see Section l.a.).
 According to KHRC, there were numerous cases of humiliation, intimidation,
 abuse and torture by police, typified by the cases below; in several instances, police
 use of torture resultedin death (see Section l.a.). In March police arrested 13-year-
 old Phillip Eshialo in Kakamega and beat and tortured him for 10 days in connec-
 tion with a bicycle theft involving his elder brother. Twenty people arrested in
 Kandara in May alleged that police whipped them, be at them with steel bars,
 pricked them in the buttocks with a sharp tool, and forced them to eat human
 waste. In January police detained and beat two Islamic leaders working with the
 Safina Party (see Sections L. and 1f.). In March police arrested and physically
 abused one journalist, then in May beat another (see Section 2.a.). In a particularly
 well-documented case, the KHRC published medical reports for the cases of Virginia
 Nyambura Wambui and Bernard Mirie Kariki, two of four people detained by
 Kiambu police in December 1995. The medical reports appeared to confirm the de-
 tainees' claims that they were whipped, kicked, beaten with sticks, and sexually
 abused, causing Wambui to suffer a miscarriage in her fifth month of pregnancy.
 All four were acquitted of robbery charges in July.
 In the same report, the KHRC also published a personal statement by Josephine
 Nyawira Nengi describing the beatings and forced starvation that she experienced
 for 3 weeks while in detention following her May 1994 arrest on charges of robbery
 with violence. She was finally acquitted of all charges in March but detained again
 with 20 other members of RPP in July (see Section 1.d.). Police also reportedly
 abuse street children (see Section 5).
 In the final weeks of 1996, there were a number of allegations of police torture.
 In November University of Nairobi (Kikuyu campus) student leader Solomon Muruli
 was reportedly detained by police for 5 days and tortured to obtain information on
 student unrest. The police commissioner responded to the public uproar by ordering
 an investigation into the allegations, but no report had been made by year's end.
 In December an unnamed woman was reportedly detained and tortured beaten and
 sexually molested) by Kanu youthwingers; a number of similar incidents have been
 reported in Nakuru, with police making no effort to intervene or prevent. On De-
 cember 9, a Kenyan military officer was reportedly detained and beaten by Nairobi
 police when he refused to make a holiday "contribution" after being stopped in his
 car.
 Prison conditions are at times life threatening, due in part to a lack of resources,
 and in part to the Government's unwillingness to address deficiencies in the penal
 system. Prisoners are subjected to severe overcrowding, inadequate water, poor diet,
 substandard bedding, and deficient health care. In October 1995, Justice Emmanuel
 O'kubasu stated that prisons are "death chambers." The same month, Home Affairs
 Minister Francis Lotodo reported that 814 prisoners had died in jails in the first
 9 months of 1995, due chiefly to dysentery and diarrhea. As of August 1994, Kenya's
 78 prisons held a daily average of about 39,000 inmates, 12,000 of whom were
 awaiting trial. Prisons are severely overcrowded, averaging 30 percent above hold-
 ing capacity. Some facilities, such as the Nairobi Remand Prisn, are overcrowded
 by several hundred percent. Rape of both male and female inmates is a serious
 problem, as is the growing incidence of AIDS. Prisons do not have resident doctors,
 and only one prison had a doctor permanently assigned. A medical doctor at Kamiti
 prison reportedly threatened to bind Koigi Wa Wamere and his two associates-op-
 
 
 133
 position activists convicted in 1995 on charges widely assumed to be politically moti-
 vated of trying to rob a police station of its armaments with a home-made weapon-
 and force the three prisoners to take antidepressants. In addition, the prison officer-
 in-charge refused to permit the special medical treatment and food ordered for them
 by the court.
 Officially, there is separate confinement for men, women, and children. However,
 there are cases in which men and women have been put in the same cells, and
 youths (as young as early teenagers) are frequently kept in cells with adults in over-
 crowded prisons and remand centers. The Government does not permit independent
 monitoring of prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite constitutional protections, police
 continued to arbitrarily arrest and detain citizens. The Constitution provides that
 most persons arrested or detained shall be brought before a court "as soon as is rea-
 sonably practicable," which is statuatorily definable as within 14 days of arrest or
 from the start of detention. A 1988 constitutional amendment allows police to hold
 persons suspected of capital offenses, such as murder and treason, for 14 days be-
 fore charging them in court. A 1993 amendment to the Penal Code excludes week-
 ends and holidays from this 14-day period. In practice, however, suspects are often
 held for 2 to 3 weeks or longer before being brought to court.
 Persons arrested and charged are usually allowed access to their families and at-
 torney. Prisoners, however, may be visited by family members and attorneys only
 at the discretion of the State. For those who have been charged, it is often possible
 to be released on bail with a bond or guarantees of return.
 The law does not stipulate the period within which the trial of a charged suspect
 must begin. The Government has acknowledged cases in which persons have been
 held in pretrial detention for several years, usually because of backlogs. There were
 credible reports of pretrial detention periods in excess of 5 years. Over 30 percent
 of prisoners are pretrial detainees.
 The Preservation of Public Security Act (PPSA) allows the State to detain a per-
 son indefinitely without charge or trial upon a determination that it is necessary
 for the "preservation of public security." This provision includes "prevention and
 suppression of rebellion, mutiny, violence, intimidation, disorder and crime, unlaw-
 ful attempts and conspiracies to overthrow the Government or the Constitution."
 The Chiefs' Authority Act, a legacy of the colonial period, empowers local officials
 called "chiefs" to arrest individuals and to restrict a person's movement without
 trial. No persons were detained under the PPSA or the Chiefs Authority Act during
 the year.
 The Task Force on the Reform of Penal Law and Procedures, created by the Attor-
 ney General in 1993, continued reviewing and proposing new statutes related to
 criminal investigation, arrest, detention, questioning, charge, and bail. The Task
 Force had still not submitted its final report by year's end.
 The police continued to detain politicians, members of civic organizations, clergy,
 journalists, and other government critics, though in fewer numbers than 1995. The
 detainees were usually held for several hours before being released without charge.
 In some cases, detainees were held for longer periods, from several days to as long
 as several months.
 Arrest of political and human rights activists by security forces decreased, com-
 pared with the previous year, but remained a serious problem. In January Mombasa
 lice arrested two prominent Islamic leaders working with the Safina party. Police
 at them while in custody and threatened them with charges of car theft; they re-
 leased them 3 days later (see Sections 1.c. and 1.f.). In July Nairobi police arrested
 21 members of the RPP, charging them with incitement and holding an illegal meet-
 ing, the first time in 12 months that the Government had brought charges of this
 nature. On August 6, however, the presiding magistrate granted bail to the detain-
 ees and set the hearing for November.
 Security forces continued to harass, follow, inconvenience, and occasionally briefly
 detain opposition Members of Parliament (M.P.'s) and other government critics.
 However, the number of opposition MP.'s arrested for sedition or incitement de-
 creased. Nevertheless, in February, for example, security forces detained Ford-Asili
 M.P. George Nyanja for several hours. In July Nanyuki police arrested human
 rights attorney and opposition M.P. Paul Muite and several other members of
 Safina when they presented trophies to volleyball teams involved in a local competi-
 tion. Police fired twice into the air to push back the crowd, which pelted police with
 stones as they took the detainees to the Nanyuki Police Station and held them for
 2 hours.
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control. However, Sheik
 Khalid Balala, a former leader of the unregistered Islamic party of Kenya, has re-
 
 
 mained in a European country for more than 2 years because the Government has
 been unwilling to renew his passport.
 e. Denial o a Fair Public Tria.-Although the Constitution provides for an inde-
 endent judiciary, it is subject to executive branch influence in practice. The Presi-
 dent has extensive powers over appointments, including that of the Chief Justice,
 the Attorney General, and Appeal and High Court Judges. The President can also
 dismiss judges and the Attorney General upon the recommendation of a special
 presidentially appointed tribunal. Judges do not have life tenure and serve on a con-
 tract basis.
 The court system consists of a Court of Appeals, a High Court, and two levels of
 magistrates' courts, where most criminal and civil cases originate. Judges hear all
 cases; there is no jury system. Customary law is used as a guide in civil matters
 affecting persons of the same ethnic group so long as it does not conflict with statu-
 tory law. In 1989 High Court Justice orbury Dugdaie ruled that the "bill of rights"
 outlined in the Constitution was unenforceable; this decision reinforced the implicit
 power of the executive branch over the judiciary. The decision has not been over-
 ruled.
 Civilians are tried publicly although some testimony may be held in secret. There
 is a presumption of innocence, and defendants have the right to attend their trial,
 to confront witnesses, and to present witnesses and evidence. Civilians can also ap-
 peal a verdict to the High Court and ultimately to the Court of Appeals. Military
 personnel are tried by military courts-martial, and verdicts may be appealed
 through military court channels. The Chief Justice appoints attorneys for military
 personnel on a case-by-case basis.
 Defendants do not have the right to government-provided legal counsel, except in
 capital cases. For lesser charges, free legal aid is not usually available outside
 Nairobi. As a result, poor peopile without an attorney may be convicted for lack of
 an articulate defense. Although defendants generally have access to an attorney in
 advance of trial, defense lawyers do not always have access to government-held evi-
 dence, since the Government can plead the state security secrets clause as a basis
 for withholding evidence. The Government raised court fees for filing and hearing
 cases by several hundred percent in 1995. The daily rate for arguing a case before
 a judge, for example, rose from $10 to $50. The Law Society of Kenya and many
 attorneys strongly opposed the increase, saying that the new charges would deny
 the majority of citizens access to the courts.
 The Constitution entitles the Attorney General to take over and discontinue pro-
 ceedngs in private prosecution cases. Attorney General Amos Wako has argued that
 citizens must first notify his offie before initiating private prosecution. He has used
 this authority on a number of occasions to terminate cases against government offi-
 cials, including a private suit by the Law Society of Kenya against Vice President
 Saitoti and others for allegedly embezzling funds from the treasury in the Golden-
 berg scandal.
 There were several instances in which judges spoke out and sought to assert judi-
 cial independence. In May and August, a number of magistrates and judges called
 for greater judicial independence, complaining about the frequency of executive in-
 trference in court cases, and urged that the presidential power to appoint judges
 be transferred to Parliament. In several court cases, magistrates publicly rebuked
 the police for their brutal methods of interrogation and excluded confessions that
 were reportedly coerced. Judges have also urged that the Government publicly re-
 dress the inhuman conditions in prisons.
 The Government does not currently hold political prisoners. In a well known
 human rights case, Koigi Wa Wamwere and his two associates were denied fair judi-
 cial process throughout most of the year. Their application for appeal of conviction
 was denied in July because the typing of the trial transcript had not been finished.
 On December 13, Koii was granted bail on medical grounds, followed 1 month later
 by medical bail for his two associates. The three men remain at liberty while they
 pursue their appeal of conviction, but there are no indications as to when the trial
 manuscript typing will be finished.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution permits searches without warrants in certain instances "to promote the
 public benefit." The Police Act clarifies that policemen may enter a home forcibly
 if the time required to obtain a search warrant would "prejudice" their investiga-
 tions. Although security officers generally obtain search warrants, they occasionally
 conduct searches without warrants to apprehend suspected criminals or to seize
 property believed to be stolen. The courts have admitted evidence obtained without
 search warrants to support convictions.
 There were instances during the year in which police conducted searches or sei-
 zures without warrants. One of the two Safina officers detained in Mombasa in Jan-
 
 
 uay (see Sections 1.c. and 1.d) was repeatedly beaten and threatened until he fi-
 nlyagreed to allow police to enter and search his home.
 Security forces continued to employ various means of surveillance, including a
 network of informants to monitor the activities of opposition politicians and human
 rights advocates. Seoe opposition leaders report that the Government targets them
 with surveillance, telephone wiretaps, and interference with written correspondence.
 Although citizens axe free to choose their political affiliations, the Government
 discourages civil servants from membership in opposition parties.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and the press, the Government has interpreted broadly the existing colo-
 nial-era sedition and libel laws in order to limit free expression (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government has used these provisions to deny opposition parties the right to
 free speech. For example, security forces and local administration officials used
 these provisions as a pretext to disperse opposition rallies to prevent speakers from
 criticizing the Government. In June the President directed the police to disperse any
 meetings that maligned or abused government authorities. Despite these forms of
 obstruction, the press, civic organizations, and the opposition continued to present
 their views to the public.
 The print media include three daily newspapers that report on national politics.
 The largest newspaper, The Nation, is independent and publishes articles critical
 of government policies. The second largest, The East African Standard, was sold in
 1995 to an investment group with close ties to the Government. Despite the new
 management's pledge to maintain the newspapers independent editorial policy, it
 has evolved into a tabloid that is less critical of the Government. The third daily
 newspaper, Kenya Times, reflects KANU party views. Weekly newspapers and mag-
 azines, many of which are openly critical of the Government, also have substantial
 audiences. On the whole, the print media remained outspoken and independent, de-
 spite continued government harassment.
 According to members of the independent press, relations between the press and
 the Government have improved during the year. Even in cases in which government
 officials requested them to suppress damaging articles, the final decision was left
 to the editors. While the traditional taboos surrounding the President and his family
 remain in effect, political cartoons picturing President Moi, often in a negative light,
 have appeared. In January the Government withdrew a highly controversial pro-
 posed press law that would have significantly curtailed p  reedoms. Neverthe-
 less, newspaper and magazine editors continued to be subjected to varying degrees
 of government pressure to censor themselves, particularly regarding President Moi's
 family and corruption involving his advisers.
 Overt harassment and occasional detention of journalists continued but at a re-
 d ucd rate from the previous year. In Janu aryKisumu police arrested East Africa
 S tandard reporter Dennis Oluoch in connection with an article he had written, and
 Eldoret police arrested Nation correspondent Evans Kanini because of an article he
 had written about police corruption, charging him with being drunk and disorderly,
 a charge subsequently dismissed by the court. In March Eldoret police arrested Na-
 tion correspondent John Wanjala and reportedly physically abused him in custody
 because of his press reports critical of the police (see Section 1.c.). In May Kirinyaga
 p olice beat and confiscated the camera of East African Standard correspondent
 Munene Kama; Kitui police arrested East African Standard correspondent James
 Owuor, and Nairoi police arrested Njehu Gatabaki, Ford-Asili M.P. from
 Githunguri and editor of Financ magazine, and detained him for 1 week. Gatabaki
 was already on trial for sedition for having alleged in Finance that President Moi
 had foreknowledge of the assassination of then-foreign minister Robert Ouko in
 1990.
 In June KANUJ youthwingers attacked East African Standard photographer Raph-
 ael Mung during a by-election campaign in Molo, stabbed him in the hand, stle
 his camera, and attacked East African Standard reporter Michael Giehua in Nakuru
 for damaging the party's reputation with his press reports. Police offered no protec-
 tion in either case. Nakuru is notorious for its rampant and unrestrained KANUJ
 youthwingrs and lack of police interference, verging on collusion. In September a
 group of Nairobi city councillors threatened to "fix" journalists who write about land
 scandals and other government irregularities. The offices of the independent weekly
 The People were bombed by persons unknown, and the newspaper received tele-
 phoned threats to desist from 'writing those dirty things" about the Government.
 The Government continued its ban on a number of books, including a Kiawahili
 play based on George Orwell's Animal Farm and a number of works by emigre au-
 thor Ngugi Wa Thiong'o. In a speech on December 31, 1995, President Moi banned
 
 
 136
 distribution of the book Family Life, published by the Girl Guides Association of
 America. He stated that it was immoral and promoted promiscuity and directed that
 it be removed from the shelves of the Kenyan Girl Guides and Boy Scouts.
 In May the Minister of Education directed schools to teach the KANU party mani-
 festo. After strong public protest, he modified this directive to include opposition
 party manifestos as well.
 The Government and ruling party's tight control of the broadcast media has fos-
 tered unbalanced and unfair reporting. The Government maintains its monopoly
 control of the electronic broadcast media through tight control of broadcasting, par-
 ticularly radio, the principal popular news medium. It ontrols the Kenya Broad-
 casting Corporation (KBC), which operates the country's premier radio, television,
 and cable television stations. KBC stations typically do not criticize the Govern-
 ment, give a large share of news time to government o   g party functions, and
 neglect to give equal reporting to opposition activities. KANU supporters also own
 a second television station, Kenya Television Network, which airs news programs
 with more balanced political coverage. KANU supporters opened a third television
 network, Stellavision, in June and a new private F.M. radio station in September.
 The Minister of Information continued to delay action on numerous television and
 radio license applications, ostensibly waiting for the recommendations on media lib-
 eralization from the Attorney General's task force, which was charged with estab-
 lishing operating rules for radio and television liberalization; it has made no rec-
 ommendations after 3years.
 Representatives of the international media are generally free to operate. The Gov-
 ernment complained that its hospitality to foreign correspondents indirectly worsens
 the national image because foreign journalists write so many negative articles about
 other countries which bear a Nairobi dateline.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of Assembly is pro-
 vided for in the Constitution but is seriously limited by the Government's use of-the
 Public Order Act, which gives the authorities power to control public gatherings.
 This act prohibits meetings or processions of 10 or more persons without a license
 from the District Commi sioner. In theory the law does not apply to persons meet-
 ig for social, cultural, charitable, recreational, religious, professional, commercial,
 or industrial purposes. In practice, meetings under almost all categories are sub-
 jected to the Public Order Act.
 The Government continued to restrict the right of peaceful assembly by refusing
 to iense, or by physically disrupting, opposition polit"ical meetings, despite Presi-
 dent Moi's March 1 promise to opposition leaders that such gatherings would be per-
 mitted. The Government granted many meeting lienses, and the number of meet-
 ssubstantially fewer than in  995. However, opsition arties re-
 p orted that the Government blocked 26 public meetings of Ford-Kenya, Ford-Asili,
 Democratic Party, and Safina in the first 9 months of the year, compared with 72
 for all of 1995. Government officials occasionally denied licenses to KANU as well,
 but almost always denied them to groups critical of the national party leadership.
 According to press reports in January, the Nyeri district commissioner warned
 Safina party leaders to keep out of Nyeri, and Mombasa police stood by as ruling
 KANU party youthwingers blocked a Safina march to its new headquarters. In Feb-
 ruary Bondo poice dispersed a meetingof women organized by the League of Kenya
 Women Voters. In March Nairobi polie broke up an RPP meeting, Meru police
 blocked opposition leaders from addressing a by-election rally, and Kilifi police broke
 up an opposition meeting. In June Mombasa police arrested 24 opposition leaders
 for convening an "illegal" meeting (no license), KANU activists attacked Democratic
 Party supporters in Westlands (airobi), and police and armed KANU youthwingers
 blocked opposition leaders from entering Molo to campaign in the by-election there.
 In July police and opposition supporters clashed in Mwea when police armed with
 tear gas sought to disperse a licensed opposition rally. In August riot police in com-
 bat gear stopped a Democratic Party poltical seminar, and Nakuru police cordoned
 off a hotel to prevent invitees attending a women's seminar from entering. During
 one weekend in September, riot police disrupted three opposition meetings (in
 Kiambu, Meru, and Nyandarua) and a soccer contest in Nairobi, named in honor
 of a martyred student dissident.
 In the as  usrer of 1996, authorities disrupted a number of opposition and civil
 society meetings, sometimes forcefully. In a 1-week period in mid-October, Lokitau
 police broke up a civic education seminar on voting organized by the Catholic Dio-
 cese, Turkana police disrupted a civic education seminar sponsored by the Catholic
 Justice and Peace Commission, Gachako police dispersed a meeting to inaugurate
 a new Ford-Kenya office, and Kitui police disrupted a civic education meeting and
 detained and allegedly beat M.P. Charity Ngilu and two female journalists. In the
 ensuing uprar over the latter incident, the police commissioner suspended two po-
 
 
 lice officers responsible for the incident, pending inquiry. In November, antiriot po-
 lice halted a civic education workshop at the Saint Joseph Pastoral Centre in
 Machakos sponsored by the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission. In December
 police disrupted two Ford-Kenya (Odinga) meetings, and Kitui police halted a semi-
 nar on the Values of Democracy" sponsored by the National Democratic Institute.
 The Government restricts freedom of association by use of the Societies Act. The
 act states that every association must be registered or exempted from registration
 by the Registrar of Societies. Twelve political parties are currently registered under
 this statute: KANU, Ford-Kenya, Ford-Asili, Democratic Party, Social Democratic
 Party, Kenya Social Congress, Kenya National Congress, Party of Independent Can-
 didates of Kena, KenyaNational Democratic Alliance, Labor Party Democracy, and
 National Development Party of Kenya. The Government has denied registration to
 23 parties since 1992, while at year's end, 13 parties had applications pending.
 Both the Public Order and the Societies Acts seriously restrict free political orga-
 nization. They inhibit opposition party members from meeting with voters. The .Gov-
 ernment also continued to discourage civil servants from membership in opposition
 parties (see Section 1.f). NGO's are registered by the Government's NGO Coordina-
 tion Board under the NGO Act. In May the board formally revoked the ban on the
 Center for Law Research International (CLARION), a legal affairs NGO that was
 deregistered in 1995 because of its investigations of corruption.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government generally does not infringe upon religious activities, except to require
 registration by new churches.
 Government officials virulently criticized the Catholic Church and the National
 Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) in August for their pastoral letters calling
 for constitutional reform and fair elections, accusing them of receiving assistance
 from unnamed foreigners. In September the Government accused the NCCK of sub-
 versive activities and planning to incite ethnic clashes in the Rift Valley.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-By law, citizens may travel freely within the country. However, the es-
 tablishment of security zones in the 1992 elections and again following ethnic clash-
 es in 1993, restricted the ability of many citizens to travel to those parts of the Rift
 Valley most affected by clashes. Although the security zones, such as in Molo and
 Burnt Forest, have not been officially lifted, access to the areas has been allowed
 in practice. Nonetheless, opposition party members have been stopped at police road
 blocks and prevented from visiting some of the areas.
 The Government does not restrict emigration or foreign travel. The law requires
 a woman to obtain her husband's or fathers permission prior to obtaining a pass-
 port (see section 5). Civil servants must obtain government permissio  or inter-
 national travel, which was granted in all cases.
 U.N. Development Program (UNDP) assistance to thousands of displaced ethnic
 clash victims came to a virtual standstill in January 1995. The Government tried
 to persuade the UNDP to restart this program, arguing that the different ethnic
 rups in the affected regions were once again living, working, and trading together.
 In fact, many of the rural people displaced by the clashes have still not returned
 to their homes and remain in refugee status in urban areas. In February the Gov-
 ernment ordered 360 families displaced by ethnic violence in Burnt Forest to return
 to their farms or be evicted. Government officials insisted this was not forced reloca-
 tion. Reportedly, no clash victims have returned to the Olenguruone area because
 of continued insecurity.
 The Government provides first asylum and provided it to the approximately
 168,000 UNHCR-regstered refugees in 196. The refugees are mostly Somali and
 Sudanese, living in camps, and an undetermined number living outside camps in
 cities and rural areas. Somalis account for about 75 percent of the total refugee pop-
 ulation. Although 44,000 (mostly Somali) refugees repatriated in 1995, only a few
 thousand returned home in 1996, mainly due to poor security combined with crop
 failures in returnee areas. Most of those who chose to repatriate did so because they
 did not want to be relocated to camps on the northeast border of Somalia after one
 of the largest refugee camps near Mombasa was finally closed.
 The law provides for the granting of asylum or refugee status in accordance with
 the standards of the 1951 U.N. Convention and its 1967 Protocol Relating to the
 Status of Refugees. Nevertheless, when over 400,000 refugees fleeing civil strife and
 drought arrived in Kenya from the neighboring countries of Somalia, Sudan, Ethio-
 pia, and Uganda in 1991, the Government suspended indefinitely the process by
 which it ruled on applications for refugee or asylum. Since then, a handful of afflu-
 ent individuals have effectively purchased de facto Convention status, but for prac-
 tical purposes, an official asylum or refugee application process no longer exists.
 Consequently, resettlement is not an option in Kenya.
 
 
 Incidents of rape of women and young girls in refugee camps continued to occur,
 though Kenyan police response has improved. Acts of violence, including carjackings
 and banditry, still occur with frequency in the camps and the Dadaab area, which
 sometimes led to the injury or death of some refugees and police.
 Refugees living outside the camps are vulnerable to arrest, and those who pur-
 chase false identification documents and visa are even further at risk. Hundreds of
 refugees and illegal aliens have been arrested in police sweeps, supposedly targeting
 those involved in criminal activity in Nairobi. The UNHCR was allowed to facilitate
 the release of refugees who weie ordered to camp, but other aliens were still being
 held at the end of 1996.
 There were no reports of expulsions of those having a valid claim to refugee sta-
 tus. However, in late 1996, the Government moved forcefully to prevent a mass
 wave of persons fleeing drought conditions from crossing the Kenya/Somalia border.
 Once this flow of potential refugees was halted, the Government invited UNHCR
 and other humanitarian organizations to provide assistance in place to these indi-
 viduals.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 through free and fair multiparty elections, but their ability to do so has not yet been
 fully demonstrated at the presidential level. The 1992 presidential and parliamen-
 tary elections were marked by violence, intimidation, fraud, and other irregularities,
 but opposition candidates nevertheless won 63 percent of the vote, although split
 among several factions, thereby giving KANU a majority of seats in Parliament.
 President Moi's election victory has allowed him and his KANU party to dominate
 the political process. At the local level, the President exercises sweeping power over
 the political structure. The President appoints both the powerful provincial and dis-
 trict commissioners and a multitude of district and village officials.
 At the national level, the Constitution authorizes the President to dissolve the
 legislature and prohibits debate on issues under consideration by the courts. This
 law, in conjunction with the Speaker of the Assembly's ruling that the President's
 conduct is inappropriate for parliamentary debate, has limited the scope of delibera-
 tion on controversial political issues. M.P.'s are entitled to introduce legislation, but
 in practice it is the Attorney General who does so. As the head of KANU, which
 controls 124 of the Parliament's 200 seats, the President is also able to influence
 significantly the legislative agenda.
 The Government continued to harass and intimidate the political opposition, al-
 though less frequently than in 1995. Its monopoly of the electronic media prevented
 opposition parties from reachingtelevision and radio audiences (see Section 2.a.).
 The license provision of the Public Order Act kept opposition leaders from meeting
 their supporters, and the Government's use of colonial-era sedition laws restricted
 freedom of expression (see Sections 2.a. and 2.b.). The Electoral Commission, which
 oversees all elections, lacks statutory independence, since its members are ap-
 pointed by the President. The opposition has also claimed that voter constituencies
 are apportioned in favor of KANU, which has resulted in a KANU parliamentary
 majority despite only receiving one-third of the popular vote. At the local level, offi-
 ci s have demonstrated partiality to the ruling party during parliamentary by-elec-
 tions.
 Five parliamentary by-elections were held in 1996 due to the deaths or disquali-
 fications of sitting M.P.'s. The elections were generally free and fair, although jour-
 nalists and diplomatic observers reported anomalies in voter registers and incidents
 of vote buying and continued use of government officials and vehicles, but not vio-
 lence as in 1995. During the by-election in Hamisi, KANU youthwingers insured a
 KANU victory by keeping opposition supporters away from the polls. In the Siakago
 ection, government employees and vehicles were blatantly used in support of
 In latter months of 1996, the Government made a number of efforts which in ef-
 fect, criminalized dissent. In September the Government charged several leading po-
 litical and human rights activists with engineering a "guerrilla plot" to overthrow
 the Government or assassinate President Moi. That charge was not widely accepted,
 and the Government did not pursue it. Police who detained Nairobi University stu-
 dent Murali in November tried to force him (see Section 1.c.) to admit that student
 unrest at Nairobi University had been organized by the Safina Party. Government
 officials sought unsuccessfully to blame campus unrest at Egerton University near
 Nakuru on the opposition, specifically charging Safina. Government and police offi-
 cials regularly accuse NGO's and churches involved in civic education of being "anti-
 Kenyan and agents of unnamed foreign entities.
 
 
 139
 During his unprecedented March 1 meeting with leaders of the three main opposi-
 tion parties, the President discussed ways to ensure fairness to all political factions.
 He agreed that the opposition should have greater access to the media and should
 receive licenses for meetings without hindrance. However, he did not follow through
 on these prmises. Despite his prmise to meet with opposition leaders in the fu-
 ture, no further meetings had been held by year's end.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on the participation of women in politics,
 traditional attitudes circumscribe the role of women in pitics. There was one fe-
 male minister, the country's first, who was appointed by Psident Moi in 1995, and
 seven female M.P.'s in the Assembly. In August President Moi announced that
 women would henceforth be represented at local and provincial levels in KANU
 meetings. Within the opposition, women figure most significantly in the Democratic
 Party, in which 25 percent of the party's nationa ofieolders are women.
 Members of altribal and ethnic grups participate in the Government and politi-
 cal parties. However, since white Keyan  leontologist Richard Leakey announced
 his involvement in the Safina party, President Moi has repeatedly cautioned against
 white Kenyans' participation in political activities. Numerous tribes-including
 Kisas, Merus, Embus, Kabas, Kikuyus, Taitas, Kalenjins, Luhyas, Turkanas, So-
 mah,, Maasai, Giriamas, and Luos-are represented in the President's Cabinet.
 However, the President reportedly relies on an inner circle of advisers, drawn most-
 ly from his Kalenjin tribe.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are several well-organized and active human rights organizations. Two of
 these, the KHRC and RPP, not only produce regular reports on the human rights
 situation but also organize activities to publicize their causes. The Institute for Edu-
 cation in Democracy monitors parliamentary by-elections in cooperation with the
 Electoral Commission. Legal organizations, including the Public Law Institute, the
 Kenya Law Society, the International Commission of Jurists, and the International
 Federation of Women Lawyers, treat human rights issues as a priority.
 Some opposition parties also maintain comprehensive files on human rights
 abuses, carefully tracking extrajudiciary violence and disruption of opposition politi-
 cal meetings. The Kenya Social Congress Party published a detailed study of human
 rights violations in one district in Nyanza province. The Citizens Coalition for Con-
 stitutional Change is an umbrella organization lobbying for constitutional reform.
 A large pool of attorneys represent the poor and human rights defendants without
 charge.
 Human rights NGO's work actively to engage the Government on human rights
 issues and cases. In its Quarterly Repression Report, the KHRC frequently adds the
 parenthetical note that it was unsuccessful in obtaining information from govern-
 ment officials on a specific case.
 While the Government often criticized domestic and international human rights
 NGO's, it also made some efforts to reach out and engage them. It allowed human
 rights organizations to witness autopsies of several persons who had died in police
 custody. It overturned the 1995 deregistration of the NGO Clarion (see Section 2.b.).
 The Kenya Electoral Commission facilitated the March visit of the U.S.-based Inter-
 national Foundation for Election Systems to analyze the electoral system. The same
 month, the Government published "Human Rights Situation in Kenya: The Way It
 Is" in order to rebut the KHRC's December 1995 Quarterly Repression Report. De-
 spite allegations that the Government's pamphlet was meant to appease donor na-
 tions then meeting in Nairobi, the KHRC welcomed it as the beginning of a public
 dialog on human rights and reiterated that any errors in its own reports were due
 to the Government's failure to respond to the KHRC's numerous queries for case
 status reports.
 In May the Government fulfilled its promise to create a Standing Committee on
 Human Rights. The 10-member committee was empowered to "investigate alleged
 violations of constitutional freedoms," including abuse of power by public officials.
 It was tasked with drafting recommendations on human rights problems and provid-
 ing these to the government agencies under whose purview the problems fall. The
 committee announced that it was open to, and welcomed contact with, NGO's and
 would serve as the point of contact between them and the Government.
 The Committee does not have sufficient funding to track human rights cases and
 investigate complaints. Moreover, its attention to mob violence, human rights edu-
 cation, and its lack of authority over government officials has led some observers
 to question its objectives and ability to affect the human rights situation. The Com-
 mittee presented its first report to President Moi on November 27, but details of
 the report were not made public.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of a person's "race, tribe,
 place of origin or residence or other local connection, political opinions, color, or
 creed." However, authorities did not effectively enforce all these provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women is a serious and widespread problem. The most
 recent police statistics published on the subject were released in 1994 and showed
 that in 1992 there were 454 cases of rape, 136 cases of attempted rape, 343 cases
 of indecent assault, 407 cases of defilement (e.g., child molestation), and 14 cases
 of incest. The statistics are probably underreported, however, since social mores
 deter women from going outside their families or ethnic groups to report sexual
 abuse. The Government has condemned violence against women, and the law carries
 penalties of up to life imprisonment for rape. Still, the rate of prosecution remains
 ow because of cultural inhibitions against discussing sex, the fear of retribution, the
 disinclination of police to intervene in domestic disputes, and the unavailability of
 doctors who might otherwise provide the necessary evidence for conviction. Further-
 more, traditional culture permits a man to discipline his wife by physical means and
 is ambivalent about the seriousness of spousal rape. This ambivalence was epito-
 mized in the August statement by one magistrate that not all rape suspects de-
 served to be jailed because "some cases are not intentional," just a matter of men
 being "too impatient."
 There were also numerous reported incidents of rape of refugee Somali women at
 the Dadaab camps; they were assaulted outside camp perimeters in the course of
 gathering firewood.
 The Constitution does not specifically address discrimination based on gender,
 and women continue to face both legal and actual discrimination on several fronts.
 For example, a woman is legally reuired to obtain consent from her husband or
 father before obtaining a passport. n practice a woman must also have her hus-
 band's or father's approval to secure a bank loan. Also, women can legally work at
 night only in the export processing zones (EPZ's). Women have long dominated agri-
 cultural work in terms of numbers of laborers, and they have become more active
 in urban small business. Still, the average monthly income of women is about 37
 percent lower than that of men. According to pension law, a widow loses her work
 pension upon remarriage, whereas a man does not. Not only do women have dif-
 liculty moving into nontraditional fields, they are also promoted more slowly than
 men and bear the brunt of job retrenchments.
 Kenya's Law of Succession, which governs inheritance rights, provides for equal
 consideration of male and female children. In practice, most inheritance problems
 do not come before the courts. Women are often excluded from inheritance settle-
 ments or given smaller shares than male claimants. In addition, a widow cannot be
 the sole adnistrator of her husband's estate unless she has her children's consent.
 Societal discrimination is most apparent in rural areas, where women account for
 75 percent of the agricultural work force. Rural families are more reluctant to invest
 in educating girls than in educating boys, especially at the higher levels. The num-
 ber of boys and girls in school is roughly equal at the primary and secondary levels,
 but men outnumber women almost 2 to 1 in higher education, and literate men sig-
 nificantly outnumber literate women.
 The nation's best known women's rights and welfare organization, Maendeleo Ya
 Wanawake ("Development of Women" in Kiswahili) was established as a nonpolitical
 NGO during the colonial era, but now operates under the close supervision of the
 Government. A growing number of women's organizations are active in the field of
 women's rights, such as the National Commission on the Status of Women, the Edu-
 cation Center for Women in Democracy, and the Kenyan League of Women Voters.
 Children.-The system of free education in the early years of Kenya's independ-
 ence (1963) has given way to a "cost-sharing" education system in which students
 pay both tuition and other costs. These are a heavy burden on most families. While
 there is mandatory schooling for all up to grade 12, there is a very high drop out
 rate in part because of the heavy expenses to finance education. Moreover, the
 shortage of schools also obviates the legally required universal schooling. The health
 care system for school children, which once provided periodic medical checkups and
 free milk, now appears to be completely defunct.
 Government-drafted legislation is under debate in Parliament to establish a Na-
 tional Council of Children's Services to supervise the planning and f'mancing of child
 welfare activities. The bill would also revamp the juvenile court system. However,
 both KANU and opposition M.P.'s, as well as a number of local NGO's, have faulted
 the bill for portraying child offenders as criminals in need of discipline. Opponents
 of the bill alse have noted that it does not address homelessness, female genital mu-
 tilation (FGM), forced labor, sexual abuse, and education. In November, a motion
 
 
 outlawing FGM was defeated in parliament just one week after that same body ap-
 proved a motion to implement the provisions of the Beijing Women's Conference
 platform, one of which called for outlawing FGM.
 Despite the Government's stated opposition, FGM, which is widely condemned by
 international health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health,
 remains widespread, particularly among nomadic people. It is usually performed at
 an early age. Health officials estimate that roulily 50 percent of females nationwide
 have undergone this procedure. Accordingto Maendeleo Ya Wanawake, that per-
 centage is as  g  s 80 percent in some districts of the Eastern, Nyanza, and Rift
 Valley provincs.
 Economic displacement and  pulation growth continued to fuel the problem of
 homeless street children. The Child Welfare Society of Kenya estimated that the
 number of Nairobi's street children increased from 33,000 in 1990 to 44,000 in 1996,
 while the Government estimates their growth at 10 percent per year. According to
 the Attorney Generar's Task Force, these children_ are typically involved in theft,
 drug trafficking, assault, trespass, defilement, and property damage. There have
 been credible reprts that police have treated street children inhumanely.
 Child rape and molestation are rapidly growing human rights abuses. There were
 numerous and frequent press reports of rape of young girls. The rapists were typi-
 cally older than the age of 40. Those onvicted received prison sentences of between
 5 and 20 years, plus several strokes of the cane. Child prostitution has emerged as
 a major problem in urban areas, often connected with the tourist trade. There were
 numerous press reports on the increase in child prostitution in Nairbi and
 Mombasa. A provincial government study in Nyanza province found that Kisumu
 city had 300 male and female child prostitutes 8 years of age and above and that
 the practice existed in small towns throughout the province.
 People With Disabilitis.-Government policies do not discriminate against people
 with disablities with regard to emploent, educatilbn, or state services. Disabled
 persons are frequently denied drivin  censes, however. There is also no mandated
 provision of accessibility for the disabled to public buildings or transportation.
 National/IRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Acording to the 1989 government census
 released in May 1994, the Kkuyu are the largest ethnic community, comprising 21
 percent of the population. Luhys, Luo, Kamba, and Kalenjiu(an amalgamation of
 nine small tribes) follow, each with more than 11 percent of the population.
 Opposition politicians and local human rights gups report that the Government
 continued to discriminate against Rift Valley Kikuys. They assort that provincial
 authorities have denied national identification cards to a substantial number of
 Kikuyu youths, even those born and raised there. Without identification cards these
 youths cannot marry, attend universities, obtain employment, or register to vote.
 The Government has not been supportive-and was often critical-of private ef-
 forts to conciliate ethnic tensions in the Rift Valley. On several occasions, police
 blocked interarty reconciliation talks. The Government was critical of a series of
 meetings in August and September between Kikuyu and Kalenjin elders to foter
 reconciliation and facilitate resettlement of displaced people. Some government offi-
 cials, for example, continued to aim harsh verbal barbs and threats at Kikuyus.
 There continued to be tensions between Asian Kenyans (Kenyans of subcontinent
 descent) and black Kenyans; Asians are subject to official and societal discrimina-
 tion. Black Kenyans generally resent Asians because of their affluence, their seem-
 ing reluctance to assimilate African culture and to employ black Kenyans in man-
 agement positions, and the involvement of some, in league with influential black
 Keny ans, in orruption and theft of state funds. Politicians, both opposition and rul-
 ing party, from time to time sought to gain publicity by attacking Asian Kenyans,
 accusing them of usurping the natural inheritance of black Kenyans.
 The Government has singled out the overwhelmingly Muslim ethnic Somalis as
 the only ethnic group required to carry an additional form of identification to prove
 that they are citizens. They must still produce upon demand their Kenyan i enti-
 fication card and a second identification card verifying "screening." Both cards are
 also required in order to apply for a ass rt. The continued presence of Somali ref-
 ugees has exacerbated the problems aced by Kenyan Somaias.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Except for central government civil servants, includ-
 ing medical personnel and universitr Aademic staff, all workers are free to join
 unions of theirchoice. The law provides that as few as seven workers may establish
 a union, provided that the objectives of the union do not contravene the law, and
 that another union is not already representing the employees in question.
 The Government may deregister a union, but the Registrar of Trade Unions must
 give the union 60 days to challenge the deregistration notice. An appeal of the Reg-
 
 
 istrar's final decision may be brought before the High Court. President Moi
 deregistered the Kenya Civil Servants Union in 1980. Since 1989 the Central Orga-
 nization of Trade Unions (COTU) has sought to reverse this decision.
 There are at least 33 unions representing approximately 350,000 workers, less
 than 20 percent of the country's industrial work orce. Except for the 150,000 teach-
 ers who belong to the Kenya National Union of Teachers, all other unions are affili-
 ated with the one approved central organ-the COTU. The COTU leadership, how-
 ever, generally does not pursue worker's rights vigorously, so that most union activ-
 ity takes place at the shop steward level, which disadvantages the average worker
 in disputes with management.
 The Government created COTU in 1965 as the successor to the Kenya Federation
 of Labor and the Kenya African Workers Congress. The 1965 decree establishing
 COTU gives the President the power to remove COTU's three senior leaders from
 office and grants nonvoting membership on the executive board to representatives
 of the Ministry of Labor and of KANU. A 1993 High Court decision nullified an at-
 tempt to install leaders more acceptable to the Government, but the plotters refused
 to vacate COTU headquarters. Following a 1994 Appellate Court order, however,
 the Registrar of Trade Unions agreed to recognize the old COTU leadership. Al-
 though the board is comprised of the leadership of affiliated unions, it is common
 for KANU to provide funding and other support for the election of senior union offi-
 cials. In 1995 several trade union leaders from affiliated unions sought to bring
 about democratic reforms in the election and appointment of labor officials, inde-
 pendence from the Government, and establishment of links with any political party
 that supports worker rights. The reelection of the COTU leadership in July indi-
 cated that there would be no major changes in the near future.
 The Trade Disputes Act permits workers to strike, provided that 21 days have
 elapsed following the submission of a written letter to the Minister of Labor. Mem-
 bers of the military services, police, prison guards, and members of the National
 Youth Service are precluded by law from striking. Other civil servants, like their
 private sector counterparts, can strike following the 21-day notice period (28 days
 if it is an essential service, such as water, health, education, or air traffic control).
 During this 21-day period, the Minister may either mediate the dispute, nominate
 an arbitrator, or refer the matter to the Industrial Court, a body of five judges ap-
 pointed by the President, for binding arbitration. Once a dispute is referred to either
 mediation, fact-finding, or arbitration, any subsequent strike is illegal. However, the
 act gives the Minister of Labor broad discretionary power to determine the legalit
 of any strike. In 1994 the Minister used this power to declare several strikes ilegal,
 although the required notice had been given. The Minister did not declare any
 strikes illegal in 1995 or 1996; however, the Government's response to wildcat
 strikes is usually severe. This led worker rights groups to raise the problem with
 the International Labor Organization's (ILO's) Committee on Freedom of Associa-
 tion. Several unions, including municipal workers, bank employees, and some civil
 servants held brief strikes for back or increased wages.
 Internationally, COTU is affiliated with both the organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Many of its
 affiliates are linked to international trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colectively.-While not having the force
 of law, the 1962 Industrial Relations Charter, executed by the Government, COTU,
 and the Federation of Kenya Employers, gives workers the right to engage in legiti-
 mate trade union organizational activities. Both the Trade Disputes Act and the
 Charter authorize collective bargaining between unions and employers. Wages and
 conditions of employment are established in negotiations between unions and man-
 agement. In 1994 the Government relaxed wage policy guidelines to permit wage
 increases of up to 100 percent and renegotiation of collective agreements. Collective
 bargaining agreements must be registered with the Industrial Court in order to
 guarantee adherence to these guidelines.
 The Trade Disputes Act makes it illegal for employers to intimidate workers. Em-
 ployees wrongfully dismissed for union activities are generally awarded damages in
 the form of lost wages by the Industrial Court; reinstatement is not a common rem-
 edy. More often, aggrieved workers have found alternative employment in the
 lengthy period prior to the hearing of their cases.
 Legislation authorizing the creation of Export Processing Zones (EPZ's) was
 passed in 1990. The EPZ Authority decided that local labor laws, including the right
 to organize and bargain collectively, would apply in the EPZ's, although it grants
 many exemptions in practice. For example, the Government waived aspects of the
 law that prevent women from working at night (see Section 6.e.). Labor and some
 government officials criticized health and safety conditions in the EPZ's.
 
 
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution proscribes slav-
 ery servitude, and forced labor. However, under the Chiefs' Authority Act, a local
 authority can require people to perform community services in an emergency, al-
 though this did not occur in 1996. The ILO Committee of Experts has found that
 these and other previsions of the law contravene ILO Conventions 29 and 105 con-
 cerning forced labor, but noted the Government's efforts to review the Chiefs' Au-
 thority Act.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Employment Act of 1976
 makes the employment in industry of children under the age of 16 illegal. The act
 applies neither to the agricultural sector, where about 70 percent of the labor force
 is employed, nor to children serving as apprentices under the terms of the industrial
 training act. Ministry of Labor officers nominally enforce the minimum age statute,
 and the Government is making strong efforts to eliminate child labor, working close-
 ly with the IL's International Program for the Elimination of Child Labor. Chil-
 dren often work as domestic servants in private homes, including those of relatives,
 in the informal sector, and in family businesses and commercial agriculture, al-
 though usually assisting parents rather than as employees in their own right. Given
 the high levels of adult unemployment and underemployment, the employment of
 children in the formal industrial wage sector in violation of the Employment Act
 rarely occurs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for blue collar work-
 ers in the wage sector has 12 separate scales, varying by location, age, and skill
 level. The lowest minimum wages were $34 (1,700 slillings) per month in urban
 areas and $19.50 (955 shillings) in rural areas. The minimum wage is insufficient
 to meet the daily needs of a worker and family. A 2 percent wage increase in August
 had limited impact on worker income. Most workers relied on second jobs, subsist-
 ence farming, informal sector opportunities, or the extended family for additional
 support.
 The Regulation of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act limits the normal
 workweek to 52 hours, although nighttime employees may be employed for up to
 60 hours per week. Some categories of workers have a shorter workweek. As is the
 case with respect to minimum age limitations, the act specifically excludes agricul-
 tural workers from its purview. An employee in the nonagricultural sector is enti-
 tled to 1 rest day per week. There are also provisions for 1 month of annual leave
 and sick leave. The law also provides that the total hours worked (i.e., regular time
 plus overtime) in any 2-week period for night workers may not exceed 144 hours;
 the limit is 120 hours for other workers. Workers in some enterprises claimed that
 employers forced them to work extra hours without overtime pay. The Ministry of
 Labor is tasked with enforcing these regulations, and there are few reports of viola-
 tions.
 The Factories Act of 1951 sets forth detailed health and safety standards; it was
 amended in 1990 to include the agriculture, service, and government sectors. The
 65 health and safety inspectors attached to the Ministry of Labor's Directorate of
 Occupational Health and Safety Services have the authority to inspect factories and
 work sites. As a result of the 1990 amendments, the Directorate s inspectors may
 now issue notices enjoining employers from practices or activities that involve a risk
 of serious personal injuries. Previously, only magistrates were vested with this au-
 thority. Such notices can be a ppealed to the Factories Appeals Court, a body of four
 members, one of whom must be a High Court judge. The number of factory inspec-
 tions increased dramatically in 1993 and subsequently has continued at a high level.
 Workers are not forced by law to remain in hazardous conditions; however, many
 would be reluctant to remove themselves because of the high unemployment prob-
 lem.
