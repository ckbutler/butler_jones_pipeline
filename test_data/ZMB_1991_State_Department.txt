 ZAMBIA
 Zambia's transition from a de jure one-party to multiparty
 state featured adoption of a new Constitution and was capped by
 presidential and legislative elections on October 31, in which
 labor leader Frederick Chiluba defeated long-time President
 Kenneth Kaunda for the Presidency. Chiluba's Movement for
 Multiparty Democracy (MMD) won an overwhelming majority in
 Parliament over the ruling United National Independence Party
 (UNIP). Despite a number of campaign abuses, primarily by
 UNIP-forces, the elections, held under the scrutiny of a large
 number of domestic and international observers, were fair and
 orderly.
 The new Constitution, which provides for a number of
 fundamental rights, represents a compromise between the
 preference of UnZIP for a strong Presidency and MMD's demand for
 a strengthened Parliament. It gives Parliament the power to
 ratify major appointments, including those of the Chief
 Justice, the Attorney General, and others, and the right to
 approve the establishment or dissolution of government
 ministries and departments.
 The Zambian police, operating under the Ministry of Home
 Affairs, have primary responsibility for maintaining law and
 order. Divided into-regular and paramilitary units, the police
 also supervise a, volunteer vigilante force which is frequently
 accused of human rights abuses. The Zambian Intelligence and
 Security Service (ZISS) is charged with'intelligence and
 counterespionage responsibilities while the armed services are
 used for internal security. Abuses by the security forces can
 be and occasionally are challenged in court, and abusers found
 guilty are punished. However, the Government has seldom taken'
 the initiative to investigate reports of abuses, and'security
 forces regularly kill suspects and detainees: such claims
 rarely have been challenged.
 The Zambian economy is heavily dependent on its majority.
 state-owned copper industry, the only significant source of
 foreign exchange. A decline in world copper prices, compounded
 by falling production due to mismanagement, failure, to invest
 in maintenance; and the siphoning off of revenues for purposes
 other than copper production, has plunged the Zambian economy
 into serious recession for a number of years. Agricultural
 production, in which over half of the population is engaged,
 mainly at the subsistence level, has suffered from severe
 drought and government policies, e.g., low prices paid to the
 farmers and expensive food subsidies given to the large urban
 population. The Kaunda Government was unwilling to introduce
 austerity programs-principaIly reduction of the subsidies on
 mealie meal--and as a consequence, fell into arrears with the
 International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD),
 causing the IBRD to suspend its programs in Zambia.- In
 1990-1991, inflation of over 100 percent and deteriorating real
 wages prompted strikes in many sectors and helped bring about
 the end of the Kaunda era.
 The human rights situation improved steadily in Zambia as the
 year unfolded. The reintroduction of democratic pluralism and
 popular ferment for political and economic change resulted in
 unprecedented freedom of speech, press, and assembly, and
 increased parliamentary and public challenges to the
 Government. There was vigorous judicial protection of
 constitutional rights, including the right of citizens to
 change their government. The state of emergency (SOE), which
 hid been in effect for 27 years, ended in November, 7 days
 
 
 450
 ZAMBIA
 after the elections, in accordance with the new Constitution.
 Despite these positive developments, there were a number of
 human rights abuses during the year, including torture and
 other mistreatment of detainees and excessively long
 detentions. Discrimination against women remains a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There-were five known political killings during the year and
 numerous extrajudicial killings. Four MMD officials were
 murdered by UNIP members in Luanshya, and an MMD supporter was
 beaten to death by UNIP supporters in Lusaka. UNIP leaders
 claimed these killings were individual acts and not a result of
 government or party instructions. There is no evidence to
 contradict that claim. The Government and the police are
 treating the murders as criminal rather than political acts.
 As the year ended, the trial of the seven UNIP suspects had not
 yet begun. Suspects in the murder of the MMD supporter in
 Lusaka are awaiting trial.
 Security forces frequently kill criminal suspects during
 apprehension or while the suspects are in custody. Between
 January and September, more than 30 suspects were shot dead by
 police. For example, in May a paramilitary policemen killed a
 street vendor, provoking a near riot. In August and September
 alone, police killed over 20 persons. Such killings are rarely
 investigated, and explanations that suspects were shot while
 resisting arrest or trying to escape are not generally
 challenged.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of government-inspired disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, but police and military
 personnel resorted to excessive force when apprehending or
 interrogating detainees or prisoners. In May police announced
 that the volunteer vigilantes would be replaced by trained
 community constables, but at year's end, this program had not
 been implemented.
 Victims can and do sue the Government for abuses-by the
 security forces. According to press reports, an 84-year-old
 headman successfully sued the State for defamation and assault
 after police beat and starved him for 8 days on an alleged
 charge of stock theft; a Chingola student testified that a ZISS
 officer thot him through the mouth; two aggravated robbery
 suspects told the Ndola High Court that they were severely
 beaten by police with fan belts and cable wires while their
 colleague was shot dead; and three youths who sued the Attorney
 General and sought damages for being subjected to one meal a
 day at a police station in Lusaka. The verdicts in these cases
 were not publicized. In October the State was ordered to pay
 three men $300 each as compensation fQr false imprisonment when
 they were detained without explanation for a night. Also in
 October, a paramilitary officer who beat a man to death during
 crowd control duties was sentenced to 5 years at hard labor.
 
 
 451
 ZAMBIA
 Due to fear or ignorance, however, few victims file complaints
 of torture and other mistreatment at the hands of the security
 forces. When charges are brought and there is strong evidence
 against the security forces, the Government pays damages and
 settles out of court, thereby avoiding publicity or a public
 record of the case.
 Conditions in Zambian prisons are harsh and life threatening.
 Tuberculosis, anemia, and-chest infections are rampant in
 prisons due to low protein diets, lack. of clean water,
 substandard food, severe overcrowding, and poor sanitation and
 medical facilities. In many prisons only one meal a day is
 served. Lusaka Central Prison, built early in the century to
 incarcerate less than 200 inmates now houses over 1,000. In
 June the Minister of Home Affairs told Parliament that 306
 prisoners died from various diseases while serving sentences
 between 1985 and 1990, and in July Prime Minister Malimba
 Masheke expressed government concern with prison conditions.
 However, by year end, no new, funds had been allocated, and the
 overall prison situation had not improved.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government released all political detainees and prisoners
 in July 1990; new political detentions did not occur.
 Various security laws provide broad powers of detention, and in
 practice administrative detentions are widespread. An
 indeterminate number of foreign nationals are .held for
 extremely long periods of time awaiting deportation. One
 detainee, James Kakoma, said he had been detained since 1983
 while another, Peter Moyo-, said he had been held as a
 prohibited immigrant since 1979. On October 15, according to
 the Zambia Daily Mail, 50 prohibited immigrants at Lusaka
 Central Prison were beaten by prison wardens following a
 protest against alleged prolonged detention- Some of the
 immigrants were reportedly in detention since 1980.
 In regular criminal cases, a detainee must be charged ahd
 brought before a magistrate within 24 hours, but there are
 delays at each step of the process, and deadlines are
 frequently missed due to police inefficiency or lack of
 transportation to bring a suspect before a magistrate.
 Delayed judgments occur at every level of the judicial process
 and have been a growing concern to the Zambian legal
 community. In December 1990, the Chief Justice assured the Law
 Association of Zambia (LAZS that the problem of delayed
 judgments would be resolved. The LAZ recommended that judgment
 not delivered within 6. months should trigger misconduct
 proceedings against a. judge and criticized the Supreme Court
 for being a major culprit in failing to dispose of cases on
 time. In March the Supreme Court in turn criticized prison
 authorities for failing to bring prisoners to present their
 appeals. In one case, a prisoner convicted in 1981 and
 released in 1989 finally came up for appeal in 1991.
 The Preservation of Public Security Act (PSA), which gave the
 President broad discretion under the SOE to detain or restrict
 the movements of persons and to order that persons be arrested
 and detained for indeterminate periods, expired with the State
 of Emergency on November 8, 1991.
 The State of Emergency was a major issue in the election
 campaign. The SOE gave police officers of assistant inspector
 
 
 452
 ZAMBIA
 rank and above power to arrest without a warrant and detain a
 person for up to 28 days. In practice, the SOE was used early
 in the campaign to refuse permits to rally to opposition groups
 until the courts stopped the pr'actice. An international
 election observer, former President Jimmy Carter, found that
 use of the SOE served as a tool for police to issue or deny
 permits for political rallies, impose official or unofficial
 curfews, and generally intimidate or abuse opposition parties.
 On October 3, the Vice President of LAZ accused the Govetrnment
 of using the SOE to detain people on political grounds, to
 expropriate property, and to detain people for 28 days or more
 to facilitate investigations into petty crimes.
 .e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system consists of the Supreme Court with
 appellate powers and a series of lower courts, of which the
 High Court is the most important. Although presidential
 detainees were not guaranteed public trial, such trials were
 usually public in the few instances when they occurred. In
 most cases, presidential detainees were eventually released
 without having been tried.
 In ordinary cases, the law provides a number of protections for
 defendants, including protection during interrogations. It
 provides for the right to legal representation at one's own
 expense or through legal aid; the right to give evidence under
 oath in criminal procedures; the right to give an unsworn
 statement; and the right to remain silent.
 In security cases, accused persons enjoyed few of these
 protections. The President in the past had the power to
 appoint and transfer judges, and some attorneys maintain that
 this fact swayed court decisions in cases in which the
 executive branch had a particular interest. However, the new
 Constitution increased the Parliament's role in the approval of
 judicial personnel, and during 1991 the judiciary demonstrated
 significant independence in rulings protecting the political
 opposition's freedom of speech, right to associate, and right
 to buy air time on radio and television (see Sections 2.a. and
 2.b.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home is provided for in law and is
 generally respected, except in past cases relating to the SOE
 or to roundups of suspected illegal aliens and black
 marketeers. In such cases, security forces had broad powers
 and often entered the homes of suspects without search
 warrants. Following the lifting of the SOE, the new Minister
 of Legal Affairs announced that police may no longer conduct
 searches of homes or other properties without warrants. One
 credible UNIP opponent claimed that his incoming and outgoing
 mail was tampered with in 1991. However, there was no
 independent confirmation of mail or telephone monitoring.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedoms of speech and press were increasingly exercised in
 1991. As a result of popular pressure and the ensuing
 nationwide debate on democratic pluralism, there was
 unprecedented criticism of the one-party system of government
 
 
 453
 ZAMBIA
 and its leaders, including the former President. President
 Chiluba promised in the campaign to ensure freedoms of speech,
 press, and assembly.
 Early in the year, however, the Government, including'President
 Kaunda, tried to suppress coverage of MMD activities in
 UNIP-publications and in government-owned newspapers. In
 February a High Court judge ruled that the President had denied
 Zambians their constitutional freedom of expression by banning
 the newspapers, television, and radio from covering the
 opposition. As a result of this and other court actions
 throughout the year, the official and UNIP newspapers gradually
 increased coverage of all political activities and viewpoints,
 and alternative private newspapers proliferated, despite
 official intimidation and threats against suppliers, printers,
 and distributors. In particular, the Weekly Post and
 opposition papers like the Daily Express gained great respect
 and credibility for their reporting on corruption.
 In September a court injunction forced the Zambia National
 Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) to air opposition
 advertisements, and in October the Press Association of Zambia
 filed a successful injunction against the government-appointed
 Director General of ZNBC and the managing editor of the Times
 of Zambia. The injunction restrained both men from occupying
 their offices or performing their duties until after the
 elections on the grounds that the two were partial in reporting
 on political activities.
 Academic freedom is respected in Zambian society, and educators
 are outspoken in- their opposition to political influence on the
 education system. However, when students at the University of
 Zambia Lusaka campus became embroiled in the debate on
 democratic pluralism, the Government temporarily shut down the
 university. President Kaunda said the closure was intended to
 prevent students from triggering riots and looting and
 implementing plans for the Speaker of Parliament or the Chief
 Justice to take over the Presidency in an interim government.
 Student leaders denied the allegations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 During 1991 the courts routinely ruled in favor of greater
 freedom-of peaceful assembly and association. When Zambia
 became a multiparty state in December 1990, the UNIP leadership
 tried to exclude from Parliament those members who changed
 their affiliation to- join the opposition party. The Supreme
 Court overturned a lower court and found that parliamentarians
 who joined the MMD could keep their seats in Parliament. In
 March nine MMD members, including party president Frederick
 Chiluba, were acquitted of unlawful assembly and. belonging to
 an illegal society. In other cases, the courts ruled against
 government attempts to prevent the opposition from meeting
 without a police permit, to evict marketeers for belonging to
 the MMD, and to restrain conference centers from renting
 meeting space to opposition parties.
 After the various court rulings, police became generally
 evenhanded in issuing permits for peaceful multiparty rallies
 and on occasion demonstrated considerable professionalism in
 defusing potentially explosive situations between parties at
 political rallies. In several instances where ruling party
 supporters harassed or attacked opposition supporters, the
 police arrested UNIP vigilantes or-other instigators.
 
 
 454
 ZAMBIA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided.for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Zambia has no state religion, and
 adherence to a particular faith does not confer either
 advantage or disadvantage. Christian missionaries from a wide
 variety of faiths operate in the country.
 In a departure from past liberal practices, soon after taking
 office in November, the Minister of Information banned an
 Islamic radio program on the grounds that Zambia is a Christian
 country. The Vice President quickly reversed the decision as a
 violation of human rights and reinstated the program.
 The Government has prohibited the Jehovah's Witnesses from
 proselytizing, but they function openly, and their freedom to
 refrain from participating in various secular activities such
 as voting, singing the national anthem, and saluting the flag
 is respected.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Under the UNIP Government, police roadblocks were common, and
 vehicles were commonly searched for illegal immigrants,
 poaching, and other crimes. Police used these opportunities to
 steal goods from travelers. Shortly after the Chiluba
 Government took office, the Minister of Ldgal Affairs
 abolished road blocks.
 In Lusaka in September and October, an unofficial dawn-to-dusk
 curfew was imposed in townships. The Government claimed that
 the curfew was instituted to curb a rise in crime. However,
 the LAZ, the MMD, and residents of the townships claimed that
 the curfew and related police patrols were intended to impede,
 opposition candidates and supporters from door-to-door
 campaigning in the evening hours. In one reported incident,
 paramilitary officers beat a newspaper reporter for being out
 of doors after 8 p.m. Since the October 31 elections, there
 have been no official or unofficial curfews in Zambia.
 In several instances, the UNIP government withheld or withdrew
 passports to prevent foreign travel by persons whose political
 or criminal activities were considered inimical to Zambian
 interests. On November 26, the Supreme Court ruled that a
 passport is not a privilege but a right to which every Zambian
 citizen is entitled.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 estimates that in 1991 there were approximately 140,000
 refugees in Zambia, pricipally from Angola, Mozambique, Zaire,
 South Africa, and Namibia. Some Angolans entered Zambia after
 the final throes of the armed conflict in Angola. Repatriation
 of these and of the older Angolan refugee population began in
 1991; large-scale repatriation is projected for 1992. Most of
 the approximately 2,000 African National Congress (ANC) exiles
 departed Zambia in 1991 although there was also an influx of
 young South Africans fleeing the violence in their country.
 While the ANC has imprisoned defectors and detainees in Zambia
 in the past, there were no known ANC prisoners held by the
 organization in Zambia in 199'1. The ICRC has been tasked with
 following up on the detainee issue in southern Africa.
 The Zambian authorities handed over to the Malawi Government in
 midyear five Malawian suspects held in the 1989 assassination
 
 
 455
 ZAMBIA
 in Zambia of Mkwapatira Mhango, a leading opponent of President
 Banda, and eight members of his family. The Malawi Government
 reportedly released the five suspects shortly after their
 return to Malawi, although this could not be independently
 confirmed.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 During 1991 popular demand for political change increased, and
 the right of citizens to change their government was -visibly
 demonstrated in the multiparty, secret ballot elections October
 31. The new President, trade union leader Frederick Chiluba,
 and his party, the MMD, stressed throughout the campaign their
 dedication to a democratic political process, including
 increased parliamentary control and safeguarding basic human
 rights. The MiMD also stressed the importance of moving toward
 a free market economy. In the legislative elections, the MMD
 won a sweeping victory over UNIP, gaining 125 of the 150 seats
 in Parliament. In addition to UNIP and the MMD, four other
 parties fielded candidates. UNIP swept Eastern Province, where
 19 of its 25 seats were won but picked up only 6 more seats in
 the remaining 8 provinces. No independent or third-party
 candidates were elected.
 Parliament has yet to make any significant changes on
 appointments other than electing a new Speaker, Robinson
 Nabulyato, who was previously Speaker from 1968 to 1988, and
 choosing a former UNIP government official who became a founder
 of MMD, Sikota Wina, as Deputy Speaker.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government neither encourages nor hinders inquiries or
 visits by'human rights organizations. The LAZ Human Rights
 Committee has operated without hindrance under both the UNIP
 and MMD governments. A new organization, the Women's Lobby
 Group, seeks to ensure legal and societal rights of women.
 During the runup to the elections, President Kaunda at first
 refused to permit foreign monitors to .observe the election but
 -later reversed his position and invited a cross-section of
 international groups, including the Carter Center,'the United
 Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the Nonaligned
 Movement and the Commonwealth of Nations to send monitors to
 Zambia. In addition to the international observers, domestic
 monitoring groups, the Zambia Independent Monitoring Team and
 the Zambia Elections Monitoring Coordinating Committee actively
 recruited and trained Zambians to monitor polling stations and
 counting centers and report on whether the election process was'
 free and fair. Representatives of the churches, press, women's
 organizations, nongovernmental organizations, the Law
 Association, and university students participated in the
 monitoring effort. Despite some abuses,, the ensuing elections
 were judged free and fair by international and domestic
 observers.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The population of almost 8 million comprises more than 70
 Bantu-speaking tribal groupings. Economic and social needs are
 met on a generally nondiscriminatory basis. The Constitution
 
 
 456
 ZAMBIA
 of 1991 prohibits discrimination based on race, tribe, sex,
 place of origin, marital status, political opinions, color, or
 creed.
 Under civil and constitutional law, women are entitled to full
 equality with men in most areas. Government and opposition
 leaders encourage women to become involved in the political
 process. In practice, women are increasing their participation
 in Zambia's social, economic, and political life and gaining
 representation in the professions and higher education. Women
 deputy government ministers, judges, parliamentarians, managing
 directors, and other professionals do exist. However, in
 Zambia women remain subordinate in many ways. As a major
 component of the rural work force, according to one report,
 women provide 80 percent of the labor involved in food
 production and 50 percent in cash crop production. Statistics
 provided in April 1991 by the Central Statistics Office show
 that women are severely disadvantaged compared to men in formal
 employment (4 percent women versus 25 percent men), in
 unemployment (65 percent women versus 35 percent men), and in
 literacy (54 percent women versus 76 percent men).
 Although legally, Zambian men and women doing the same job are
 to receive the same pay, in 1986 the average monthly earnings
 were much less for women than for men in each industry owing to
 the higher rate of employment for men and lower salaries for
 comparable work by women. In rural areas, women earned eight
 times less than men, whereas in urban areas, women earned three
 times less than men on average. There is no legal redress for
 women who are refused employment on the basis of sex.
 Customary law and practice, contradicting Zambia's Constitution
 and codified laws, place women in subordinate status with
 respect to property, inheritance, and marriage. Under
 traditional customs, all rights to inherit property rested with
 the deceased man's family. The widow and her children were
 entitled to nothing. The Intestate Succession Act, passed in
 1989, guarantees widows a 20-percent share and children a
 50-percent share in the inheritance of a deceased man's
 property. Despite this legal provision, ignorance, apathy, and
 fear render the enforcement of this law generally ineffective.
 Similarly, most divorced women are unaware that under the
 maintenance law, ex-husbands can be compelled by magistrate's
 courts to maintain their families after divorcing their wives.
 Women's groups representing the major political parties, a
 nonpartisan organization created in 1991 called the Women's
 Lobby Group, and professional women's associations have been
 active in educating women about their rights.
 There are no reliable statistics on the extent of violence
 against women, including wife beating. Domestic assault is a
 criminal offense, but in practice police are often reluctant to
 pursue reports of wife beating or other forms-of abuse. In
 addition, women are often ignorant of their rights, and there
 is substantial societal pressure placed upon women not to
 prosecute cases of domestic violence. According to women's
 rights advocates, nondomestic violence against women is not
 generally tolerated by traditional or civil authorities.
 Victims usually report attacks, and legal action is taken.
 However, in June a senior police officer said that there had
 been an increase in cases of rape and defilement and appealed
 to the public to report officers who did not respond to reports
 of such cases. In crimes against women where rape, serious
 injury, or death occurs, men--including husbands--may receive
 sentences up to, and including, the death penalty. On
 
 
 457
 ZAMBIA
 November 22, the Supreme-Court confirmed the death sentence of
 a man who killed a woman for refusing to have sex with him.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Zambia has a history of strong labor union organizations,
 dating from the establishment of the copper mines during the
 1930's. According to the Minister of Labor, 50 percent of
 Zambia's 380,000 formal sector workers are unionized. Zambia's
 19 large national unions are organized by industry or
 profession. Until 1991 only one union per industry was legal,
 and all unions were members of the Zambia Congress of Trade
 Unions (ZCTU), the sole legal confederation under the
 Industrial Relations Act of 1971. The ZCTU is democratic,
 regularly conducts open elections to select its leadership, and
 frequently criticizes government policy on subjects such as
 wages, economic policy, conditions of service, and labor
 representation in party and government organs. During the
 political campaign, the ZCTU threw its support behind the MMD
 and former ZCTU chairman, now-President, Frederick Chiluba.
 Deteriorating economic conditions and sharp increases in the
 cost of living led to widespread labor unrest in 1991 and
 numerous strikes, boycotts, and "go slows." Under existing
 legislation, strikes are permitted only after all other
 recourse has been exhausted. In practice, virtually all
 strikes are illegal, since they almost always commence before
 the mandatory process of mediation has run its course. The
 Government normally has relied on persuasion and continued
 mediation to end strikes once they have begun. Most strikes
 have terminated with increased wage settlements and without
 government action against the unions.
 In January 1991, president Kaunda signed into law the
 controversial Industrial Relations Act (IRA of 1990. The Act
 revises the law relating to. trade unions, the ZCTU, the
 Industrial Relations Court, recognition of collective
 agreements, settlement of collective disputes, strikes and
 lock-outs, essential services and works councils. Under the
 new and old Acts, all workers have the right to strike except
 those in the Zambia defense force, judicial service, police
 force, prison service, and security intelligence service.
 The ZCTU and the Zambia Federation of Employers (ZFE) view the
 new IRA as an attempt to undermine organized labor and
 employers organizations. Under the Act, unions previously
 under the umbrella of the ZCTU are disaffiliated and can only
 rejoin the ZCTU or any other national or international union or
 association if a two-thirds majority of members vote to do so.
 The ZCTU sued the State over the new IRA on the grounds that
 the two thirds vote requirement was inconsistent with the right
 to freedom of association and expression. On March 22, the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) lodged
 a formal complaint with the International Labor'Organization
 (ILO) that the new IRA violates ILO conventions. The
 Government argued the opposite, that in fact the law improved
 workers' rights of association and freed unions from compulsory
 association with the ZCTU. Although the IRA was legally still
 in effect at the close of 1991, the new MMD Minister of Labor
 called portions of the Act unconstitutional, unreasonable, and
 unworkable and promised to present the issue to the Cabinet
 soon with an eye toward repeal. After the elections, the ZCTU
 j6ined a number of other African countries in abandoning the
 
 
 458
 ZAMBIA
 policy of the continentwide official trade union body, the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity, which prohibits
 affiliations outside Africa, and was accepted as a member of
 the ICFTU.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The new IRA gives the Minister of Labor the right to
 unilaterally deny the right to unionize to any person, trade,
 or industry. The Act reduces the ZCTU's jurisdiction in
 internal affairs of a union and perpetuates the existence of
 heretofore UNIP-dominated works councils. The works councils
 have powers that can conflict with union-employer relationships
 and that usurp some of the responsibilities normally reserved
 for decision between unions and employers, such as conditions
 of service, recruitment, salary assessments, transfers,
 bonuses, and safety issues.
 In February, before lodging its complaint with the ILO, the
 ICFTU urged President Kaunda not to enforce the new IRA or a
 bill on wages and'working conditions in the public services.
 The ICFTU argued that application of these laws would put an
 end to collective bargaining and would cripple the trade union
 movement by ending the check-off system. These antiunion
 provisions will probably be scrapped when the new IRA is
 reviewed.
 The new IRA was condemned by both workers and employers
 organizations as being designed to cripple trade unions and
 employers organizations. The thrust of the legislation was to
 give the Government, not employers, more power to control the
 creation and dissolution of unions, collection of dues, and
 operation of workers councils. At the same time, the law
 specifically prohibited an employer or any person acting on his
 behalf from preventing or deterring an employee from taking
 part in the formation of a trade union, joining a union,
 participating in the activities of a trade union, becoming an
 officer, or being elected or appointed to hold office.
 Similarly, employers were prohibited from dismissing,
 penalizing, or discriminating against any employee who
 exercised those rights, or from taking any action against an
 employee on the grounds that he was or was not a member of a
 trade union.
 Following the announcement in 1990 that export and customs free
 zones would be established, no further action was taken.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Slavery and involuntary servitude are prohibited by the
 Constitution. Forced labor is prohibited except as consequence
 of a sentence or court order, by members of the miIitary, by
 conscientious objectors in lieu of military service, as labor
 required during wartime or other national emergency, or in the
 conduct'of communal or civic obligations. These prohibitions
 are observed and not abused.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 According to the Minister of Labor, the minimum age for
 employment of children is 16. This and other age restrictions
 apply to the industrial sector, where, because of adult
 unemployment, there are few employees under age 16. The Labor
 Commissioner effectively enforces the law in industry. There
 is, however, little enforcement for the vast majority of
 
 
 ZAMBIA
 Zambians who work in the subsistence agricultural and domestic
 service sectors, where persons under age 14 are often
 employed. In urban areas, children commonly engage in street
 trading. According to a Central Statistical Office survey
 published in April 1991, in 1986 approximately 15 percent of
 the 12 to 14 age group was in the rural or urban labor force.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 In 1991 the Government established a minimum monthly wage rate
 for all employees except professionals, plus housing and
 transportation allowances. However, each industry may also set
 its own minimum wage rates above the legal floor through
 collective bargaining. In industries where collective
 bargaining is not effective, the Minister of Labor and Social
 Services sets the minimum wage rate for employees in positions
 such as delivery assistants, general workers, and office
 orderlies. These "minimums" are insufficient to provide an
 adequate standard of living. Most Zambian workers must
 supplemeit their incomes through second jobs, some subsistence
 farming, or reliance on the extended family.
 The normal workweek is 40 hours, but it is not a legal
 maximum. The legal maximum workweek for nonunionized workers
 is 48 hours. The minimum for full-time employment is 40
 hours. Maximum limits for unionized workers vary. For
 example, the legal maximum for unionized guards is 72 hours per
 week. There are legal requirements for annual leave (2 days
 per month of service..
 Zambian law regulates minimum health and- safety standards in
 any industrial undertaking. Enforcement of industrial safety
 in the mines is the responsibility of the Department of Mines.
 In March the state-owned mining company reported'that disabling
 injuries had been reduced-by 32- percent. Factory safety is
 handled by-the Inspector of Factories under the Minister of
 Labor, but staffing problems chronically limit enforcement
 effectiveness. The Inspector of Factories reported in January
 that 280 workers were injured, 5- fatally, in-various industrial
 accidents during 1990.
