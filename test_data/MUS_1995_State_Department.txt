 MAURITIUS
 Mauritius is a parliamentary democracy governed by a Prime Minister, a Council
 of Ministers, and a National Assembly. The Head of State is the President, who is
 nominated by the Prime Minister and confirmed by the Assembly, and whose pow-
 ers are largely ceremonial. Fair and orderly national and local elections, supervised
 by an independent commission, takeplace at regular intervals, most recently on De-
 cember 20. The judiciary is indepe nent, there are numerous political parties, both
 large and small, and partisan politics are open and robust.
 A paramilitary Special Mobile Force and Special Supporting Units under civilian
 control are responsible for internal security. These forces, under the command of the
 Commissioner of Police, are backed by a general duty police force. They are largely
 apolitical and generally well-trained, but the police committed some human rights
 abnses.
 The economy is based on labor-intensive, export-oriented manufacturing (mainly
 textiles), sugar, and tourism. About 85 percent of arable land is planted with sugar
 cane. There is a generally high standard of living; annual per capita income is ap-
 proximately $3,250. The country weathered well the global economic slowdown of
 the early 1990's and is now attempting to diversify its economy by promoting invest-
 ment in new sectors, such as electronics, and developing Mauritius as a regional fi-
 nancial center.
 The Government's human rights record improved, but problem areas remained.
 There continued to be occasional reports that police abused suspects and detainees.
 The Government continued to use the National Intelligence Unit to monitor opposi-
 
 
 tion party activities. Violence against women and child labor appeared to be on the
 rise, despite government efforts to address these problems. The Government made
 progress in addressing police brutality and advancing the legal status of wom .
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 The investigation into the 1994 death of a suspect in police custody who burned
 to death in his cell is complete but the results had not been released by year's end.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and inhuman punishment are prohibited by law, but there were several re-
 ports of police brutality, involving mistreatment of individuals on the street as well
 as of suspects in custody. The Commissioner of Police continued to display a willing-
 ness to pursue such reports of abuse.
 Because of the Police Commissioner's crackdown on crime, prisons have become
 overcrowded and prison sanitation inadequate.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile and the Government generally observes these prohibitions.
 Last year's constitutional amendment which would allow the Government to detain
 suspected drug traffickers indefinitely without trial or the possibility of bail came
 into force in November (see Section I.e.).
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice. Some critics
 believed that the executive interfered with the judiciary. Legal experts noted con-
 cern about overt manipulation of the judiciary as well as political influence over the
 Commissioner of Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Anticorruption
 Tribunal.
 The judicial system consists of the Supreme Court, which has appellate powers,
 and a series of lower courts. Final appeal may be made to the Judicial Committee
 in the United Kingdom (the Privy Council), and was routine in the case of death
 sentences until the Abolition of the Death Penalty Act was passed in July. At year's
 end, the act had not been signed by the President, but the judiciary has stopped
 issuing death sentences. There are no political or military courts. The judiciary pro-
 vides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 Defendants have the right to private or court-appointed counsel. However, in No-
 vember the Assembly passed the Dangerous Drugs Act, which would permit law en-
 forcement authorities to hold suspected drug traffickers for a limited time without
 access to bail or legal counsel. The constitutionality of the law may be questioned.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 sanctity of the home is provided for in law and generally respected in practice. The
 search of personal property or premises is allowed only under clearly specified condi-
 tions by court order or by police action to stop a crime in progress. The Govern-
 ment's intelligence apparatus continued to carry out illegal surveillance of local op-
 position leaders and other major figures. In April the opposition proposed a bill to
 establish a code of conduct for the intelligence arm and define the "subversion and
 national security" clauses under which the Government claims to use the unit. The
 bill was soundly defeated.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 Debate in the National Assembly is lively and open. There were occasional com-
 plaints of government influence in editorial policies, but more than a dozen privately
 owned daily, weekly, and monthly newspapers presented varying political view-
 points and they expressed partisan views freely. In 1995 three editors of independ-
 ent newspapers resigned to accept government positions, fueling speculation that
 the press was less independent than previously believed. However, there was no evi-
 dence of loss of independence in subsequent reporting by those newspapers. The
 Government has the ability to counter press criticism by using strict libel laws- how-
 ever the Government did not use these laws to inhibit the press in 1995. Libel suits
 between private parties are common.
 The Government used the Official Secrets Act in October 1994 to arrest two edi-
 tors and the managing director of the weekly magazine Le Mag, ostensibly for pub-
 
 
 175
 lishing an internal document; the document, which was embarrassing to a public of-
 ficial, had been in the public domain for more than a year. Opposition and press
 criticism led the Prime Minister to say that the Commissioner of Police had acted
 legally but overzealously; within 24 hours, the police released the three on bail.
 While the case was pending at year's end the three remained under an "objection
 to departure" restriction for overseas travel.
 The Government controls television and radio-the most important media. Pro-
 gramming and editorial policies generally reflect government interests. The Govern-
 ment gave opposition politicians slightly more bradast time in 1995 than in years
 past. However in February, the Mauritius   roadcast Cororation director inter-
 rupted a talk show program which had been discussing the controversial Nationality
 Law; it was widely believed that the order to stop the broadcast was because of com-
 ments critical of the Government. In December 1994, the Goverimnt authorized
 the private use of "television reception only" satellite dishes. Ownership and oper-
 ation of private television and radio stations is not permitted. However, foreign tele-
 vision broadcasts, specifically "Skynews" from the United Kingdom and "Canal Plus"
 from France became available to the general public via a subscriber service.
 The Government generally respects academic freedom but has occasionally
 censored books, usual   in national security reasons.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government generally respects them in practice. Police permis-
 sion is required for demonstrations and mass meetings; such permission is rarely
 refused and groups have the right to challenge denials.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights and the Government respects
 them in practice.
 There are no refugees in Mauritius, and the Government deals with asylum re-
 quests on a case by case basis.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right peacefully to change their gov-
 ernment, and citizens exercise this right in practice. Free and fair elections based
 on universal suffrage were held on December 20. The opposition coalition won all
 of the elected seats in the National Assembly, and Labor Party leader Navinchandra
 Ramigoolam was sworn in as Prime Minister, replacing Aneroed Jugnauth, who had
 led the Government since 1982.
 The remote and isolated islands of Agalega and St. Brandon are an exception to
 universal suffrage. Their nearly 500 citi~zens are not registered as voters and have
 no representation in Parliament.
 In the National Assembly, up to eight members are appointed through a "best
 loser ' system to ensure that all ethnic groups are represented. Political parties often
 match the ethnicity of their candidates to the ethnic composition of particular elec-
 toral districts.
 Six of the 66 members of the Assembly are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based io Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, caste,
 place of origin, political opinion, color, creed, or sex. The Government generally re-
 quests onheserevi seass.
 threseroVioneainst women, particularly sousal abuse, is widespread and
 increasing, according to the Ministry of Women's Rights and Family We Gare, attor-
 neys, andnongovernmental organizations. In March the National Council of Women
 reported a 43 percent increase in registered cases of domestic violence in 1994 over
 1993. To addres tis cissue, the Ministry requested consultative assistance from the
 United Nation's Children's Fund. There are no special provisions in Mauritian law
 concerning family violence. Police are generally reluctant to become involved in
 cases of apousal abuse.
 Women have traditionally occupied a subordinate role in society, and societal dis-
 crimination continues. The National Assembly addressed one facet of this problem
 
 
 176
 in 1995 when it amended the Citizenship Act to permit women to transmit citizen-
 ship to their children and obtain residence and work permits for their spouses, as
 do men. Nearly half of Mauritian women work outside the home. The Government
 also moved to promote greater equality by amending the Constitution to prohibit
 discrimination against women.
 Children.-The Government placed a strong emphasis on the health and welfare
 of children, and displayed a commitment to expand educational opportunities for
 children. Reported incidents of child abuse are infrequent and isolated, although pri-
 vate voluntary organizations claim that the problem is more widespread than pub-
 licly acknowledged. At present, most government programs are administered by the
 state-funded National Children's Council, which provides counseling and inves-
 tigates reports of child abuse as well as takes "remedial action" to protect affected
 children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employmrent, education, or in the provision of other state services. The law requires
 organizations which employ more than 10 people to set aside at least 3 percent of
 their positions for people with disabilities. The law does not, however, require that
 work sites be accessible to the disabled, making it difficult for people with disabil-
 ities to fill many jobs. There is no law mandating access to public buildings or facili-
 ties.
 National /RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Tensions between the Hindu majority and
 Creole and Muslim minorities persist. In 1995 the Supreme Court struck down a
 Government proposal which would have favored the Hindu majority in educational
 opportunities as violating the constitutional right to equal protection. This ruling
 appeared to be a factor in the Government's decision to call new elections at the
 end of the year. However, public attention to the issue faded during the course of
 the campaign.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution explicitly protects the right of
 workers to associate in trade unions, and Mauritius has an active trade union move-
 ment. Almost 300 unions represent over 100,000 workers, more than 20 percent of
 the total work force. With the exception of members of the "disciplined force" (i.e.,
 the police and the Special Mobile Force) and persons in state services who are not
 public officers (e.g., contractors), workers are free to form and join unions and to
 organize in all sectors including in the export processing zone (EPZ). Employers
 sometimes intimidated prospective union members. Labor unions are independent
 from the Government and in 1995 successfully appealed to the Government to with-
 draw proposed legislation which would have further curbed the ability of unions to
 strike. Unions can and do press wage demands, establish ties to domestic political
 parties, and address political issues. Unions are free to establish federations.
 Under the Industrial Relations Act (IRA), unions have the legal right to strike.
 In practice, however, the IRA requires a prestrike 21-day cooling-off period, followed
 by binding arbitration, which has the effect of making most strikes illegal. More-
 over, the IRA states that worker participation in an unlawful strike is sufficient
 grounds for dismissal. According to Ministry of Labor statistics, there were seven
 strikes.
 Under the law, unions may and do establish ties with international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law protects the right of
 employees to bargain collectively with their employers. However, the collective bar-
 gaining process is weakened by excessive government intervention in the form of
 wage-settingin the state sector, which is generally used as the basis for private-
 sector pay. ages are set by the National Remuneration Board, whose chairman is
 appointed by the Minister of Labor. About 12 percent of the labor force works for
 national or local government. The IRA prohibits antiunion discrimination. There is
 an arbitration tribunal which handles any such complaints.
 Mauritius' export processing zone (EPZ) employs about 90,000 people. While there
 are some EPZ-specific labor laws, such as provisions allowing EPZ employers to re-
 quire up to 10 hours per week of paid overtime from their employees, workers in
 this sector enjoy the same basic protections as non-EPZ workers. Statutory mini-
 mum wage levels in the EPZ are somewhat lower than elsewhere, but due to the
 country's labor shortage, actual wage levels are nearly double the minimum wage.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment of children is 15 years. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforce-
 ment and conducts frequent inspections. In June inspections revealed 46 underage
 workers and in July 25 more. These findings led the Government to review its in-
 
 
 spection program and implement more systematic inspections, particularly of small-
 er firms that tend to hire underage workers. According to, the Government's report,
 child labor in homes, on farms, and in shops is common in Rodrigues, where inspec-
 tion procedures are less effective.'
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government administratively establishes
 minimum wages, which vary according to the sector of employment, and it man-
 dates minimum wage increases each year based on inflation. The minimum wage
 for an unskilled worker in the EPZ is about $12.25 (218.58 rupees) per week effec-
 tive July 1, while the lowest weekly wage for a non-EPZ worker is about $13.25
 (236.25 rupees). While this is significantly below the level needed to provide an ac-
 ceptable standard of living, the actual market wage for most workers is much higher
 due to the present labor s ortage.
 The standard legal workweek in the industrial sector is 45 hours. In the EPZ an
 employee may be required to work an additional 10 hours per week, although at
 a higher hourly wage.
 In 1995 the Mauritius Labor Congress fied a complaint with the International
 Labor Organization (ILO) regarding the wages and living conditions of foreign work-
 ers. The ILO and the Government are both investigating the complaint.
 The Government sets health and safety standards and Ministry of Labor officials
 inspect working conditions and ensure compliance with the 1988 Occupational Safe-
 ty, Health, and Welfare Act. The small number of inspectors limits the Govern-
 ment's enforcement ability, but the number of occupational accidents has been cut
 nearly in half since the Act's passage. Workers have the right to remove themselves
 from dangerous situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
