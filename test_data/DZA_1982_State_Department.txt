 ALGERIA
 Algeria is a developing country for whose people and leaders the
 central historic experience continues to be the long, bitter,
 and hard-fought struggle for independence, which was achieved in
 1962. Although the Algerian Constitution contains human rights
 guarantees, political and civil liberties-are restricted and
 tightly controlled. The closed nature of Algerian society makes
 information scarce. Algeria has a single political party, the
 National Liberation Front. Important political decisions are
 taken by the Government and party leadership, both headed by
 President Chadli Bendjedid. There is little freedom to deviate
 from the path prescribed by ruling authorities. Nevertheless,
 since the advent of Bendjedid's presidency in February 1979, all
 known political.rprisoners have been released from custody.
 While the major economic and commercial institutions remain
 under government control, there is increasing recognition of the
 contribution the private sector can make to development.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Aside from an incident at Algiers University in November, when
 one student was killed by Muslim fundamentalist students who
 attacked a group opposed to them in student elections, there
 have been no politically motivated killings in 1982, nor
 charges of such.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detention are
 neither condoned nor practiced by the regime. There were no
 accusations of such practices in 1982.
 c. Torture
 The Constitution prohibits torture. No reports were received of
 its use in 1982.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Although possible punishment for crimes against state security
 and economic sabotage may be severe and include the death
 penalty or life imprisonment, there were no reports of cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment in 1982. In the past, death
 sentences usually have been commuted to life imprisonment. In
 several instances, these prisoners have been released later.
 Prison conditions vary from primitive to modern. In the primary
 civil prison in Algiers (el-Harrach), prisoners are crowded into
 cells and sanitary conditions are poor. Better conditions are
 found in some smaller outlying prisons and jails. All prisons
 have medical facilities, and each prison has a contract with a
 local doctor who visits the prison regularly to treat ill
 prisoners. Prisoners who are seriously ill may be transferred
 to local hospitals. Prison diet is -rarely adequate, and the
 prisoners' families often provide much of their food. Families
 are allowed to visit prisoners and, in some cases at the
 discretion of local prison authorities, conjugal visits are
 permitted. Prisoners convicted of civil crimes are quartered
 apart from those convicted of crimes such as terrorism. The
 treatment is, however, generally similar.
 
 
 1084
 Lawyers are allowed regular access to their clients. Their
 meetings take place under the visual supervision of a guard.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross does not have
 access to detainees or prisoners.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Constitution states that no one may be prosecuted, arrested,
 or held except in cases provided for by law. It also provides
 that detention for questioning in criminal investigation cases
 cannot exceed 48 hours, after which the suspect must be charged
 or released. Both the urban police and the more rural-oriented
 gendarmerie generally adhere to this constitutional requirement.
 Military security forces, however, operate under fewer
 restrictions and have been known to hold suspects up to a month
 before releasing or charging them.- The security forces are
 authorized to investigate not only military offenses, but also
 cases involving internal security and foreign intelligence.
 They can also investigate civil crimes that ordinarily would be
 under police jurisdiction.
 Once charged, an individual may be held under preventive
 detention while his case is being investigated. Given the
 crowded court dockets and number of cases under investigation,
 this period of preventive detention can last many months.
 All political prisoners apparently have been released since
 President Bendjedid took office in February 1979.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants have free access to counsel and there is no
 harassment of defense counsel by the Government. As far as is
 known, defendants are made fully aware of the charges against
 them at the time they are bound over for trial. Trials are
 public, and defendants have the right of appeal. The judicial
 system is divided into three parts: civil courts, military
 courts, and state security courts. The civil courts are
 generally independent of executive or military control.
 Military courts deal directly with offenses committed by
 military personnel, such as absence without leave and theft, and
 also with espionage. The national security court at Medea meets
 for important cases of national security and generally provides
 due process similar to that of civilian courts.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the home is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 generally is honored in practice. With the exception of the
 military security forces, police forces may not enter a house
 without a warrant from the local prosecutor or investigating
 magistrate. In addition, police and other security forces may
 not enter a residence during night hours. There have been
 occasions, however, when the military security forces have made
 searches and seizures without authorization from military
 superiors. It is not known whether the personnel involved have
 been disciplined.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression and
 assembly, it states that they may not be used to undermine the
 
 
 1085
 foundations of the socialist revolution. All of the printed and
 electronic media, including foreign publications, are controlled
 or monitored by the Government. Foreign newspapers and
 magazines are available to a limited extent. Certain issues
 have been seized. The French language weekly 'Jeune Afrique" is
 proscribed. Many economic and social problems are frankly
 discussed in the government-controlled media, and Government
 policies both in approach and implementation often are
 criticized without naming individuals. President Bendjedid
 severely chastised the Algerian press in September 1982 for
 failing to inform the public adequately of negative aspects of
 Algerian life, e.g., strikes, work stoppages, and general
 inefficiencies or failings in government and industry. The
 national press has already begun taking steps to remedy the
 situation, albeit with great caution.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 While there-are in theory few legal impediments to freedom of
 assembly, there is only one legal political party and one
 umbrella labor union, the General Union -of Algerian Workers.
 These and other 'mass organizations' for youth, women, farmers,
 and veterans--all.tightly controlled by the Government or
 Party--are the primary recognized associations in Algeria.
 Security personnel watch public gatherings closely. Very
 limited political opposition, such as student demonstrations, is
 tolerated, but only barely. A student demonstration in Oran in
 April 1982 led to widespread arrests, after initially peaceful
 demonstrators turned to vandalism and looting. Opposition
 political tracts are sometimes circulated, almost certainly with
 the knowledge of the Government. In addition, workers have
 successfully used strikes, without the sanction of the national
 union, to win more pay and benefits. Strike actions in the fall
 of 1982 brought explicit recognition from the Government of the
 role of the strike in advancing workers' interests.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Legally an Islamic country, Algeria protects the rights of the
 small Christian and.Jewish minorities, although this does not
 prevent individual prejudice. On several occasions, the
 Government has intervened to prevent desecration of Christian
 and Jewish cemeteries::and places of worship. A potential
 problem for the authorities.. has been the willingness of small
 Muslim fundamentalist groups to resort occasionally to violence
 to seek to impose-their views-on other elements of the
 population.
 d.!; Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 1 Travel, Emigrati-n, and Repatriation
 Freedom to travel within Algeria-and abroad and to emigrate is
 -guaranteed by law and generally is respected in practice. One
 of.the first acts of the Bendjedid Government was to remove the
 erxit visa requirement for Algerians travelling abroad. The
 amount of hard currency which Algerians may carry abroad has
 been doubled, but remains the primary limitation on foreign
 travel. These changes have resulted in significantly increased
 Algerian travel abroad. The Algerian and French Governments
 have agreed on a series of measures, such as special benefits,
 to-encourage some of the many Algerian workers in France
 voluntarily to return to Algeria. Except for foreign diplomats,
 who must apply for permission to travel farther than 50
 kilometers from Algiers, travel within Algeria is generally
 :unrestricted. Visitors must fill out police registration forms
 
 
 1086
 if they are staying overnight in a locality. The gendarmerie
 occasionally sets up vehicular check points in the countryside.
 A special problem are those Algerians who fought on the French
 side during the war for independence and have since resided in
 France. The Algerian Government has begun to permit them to
 return to Algeria, but on condition that they not return to
 their towns of previous residence (where they could be in
 physical danger).
 The Constitution provides for the right of political asylum.
 According to estimates of international experts, there may be up
 to 120,000 refugees in camps near Tindouf, most of them
 apparently from the Western Sahara. There also are several
 thousand refugees around Tamanrasset in southern Algeria,
 mostly from Mali and Niger, who left those countries at the time
 of the Sahel drought. The Government contributes to the support
 of all of these refugees, as does the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees.
 The Government supports various foreign opposition and dissident
 groups. Many of their representatives (some of whom may be
 considered refugees) are located in Algiers.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Major political decisions are made within the leadership of the
 National Liberation Front, headed by President Bendjedid.
 Political activity is largely confined to the single Party, and
 there is little freedom to deviate significantly from the path
 prescribed by the ruling authorities. While fundamental policy
 options are not questioned, there is considerable airing of
 popular aspirations and grievances within the Party organization
 and within the elected assemblies which exist at national and
 local levels. All candidates for office are nominated by the
 single political Party, though voters generally have a choice
 among several candidates. Freedom House, in its report for
 1982, says that elections are managed by the Government, and
 classifies Algeria as "Not Free."
 The status of women in Algeria is improving, but tradition and
 culture make it difficult for any woman to follow an independent
 path. Women are legally equal to men but, in fact, have less
 freedom than do men. The great majority of Algerian women
 remain in traditional roles, although their participation in
 public life is growing. Ten women have been elected to the
 Popular National Assembly, two are members of the Central
 Committee of the National Liberation Front, and several women
 have been elected to the Council of the National Committee of
 the Party. Women also serve in the armed forces.
 An effort has been made to close the gap separating women from
 men in equality of educational opportunity. According to
 government statistics, 62 percent of all school-age girls were
 enrolled in 1980 compared with 39 percent in 1965. In 1979,
 about 40 percent of all students were female. Discussion of a
 new family code was broken off in the National People's Assembly
 in January 1982 because of deep disagreement between those
 traditionalists who believed the legislation incompatible with
 Islamic values and those who advocated greater equality for
 women than the bill provided.

 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Government has not allowed foreign or international
 organizations to visit Algeria to investigate alleged violations
 of human rights. With the release of former President Ben Bella
 and other political prisoners, the Government has responded to a
 major criticism leveled against it by such organizations as
 Amnesty International. Amnesty   International's 1982 report,
 covering 1981, states that organization's concern about prison
 conditions and reports about trials of individuals involved in
 "the non-violent expression of political belief.'
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Algerian economic life is shaped by adherence to "Islamic
 socialism," the departure of most skilled Europeans after
 independence in 1962, and large revenues from oil and gas sales.
 The Algerian economy is largely socialist, with the main
 economic sectors in the hands of state-owned companies.
 However, there has been increasing recognition that the private
 sector has an important contribution to make to economic
 development and prosperity. The December 1981 Party congress
 officially endorsed a larger role for the "nonexploitative
 private sector." At present, about one-half of the arable land
 remains in the hands of independent herders and farmers, most
 retail businesses and service firms are privately owned, and
 there are several thousand private industrial firms in operation.
 An estimated 3.2 percent annual population increase and a
 fertility rate of 6.8 (1978) make it difficult to meet food and
 social needs and to provide full employment, but minimum vital
 needs are being met. The National Popular Assembly adopted a
 five-year plan (1980-84) on November 10, 1980 which gives
 greater priority to fulfillment of social needs, such as housing
 and health care. Per capita GNP was $2,291 in 1981. About
 forty percent of GNP is invested and the remainder consumed.
 This rate of investment is high, reflecting a conscious
 government policy of maintaining a certain degree of austerity
 at the present time in the interest of rapid development to
 provide for future generations. The rate of real growth in 1981
 was nine percent. About 20 percent of nonagricultural workers
 are unemployed, and a 1976-79 estimate put the urban population
 living below the absolute poverty level at 20 percent.
 The Government controls most food supplies. One-third of the
 nation's food must be imported because of inefficient
 agriculture. While food supplies are adequate, the cost is high
 and supply irregular. The five-year plan seeks to revitalize
 agriculture through greater investment and a degree of
 liberalizaton.
 Housing is in extremely short supply, and the situation has
 deteriorated in the period since a 1970 estimate put the average
 number of persons per room in urban areas at 2.8, reflecting the
 high birth rate and an accelerated flight from the countryside
 to the cities. Efforts to correct the shortage are under way.
 A total of 450,000 dwelling units are scheduled for construction
 in 1980-84, but progress is slow; some experts estimate that the
 total will reach only 250-300,000 units.
 Most health care is rudimentary, but free and widely available.
 An ambitious program to build some 600 new clinics has been
 
 
 1088
 
 launched. Life expectancy was 57 years in 1980, compared with
 47 in 1960. For males life expectancy was 56 in 1979, and 58
 for females. Infant mortality was 112 per 1,000 live births in
 1978. Seventy-seven percent of the population was considered to
 have access to safe water as of 1976. Water-borne diseases are a
 serious problem, especially for young children.
 Education is free through the university level. It is
 compulsory between the ages of six and thirteen. Educational
 facilities have been vastly expanded since independence, but are
 still generally inadequate in both rural and urban areas. The
 literacy level in Arabic, French, or both is approximately 40
 percent of the population over nine years of age, but is
 steadily increasing as the large majority of children now attend
 school.
 The Government has a continuing problem of reconciling its
 policy of developing the identity of Algeria as an Arab nation
 with the desires of the Kabyle Berbers (about 15 percent of the
 population) to preserve their own culture and language, while
 retaining French as a language of education and work. This
 conflict has sometimes resulted in clashes between demonstrating
 Kabyles and security forces. The Government has remained firm
 in its policy of making Arabic, instead of French, the language
 of education, but in September 1981 announced that Berber could
 be studied as an academic subject in the major universities,
 leading to some reduction in tensions during 1982.
