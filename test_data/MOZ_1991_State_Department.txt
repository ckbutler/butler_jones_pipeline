 MOZAMBIQUE
 In 1991 Mozambique continued to be governed by President
 Joaquim Chissano and members of the National Front for the
 Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO). The secret-ballot,
 multiparty elections called for in the 1990 Constitution were
 postponed, pending the outcome of peace talks in Rome between
 the Government and the insurgent Mozambican NAtional Resistance
 (RENAMO). The Government passed legislation in 1991 governing
 the new, multiparty system and, by year's end, 14 new political
 parties had formed and held public meetings. Only FRELIMO,
 though, had officially registered. At its Sixth Party
 Congress, FRELIMO formally adopted social democracy as the
 party's philosophy, replacing Marxism-Leninism, and held its
 first secret-ballot elections for party leadership.
 Since the late 1970's, the Government has been under attack
 from RENAMO, which is- estimated to have as many as 20,000 men
 under arms. Peace talks between the Government and RENAMO
 began in mid-:990 under Italian mediation and were still under
 way at year's end. Sporadic fighting, however, continued
 between the Armed Forces of Mozambique (FAM) and RENAMO in all
 of the country's 10 provinces, including attacks on the
 outskirts of the capital, Maputo.
 The security forces include the 60,000 FAM soldiers, a people's
 militia, and, until mid-1991 when if'was abolished,: the
 Mozambican National Security Service (SNASP), which in the past
 had been frequently charged with human rights abuses. In
 September the President signed legislation creating a new
 security force, the State Information and Security Service
 (SISE). Several top officials of the former SNASP were
 assigned to other government departments. Unlike its
 predecessor, the new organization does not have the power to
 arrest and detain suspects, and the Government's declared
 intent is to limit SISE to legitimate intelligence and security
 functions. At year's end, it was too early to evaluate SISE's
 human rights record.
 Approximately 80 percent of the population is employed in
 agriculture, mostly on a small-scale, subsistence level. Major
 sources of foreign exchange are seafood and agricultural
 products, especially cashews, tea, sugar, and cotton. The
 Government continued its efforts to move to a market-oriented
 economy, but growth was.extremely poor for the second year in a.
 row. Continued attacks by RENAMO on economic'targets severely
 hampered production and internal trade; approximately 5 million
 people--a third of the nation's population--are thought to be
 dependent on international food aid.
 Human rights abuses continued in 1991, with the most blatant
 arising out of the continuing civil conflict. Widespread
 reports detailed massacres directed against civilians,
 kidnapings, torture,-and looting. RENAMO was responsible for
 the vast majority of these atrocities, but government forces
 also committed serious abuses. Other major human rights
 problems included harsh prison conditions; the use of
 arbitrary, incbmmunicado-detention, especially'by the SNASP;
 incidents of military indiscipline and harassment of civilians;
 forced recruitment; and citizens' inability to change their
 government.
 The new Constitution represented a major step toward
 safeguarding basic rights, but it also contains a number of
 qualifying clauses which subordinate the new freedoms to
 "national security" and "foreign policy interests." By the end
 
 
 258
 MOZAMBIOUE
 of 1991, it was unclear how the Government would implement key
 provisions of the Constitution and a series of new laws enacted
 in 1991 governing press, nationality, and labor. However, as
 political parties were allowed to form and meet without
 government intervention and labor disputes were being aired
 publicly, people were increasingly confident and willing to
 voice dissenting views, criticize government actions past and
 present, and openly challenge FRELIMO/government orthodoxy.
 The success of the new Constitution and a multiparty system
 will depend heavily on resolution of the conflict with RENAMO,
 which has long demanded the establishment of a multiparty
 system but denounced the Government's unilateral implementation
 of the Constitution and legislation on political parties.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known or suspected cases of the Government
 targeting persons for political killings in 1991. Both sides
 were responsible for the deaths of civilians in the course of
 the civil war, with the great majority of the killings
 attributed to RENAMO forces (see Section 1.g.).
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of government-perpetrated
 disappearances. However, thousands are missing due- to the
 conflict, often as a result of kidnapings in areas affected by
 the war. RENAMO, in particular, regularly holds civilians
 against their will, often employing them as porters or forcibly
 impressing them into their military forces.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment of Punishment
 The new Constitution expressly prohibits torture. During the
 prosecution of the war, however, both government'and RENAMO
 forces tortured prisoners and civilians. There were numerous
 reports that government troops and security personnel beat and
 extorted money from civilians. Several soldiers were convicted
 for such crimes in 1991 and sentenced to prison terms, fines,
 and expulsion from the armed services. RENAMO's attacks on
 civilians continued unabated in 1991. According to many
 reports, RENAMO beat and mutilated people and forced family
 members to witness or participate in the torture of their
 relatives. Former RENAMO soldiers claimed that threats of
 beating, torture, and execution were used to keep coerced
 recruits from escaping.
 Prison conditions remained very poor. For example, the local
 press reported three persons in the Beira jail died in July as
 a result of diseases caused by contaminated food; further, the
 jail, which has a capacity for 70 inmates, was holding 216 at
 one point. Since 1988 the Government has allowed international
 human rights groups access to prisons where national security
 prisoners (mainly RENAMO soldiers and sympathizers) are held,
 both those already convicted and those awaiting trial. In past
 years, there were reliable reports of torture, including
 beatings, submersion in water, deprivation of food and sleep,
 and prolonged isolation. It is nQt known to what extent these
 
 
 259
 MOZAMBIQUE
 abuses occurred in 1991, but instances of torture by security
 police have reportedly declined, sharply since i988.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The law requires that most detainees be charged or released
 within 30 days. However, persons accused of the most serious
 crimes, i.e., security offenses or those requiring a sentence
 of more than 8 years, may be detained for up to 84 days without
 being formally charged or investigated. With court approval,
 such detainees may then be held for two additional periods of
 84.days while the police complete their investigation. While
 detained persons have the constitutional right to counsel and
 to contact relatives or friends, this right is often not
 respected.' In some cases, detaifiees-may be ieleased from
 prison while the investigation proceeds, but the bail system in
 Mozambique remains ill-defined. The law provides that if the
 prescribed period for investigation has been completed and no
 charges have been brought, the detainee must be released. In
 practice, however, this law is often ignored, in part because
 of the severe lack of administrative personnel and trained
 lawyers to monitor the judicial system, and in part because
 citizens are often unaware of their rights, particularly those
 granted under the new Constitution, and do not demand them. As
 a result, there contihued to be throughout 1991 a large backlog
 of prisoners awaiting trial, despite reported government
 efforts to speed up pretrial investigations. Detainees often*
 spend many months, even years, in pretrial'status.
 The SNASP,'.abolished in September, had broad powers to arrest
 persons accused of political and economic crimes againse the"
 State, such as espionage or sabotage. It often used these
 powers, arbitrarily, mainly against anyone suspected of
 sympathizing with RENAMO, and held detainees indefinitely,
 often incommunicado. Its successor, the SISE, no longer has
 this power. In Xheory, security detainees now have'the same
 legal rights as ordinary criminal detainees.
 The number of-political detainees awaiting trial, as
 distinguished from those who had been convicted, was unknown at
 year's end. There were an estimated 700 security prisoners at
 the end of 1990'; that figure was thought to be lower in 1991,
 though no concrete data were available. It is unknown how many
 of these were awaiting trial. Most of those being held are
 accused of sympathizing with, or committing crimes on behalf
 of, RENAMO.
 In June and July, 21 persons were arrested for allegedly
 attempting to overthrow the Government. Two of the suspects
 were released shortly after their arrest,.and three more were
 released in September for lack of evidence. The Attorney
 General said the State would'ensure a fair and legal trial.
 The new Constitution expressly prohibits the expulsion of any
 Mozambic~n citizen.-
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mozambique has two complementary justice systems: the
 civil/criminal, which includes customary courts, and the
 military justice system, both under the administration of the
 Ministry of Justice. At the apex of both systems is the
 Supreme Court. Military courts, including brigade courts and
 provincial military courts for specified military-related
 crimes, are administered jointly with the Ministry of Defense.
 
 
 260
 MOZAMBIQUE
 Crimes committed by senior military officials are handled
 directly by the Supreme Court. Appeals, including military
 cases, may be made to the Supreme Court, where two judges are
 designated to handle military matters.
 Since the establishment of the Supreme Court in 1988 and the
 abolition of the Revolutionary Military' Tribunal, persons
 accused of crimes against the State are tried in common
 civilian courts under standard criminal judicial procedures.
 For example, persons arrested in July for allegedly attempting
 to overthrow the Government are being tried in civilian
 courts. Although all accused persons are in theory presumed
 innocent and have the right to legal counsel and the right of
 appeal, these rights are not always applied. A judge may order
 a trial closed because of national security interests or to
 protect the privacy of the plaintiff in cases concerning rape.
 Trials in the regular civil and criminal court system are
 generally public and fair, but the entire process suffers
 severely from the Government's inability to reduce a large
 backlog of cases.
 In addition to the regular courts at the provincial and
 district levels, there are customary courts at the local level
 which handle matters such as estate and divorce cases. The
 proceedings are usually conducted in public by a trained
 representative of the Ministry of Justice, assisted by two or
 four popularly elected lay judges instructed to exercise common
 sense and to apply locally accepted principles.
 The 1990 Constitution establishes an independent judiciary and
 provides for the selection of judges by other jurists,
 replacing the prior system of administratively appointed
 justices. Under the new Constitution, the President appoints
 seven members of the Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice
 and Assistant Chief Justice, from career jurists. An
 additional 9 to 18 "citizen judges" are elected by the National
 Assembly. The practical impact of these and projected changes
 on the independence of the judiciary remains to be tested.
 Several of the new political parties continued to maintain that
 the Government was still holding political prisoners as well as
 operating reeducation camps, although no new evidence emerged
 in 1991 to support those claims. The Government continued to
 deny the charges and said that all political prisoners have
 either been granted amnesty, pardoned, or were dead.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Despite provisions for privacy in the new Constitution, in
 areas of active insurgency homes are entered at will by
 security and police forces. Civilians living in these areas
 are often forced to move to government-protected villages. The
 population concentrated in the secure villages suffers from
 malnutrition, disease, and high mortality rates.
 It is widely assumed that surveillance devices are employed to
 monitor local and international telecommunications systems and
 that mail is periodically inspected, even though the new
 Constitution.expressly prohibits such surveillance.
 
 
 MOZAMBIQUE
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Both government (FAM) and RENAMO forces were again responsible
 for violations of humanitarian law in 1991, although RENAMO
 abuses continued to be much more widespread and systematic.
 Attacks against civilians were reported frequently, and, given
 the remoteness of much of the countryside, many more attacks
 undoubtedly went unreported. Since it began in the late
 1970's, the conflict is estimated to have cost approximately
 500,000 lives and left millions of Mozambicans homeless and
 living on the edge of starvation.
 There. is no estimate 'of the number of killings in 1991 by
 government f6rces, but there have been credible reports,
 including allegations by refugees, of abuses by government
 forces. According to press and eyewitness reports, government
 soldiers regularly attacked residents of Matola-Rio, killing
 and torturing many persons and looting property. In another
 incident, security forces shot into a crowd of citizens during
 a protest in Sofala province over the payment of salaries,
 wounding three adults and killing a child. There wdre also
 numerous complaints of forced recruitment by government troops.
 Senior officials repeatedly urged the security and military
 forces to respect the population, and in some cases legal
 charges were brought against undisciplined soldiers. In one
 such case, a military court sentenced two officers to 12 and 15
 years in prison, respectively, for killing a civilian accused
 of being involved with RENAMO. In 1991, 66 police were brovght
 before an internal commission of the police department for
 crimes ranging from attacks on citizens to theft. According to
 the Government, 46 of these policehad been discipline or
 expelled from the force. The others were still being
 investigated.
 Atrocities by RENAMO are well documented; the-rebel gkoup
 continued to execute or kidnap noncombatants after attacks on
 villages' often hacking or burning people to death and later
 "displaying body parts, apparently to intimidate would-be
 resisters. For example, such atrocities were widely reported
 in national and international media after RENAMO overran the
 the town of Lalaua in Nampula province in August. There were
 numerous other such abuses during the year. RENAMO also
 continued to forcibly impress civilians; including children,
 and to attack relief convoys, health workers, and clinics. By
 year's end, allegations of armed attacks by both RERAMO and FAM
 on refugee camps in Malawi were a growing concern.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The new Constitution provides for freedom of expression and the
 press, but it also permits the Government to restrict these
 freedoms for various reasons, including national defense
 considerations. The new press law holds that, in cases of
 defamation against the President or ambassadors accredited tb$
 Mozambique, truth is not a sufficient defense. Criticism of
 these persons, however, is not prohibited. In practice, there
 was increased freedom of speech with the advent of several new
 political parties. Some political opposition leaders voiced
 harsh public criticism of the one-party political system, and
 there was more open discussion within FRELIMO at its party
 congress.
 
 
 262
 MOZAMBIQUE
 There is no formal prior press censorship in Mozambique.
 However, many journalists have stated that they are held to
 unwritten and sometimes vague guidelines by their media
 directors, who are, in turn, appointed by the Government. The
 journalists claim that this encouraged self-censorship.
 In general, press freedom improved in 1991. According to media
 sources, official interference was almost nonexistent by year's
 end. The media ran stories on corruption, official
 incompetence, and incidents of military and police abuse of the
 civilian population. Journalists stated publicly that they had
 received death threats from the military to stop stories on
 army press-ganging but were apparently not intimidated and
 continued to report the story. Editorials and commentaries
 rarely criticized FRELIMO and never directly criticized the
 President. However, the press reported, in full and without
 penalty, strong criticism of FRELIMO and the Government by the
 new political parties.
 All mass media, including radio and television, are owned by
 the Government, except for one privately owned newsmagazine.
 The National Organization of Mozambican Journalists declared
 its independence from FRELIMO in 1991. It lobbied vigorously
 for a less restrictive press environment and pressed the
 Government for a liberal interpretation of the new press law.
 This new law permits private media and allows private
 investment in state-owned media. Foreign journalists are
 welcome, and foreign radio broadcasts and television are
 received without interference.
 No formal restrictions on academic freedom exist, but in
 practice teachers are subject to the same self-censorship as
 the media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. Legislation enacted in 1991 set up guidelines for
 registering as a political party, as well as for holding public
 demonstrations (see Section 3). Opposition political groups
 met during the year and held congresses and press conferences
 with no government interference.
 While the requirements for holding public demonstrations are
 not onerous, the Government's overly strict application of the
 rules made it difficult for some groups to exercise this
 right. The Government halted or prohibited several public
 demonstrations on technical grounds. Some FRELIMO party
 officials have defended this approach, insisting that security
 concerns take precedence over freedom of assembly.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Both the original and the new Constitutions mandate strict
 separation of church and state and provide for the freedom to
 "practice or not practice a religion." The Government does not
 require religious organizations or missionaries to register,
 and foreign missionaries are readily granted visas. The new
 Constitution gives religious institutions the right to own
 property and allows private entities, including presumably
 religious institutions, to operate schools.
 Relations between the Government and religious organizations,
 tense in the early years after independence, continued to
 improve in 1991. The Government agreed in principle to return
 
 
 263
 MOZAMBIQUE
 many properties expropriated from religious organizations in
 the postindependence period, and some property was returned in
 1991.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The new Constitution provides for freedom to travel within the
 country and abroad and prohibits exile or revocation of
 Mozambican citizenship for political reasons. The Government
 no longer requires citizens to obtain permits from local
 authorities in order to travel throughout the country.
 Citizens in insecure areas are often forced to move to
 government-protected villages.
 Given the civil conflict, there are few refugees from other
 countries in Mozambique. At the end of 1591, only 358 refugees
 received assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) with the full cooperation of the
 Government. There were no reported cases in which refugees
 were forced to return to countries where they have a
 well-founded fear of persecution.
 There are an estimated 1.4 million internally displaced people,
 living mainly in displaced persons camps scattered throughout
 the country. In these camps, they receive emergency aid from
 the Government and from the international community. Over 1.5
 million Mozambicans have left their homes for refuge in
 neighboring countries. Over half have gone to Malawi, others
 to South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Zambia, and Swaziland.
 The Government readily accepts and aids repatriates; in Ifecent
 years, an estimated 234,000 have returned on their own
 initiative, or through tJNHCR voluntary repatriation programs
 coordinated with neighboring governments. Outflow, however,
 still exceeds repatriations.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens did not have the ability to change their government in
 1991. Although the 1990 Constitution provides for multiparty
 elections, RENAMO and most of the new opposition parties
 indicated that they would not participate in elections before a
 political settlement was reached to end the longstanding civil
 war. Consequently, the Government postponed national elections
 indefinitely pending the outcome of the Rome peace talks with
 RENAMO, at which issues related to the holding of future
 multiparty elections were also being discussed. An accord
 reached in Rome in November altered several aspects of the
 political parties law passed by the Government in 1991 but
 preserved the commitment to hold early elections.
 The postindependence single-party constitution established a
 system tiat effectively allowed the President, the FRELIMO
 Politburo, and the Council of Ministers to control policymaking
 and implementation. The new Constitution officially ended the
 leading role of the FRELIMO party, although the
 FRELIMO-dominated Government will remain in office pending new
 elections. The new Constitution calls for a strong presidency,
 but it also strengthens the legislature by allowing a
 two-thirds majority to override what is essentially a
 presidential veto. It also provides for eventual
 constitutional review of legislation by the Supreme Court.
 
 
 264
 MOZAMBIQUE
 The Constitution provides for an unlimited number of political
 parties. Under the political parties law promulgated in 1991,
 a legally recognized political party must demonstrate that it
 has no racial, ethnic, or religious exclusiveness and must
 demonstrate support in all provinces. (The November accord on
 political parties law would eliminate this latter
 requirement.) Fourteen different parties had formally
 announced their formation by the end of 1991; only FRELIMO,
 though, had officially registered.
 The success of the new Constitution and a multiparty system
 will depend heavily on RENAMO's intentions. While RENAMO has
 long demanded the establishment of a multiparty system in
 Mozambique, it denounced the Government's unilateral
 implementation of the new Constitution and legislation on
 political parties.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local organizations that monitor human rights
 abuses, although there are no legal obstacles to the formation
 of such groups. The Government is receptive, however, to some
 international human rights monitoring groups. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) maintains
 offices in Maputo and Beira, but its relations with the
 Government suffered in 1991 following the discovery of military
 and police uniforms in an ICRC donation shipment. The
 Government accused the ICRC of providing uniforms to RENAMO,
 which the ICRC denied. By the end of the year, however, the
 matter had subsided, and relations were improving.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits such discrimination, and there does
 not appear to be any systematic persecution on the basis of
 ethnicity or race. Nonetheless, the FRELIMO Government has
 tended to include at all levels a disproportionate number of
 southerners, mostly from the Shangana ethnic group. White,
 Asian, and mixed-race Mozdmbicans are also heavily represented
 relative to their numbers in the population. This is not the
 case, however, in the military where no whites and few
 mixed-race Mozambicans serve. Most observers, both Mozambican
 and foreign, believe that ethnic imbalance in governmental
 positions results from the greater educational opportunities
 available to southerners and nonblacks under the former
 .colonial administration and not from deliberate government
 policies. During its Sixth Congress in August, FRELIMO
 broadened the regional and ethnic base of the party by creating
 slates of candidates for the Central Committee from all
 provinces.
 Racial issues figured in political debates in 1991. During the
 discussion over the new nationality law, several National
 Assembly members argued that Mozambican citizenship should be
 limited to persons of black Mozambican origin, excluding
 whites, Indians, and mixed races; the final legislation did
 not, however, adopt that definition. Some of the new political
 parties also played on racial themes as they worked to define
 themselves. During its party congress, the Liberal Party of
 Mozambique (PALMO) attacked the role of whites and mixed races
 in the Government and the economy, though it publicly retreated
 from these statements later.
 
 
 265
 MOZAMBIQUE
 The leadership of the RENAMO insurgents is predominantly from
 the Shona-speaking ethnic .groups who live near the Zimbabwean
 border. There is no indication that the conflict between the
 Government and RENAMe is primarily motivated by ethnicity,
 although ethnic and regional factors may play some role, and.
 tribal factors may explain-some .of the violence. Historical
 accident appears to be xesponsible for the ethnic composition
 of the RENAMO leadership; the Shona was the group culturally
 and geographically most accessible to the Rhodesian
 intelligence organization, which established the forerunner to
 RENAMO in-the late 1970's. Since then RENAMO has recruited
 from all ethnic groups and has not emphasized ethnic issues in
 its communiques or in its negotiating positions.
 The'neii Constitution forbids discrimination on the basis of sex
 and mandates equal rights 'and responsibilities for women.
 Tamily lw -requires that -women have equal prmperty rights -and
 rights over the children in any marriage. In practice, women
 are underrepresented in the professions and in: educational
 institutions at all levels. Over 80 percent of Mozambican
 women are peasant farmers, and most have had little education
 or access to good health care. Mozambique has one of the
 highest maternal mortafity rates'in the world. The"
 Organization of Mozambican Women (OMM) has made a long-term
 project of studying the traditional practices of the various
 ethnic groups and challenging, through grassroots educational
 programs, those practices believed detrimental to women.
 FRELIMO made a concerted effort to increase the representation
 of women in the party, electing ii 1991 a Central.Committee
 with a 35-percent female membership.
 According to medical and other sources, violence against women,
 especially-wife beating, is fairly widespread in Mozambique,
 especially in rural areas. The police do not normally
 intervene in domestic disputes, and cases are rarely brought
 before the courts. The Government has not addressed the issue
 specifically, and its influence is weak, especially in many
 rural areas affected by the war. The OMM is campaigning to
 change public attitudes on violence against women and other
 practices, such as female circumcision and bride-price
 payments, which continue in some rural areas. Female
 circumcision is found most frequently in coastal areas,
 particularly among Muslim groups.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The 1990 Constitution specifies that all workers, are free to
 join or not join a trade union. A new labor law passed in
 December further protects workers' rights to organize and to
 engage*in union activity at their place of employment.
 However, at the end of 1991, all trade unions were still
 incorporated into a central labor union confederation, the
 Organizatign of Mozambican Workers (OTM), which was loosely
 affiliated with the FRELIMO party until late.1990, when it
 declared itself independent. In late 1991, the Assembly
 approved legislation clarifying the right of labor groups to
 form independent trade unions. By the end of 1991, no other
 independent unions had yet been formed.
 For the first time, the new Constitution explicitly provides
 for the right to strike, though it restricts this right for
 government employees, police, military personnel, and employees
 of other essential services. Following the wave of wildcat
 
 
 266
 MOZAMBIQUE
 strikes in 1990, the Government introduced a set of provisional
 guidelines which have the effect of delaying strikes but which
 nevertheless conferred de facto recognition on ad hoc labor
 committees to act as independent negotiating units in place of
 OTM. These guidelines require prior notice of strike activity,
 exhaustion of other alternatives, presentation of a list of
 demands, and appointment of a negotiating committee. According
 to government reports, strikers in several subsequent walkouts
 adhered to the guidelines. However, in 1991 there was much
 confusion regarding the Government's interpretation of the
 provisional guidelines, the new labor law, and the right to
 strike.
 During 1991 wildcat strikes continued in several sectors,
 though with less frequency than in 1990. Strikers continued to
 rely on ad hoc committees to press their demands rather than on
 the OTM leadership with its close ties to the Government and
 FRELIMO. While the new OTM leadership hoped to convince labor
 of its new independent role, at the end of 1991 many OTM
 leaders continued to hold prominent positions in FRELIMO.
 Strikers in several industries were able to win their demands
 from management, though a strike among air trAffic controllers
 dragged on throughout the year, with the Government taking an
 ambivalent position.
 The Constitution and labor legislation guarantee unions the
 right to join and participate in international bodies. The OTM
 is not affiliated with any non-African international trade
 union organization; it is a member of the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity and the Southern African Trade Union
 Coordinating Council.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The new labor law protects workers' rights to organize and to
 engage in collective bargaining. It expressly prohibits
 discrimination against organized labor. In late 1991, the
 Government decreed that it would no longer set all salary
 levels. Negotiating wage increases was left in the hands of
 the existing unions. Though some unions have begun the process
 of negotiating new wage levels, it is too early to tell how
 successful they will be or whether they will be able to gain
 the confidence of workers. During most of 1991, workers chose
 to bargain with employers through legally recognized ad hoc
 committees, with mixed results. The law requires Government
 arbitration if labor and management fail to reach agreement.
 There are currently no export processing zones in Mozambique.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and there have
 been no reports of such labor practices by the Government.
 RENAMO reportedly forces kidnaped civilians to perform various
 support functions, including portering arms and supplies and
 growing food for combatants. There were also reports of forced
 conscription by the FAM.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Child labor is regulated by the Ministry of Labor. In the wage
 economy the minimum working age is 16. Because of high adult
 unemployment, there are few children in regular wage
 positions. However, children commonly work on family farms or
 in the urban informal sector, where they perform such tasks as
 
 
 267
 MOZAMBIQE
 watching cars or collecting scrap metal. In addition, many
 children are kidnaped by RENAMO and forced to serve as soldiers
 or laborers for the rebels.
 e.. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Ministry of Labor enforces minimum wage rates in the
 private sector-. Public sector rates are enforced by the
 Ministry of Finance. Violations of minimum wage rates are
 usually investigated only after workers register a complaint.
 It is customary for workers to receive benefits such as
 transportation and food. The minimum wage is not adequate to
 sustain an average urban worker's family. Workers must turn to
 second jobs, if available, as well as work garden plots to
 survive. An estimated 80 percent of the work force is engaged
 in subsistence agriculture, which is not covered by minimum
 wage legislation. The standard legal workweek is 44 hours.
 In the small, modern sector, the Government has enacted health
 and environmental laws to protect workers. On occasion, the
