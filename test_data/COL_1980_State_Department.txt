 COLOMBIA
 Colombia has been ruled by freely elected governments
 for all but five years (1953-57) of the present century.
 The constitution provides for a popularly-elected president
 and congress and an independent judiciary. Two political
 parties, the Liberal and Conservative, dominate Colombian
 politics. The constitution mandates that the president's
 party must give the other principal party "adequate and
 equitable" representation in the government. The present
 chief executive is a Liberal, but six of thirteen cabinet
 positions are held by Conservatives. Minor parties exist
 and are legal in Colombia, although none has attracted
 widespread popular support in recent years.
 The constitution guarantees numerous civil and political
 liberties as well as some social benefits. A constitu-
 tionally-authorized state of siege, which permits the
 curtailment of some civil and political freedoms, has
 been imposed increasingly during the last 20 years and
 is currently in effect. A "security statute" decreed
 by the government in 1978 provides for military trials
 of civilians accused of certain crimes and has come under
 severe criticism by human rights and opposition groups
 as denying basic human rights. The government has argued
 that these measures are necessary because politically
 inspired violence over the past thirty years threatens
 Colombia's institutions. The Colombian government has
 notified the United Nations (UN) under Article 4 of the
 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
 that extraordinary measures are necessary in Colombia.
 The attempts to eliminate this violence resulted in numerous
 charges of human rights violations, including torture,
 and increased attention by local and international human
 rights groups to the situation in Colombia. In response,
 President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala invited Amnesty Interna-
 tional to study the human rights situation of Colombia,
 and a commission from that organization visited Colombia
 in January 1980. In February, guerrillas from the April
 19th Movement (M-19) seized and held the Embassy of the
 Dominican Republic in Bogota for two months; among the
 diplomatic hostages was the American Ambassador. In
 the midst of the crisis, Amnesty International issued
 its preliminary report, which was very critical of the
 Colombian human rights record. The report was rejected
 by the Colombian government as insensitive to Colombia's
 serious problem of subversion and as ignoring efforts
 made by the government to correct violations that had
 occurred. As part of the settlement which eventually
 led to the release of the hostages, President Turbay
 asked the Inter-American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC)
 to come to Colombia to investigate charges of human rights
 abuses. The Commission has not yet issued its report.
 Although accusations of torture of prisoners were much
 
 
 382
 less frequent in 1980 than they were in 1979, the govern-
 ment has been criticized for the continued imposition
 of a state of siege, the 1978 security statute and military
 offensives aimed at guerrillas.   Also, many of those
 arrested under the security statute in 1979 have not
 received verdicts because of the lengthy trial process.
 The Turbay administration has proposed a limited amnesty,
 which still must be approved by the full congress, for
 those who are in armed opposition against the government.
 The amnesty bill has been approved by the House of Repre-
 sentatives but not yet by the Senate.
 Colombia has recently experienced strong economic growth,
 and the country's favorable foreign exchange situation
 further improved during 1980. However, skewed distribution
 of wealth, limited resources to address the nation's
 social problems, and high inflation continued to plague
 the country.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The constitution states that public officials may be
 held responsible for abuses of authority and for acts
 of omission in the exercise of their authority. Torture
 is forbidden by law and is contrary to custom. High-
 ranking Colombian officials have decried its use. The
 new penal code, which is scheduled to go into effect
 in January 1981, characterizes as a crime any kind of
 torture.
 Very few charges of torture have surfaced during 1980.
 Even the government's staunchest critics have said that
 the Colombian government's record in this area has improved
 substantially since 1979. When torture is alleged, govern-
 ment policy dictates an investigation of the charges.
 One case in which torture has been alleged by family,
 press and human rights groups is that of Jorge Marcos
 Zambrano, a student arrested with other suspected members
 of the M-19 and turned over to Colombian military author-
 ities in Cali on February 22, 1980. Twenty-four hours
 later, Zambrano's body was delivered to a hospital.
 Because of-allegations that Zambrano died as a result
 of torture inflicted by the military authorities, two
 army officials were tried for their role. Although the
 two were originally acquitted, the supreme military tribu-
 nal has ordered that the case be retried because of evidence
 overlooked in the first trial.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Colombian constitution specifically proscribes the
 death penalty. However, the Colombian council of state,
 the organization ultimately responsible for adjudicating
 administrative abuses, has awarded indemnities for wrongful
 death at the hands of government forces. In one such
 ruling, the council of state said there was evidence
 that government forces were ignoring the constitutional
 ban against the death penalty. The council has also
 
 
 383
 awarded reparations to families of victims of guerrilla
 groups.
 Following the capture of an army platoon by guerrillas
 in August, the military launched a major offensive in
 rural areas where insurgents have held long-standing
 redoubts. Some 1,000 farmers caught between the guerrillas
 and military fled their lands amidst charges as to which
 side was responsible for the flight.
 Colombia's prison facilities are badly overcrowded.
 Conditions vary from prison to prison, and the quality
 of life for prisoners depends largely on their financial
 resources. The central prison authorities took actions
 during 1980 to improve prison conditions and upgrade
 security, and several prison directors were dismissed
 as a result.
 Some detainees accused of security offenses have been
 held in military installations not normally used as pris-
 ons, but conditions in these facilities are normally
 equal to or better than those in regular prisons. Most
 prisoners accused of security-related crimes are incar-
 cerated in regular prisons, segregated from common crimi-
 nals.
 Family members and friends are normally allowed to visit
 prisoners regularly. Some of the accused have on occasion
 even held political "rallies" in the prisons. In January,
 the Amnesty International commission visited eleven prisons
 in seven cities as well as two military institutions
 being used as prisons. In April, the IAHRC commission
 also visited prisons in several cities, and representatives
 from the IAHRC have made periodic visits to Colombia
 since then. In addition, the ministry of justice maintains
 a program of regular prison visits by ministry officials.
 c.   Disappearances
 There have been no confirmed cases of disappearances,
 and few allegations have surfaced.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under the existing state of siege, the government has
 broad powers of arrest and detention. The government
 has repeatedly stated that no one is arrested simply
 for his political beliefs but that all those held under
 Article 28 of the constitution (dealing with threats
 to the public order) or the security statute of September
 1978, have been detained on suspicion of having committed
 crimes such as rebellion or acts of violence. Amnesty
 International recommended, however, that crimes such
 as "subversion" and "disturbances of the public order"
 need to be more clearly defined so that human rights
 can be safeguarded. Under the government-sponsored amnesty
 bill, those accused or convicted of "sedition, rebellion,
 and uprising," who have not also committed violent crimes,
 would be eligible for amnesty.
 Although during 1980 Colombia's security forces refrained
 from the widespread searches and detentions which character-
 ized the first months of 1979, there appear to have been
 some unjustified arrests. In July, in the wake of the
 escape from prison of two leaders of the M-19, security
 forces conducted 800 searches and arrested 1600 suspects
 
 
 384
 in the city of Medellin alone. Most of the detainees
 were later released for lack of evidence. Relatives
 of prisoners being held for security-related offenses
 have complained that the relatives are subjected to unjust-
 ifiable searches and detention.
 Colombia's constitution provides for habeas corpus in
 most cases, although it does not apply to any person
 detained under Article 28 during the first ten days of
 his detention. Prisoners are routinely held incommunicado
 for at least the first 72 hours of their detention and
 frequently for much longer periods.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The rights of public access to a trial and due process
 are guaranteed by the constitution and generally honored
 in practice. Prisoners may be represented by attorneys
 of their choice, and, if they have none, the court will
 appoint one. Court proceedings are closed until the
 investigation of the circumstances is completed and an
 indictment handed down. Owing to an overburdened judicial
 system, many persons indicted for common crimes never
 come to trial but are simply released after serving the
 minimum sentence applicable to the crime in question.
 In July, the congress passed a "judicial emergency" bill
 aimed at alleviating this situation. When the bill is
 implemented, it is estimated that approximately 9,000
 prisoners--more than 20 percent of the Colombian prison
 population--whose cases have never been brought to trial
 will be released.
 Under the 1978 security statute, the following offenses
 are tried by military courts: kidnapping for political
 purposes; promoting or leading an armed uprising; commit-
 ting violent acts against collective security or integrity;
 causing public disturbances; damaging property by the
 use of explosives; delivering, sending or storing illegal
 goods, money or documents, or forcing any other person
 to do so; and crimes against the military. According
 to the ministry of defense, 1,253 prisoners are currently
 being detained under the military judicial system, of
 which 1,027 have been mandated to jail under arrest warrants,
 181 have been found guilty by lower courts and 45 have
 had their convictions reaffirmed on appeal.
 The original rationale for the involvement of military
 courts in the trials of security related offenses was
 to provide speedier trials than was possible by the over-
 burdened civilian criminal court system. However, the
 large number of prisoners arrested under the security
 statute, primarily during 1979, and the fact that many
 of them are being tried in large group trials have slowed
 the process in the military court system also. The govern-
 ment attempted several procedural changes to speed up
 the trials now underway but has not found a solution
 which is consistent with defense attorneys' concerns
 and with Colombian law. The government has argued that
 the military justice system provides adequate safeguards
 to assure fair trials for civilians, and recent examples
 demonstrate the independence of the military courts.
 Whether tried in civil or military courts, the accused
 is entitled to counsel, and counsel has free access to
 the de endant for private consultations. Defendants
 are made ful y aware of the charges brought against them,
 
 
 385
 and they and their lawyers may inform themselves of the
 evidence on which the charges are based. Complaints
 have been made of government harassment of defense counsel
 in some security statute cases.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 The constitution requires a court order before the author-
 ities can enter a private home, except in the case of
 hot pursuit of .a person seen committing a crime who at-
 tempts to seek refuge in his own home.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Colombia has a mixed economy in which property ownership
 is considered a right of the citizen. The constitution
 gives the government the right to set the general direction
 of the economy and permits it to intervene in the produc-
 tion, distribution, utilization and consumption of goods
 and services. Generally, the state does not openly inter-
 vene but rather exercises selective controls over private
 enterprise. The private sector is well-organized, and
 sectoral interest groups often exercise powerful influence
 over government policy.
 The recent trend of strong economic growth in Colombia
 continued Ln 1980. It has been estimated that the per
 capita gross national product will have reached $1,161,
 a growth of about 3 percent in 1980 in real terms. A
 high rate of inflation, estimated at 25 percent in 1980,
 has continued to plague the economy and has had a particularly
 harmful effect on the poorest strata of the population,
 particularly farmers, who cannot defend their incomes
 against declining purchasing power. Economic policy-
 makers pursued an essentially anti-inflationary policy.
 However, these efforts to slow price increases included
 restrictive monetary and fiscal policies which reduced
 public sector spending to meet acknowledged social needs
 and which slowed employment-creating investment.
 According to Colombian government statistics, unemploy-
 ment has increased since last year and is now about 10
 percent. Underemployment is about 12-14 percent. Usually
 omitted from any official labor statistics are the estimated
 2.5 million children under 15 who work in Colombia under
 poor salary and work conditions and without the protection
 of the Colombia labor code. The National Salary Council
 periodically establishes minimum wage levels for both
 industry and agriculture. While increases in minimum
 wages have kept pace with increases in the cost of living
 in recent years, workers have not recuperated the losses
 sustained earlier (1968-1975).
 Another negative feature of the Colombian economy is
 the inequality in the distribution of the nation's wealth.
 According to a 1979 World Bank report, the wealthiest
 4 percent of Colombians receive 28 percent of the income,
 while the poorest 40 percent receive only 10 percent.
 Colombia has a highly progressive income tax, but tax
 evasion is widespread.
 
 
 Land tenure patterns show a similarly distorted distribution:
 The top 10 percent of the landowners hold 80 percent
 of the land, while the bottom 10 percent-own only 0.2
 percent. A notable exception to income maldistribution
 is in Colombia's important coffee growing regions, where
 farms have traditionally been medium to small-sized.
 Significant regional inequalities also exist, with the
 best economic opportunities, health care facilities and
 education available in the largest cities. This has
 contributed to the problem of heavy, though decreasing,
 migration from the countryside to the cities.
 Another major problem facing Colombian economic policy-
 makers is the distortion caused by the repatriation of
 some of the profits of the illicit drug traffic. The
 money, estimated at $750 million in 1979, escapes government
 monetary policy and hence contributes to inflationary
 pressure. The narcotics industry is a corrupting influence
 on Colombian society and politics. The Turbay Administration
 has named a commission to study the impact of this illicitly-
 obtained money.
 Although Colombia has made great progress in recent years
 in social services, significant portions of the population
 still cannot meet basic human needs. According to the
 most recent World Bank statistics, 28 percent of the
 city dwellers and 80 percent of the rural population
 lack access to piped water. Although primary education
 is free and compulsory, only 7 out of 10 children between
 the ages of 7 and 14 are in school. There is a severe
 teacher shortage, particularly in the countryside. The
 adult literacy rate is estimated to be 77 percent. Colombia's
 infant mortality rate is about 70 per 1,000 live births,
 and average life expectancy is slightly over 60 years.
 Again, however, regional differences are substantial.
 The country's housing deficit is growing at an annual
 rate of 5.3 percent. The vast majority of Colombians
 over the age of 65 do not receive any social security
 benefits.
 The Turbay administration has stated its commitment to
 economic development that meets the social needs of the
 country. In the total budget for 1980, the social sector
 ministries (labor, health and government) account for
 some 30 percent of government expenditures. As two specific
 examples of current social sector spending, primary health
 services have been established in 1,037 localities since
 1979, and the government institution which finances low
 cost housing had a budget of 94 million pesos in 1980
 compared to 24.5 million in 1979 (one dollar equals about
 50 pesos). During the last half of 1980, the government
 instituted a major adult literacy campaign and approved
 legislation which would extend social security benefits
 to retirees and family members.
 The economic situation of the Colombian woman, though
 improving, is not equal to that of the Colombian man.
 Women have equal civil and property rights. They comprise
 just over twenty-five percent of the economically active
 population but are overrepresented in low-productivity
 and low-wage sectors. Historically the unemployment
 rate for women has been higher than for men, but this
 difference has decreased in recent years. Although Colom-
 bian women are legally entitled to equal pay and are
 normally paid equal salaries when employed by the govern-
 
 
 387
 ment, in private industry they are almost always paid
 less than men for the same work. A survey conducted
 in Cali in 1980 showed that women there with the same
 age, education, experience and jobs earned only 75 percent
 as much as their male counterparts.
 There is no discrimination against women in the formal
 education system. An increasing number of females are
 receiving higher education, and women currently comprise
 30 percent of the Colombian university population.
 President Turbay has created a "National Council for
 the Integration of Women in Development," a public body
 directly under the presidency whose functions are to
 advise the president and collaborate with the government
 on programs aimed at achieving greater female participation
 in the public and private sectors.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These constitutionally-guaranteed rights have been generally
 respected in spite of the state of siege. Press censorship
 does not exist, and the press often attacks the government
 and its leaders vigorously. However, the 1978 security
 statute gives the government authority to ban radio and
 TV broadcasts dealing with subveisive activities and
 public order. The government imposed this restriction
 several times during 1980, for example, during the siege
 of the Dominican Embassy. No media were closed down
 during 1980.
 Public meetings, marches and demonstrations are normally
 and frequently held without interference, although the
 government can impede public assembly when it anticipates
 violence. In mid-August, a second national forum on
 human rights and general amnesty was held in Bogota and
 attended by several thousand participants from a broad
 political spectrum. At the forum, all aspects of the
 Colombian human rights situation were openly discussed.
 Colombian workers freely exercise the right to form unions
 and, in the private sector, to bargain collectively and
 strike in pursuit of professional or economic goals.
 Public sector unions also negotiate and occasionally
 strike despite legal prohibitions and sanctions. The
 labor code is administered impartially regardless of
 the ideology of the union. Some labor organizations
 charged that the government has misused the security
 statute's restriction of the right of assembly to hamper
 legitimate trade union activity. However, there have
 been fewer charges of such misuse in 1980 than in 1979.
 The Colombian constitution guarantees freedom of religion.
 Although an overwhelming majority of Colombians are Roman
 Catholics (the state religion), there is no discrimination
 against others.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Internal travel controls consist of airport and highway
 document checks and inspection for illegal arms. Foreign
 residents leaving the country must have an exit permit.
 
 
 388
 Under a special decree aimed at controlling drug traffic,
 there are increased restrictions on the movement of aircraft
 and ships. In areas under military control because of
 efforts against rural guerrilla groups, the movement
 of civilians has been subjected to more severe restrictions.
 Colombia has a relatively open refugee and asylum policy.
 Asylees who sought refuge in the Colombian embassies
 in Bolivia and Nicaragua have been admitted to Colombia
 during 1980. Those members of subversive organizations
 who sought asylum in foreign embassies in Bogota were
 permitted safe conduct out of the country. Any Colombian
 with a valid passport is free to leave the country without
 unusual restrictions. An estimated 60,000 Colombians
 emigrate each year to other countries--primarily the
 United States and Venezuela--in pursuit of a better economic
 situation. There have been no known cases of forcible
 repatriation. Foreigners who are found guilty of misde-
 meanors or crimes are usually deported to the border
 at which they entered the country. In matters of travel
 and migration, women and men are treated equally.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Colombian citizens can participate in their government
 in all the ways normally associated with the democratic
 system. The constitution confers on persons 18 and over
 the right to vote, and this right is respected by the
 authorities. National elections are held every four
 years and local elections every two years. Elections
 are generally honest. Persons convicted for certain
 crimes can be disenfranchised. Public employees are
 forbidden by law to participate in political campaigns
 but can vote.
 The two major political parties encompass sectors with
 widely divergent political views. Opposition parties
 function freely, are allowed to raise funds, field candi-
 dates, hold public meetings and have access to the media;
 some groups publish their own newspapers. However, the
 extremely high rates of voter abstention recently indicate
 that in practice the extent of popular interest in politics
 is limited.
 Women, who have traditionally played a secondary role
 in Colombian society, are increasingly becoming partici-
 pants and leaders at all levels of society. In Colombia
 women serve as legislators, judges, departmental governors,
 party leaders, government officials and diplomats. About
 three percent of all elective offices are held by women.
 The Turbay government currently has a female acting
 minister of labor. A large number of women's organizations
 are active in the country.  In preparation for the 1980
 United Nations Conference on the Decade for Women, a
 conference on women was held in Bogota in June at which
 the participants expressed their desire for a more important
 role in the country, and government representatives supported
 their cause. At the United Nations conference, Colombia
 signed the convention calling for the elimination of
 all forms of discrimination against women.
 
 
 389
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The most active Colombian organization involved in monitor-
 ing the human rights situation is the Permanent Committee
 for the Defense of Human Rights, which was set up in
 early 1979. The organization monitors trials of those
 accused of security offenses, investigates reports of
 human rights violations, publishes a newsletter and sponsors
 an annual human rights forum. The committee has proposed
 a general amnesty bill broader than President Turbay's
 to be considered by congress. Other human rights groups
 in Colombia include the Political Prisoners' Solidarity
 Committee and the Committee of Relatives of Political
 Prisoners.
 Representatives from the Colombian government have been
 active participants in international and regional human
 rights bodies. Colombia was one of the 21 countries
 to submit a report in 1980 to the United Nations Committee
 on Human Rights, established under the International
 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In July, Colombia,
 together with several other South American democracies,
 signed the Lima Declaration which states that those states
 are subject to an "international obligation" to defend
 human, political, social and economic rights. In the
 Riobamba Code of Conduct signed in August, Colombia reiterated
 its formal commitment in defense of democracy, social
 justice and human rights.
 At the invitation of the Colombian government, Amnesty
 International sent an investigatory team to Colombia
 in January 1980. The team was given broad access to
 prisons, prisoners, officials and human rights activists.
 As mentioned above, the organization issued a preliminary
 report in April and a final report was issued in August.
 The report, which concentrated on abuses in 1979 ahd
 earlier, was criticized strongly by President Turbay.
 In response, Amnesty International stated that it was
 aware there was violent opposition in Colombia but stressed
 that this could not justify the use of torture or the
 detention of people for non-violent exercise of basic
 human rights.
 In April, the Colombian government invited the Inter-
 American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC) to come to Colombia
 to investigate charges of human rights violations. This
 team was also allowed broad access to sources. As part
 of the on-going investigation, representatives of the
 IAHRC have visited Colombia periodically. The Commission
 has not yet issued its report.
 Colombia was one of the first nations to ratify the Ameri-
 can Convention on Human Rights.
