 THE GAMBIA
 The Gambia is a parliamentary democracy with an elected president and legisla-
 tur. Except for a coup attempt in 1981, The Gambia has had a history of political
 stability under the leadership of its only President since independence in 1965, Sir
 Dawda Jawara. His ruing People's Prore..ssive Party (PPP) has dominated the uni-
 cameral Parliament, but several opposition parties, as well as independent politi-
 cians, participate in the political process.
 The Gambia has a 900-man army with an attached naval unit, commanded by a
 Nigerian appointed in 1992, and supported by a Nigerian training team. The Gen-
 darmerie and the National Police Force were merd and are firmly under civilian
 control. Total military expenditures for 1989, the ast year for which the U.S. Arms
 Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were $1 million.
 Despite Gambian participation in the regional peacekeeping force in Liberia, the
 Government has undertaken efforts to reduce defense spending.
 The Gambia's estimated population of 870,000 consists largely of subsistence
 farmers growing rice, millet, maize, and groundnuts (peanuts), the country's pri-
 mary export crop. The private sector, led by re-exporting, fisheries, horticulture, and
 tourism, has begun to flourish.
 The Gambia has made particular efforts to promote observance of human rights,
 which are constitutionally protected and generally observed in practice. In 1991 the
 death of a person in plice custody led to a swift investigation, arrests, and trial
 of the police officers. This year, two of the three accused were convicted (see Section
 l.a.).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reported political
 killings. In 1991 Momodou Jardue, a Senegalese resident of The Gambia, died in
 
 
 police custody. The three officers involved were arrested and tried for murder and
 assault. One was acquitted of all charges; the other two were acquitted of murder
 but convicted of assault and sentenced to 3 years at hard labor. In December the
 Court of Appeal upheld the acquittal of the first defendant but unanimously found
 the other two defendants guiltyof murder and sentenced them to death. Both sides
 have the right of appeal to the Privy Council in London.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other crueL inhuman, and degrading punish-
 ment. No systematic abuse of prisoners or detainees appears to occur in The Gam-
 bia, but incidents have occurred in which prison or police officials have beaten pris-
 oners or detainees. When they occur, government officials usually have responded
 swiftly, investigating the incident, and, if warranted, pressing charges.
 Prison canditone aye severe, even after the Government implemented reforms fol-
 lowing the death of several inmates in 1988 from beri-beri. During 1992 a local
 newspaper and other reports described conditions in local prisons in which inmates
 receive inadequate medical care and nutrition. Prisoners at Mile Two Prison suffer
 from leprosy cancer, tuberculosis, and beri-beri. Because Mile Two Prison is located
 next to the Bajul City Dump and a large mangrove swamp, inmates are exposed
 to mosquitoes and therefore malaria. Elderly and handicapped inmates are required
 to work at arduous prison tasks, and prisoners are not allowed regular exercise out-
 side their work assignments. Junior prison officers occasionally beat prisoners and
 arbitrarily place inmates in solitary confinement; however, their superiors often re-
 verse confinement orders. The Government allows prison visits by local Red Cross
 representatives and close family members.
 Some Gambian police officers abuse citizens' rights in the execution of their du-
 ties. Many incidents are unreported, but some complaints reach the Ministry of the
 Interior and, sometimes, the public. Investigations are carried out, and responsible
 personnel have been formally charged. Most such incidents appear to involve junior
 police and security officers acting independently. The Government, recognizing its
 police force needs training, has secured the services of two British consultants to
 train the force in appropriate police techniques.
 dL Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Eile.-Based on British legal practice, well-de-
 veloped constitutional and legal procedures govern the arrest, detention, and trial
 of persons accused of crimes. Under these procedures, an arrested person must not
 be held more than 24 hours unless presented to a magistrate or granted bail. A de-
 tained person must be brought to trial within 1 week of arrest, but this waiting  -
 Hod may be extended twice, making 21 days the maximum period of detention e-
 fore trial. In practice, because of overcrowded court schedules, the detention period
 can be much longer.
 In April, 16 Gambians were arrested for involvement with an unlawful society,
 the Movement for Justice in Africa (MOJA). All claimed that they were held incom-
 municado, without bail or hearing, for extended periods. Some claimed that they
 were tortured, but one told a reporter that he was not harmed by the security serv-
 ice. Twenty-four days after their arrest, they were granted bail. On May 26, in
 Kanifmg Municipal Court, the Director of Public Prosecution moved for the dis-
 charge of the 16 detainees.
 On May 11, President Jawara granted amnesty to all those accused of participat-
 ing in the July 1981 abortive coup and invited all those living abroad to return.
 However, the leader of the failed coup, Kukoi Samba Sanyang, was not included in
 the amnesty; the Government obtained a warrant for his arrest on seven counts of
 treason.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There are three kinds of law in The Gambia: gen-
 eral, customary, and Shari'a (Islamic). Shari'a law is observed in Muslim marriage
 and divorce proceedings. Customary law covers marriage and divorce for non-Mus-
 lims, inheritance, land tenure and utiizatin, local tribal government, and all other
 traditional civil and social relations. General law, based on the English system and
 modified to suit The Gambian context, governs criminal cases and trials and most
 organized business practices. If there were a conflict between general law and
 Shari's, general law would prevail.
 The Constitution provides criminal defendants with the traditional rights of the
 English legal system, such as the presumption of innocence, the right of the accused
 to be informed promptly of the charges, and the right to a public trial. If released
 on bail, an accused person may face charges indefinitely since there is no maximum
 time lmit for completing the investigation and bringing the ase to trial. Appeals
 normally proceed from the Supreme (trial) Court to the Court of Appeals, the coun-
 try's highest tribunal.
 
 
 100
 Judges are appointed by the Government, but the judiciary operates independ-
 ently and is free of government interference.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution contains provisions (which are respected in practice) against arbitrary
 search of person and property. It does permit a search to which a suspect submits
 voluntarily or if the search is reasonably required in the interest of national defense
 or public welfare. Under The Gambian Criminal Code, search warrants based on
 probable cause are issued by magistrates upon a pplication by the police. The Code
 also specifies that police may conduct a search of a private residence while a crime
 is in progress. There are a few checkpoints in the country where the police and mili-
 tar penodically stop and search drivers and vehicles.
 The rights of family are of great importance in The Gambia's conservative Muslim
 society. Marriage, the rearing of children, and religious instruction are regulated
 imarily by personal preference and ethnic and religious tradition; the Government
 does not normally intrude in family matters. There is no effort to censor or control
 personal correspondence or communications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press. Ordinary citizens openly criticize government policies during public meet-
 ings or in private conversations. During the 1992 election, opposition political par-
 ties freely criticized the Government's record.
 In 1992 two new newspapers, a weekly and a triweekly, were published. They
 joined a group of biweekly and monthly mimeographed newssheets, as well as the
 government and PPP newspapers. A degree of self-censorship does exist in the gov-
 ernm ent prss but at a lower level than in the past. The decrease in self-censorship
 can be attributed to competition from independent newspapers.
 There is no television in The Gambia, although Senegalese broadcasts can be re-
 ceived. The Government dominates the media through Radio Gambia. Opposition
 parties did have access to Radio Gambia during the electoral campaign, although
 there were some complaints. There are two commercial radio stations. Foreign mag-
 azines and newspapers are available in the capital. There is no university in The
 Gambia.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-At present the Government
 does not interfere with lawful freedom of assembly and association, for which the
 Constitution provides. The Government almost always grants permits for peaceful
 assembly but requires that these meetings be open to the public. Permits for assem-
 bly are issued by the police and are not denied for political reasons. On November
 25, President Jawara announced the lifing of the ban against the MOJA, which had
 been prscribed for suspected involvement in the unsuccessful 1981 coup attempt.
 No organization is currently prscribed in The Gambia. The law on prscribed orga-
 nizations    been amended so that future bans will require a judicial decision rath-
 er than a presidential decree. The State must now apply to a court for a proscription
 order, citing specific grounds for the request.
 c. Freedom of Religion.--Constitution al prvisions of freedom of conscience,
 thought, and religion are observed in practice. The State is secular, although Mus-
 lims constitute over 90 percent of the population. The schools provide instruction in
 the Koran for Muslim students. Christians, both Catholic and Protestant, freely
 practice their religion. There is a small Baha'i community in Banjul. Missionaries
 are permitted to carry out their activities freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement, subject to condi-
 tions protecting public safety, health, and morals. There is no restriction on freedom
 of emigration or freedom of return. Because of historic and ethnic ties with the in-
 habitants of Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Mauritania, people
 tend to move freely across borders, which are poorly marked and difficult to pohice.
 The number of Liberian efugees continued to increase through 1992. Through
 most of the year the local Uhited Nations Development Program (UNDP) office re-
 eived an average of three applications for refugee status per week. Approximately
 300 Liberians residing in The Gambia are registered with the the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and many more are not. The UNCR
 does not have an assistance program in The Gambia. However, it has provided in-
 terested Liberians transportation to return to Liberia or to travel to other countries
 where UNHCR relief programs exist.
 In 1992 there were large influxes of refugees fleeing the Casamance region of Sn-
 egai. The UNHCR estimates that there are 3,000 Senegalese refugees in The Gam-
 bia. These refugees were supported by The Gambian Red Cress Society with some
 assistance from the International Committee of the Red Cress and private groups.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights; The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government through peaceful means. The
 President and Members of Parliament are popularly elected, as are the district
 councils and the chiefs who exercise traditional authority in the villages and com-
 pounds. Presidential and parliamentary elections are held every 5 years. Citizens
 must be at least 18 years of age to vote. Balloting is secret, and measures are em-
 ployed to assure that illiterate voters understand the choices and voting procedure.
 A functioning multiparty system exists, even though the Peoples' Progressive
 Party under the leadership of President Jawara has been in power since independ-
 ence. All opposition parties contest general elections, and some contest district elec-
 tions. In the Ap    92 presidential and parliamentary elections, candidates from
 the five politi  parties as well as independent candidates campaigned vigorously.
 Observers as well as most participants declared the election free and fair. President
 Jawara was reelected President, but his PPP lost six seats in Parliament. The over-
 all distribution of elected parliamentary seats was 25 for the PPP, 6 for the National
 Convention Party (NCP), 2 for the Gambian People's Party (GPP), and 3 independ-
 ents.
 In accordance with election law seven defeated parliamentary candidates filed pe-
 titions at the Supreme Court challenging the results in their districts. The petitions
 of two NCP candidates were dismissed, but all five petitions from PPP candidates
 were scheduled for hearing. In September the new Chief Justice dismissed one PPP
 petition as spurious, but the petitions of the other PPP candidates are scheduled
 or hearing in 1993.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several international nongovernmental human rights organizations, including the
 International Society for Human Rights, the African Society for International and
 Comparative Law and the African Bar Association, operate freely in The Gambia.
 International human rights organizations may visit to observe the condition of de-
 tainees and the trial process. The Government established an independent (non-
 governmental) organization, the African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights
 Studies, to promote greater respect for human rights in Africa through research into
 and documentation of human rights problems and through workshops and con-
 ferences.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution states that all persons in The Gambia are entitled to "fun-
 damental rights and freedoms," regardless of "race, place of origin, political opin-
 ions, colour, creed, or sex." There is no officially sanctioned discrimination based on
 race sex, religion, language, or social status. The Gambian population is over-
 whelmingly rural with 85 percent living in villages, and there is considerable em-
 phasis on the collective aspects of rights and privileges.
 Traditional views, especially about the role of women in society, are changing but
 very slowly. Marriages are usually "arranged," and Muslim tradition allows for po-
 lygamy. Women are disadvantaged educationally, with females comprising one-third
 of primary students and one-fourth of high school students. The Government has
 encouraged parents to send their daughters to school.
 Domestic violence occurs, and female genital mutilation (circumcision) is prac-
 ticed. According to an independent expert in the field, the percentage of Gambian
 women who have undergone this procedure may be as high as 60 percent. The Wom-
 en's Bureau in the Office of the Vice President conducts an ongoing campaign in
 both the rural and urban areas to make women aware of their legal rights in re-
 spect to divorce and custody of children, property matters, and in cases of assault.
 TeBureau holds workshops on female circumcision to inform women of its nea
 tive effects and to discuss the religious and traditional ties to the practice. It a
 publishes a quarterly magazine on womenas issues, which it distributes throughout
 the country.
 In addition to women, some young boys known as Almudos experience severe
 hardship, deprivation, and degradation. They are given by their parents to Koranic
 scholars to learn the Islamic holy book, and they frequently must resort to public
 D        food. Journalists and human rights activists have said that these boys
 oft sleep 20 or 30 to a small room, have hardly any clothing, and eat barely
 enough to survive. Many are beaten byt    teachers if they do not bring home
 enough money. Some estimate that as many as 60 percent of them are not Gambian.
 The Goverment has reconized the Mroblem. nd the Ministry of Health and Social
 
 
 102
 Welfare assisted by the United Nations Children's Fund, is conducting a study into
 the plight of the Almudos.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Act of 1990 applies to all workers except
 civil servants. The Act specifies that workers are free to form associations including
 trade unions, and provides for their registration with the Government. Police offi-
 cers and military personnel, as well as other civil service employees, are specifically
 prohibited from forming unions and going on strike.
 The Labor Act of 1990 authorizes strikes, but it specifies that a union must give
 the Commissioner of Labor 14 days' written notice before beginnin, an industrial
 action (21 days for essential services). Furthermore, upon application by an em-
 ployer to the Supreme Court, that body may prohibit an industrial action which is
 ruled to be in pursuit of a political objective. The Court may also forbid an action
 which is in breach of a collectively ared procedure for the settlement of industrial
 disputes that has not been exhausted.
 Because of these provisions, government conciliation efforts, and the weak bar-
 gaining position of the unions, few strikes actually occur. However, in 1992 workers
 in one hotel stopped work for 3 hours and sanitation workers threatened to strike.
 Hotel management convinced its employees to return to work. However, eight em-
 ployees were fired for their alleged use of violence during the walkout. The Labor
 Depatment upheld their dismissal because the workers had not provided the Com-
 missioner of Labor the legally mandated 14 days' notice prior to initiating a labor
 action. In the case of sanitation workers, a strike was averted following a meeting
 between the Vice President and union management.
 Less than 20 percent of the work force is employed in the modern wage sector
 of the economy, where unions are normally active. The Gambian Workers' Confed-
 eration (GWC) and The Gambian Workers' Union (GWU) are the two main inde-
 pendent and competing umbrella organizations. Both are recognized by, and have
 good working relationships with, the Government but are independent of the Gov-
 ernment and political parties. Unions exercise the right to affliate internationally,
 and there are no restrictions on their members' ability to participate in inter-
 national activities.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Act of 1990 pro-
 vides workers the right to organize and bargain collectively. Although trade unions
 are small and fragmented, collective bargaining does take place. Prevailing wages
 exceed minimum wages and are determined by collective bargaining, arbitration, or
 market forces. The Labor Department registers the collective bargaining agreements
 reached between the unions and management, after ensuring that the agreements
 do not violate the Labor Act. There are no reports of denial of registration. The Act
 also sets minimum standards for contracts in the areas of hiring, training, terms
 of employment, wages, and termination of employment. The Act states that "any
 term of a contract of employment prohibiting an employee from becoming or remain-
 ing a member of any trade union or other organization representing workers...shall
 be null and void." Otherwise, the Government does not interfere in the bargaining
 process.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Criminal Code prohibits com-
 pulsory labor, and it is not practiced in The Gambia.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The official minimum age for em-
 ployment is 18. There is no compulsory education legislation and, because of the
 paucity of secondary school opportunities, most children compiete their formal edu-
 cation by age 14 and informally enter the work force. Employee labor cards, which
 include a person's age, are registered with the Labor Commissioner, but enforce-
 ment inspections rarely take place because of lack of funding and inspectors. Child
 labor protection does not extend to youth performing customary chores on family
 farms or engaged in street trading.
 e. Acceptable Conditions ofWor.-By law, minimum wages and hours of work are
 determined by six joint industrial councils (commerce, artisans, transport, the port
 industry, a grculture, and fisheries), which have representation from employees, em-
 ployers, and government. These minimum wages do not provide for a decent stand-
 ardof living. Moreover, only 20 percent of the labor force is covered by minimum
 wage legislation. The remainder are privately employed, chiefly in agriculture. Most
 Gambians do not live on one worker's earnings and rely on the extended family sys-
 tem, usually including some subsistence farming.
 The standard legal workweek is 48 hours within a period not to exceed 6 consecu-
 tive days. Allowance is made for half-hour lunch breaks. For the private sector, the
 6-day 40-hour workweek includes four 8-hour days with half days on Fridays and
 
 
 Saturdays. Government employees are entitled to 1 month's paid annual leave after
 1 year of service; private sector employees receive between 14 and 30 days of paid
 annual leave, depending on their length of service.
 The Labor Act provides a list of occupational categories and specifies safety equip-
 ment that an employer must supply to employees working in these categories. The
 Factory Act gives the Minister of Labor authority to regulate factory health and
 safety, accident prevention, and dangerous trades and to appoint inspectors to en-
 sure compliance. However, enforcement is less than fully satisfactory because of a
 need for more trained inspectors.
