 BURMA
 Burma continued to be ruled by a highly authoritarian military regime widely
 condemned for its serious human rights abuses. The military Government, the State
 Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), headed by the armed forces com-
 mander and composed of top military officers, seized power in September 1988 after
 harshly suppressing massive prodemocracy demonstrations. Retired dictator Gen-
 eral Ne Win, whose idiosyncratic policies had isolated Burma and driven the coun-
 try into deep economic decline, is believed by many to continue to wield considerable
 influence.
 The SLORC permitted a relatively free election in 1990, but it failed to honor the
 results-which were an overwhelming rejection of military rule-or to cede power
 to the victorious prodemocracy forces. Instead, the SLORC attacked the coalition of
 winning parties and their leaders through intimidation, detention, and house arrest.
 In Apri 1992, the SLORC began taking some steps to lessen its harsh rule. The
 regime reopened universities, released some political prisoners, and introduced mod-
 est economic reforms. But in January 1993 the SLORC established the "National
 Convention," a body ostensibly tasked with working out a new constitution and pri-
 marily made up of delegates handpicked by the military. The SLORC has carefully
 stage-managed the Convention's proceedings and ignored even limited opposition
 views. Despite having no mandate from the people, the SLORC seems determined
 to draft a constitution that will guarantee a dominant role for the military in the
 country's future political structure.
 The Government reinforces its rule via a pervasive security apparatus led by the
 Directorate of Defense Services Intelligence (DDSI). Control is buttressed by selec-
 tive restrictions on contact with foreigners, surveillance of government employees
 and private citizens, harassment of political activists, intimidation, arrest, deten-
 tion, and physical abuse. The Government justifies its security measures as nec-
 essary to maintain order and national unity, although almost all major insurgent
 groups have reached accommodations with the SLORC in recent years, and the oth-
 ers pose little threat to major population centers. Members of the security forces
 committed numerous serious human rights abuses.
 Burma is a poor country, with an average per capita gross domestic product of
 about $200 to $300 a year. Primarily an agricultural country, Burma also has sub-
 stantial mineral, fishing, and timber resources. Since 1988 the Government has
 slowly opened up the economy to permit expansion of the private sector and to at-
 tract foreign investment. Some economic improvement has ensued, but major obsta-
 cles to economic reform persist. These include restrictions on private commerce, con-
 stantly changing rules and regulations; overcentralized decisionmaking, a bloated
 
 
 558
 bureaucracy, a greatly overvalued currency, poor infrastructure, and grossly dis-
 proportionate military spending.
 The Government's severe repression of human rights continued essentially un-
 changed during 1995, despite a few potentially significant moves on the political
 front and the appearance of greater normalcy fostered by increased economic activ.
 ity. Out of sight of most visitors, citizens continued to live subject at any time and
 without appeal to the arbitrary and sometimes brutal dictates of the military. There
 continued to be credible reports, particularly from ethnic minority dominated areas
 that soldiers committed serious human rights abuses, including extrajudicial
 killings and rape. Disappearances continued, and members of the security forces
 beat and otherwise abused detainees. Prison conditions remained harsh, and the ju-
 diciary is not independent of the executive.
 The use of porters by the army-with attendant mistreatment, illness, and even
 death for those compelled to serve-remained a standard practice. The military con-
 tinued to force ordinary Burmese on a massive scale (including women and children)
 to "contribute" their labor, often under harsh working conditions, on construction
 projects throughout the country. A midyear directive ordering a halt to certain kinds
 of forced labor appeared to have only a limited impact. Although the Government
 continued to release some prisoners, it continued arbitrarily to arrest and detain
 citizens for the slightest expression of dissenting political views. Several hundred,
 if not more, political prisoners remained in detention, including approximately 20
 Members of Parliament elected in 1990. The International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) closed its office in July as a result of the SLORC's refusal to accept
 the ICRC's standard modalities for conducting prison visits.
 The SLORC continued to restrict severely basic rights to free speech, press, as-
 sembly, association, and privacy. Worker rights are also severely limited. Political
 party activity remained severely restricted, and citizens do not have the right to
 change their government. By year's end, the Government had still not taken up
 Aung San Suu Kyi's call for a genuine dialog on political reform. The Government's
 rejection of the a ppeal of the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) for
 a reform of the National Convention's working procedures led most of the Conven-
 tion's elected representatives to withdraw i November. Although mre than
 196,000 Rohingyas (Burmese Muslims from Arakan State) who fled to Bangladesh
 in 1992 had returned to Burma by year's end, about 50,000 remained in camps
 across the border. A few thousand students and dissidents continued in exile mn
 Thailand. Roughly 90,000 Burmese were residing in ethnic minority camps in Thai-
 land, among them many thousands of new arrivals driven out by Burmese army at-
 tcks on the Karen and Karenni ethnic minority controlled areas. Discrimination
 against ethnic minorities and violence against women remained problems.
 Several positive developments occurred, most notably the release of Burma's fore-
 most prodemcracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, her 2 top lieutenants, and 103 other
 political prisoners. Resident representatives of the office of the United Nations High
 Commssioner for Refugees (UNHCR) were permitted to continue their work mon-
 itoring the return of the Rohingyas, and a limited number of international non-
 governmental organizations (NGO's) were allowed to set up operations or expand ex-
 isting ones.
 Despite these positive moves, by year's end the SLORC had yet to make a fun-
 damental break with its past behavior and demonstrate a willingness to cede its
 hold on absolute power. Most importantly, the generals have failed thus far to begin
 neotiating with the country's prdemcracy forces and ethnic groups on a genuine
 poitical settlement to allow a return to the rule of law and respect or basicnluman
 rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was no evidence of an explicit
 or systematic government policy encouraging summary killings. However, there con-
 tinued to be credible reports of instances ofbrtality and killing of civilians by the
 military, particularly in minority dominated areas and among those impressed as
 porters. The Government's general disregard for human rights has created a climate
 clearly conducive to such abuses.
 b. Diappearance.-A in previous years, private citizens and political activists
 continued to "disappear"      o   for several hours to several weeks. DDSI offi-
 cials usuallypicked up people for questioning without the knowledge of their family
 members andin many cases, though not all, released them soon aiterward. At the
 same time, large numbers of people continued to be taken away by the military for
 porterage or other duties, often without the knowledge of their family members. The
 
 
 559
 whereabouts of those conscripted, as well as of prisoners transferred for labor or
 porterage duties, remained difficult to trace (see Sections 1.g. and 6.c.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Again in 1995, political detainees were held incommunicado for long periods. De-
 tainees were routinely subjected to harsh interrogation techniques designed to in-
 timidate and disorient. The most common forms of mistreatment were sleep and
 food deprivation coupled with round-the-clock questioning, but some were also
 kicked and beaten. In recent years, there have been credible reports of prisoners
 being forced to squat or assume unnatural positions for lengthy periods. In the past,
 there have also been reports of practices such as electrical shocks to the genitals,
 suffocation, and cigarette burns, but there were no known instances of these tech-
 nies being employed in 1995.
 There continued to be credible reports that security forces subjected ordinary citi-
 zens to harassment and physical abuse. In rural vilages the military routinely en-
 tered villages to confiscate property and food and used abusive recruitment methods
 to procure porters. Those forced into porterage or other duties faced extremely dif-
 ficult conditions and mistreatment that sometimes resulted in death. There was a
 steady pattern of reports that soldiers raped ethnic minority women (see Section
 l"he regimen at Insein prison near Rangoon remained extremely harsh, including
 widespread use of solitary confinement, little or no exercise, no mosquito nets or
 reading or writing materials for virtually all prisoners, poor nutrition, and inad-
 equate medical care. A handful of prominent political prisoners were housed in sepa-
 rate bungalow accommodations on the prison compound. Most prisoners were per-
 mitted to receive medicine as well as supplemental food brought by their families
 during the 15-minute visits permitted every 2 weeks. Conditions for political pris-
 oners were reliably reported to be much worse at some upcountry locations, particu-
 larly Thayet and Thayawaddy prisons.
 Unlike in the past, in May the SLORC refused to allow visiting U.S. Congressman
 Bill Richardson to meet with political prisoners. Similarly, the SLORC refused a re-
 quest by U.N. Special Ra porteur Yozo Yokota to visit several political prisoners
 during his October trip. Jredible reports indicate a group of political prisoners at
 Insein prison was mistreated after smuggling information to Professor Yokota on
 conditions in that facility. The Government continued to bar the ICRC from visitin
 detainees or convicted prisoners of any kind. After the Government officially notified
 the ICRC that it was not prepared to accept the ICRC's standard procedures for con-
 ducting prison visits, the ICRC closed its Rangoon office in July, though not before
 indicating its willingness to renew discussions again should the SLO C change its
 mind.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The SLORC routinely practiced arbitrary
 arrest and incommunicado detention. Prior to being charged, detainees do not have
 access to legal counsel or their families. There is no provision in the law for judicial
 determination of the legality of detention, and political detainees cannot obtain re-
 lease on bail.
 Because of the high level of intimidation discouraging overt political activity, de-
 tentions for public antigovernment activities remaIned at a relatively low level.
 Nonetheless, the authorities continued to detain scores of political activists for low-
 level political activity, such as handing out opposition flyers or shouting political slo-
 gans m public. For example, in February atleast 20 young people were arrested in
 connection with a short demonstration at the funeral of former Prime Minister U
 Nu; 9 were later sentenced to 7 years in prison. Other small groups of young people
 were detained in July for distributing flyers, and at year's end only a few were
 known to have been released.
 In June the authorities detained former National League for Democracy (NLD)
 acting chairman Kyi Maung, who had been released from prison only 3 months ear-
 lier. Kyi Maung and two of his four companions picked up at the same time were
 eased The other two were held and later tried in a summary proce-
 dure without benefit of legal counsel and sentenced to 7 years in prison. This in-
 cluded the former chairman of the Democracy Party, Thu Wai. At the same time,
 another former Democracy Party activist, Htway Myint, was also arrested, tried,
 and given a 7-year sentence. All three were convicted for allegedly violating the
 country's security laws when in fact they appear to have merely engaged in political
 discussions.
 In November three supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi were arrested and within
 days sentenced to 2 years in prison for objecting to the placement of traffic-control
 barriers by police in front of the NLD leader's residence.
 Forced exile is not used as a method of political control.
 
 
 560
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is not independent of the executive.
 The SLORC names justices to the Supreme Court, who, in turn, appoint lower court
 judges (with the approval of the SLORC).
 The court system, as inherited from the British and subsequently restructured,
 is comprised of courts at the township, district, state, and national levels.
 Throughout 1995 the Government continued to rule by decree and was not bound
 by any constitutional provisions providing for fair public trials or any other rights.
 Although remnants of the British-era legal system were formally in place the court
 system and its operation remained seriously flawed. Many observers believe there
 has been an improvement over the last few years in judicial procedures, at least in
 the handling of nonpolitical cases. But ongoing unprofessional behavior by some
 court officials, pervasive bribe-taking, the misuse of overly broad laws, and the ma-
 nipulation of the courts for political ends continued to deprive citizens of the right
 to a fair trial and the rule of law.
 Some basic due process rights, including the right to a public trial and the right
 to be represented by a defense attorney, were generally respected except in sensitive
 political cases. Defense attorneys are permitted to call and crss-examine witnesses,
 but their primary purpose is to bargain with the judge to obtain the shortest pos-
 sible sentence for their clients. Most court proceedings are open to the public. How-
 ever, in poitical cases, almost all trials are held in ourtrooms on prison compounds
 and are not open to the pubic. In these instances, defense counsel appears to serve
 no purpose other than to provide moral support, since reliable reports indicate ver-
 dicts are dictated by higher authorities.
 During the first 3 months of the year, 105 persons beieved to be political pris-
 oners were released, including former eLD Member of Parliament-elect and one-
 time National Convention delegate Dr. Aung Khin Sint. This group also included
 former NLD chairman Tin Oo and former acting NLD chairman Kyi Maung. On
 July 10, Aung San Suu Kyi was freed unconditionally after serving 6 years under
 house arrest. During the remainder of the year, 49 other persons believed to have
 been political prisoners were released. By year's end, at least several hundred-if
 not many more-political prisoners remained incarcerated.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 military ruled unchecked by any outside authority, and the State continued to inter-
 fere extensively and arbitrarily in the lives of private citizens. Through its extensive
 intelligence network, the Government closely monitored the travel, whereabouts,
 and activities of many citizens, particularly those known to be politically active. Se-
 curity personnel selectively screened private correspondence and telephone calls and
 conducted warrantless searches of rivate premises. On occasion the Government
 attempted tojam foreign radio broadcasts (see Section 2.a.). Government employees
 were required to obtain advance permission before meeting with foreigners.
 The SLORC continued to move people out of cities to pe ripheral new town settle-
 ments, though not on the same scale as in the early 1990's. While facilities in some
 of these areas have improved over time, residents targeted for displacement contin-
 ued to be given no option but to move, usually on short notice. The military also
 continued to relocate forcibly some rural villages, especially in ethnic minority
 areas.
 Those able to remain in established cities and towns were subject to arbitrary sei-
 zure of their property. In a number of urban areas, residents were compelled to cede
 land for road-widening projects decided upon without any public consultation or en-
 dorsement. Other long-term city residents were required to cede land for commercial
 redevelopment and were compensated at only a fraction of the value of their lost
 homes. Automobiles and other movable property remained vulnerable to arbitrary
 seizure. In rural areas, military personnel at times confiscated livestock and food
 supplies.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-For more than four decades the Burmese Army has battled diverse ethnic
 insurgencies. These ethnic minority insurgent groups have sought to gain greater
 autonomy from the dominant ethnic Burman majority. In 1989 the SLORC began
 a policy of seeking cease-fire agreements with most ethnic insurgent groups. In late
 1994, however, the army moved militarily against the largest remaining ethnic in-
 surgent group, the Karen National Union (KNU). In late 1994, the KNU broke into
 two factions, in part because of government efforts to stir up religious tension be-
 tween the Karen Christian and Buddhist communities. The Buddhist faction, known
 as the Democratic Karen Buddhist Organization (DKBO) subsequently allied itself
 with the Government.
 In January the Burmese army offensive led to the fall of Manerplaw, the longtime
 headquarters of the KNU and of semiexiled prodemocracy forces. Less than a month
 later, the KNU's last major defensive encampment along the Thai border also fell
 
 
 to army troops. These two incidents unleashed a flood of as many as 10,000 refugees
 into Thailand. Throughout the rest of the year, the DKBO staged cross-border raids
 resulting in inury and death, destruction of refugee camps, and the forced repatri-
 a       some refugees. In June several thousand more fled to Thailand after troops
 attempted to move into Karenni-held areas of Kayah State, which led to the break-
 down of the SLORC's cease-fire agreement with the Karenni National Progressive
 Party (KNPP).
 In connection with the military's campaign against the Karen, Karenni, and dru
 trafficker Khun Sa and his Shan United Army, as many as several thousand civi-
 ian, were believed to have been coerced into working as porters in jungle areas in
 or near combat zones. According to reliable reports, military sweeps for porters or
 demands for porter "taxes" (i.e., cash payment instead of porter duties) reached as
 far as Rangoon and other urban areas in central Burma. It was also credibly re-
 ported that some members of the military used sham threats of impressment to ex-
 tort money.
 Antigoverment insurgent gups were also responsible for violence; mines laid by
 insurgents caused both cilan and military deaths. At least one former insurgent
 group that concluded a cease-fire agreement with the SLORC is known to have used
 forced labor. In addition, the narcotics-trafficking Shan United Army brutalized and
 murdered villagers, conducted forced recruitment of boys, and impressed porters
 while fighting against the army and ensuring continued cultivation of opium by
 peasant farmers.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Severe restrictions on freedom of speech and the
 press persisted throughout 1995. The security services continued to clamp down on
 those attempting to express opposition political views, such as by handing out flyers
 or chanting slogans (see Section 1.d.). Many more refrained from speaking out for
 fear of arrest and interrogation. Major exceptions were Aung San Suu Kyi, and NLD
 Vice Chairmen Tin Do and Kyi Maung, who following Aung San Suu Kyi's release
 in July regularly gave short speeches in front of her residence to those willing to
 run the risk of being seen by military intelligence.
 All forms of domestic public media were officially controlled or censored. This
 strict control in turn encouraged self-censorship on the part of writers and publish-
 ers. Private citizens were generally unable to subscribe directly to foreign publica-
 tions. A limited supply of secondhand copies of international newsmagazines and a
 sizable number of private publications on nonpolitical issues were available to the
 public at large, but censors occasionally banned issues or deleted articles deemed
 unwelcome by the Government.
 The government-monopoly television, radio, and newspaper media remained prop-
 aganda instruments. With the exception of coverage of some limited aspects of the
 National Convention, these official media did not report opposing views but rather
 attacked those in the democratic opposition who dared to take issue with govern-
 ment policies. Editors remained answerable to military authorities. While the Eng-
 lish-language daily New Light of Myanmar continued to include many international
 wire service reports on foreign news, domestic news hewed strictly to and reinforced
 government policy.
 Many foreign journalists, including television crews, were able to visit and report
 on developments in the country, athouh their movements were sometimes re-
 stricted and monitored. However, other journalists were denied visas or issuance
 was so delayed as to render a planned visit impossible.
 Foreign radio broadcasts, such as those of the British Broadcasting Corporation
 (BBC), Voice of America (VOA), and Norway-based Democratic Voice of Burma, re-
 mained prime sources of uncensored information. The authorities at times at-
 tempted to jam or otherwise interfere with the reception of these broadcasts. How-
 ever, the head of the BBC's Burmese service was officially received in May, and two
 reporters for VOA's Burmese service were each allowed to remain in the country for
 several months. The Government also allowed some foreign government-sponsored
 information programs.
 The authorities took new steps to restrict the use of satellite television. After im-
 posing a September 1993 deadline for registering satellite dishes, they failed to ap-
 prove additional licenses or clarify who in the future would be allowed to have ac-
 cess to foreign television. In June the Government issued an official warning threat-
 ening up to 3 years' imprisonment for operation of an unlicensed satellite television
 receiver.
 University teachers and professors remained subject to the same restrictions on
 freedom of speech, political activities, and publications as other government employ-
 ees. These included warnings against criticism of the Government; instructions not
 
 
 to discuss politics while at work; and strictures against joining or supporting politi-
 cal parties engaging in political activity, or meeting forei  icials. Teachers con-
 tinued to 31e hel responsible for propagating SLORC political goals among their
 students and for maintaining discipline and preventing students from engaging in
 any unauthorized political activity.
 b.Freedom of Peacefd Assembly and Association.-The Government does not re-
 spect these rights. The government prohibition on unauthorized outdoor assemblies
 of more than five people remained in effect, although authorities enforced it un-
 evenly. For example, at times between 2,000 and 3,000 people were able to gather
 in front of Aung San Suu Kyi's residence to listen to her weekly talks. However,
 legal political parties remained formally required to request permission from the au-
 thorities to hold internal meetings of their own membership. During one weekly
 gathering at the home of Aung San Sun Kyi, three people were arrested for con-
 fronting policemen about the placement of barriers to control the crowd (see Section
 1.d.).
 Despite these restrictions, the NLD leadership held internal meetings, traveled
 upcountry to meet with its supporters, and hosted large public gatherings. Citizens
 engaged in these activities, including those attending Aung San Suu Kyi's address-
 es, remained subject to arrest at any time for their activities. Late in the year, the
 Government's own mass mobilization organization, the Union Solidarity and Devel-
 opment Association (USDA), orchestrated a series of rallies as a mass demonstration
 of support for the SLORC's political objectives. With few exceptions, attendance was
 coerced, with explicit threats of penalities for those who contemplated staying away.
 Religious groups, by contrast, sometimes encountered problems holding outdoor
 gatherings.
 In addition to the USDA, the right of association existed only for organizations,
 including trade associations and professional bodies, permitted by law and duly reg-
 istered with the Government. Only a handful continued to exist, and even those
 were subject to direct government intervention or took special care to act in line
 with government policy. This included such benign groups as the Myanmar Red
 Cross and the Myanmar Medical Association. Only 10 political parties (compared to
 75 in 1992) remained legal at year's end.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Adherents of all religions duly registered with the au-
 thorities generally enjoed freedom to worship as they chose, although Buddhists
 continued to enjoy a privileged position. In recent years, the Government has made
 special efforts to link itself With Buddhism as a means of asserting its own popular
 legitimacy. For example, during the year the military arranged the visit of a vener-
 ated Buddha tooth relic from China and after the visit organzed construction of two
 massive new pagodas to commemorate the event. Consistent reports indicate some
 overzealous local officials forced even non-Buddhists to contribute to Buddhist con-
 struction projects. Credible reports continued to surface of Buddhist missionaries
 dispatched by the central Government and local military personnel actively working
 to expand Buddhism, sometimes through compulsion, in minority areas.
 The Government monitors the activities of members of all religions, in part be-
 cause they have in the past been politically active. Security services demanded that
 religious groups seek prior authorization to conduct services out of doors. These reg-
 ulations were also in effect in and around Buddhist monasteries and pagodas. Reli-
 gious publications remained subject to the same control and censorship imposed on
 secular ones. Christian Bibles translated into ind'genous languages could not be im-
 ported. It remained extremely difficult for Christian and Muslim groups to obtain
 permission to build new churches and mosques.
 Religious groups were able to establish links with coreligionists in other countries,
 although these activities were reportedly monitored by the Government. Foreign re-
 ligious representatives were usually only allowed visas for short stays, but in some
 cases were permitted to preach to Buse congregations. In August Roman Catho-
 lic Cardinal7Jsef Tomko was able to visit Rangoon and upcountry locations. Perma-
 nent foreign missionary establishments have not been permitted since the 1960's,
 but seven Catholic nuns and four priests working in Burma since before independ-
 ence continued to reside upcountry.
 Credible reports continued of isolated incidents in which the Government removed
 cemeteries in the course of infrastructure projects in urban areas. These removals
 targeted adherents of many faiths, including Buddhists, but were a particularly se-
 rious problem for Muslims and Christians, who--unlike Buddhists-consider such
 "fial resting places" to be sacred ground.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although citizens have the legal right to live anywhere in the country,
 both urban and rural residents were subject to arbitrary relocation (see Section 1.f.).
 Except for limitations in areas of insurgent activity, citizens could travel freely with-
 
 
 563
 
 in the country but had to notify local authorities of their whereabouts. Those resi-
 dents unable to meet the restrictive provisions of the citizenship law, (e.g., Chinese,
 Arakanese Muslims, etc.) had to obtain prior permission to travel (see Section 5).
 Rural farmers were also not free to leave the land at will.
 While the Government relaxed restrictions on passport issuance, it carefully scru-
 tinized all prospective travel abroad. Many applicants were also forced to pay bribes
 to obtain passports to which they were entitled. The official board that reviews pass-
 port applications denied passports in some cases apparently on political grounds. All
 college graduates obtaining a passport (except for certain government employees)
 were required to pay a special education clearance fed to reimburse the Government.
 Citizens who emigrated legally were generally allowed to return to visit relatives,
 and even some who had lived abroad illegally and acquired foreign citizenship were
 able to return to visit. In January the authorities extended until the end of the year
 special procedures allowing former citizens residing abroad to reacquire citizenship.
 In anticipation of the Government's planned "Visit Myanmar Year 1996," restric-
 tions were further eased on foreign travelers. As of September 1, Burmese embas-
 sies began issuing tourist visas within 24 hours and lowered visa fees. However, se-
 led categories of applicants, such as human rights advocates, certain journalists,
 and political figures, continued to be denied entry visas unless traveling under the
 aegis of a sponsor acceptable to the Government. Although some areas of the coun-
 try remained off-limits to foreigners for security reasons, the authorities officially
 opened up a substantial number of new domestic destinations.
 In 1995 over 60,000 of the Rohingya Muslins who fled to Bangladesh in 1992 re-
 turned to Burma, bringing the total number of returnees to over 196,000. As the
 year progressed, however, the pace of repatriation slowed greatly, with over 50,000
 still in camps across the border at year's end. The UNHCR reported that authorities
 cooperated in investigating the isolated incidents of renewed abuse which surfaced.
 However, the Government continued to refuse some independent observers access
 to repatriation areas. During the year, the Government appeared to have halted the
 practice of forcibly removing Muslims from elsewhere in Arakan State to the border
 townships.
 The Government was reportedly reluctant to allow the UNHCR to play a similar
 role along the Thai border in connection with the expected repatriation of large
 numbers of Mon returnees.
 The Government does not allow refugees or displaced persons from abroad to re-
 settle or seek safe haven.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite the overwhelming desire citizens demonstrated in the 1990 elections for
 a return to democracy, they continued to be denied the right to change their govern-
 ment. Since 1988 active duty military officers have occupied an increasing number
 of important positions throughout the bureaucracy, particularly at the policymaking
 level. Despite the appointment of several civilians to the Cabinet in 1992, the proc-
 ess of placing military or recently retired military officers in most key senior-evel
 positions once held by technocrats in the economic ministries continued.
 Following the NLD's victory in the 1990 elections, the SLORC set aside the elec-
 tion results and disqualified, detained, arrested, or drove into exile many successful
 candidates. Since then 201 of the 485 Deputies elected have either been disqualified,
 resigned under pressure, gone into exile, been detained, or died. Approximately 20
 successful candidates from the election remain in prison.
 Rather than accept the will of the citizenry, the SLORC convened a National Con-
 vention in January 1993 to draw up principles for a new constitution. The SLORC
 handpicked delegates, and proceedings have been carefully stage-managed; even
 limited opposition views have been ignored. Despite having no mandate from the
 people, the SLORC tasked the Convention with drafting principles for a new con-
 stitution ensuring a dominant role for the military in the country's future political
 structure. The SLORO leadership met with prodemocracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi
 on two occasions in late 1994, but throughout the following year they failed to heed
 her call for genuine dialog on the country's political future and instead proceeded
 with their own controlled "consultations" on a new constitution. In late November,
 the NLD delegates withdrew from the Convention pending agreement by the au-
 thorities to discuss revising the convention working procedures. Two days later they
 were formally expelled. This left the Convention exercise almost solely in the hands
 of government appointees and definitively removed whatever semblance of claim it
 might once havehad to represent the Burmese people.
 
 
 Minorities and women are underrepresented in the top ranks of government serv-
 ice and largely excluded from military leadership. Members of certain minority
 groups continued to be denied full citizenship (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not allow domestic human rights organizations to exist, and
 it remained generally hostile to outside scrutiny of its human rights record. How-
 ever, the authorities continued formally to receive the U.N. Secretary General's Spe-
 cial Representative. In February Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs
 Alvaro de Soto held talks with government officials, and during a visit in August
 he was also able to meet with Aung San Suu Ky. Still, the SLORC remained un-
 willing to engage the U.N. in a substantive dialog about Burma's political future.
 After considering the January report of its Special Rapporteur for Burma, Profes-
 sor Yozo Yokota, the U.N. Human Rights Commission adopted a resolution in March
 severely criticizing the authorities for their human rights abuses. The Burmese rep-
 resentative at the Commission in turn rejected the criticism as "inaccurate,
 instrusive and politically motivated." In keeping with the Special Rapporteur's man-
 date, in October the Government permitted Professor Yokota to undertake another
 survey trip to Burma, after which he delivered a highly critical review of Burma's
 human rights situation to the U.N. General Assembly's Third Committee. In Decem-
 ber the U.N. General Assembly adopted another consensus resolution deploring con-
 tinued violation of human rights in Burma.
 A limited number of nonpolitical international NGO's continued project work in
 Burma, while a few more established a provisional presence while undertaking the
 protracted negotiations necessary to set up permanent operations in the country.
 The ICRC closed its office after failing to gain access to Burmese prisons.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government continued to rule by decree and was not bound by any constitu-
 tional provisions concerning discrimination.
 Women.-In part because of the strong role of religion, violence against women,
 including spousal abuse, is not considered socially acceptable and occurs relatively
 infrequently.
 The trafficking of women and girls to Thailand for the purposes of prostitution
 remained a serious problem. In border areas, where the Government's control is lim-
 ited, there were numerous reports of women being forced or lured into working as
 prostitutes in Thailand. While the number of young women tricked or forced into
 prostitution is unknown, a common practice is to lure young women to Thailand
 with promises of employment as a waitress or domestic (see Thailand report). Also,
 the militry continued to impress women for military porterage duties, and reports
 of soldiers raping ethnic minority women remained widespread (see Sections 1.c.
 and 1.g.).
 In general, women in Burma have traditionally enjoyed a high status, exercising
 most of the same basic rights as men and taking an active role in business. Consist-
 ent with traditional culture, they keep their own names after marriage and often
 control family finances. However, women remained underrepresented in most tradi-
 tional male occupations, and a few professions continued to be entirely barred to
 women. As elsewhere, the burden of poverty, which is particularly widespread in
 Burma's rural areas, fell disproportionately on women.
 Women did not consistently receive equal pay for equal work. There were no inde-
 pendent women's rights organizations, and no government ministry specifically tar-
 geted the safeguarding of women's interests. A government-controlled agency, the
 Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare Association (MMCWA), provided some assist-
 ance to mothers, and a new professional society for businesswomen, the Myanmar
 Women Entrepreneurs' Association, was formed in 1995.
 Children.-Despite the establishment of various child welfare programs, the Gov-
 ernment allocated few resources for programs relevant to children, and once again
 cut the share of the national budget for education (to 13 percent), with a mere 0.5
 percent allocated to social welfare services (versus an official 33 percent for the mili-
 tariere is no pattern of societal abuse of children, although poverty and alcoholism
 sometimes lead to instances of abuse. Many families allowed their young daughters
 to travel to Thailand to work as prostitutes. The rising incidence of HIV infection
 has increased demand for younger prostitutes.
 People With Disabilities.-Official assistance to persons with disabilities is ex-
 tremely limited. There is no law mandating accessibility to government facilities.

 While there are several small-scale organizations to assist the disabledmost dis-
 abled persons must rely on traditional family structures to provide for their welfare.
 Funding from the South Korean Red Cross allowed a prosthesis program begun by
 the ICRC to continue. Because of land mines and train accidents, Burma has one
 of the highest rates of amputee i.juries in the world.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minonties.-Burma's myriad ethnic minorities have long
 resented the dominance of the country's Burman majority. Over the last few years
 and continuing in 1995, the SLORC, in the name of national solidarity, has sought
 to pacify these ethnic groups by means of negotiated cease-fires, grants of limited
 autonomy, and promises of development assistance. By year's end, the Government
 had negotiated cease-fire agreements with 15 of 16 recognized ethnic insurgent
 groups, and talks with a final ethnic group, the Karen National Knion (KNU), were
 believed to be underway. However, the Government's settlement with the Karenni
 National Progressive Party (KNPP) broke down after the Burmese army forcibly en-
 tered areas under KNPP control.
 The Government included a large number of ethnic minority representatives in
 the National Convention and permitted extended debate on the issue of minority au-
 tonomy. However the ethnic minority populations complain that their concerns
 have not been addressed adequately by the Government, and none is satisfied with
 the provisions on limited "!self-administration which the authorities plan to accord
 a few groups under the new constitution.
 Government investment in the border areas in road, hospital, and school construc-
 tion has been modest at best, and economic development of ethnic minority areas
 continued to lag, leaving many living at barely subsistence levels. Since the focus
 of the hostilities against armed insurgencies has been in the border areas where
 most minorities are concentrated, those populations have been disproportionately
 victimized by the general brutalization associated with the military's activities.
 Since only people who can prove long familial links to Burma are accorded full
 citizenship, ethnic populations, such as Muslims, Indians, and Chinese, continued
 to be denied full citizenship. Those without full citizenship are not free to travel do-
 mestically and are barred from certain advanced university programs in medicine
 and technological fields. Anti-Chinese sentiment remained pervasive.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-There were no functioning trade unions; even former
 government-controlled ones were dormant. Workers-continued to be unable to strike,
 and there were no reported instances of attempts to do so.
 In July 1989, the IUnited States suspended Burma's eligibility for trade conces-
 sions under the Generalized System of Preferences Program, pending steps to afford
 its labor force internationally recognized worker rights.
 Because of Burma's longstanding violation of International Labor Organization
 (ILO) Convention 87 on Freedom of Association, in June the ILO Conference Com-
 mittee on the Application of Standards devoted a Special Paragraph to Burma in
 its general report. Following February meetings between ILO officials and govern-
 ment reprsentatives in Rangn, the lack of a constructive government response
 prompted the 1LO to cancel plans for a followup visit.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colectively.-Workers do not have the
 right to organize an d b                                benefits. The Govern-
 ment's Central Arbitration Board, which theoretically provides a means for settling
 major labor disputes, continued to exist on paper but in practice was dormant.
 Townhiplevel labor supervisory committees remained in plceto address various
 low-level labor onerns.
 The Government unilaterally sets wages in the public sector. In the private sector,
 wages are set by market forces. The Government pressures joint ventures not to pay
 salaries greater than those of ministers or other high-lvel employees. Joint ven-
 tures circumvent this with supplemental pay, including remuneration paid in for-
 ei~n exchange certificates, as well as through incentive and overtime pay and other
 fringe benefits. Foreign firms generally set wages near those of the domestic private
 sector but follow the example of joint ventures in awarding supplemental wages and
 benefits.
 No special exportprcessing zones exist.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsoy Labor.-Despite government promises to
 alter the Village and Town Acts to withdraw the claimed statutory basis for forced
 labor in the country, at year's end the legislation was not changed. As the military
 continued its program of road, rail, dam, and other infrastructure projects, its re-
 course to forced labor remained at a high level. Hundreds of thousands-if not
 more--of ordinary citizens were compelled to contribute labor to these public works.
 In preparation for the "Visit Myanmar Year-1996," in 1995 the Mandalay Moat
 
 
 566
 
 Ioect was completed by using a combination of prison, military, and paid labor
 ai the Ye-Tavoyrailroad in southern Burma continued to employ large-scale forced
 labor, including cdld labor, according to credible reports.
 In June the ILO Conference Committee on the Application of Standards cited
 Burma in a second Special Paragraph for its violation of ILO Convention 29 on
 forced labor.
 Although the Government refused to acknowledge its use of forced labor publicly,
 in June it issued an internal order instructing officials to use paid labor on large-
 scale infrastructure projects. By years end, many instances of forced labor (or forced
 monetary contributions in lieu of labor) nevertheless continued to be reported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Although the law sets a minimum
 age for the employment of children, in practice the law is not enforced. Working
 children are highly visible in cities, mostly working for small or family enterprises.
 Children are hired at lower pay rates than adults for the same kind of work, and
 economic pressure forces them to work not only for their survival but also to support
 their families. Arts and crafts is the only sector producing for the export market
 which employs a significant number of children. Despite a compulsory education
 law, almost 40 percent of children never enroll in school, and only 27 percent com-
 plete the 5-year rimary school course.
 e. Acceptable onditions of Work.--Surplus labor conditions and lack of protection
 by government authorities continue to dictate substandard conditions for workers,
 despite recent annual economic growth of at least 5 percent. The Law on Fundamen-
 tal Workers Rights of 1964 and the Factories Act of 1951 regulate working condi-
 tions. There is a legally prescribed 5-day, 35-hour workweek for employees in the
 public sector and a 6-day&, 44-hour workweek for private and public sector employ-
 ees, with overtime paid for additional work. The law also allows for a 24-hour rest
 period per week and workers have 21 paid holidays a year. Such provisions actually
 affect only a small portion of the country's labor force.
 Only government employees and employees of a few traditional industries are cov-
 ered by minimum wage provisions. The minimum monthly wage for salaried public
 employees (based on the market exchange rate of 120 kyats = $1.00) is $5.00 (600
 kyats), but this sum is supplemented by various subsidies and allowances. The min-
 imum wage is insufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and
 family. In particular, the low level of remuneration of public employment fostered
 widespread corruption. The government minimum wage for day lab~or is $0.16 daily
 (20 kyats). Workers in the private sector are much better paid. The actual average
 wage rate for casual laborers in Rangoon in 1995 was almost four times theofficial
 minimum, but still well below subsistence levels. Wage increases continued to lag
 far behind inflation.
 Numerous health and safety regulations exist on the books, but the Government
 has not made the necessary resources available to those charged with their enforce-
 ment. Although workers may in principle remove themselves from hazardous condi-
 tions, in practice workers cannot expect to retain their jobs.
