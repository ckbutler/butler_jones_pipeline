 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1975 following
 a decade of guerrilla warfare waged by the Front for the
 Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO), which then took power. The
 Government is run by a Council of Ministers appointed by the
 President, currently Samora Machel, who is also the head of the
 FRELIMO party. It is the only party allowed, and it
 articulates government policies. A self-proclaimed nationalist
 and Marxist-Leninist party at independence, FRELIMO's approach
 is increasingly pragmatic and aimed at the practical realities
 which Mozambique faces. Popular participation in the local
 political process in rural areas operates generally through
 traditional channels. In urban areas and at the national
 level, it is largely limited to granting or denying .approval to
 delegates to the People's National Assembly.
 In the first 10 years since independence, the exodus of skilled
 personnel, the world-wide recession, misdirected economic
 policies implemented by the Government, and the savage
 insurgency in recent years have contributed to economic
 stagnation. The extended drought, the worst in this century,
 which ravaged southern and central provinces in 1981-84,
 uprooted vast sections of the population and resulted in-the
 death of tens of thousands of rural Mozambicans. Mozambique
 now ranks among the poorest countries in the world. The per
 capita gross national product was estimated at $396 in'1982
 according to the World Bank (others place per capita income in
 1982 as low as $178), and it has probably dropped since then.
 Mozambique's foreign debt now stands at $2.4 billion.
 Mozambique is a country at war. Since the late 1970's, the'
 Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) has waged a violent
 guerrilla war against the Government. RENAMO originally was
 the creation of Ian Smith's Rhodesian regime but later received
 extensive support from South Africa. RENAMO now claims that it
 is an independent, indigenous force, and in the past 2 years
 has become active in all 10 Mozambican provinces.
 Respect for human rights, never widespread during Portuguese
 rule, has suffered in the violence which Mozambique has
 experienced in recent years. The insurgents' preferred target
 is the economic infrastructure, but thousands of innocent
 civilians have lost their lives in the violence perpetrated by
 the RENAMO guerrillas. The Government has responded to the
 threat by applying aggressive security measures of its own, and
 the Mozambican security/defense forces have undoubtedly
 committed excesses against innocent civilians. There have been
 no reports of public and summary executions by the Government
 since 1983, but allegations of torture by both the guerrillas
 and the government forces continue to be made. The Government
 is developing a judicial system and has already established
 approximately 700 village-level courts in addition to the
 district and provincial system which operates throughout the
 country.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Request for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Political Killing
 The continuing war between the Government and RENAMO has led to
 the death of many innocent Mozambican and foreign civilians.
 Precise figures are unavailable, but the total number of
 
 
 223
 MOZAMBIQUE
 fatalities over the past few years is certainly in the
 thousands. The insurgents have been brutally violent, killing,
 maiming, and kidnaping their victims. For example, in April
 1985 RENAMO units on two occasions ambushed civilian convoys
 traveling between Maputo and neighboring Gaza Province. Over
 200 civilians were killed, some of whom were bayoneted to
 death. Amnesty International, in its report on the practice of
 torture in Mozambique, listed numerous confirmed instances in
 which RENAMO insurgents had been guilty of "torture, violent
 beatings, mutilations, and summary executions of civilians."
 In response, the Government has continued its aggressive
 efforts to combat RENAMO, and government military operations
 have reportedly resulted in the killings of many innocen'-
 civilians in contested areas.
 The Council of Catholic Bishops in Mozambique has publicly
 decried the senseless violence perpetrated against the civilian
 population by both sides. The Government has halted public
 executions of insurgents or those convicted of economic
 sabotage or other crimes against the State. The death penalty
 is not prescribed for nonpolitical crimes.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed reports of government-sponsored
 disappearances during the year. This represents a significant
 improvement over the situation in 1983, when thousands of
 allegedly unemployed city dwellers in Maputo and Beira were
 arbitrarily rounded up and sent off to resettlement sites in
 northern Mozambique. The Government's commitment to the prompt
 notification of relatives and friends of persons detained by
 government authorities remains spotty and suspect. Security
 forces sometimes hold detainees incommunicado for extended
 periods. Detainees held by the police have the right to
 contact their relatives and to regularly receive visitors.
 This right was often abused in the past but observance improved
 in 1985. President Machel has publicly campaigned to ensure
 that the legal rights of detainees are not violated.
 RENAMO has reportedly abducted thousands of rural villagers.
 Sometimes these people are released; sometimes they are forced
 to live permanently in areas outside of government control.
 (However, RENAMO does not appear to have the ability to
 maintain many under its direct control.) For instance,
 insurgents reportedly abducted a large number of people who
 lived in Luabo, Zambezia Province, and whose fate is still
 unknown. RENAMO increased the kidnapping of foreigners during
 1985. In June and July, the insurgents kidnapped over 20
 foreign workers, missionaries, and residents. All were later
 released unharmed. However, according to media reports, two
 Soviet geologists held since 1983 were summarily killed by
 their captors during the same period.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture has been widely practiced in Mozambique and continues
 to be a problem. In the early years of independence, according
 to numerous reports, prisoners at remote government-organized
 "reeducation camps" were brutally bound, beaten, and often
 killed. These camps were used to intern political prisoners
 and "antisocial elements." Starting in 1979, however, the
 Government promulgated laws which established a formal judicial
 system in Mozambique, and in 1981 President Machel declared
 
 
 224
 MOZAMBIQUE
 that henceforth no one would be sent to a reeducation camp
 without due process. The same year the President also launched
 the "offensive for legality," and in the following months a
 number of security and defense force members were fired for
 abusing prisoners. Amnesty International, in its report on
 torture in Mozambique, characterized the campaign as the
 Government's "most important effort to end the practice of
 torture and to control other abuses which had come to be
 committed by the security and defense forces." Despite recent
 changes, including closing of some camps, reports indicate that
 prisoners have extremely Spartan living conditions.
 The situation with regard to torture in 1985 represented a
 significant improvement in comparison with previous years, but
 reports continue to be received alleging capricious and cruel
 treatment by some members of the security and defense forces.
 Flogging is also still practiced, although apparently on a more
 limited basis than previously. At the end of 1984,
 functionaries of the Ministry of Justice met and publicly
 condemned excessive and illegal floggings. Prisons in
 Mozambique are generally overcrowded and characterized by
 inadequate food, hygiene, and medical care.
 As noted, according to numerous confirmed reports, RENAMO has
 repeatedly tortured and mistreated prisoners and civilians. At
 the end of 1984, the Southern African Catholic Bishop's
 Conference wrote that the atrocities committed by RENAMO had
 reached a horrific level.
 d. Arbritrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.
 Since 1979, two separate legal systems have existed. The first
 is the civil/criminal system with a judicial service and a
 police force under the authority of the Ministry of the
 Interior. The second system, which is characterized in its
 initiating legislation as transitional, is the military-run
 State Security System, which incorporates the Ministry of
 National Security (SNASP). This latter system, established to
 deal with the growing armed insurgency, now has jurisdiction
 over both political crimes against the State and economic
 sabotage. These two systems operate separately and are subject
 to separate controls.
 Under the State Security System, all investigations and arrests
 are carried out by SNASP. SNASP has in the past held detainees
 indefinitely without formal charges. Although detainees held
 by SNASP are legally entitled to counsel, prisoners reportedly
 have been held incommunicado. Amnesty International has
 recommended that SNASP's power to detain persons be drastically
 reduced because it believes that this situation invites abuse
 and leads to prisoner mistreatment.
 Under the civil/criminal court system, persons accused of the
 most serious crimes can be detained up to 84 days without
 investigation. At the end of this period, the police can
 request an additional period of up to 84 days to complete their
 investigation but must secure the approval of the court. While
 being held for investigation, a detainee has the right to
 counsel and to contact relatives or friends. Although
 adherence to these principles has improved during the last 2
 years, there are still reports of.abuses. The availability of
 lawyers to defend detainees is limited, but in 1985 the
 Ministry of Justice continued its effort to ensure that
 detainees held by police were afforded access to private or
 
 
 225
 MOZAMBIQUE
 government-provided legal assistance. In some cases detainees
 may be released from prison while the investigation proceeds,
 but the bail system in Mozambique remains ill-defined. If the
 prescribed period for investigation has been completed and no
 charges have been brought, the detainee must be released.
 During 1985, there were no reports of anyone being exiled from
 Mozambique. As far as is known, compulsory labor is not
 practiced in Mozambique.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.
 Trials conducted by the civil/criminal court system are
 public. At the local level they are often conducted in a
 public place in the village where the crime was allegedly
 committed to encourage public attendance and participation.
 The proceedings are conducted by a trained representative of
 the Ministry of Justice, assisted by two or four popularly
 elected "judges." Since the legal knowledge of those involved
 is limited, they are instructed to exercise common sense and to
 apply locally accepted principles. These courts can handle
 only minor offenses; more serious crimes are judged in Peoples'
 Courts at the district and provincial levels. District and
 provincial trials are also open to the public, except in
 certain cases, such as rape, where the defendant can request a
 closed trial. Persons convicted of a serious crime have the
 automatic right of appeal to the next higher court. The
 Superior Court of Appeals was recently established in Maputo.
 Prisoners charged with crimes against the State are tried by
 the Revolutionary Military Tribunal. These trials are held in
 camera and there is no recourse of appeal. However, this court
 has apparently not been called into session since 1983. There
 are no reliable estimates of the numbers of persons detained
 for political reasons. The exact number of persons
 incarcerated in the reeducation camps in the mid-1970's will
 never be known. Many reportedly died in these camps and the
 fate of others remains a mystery. In its 1985 report, Amnesty
 International estimated that there were approximately
 4,000-5,000 RENAMO prisoners at the beginning of 1985, and the
 figure was probably somewhat higher at the end of 1985. The
 general amnesty announced by President Machel at the beginning
 of 1984 remains in effect, and there have been reports of some
 insurgents surrendering voluntarily.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 "Operation Production," which forcibly relocated thousands from
 large urban areas to the countryside in 1983, has not been
 repeated. Moreover, most people have moved back to their
 former dwelling places. Since FRELIMO defines itself as a
 vanguard party, people are not forced to belong, but there is
 an obvious correlation between professional advancement and
 party membership. Nonparty members are also occasionally
 compelled to attend political indoctrination meetings where
 they work or live.
 It is widely assumed that surveillance devices are employed to
 monitor the local and international telecommunications
 systems. There have also been reports of tampering with mail,
 especially the mail from abroad.
 
 
 226
 MOZAMBIQUE
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is little tolerance for public criticism of basic
 government policies and officials at the national level. At
 the local level, especially in rural areas, there is
 considerable openness as the people express their views on
 prevailing conditions. Magazines and newspapers often contain
 articles or letters to the editor complaining about the lack of
 goods and social services or the ineffectiveness of a
 particular official.
 The Government controls all authorized publications in the
 country as well as the radio and experimental television
 facilities. Although the media promote the Government's
 general philosophy and its positions on issues, there is
 controlled reporting on abuses within the system or flaws in
 the implementation of government policies for those areas of
 state policy where the Government has admitted to errors.
 The Government has criticized Western news agencies for
 exhibiting a general bias against the Third World, but Western
 journalists (including Americans) are welcome in Mozambique,
 and the Government generally works to make their visits
 productive.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Since political opposition to the Government and to FRELIMO
 ideology is not permitted, public gatherings of all but a
 purely social nature are controlled by the local authorities.
 The right of Mozambicans to come together to form voluntary
 associations is limited: local economic cooperatives are
 encouraged but politically oriented associations are
 proscribed. The Government has organized several "mass
 movements" for women, youth, workers, etc., and attempts to use
 them to motivate the general population. Though membership is
 theoretically voluntary, there is occasional pressure to join.
 The formation of independent unions is not permitted. In 1983,
 the Government established the Mozambique Workers' Organization
 (OTM) intended to function as a national labor union. In
 practice, however, an organized union movement has yet to
 develop, and labor currently has little influence on economic
 policy or politics. There are occasional exchanges of
 delegations in the labor field with other countries, especially
 with those of Eastern Europe. Existing labor law is generally
 very favorable to the employee, but in practice it is difficult
 to enforce because of the fragility of the institutions
 associated with labor.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, in
 the past the Government placed restrictions on the activities
 of religious groups. It has reserved the right to decide
 whether individual church buildings can be operational and
 whether individual clergy can visit outlying areas. It has
 also nationalized church schools and hospitals. Over the past
 few years, however, there has been an improvement in
 church/state relations. Organized religions now operate with
 relative freedom and some churches have been effective in
 social work activities and in acting as channels for the
 
 
 227
 MOZAMBIQUE
 distribution of emergency food donations to the poorest regions
 of the country. Pastoral letters issued in 1985 by the
 Catholic bishops which were critical of governmental policies
 circulated widely without reprisals by the authorities. The
 Muslims have also been allowed to establish a national
 organization, to resume religious training, and to reopen
 mosques. Attendance at religious rites is thought generally to
 be on the rise and party members are no longer specifically
 prohibited from membership in a church or mosque. Critical
 comments regarding religious beliefs by the Government are
 almost always general in nature and not directed against
 specific individuals or churches. Membership in a religious
 group does not appear to affect, either favorably or
 unfavorably, a person's secular standing.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel and relocation within the country are controlled by
 security and employment requirements under the rationale of
 assuring public and social order. Mozambicans planning to
 travel outside their city of residence must obtain a travel
 permit from local government authorities.
 Mozambican law does not address the issue of emigration,
 although presumably Mozambicans can emigrate if they wish.
 Several hundred thousand people fled from Mozambique at
 independence in 1975 because of economic chaos and fears of
 political persecution. In the past few years, additional
 thousands have fled, some only temporarily because of the
 deteriorating security situation created by the guerrilla war
 and because of continuing economic hardship. In 1981, the
 Government announced a policy of welcoming back Mozambicans who
 had left the country, and in 1982 it passed a law allowing for
 the reacquisition of citizenship by Mozambicans who had left
 the country and assumed another nationality. Previously, some
 Mozambicans who had opposed the party before independence were
 jailed upon their return to Mozambique. More recently,
 Mozambicans who have accepted the Government's invitation to
 return have apparently not suffered harassment or retribution.
 However, persons involved in the insurgency movement or
 outspoken critics of the Government generally have opted not to
 return overtly to Mozambique.
 Since independence, the Government has readily provided first
 asylum to refugees from neighboring countries. Although many
 thousands of Zimbabweans resided temporarily in Mozambique
 during the struggle for that country's independence, most
 refugees now in Mozambique are from South Africa and Malawi.
 In spite of the poor economic situation, the Government
 continues to assist refugees by providing land, housing, relief
 assistance, social services and in some cases employment.
 There are an estimated several hundred thousand internally
 displaced persons in Mozambique due to drought and insurgency
 activity, and thousands of Mozambicans have fled to Malawi,
 Zimbabwe, Swaziland, and South Africa.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Political activity and active opposition to FRELIMO is not
 allowed. The party and the Government are controlled by a
 small cadre of senior officials, headed by President Machel.
 Structures for so-called mass political involvement exist at
 
 
 228
 MOZAMBIQUE
 the provincial, district, and local levels, but they only
 permit limited participation. The party and Government espouse
 a system of "People's Democracy" where decisions are made by
 consensus; in practice, this means that policies and
 initiatives emanate from above. Election to representative
 bodies is made from a single slate and the electorate has only
 the option of endorsing or rejecting candidates preselected by
 party structures. Votes by the National People's Assembly
 endorsing government policies are usually unanimous.
 The number of ethnic Asian and white Mozambicans holding
 important positions is much greater than their proportion of
 the general population, a reflection of the greater educational
 opportunities available to these groups prior to independence,
 rather than to unequal treatment. Within the black population,
 individual ethnic groups are treated equally, and tribal
 affiliation appears to have relatively little correlation to
 political outlook.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 Although the Government has discussed the status of RENAMO
 prisoners with international relief organizations, it has not
 yet allowed them access. Several times during 1984 Amnesty
 International presented to the Government recommendations to
 strengthen the controls against torture and to limit the right
 of the security forces to hold detainees for unlimited time
 without charges. The reaction of the Government to these
 recommendations is unknown. Amnesty International, in its 1985
 Report, remains concerned about the long-term detention without
 trial of suspected opponents of the Government, including some
 reported detainees arrested before independence in 1975, and
 about allegations of torture of political detainees and
 prisoners suspected of committing economic crimes. Freedom
 House rated Mozambique as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Mozambique's annual per capita gross national product was
 estimated at $397 in 1982 and probably dropped significantly by
 1985. The country has a population estimated at 13.6 million,
 85 percent of which is engaged in subsistence agriculture. The
 population growth rate was estimated at 2.8 percent in 1985.
 Because of drought, lack of security, and mismanagement, food
 production continues to fall far short of domestic
 requirements. In order to feed its population in 1985, the
 country spent a significant amount of foreign exchange on food
 imports and relied on very sizable food aid grants from
 abroad. Although drought conditions have improved,
 considerable foreign food aid will still be required for
 rehabilitation purposes in 1986. In order to promote
 agricultural production, the Government returned some state
 farms to private farmers and cooperated on aid programs aimed
 at private farmers. It also raised prices for food resulting
 in significant modest response.
 Industrial production is only a fraction of preindependence
 levels--some factories are closed and many are operating at
 only 10 percent of capacity. Productivity has suffered from
 shortages of raw materials, equipment, spare parts, and trained
 personnel. The Government continues to follow a nominally
 
 
 229
 MOZAMBIQUE
 Socialist economic system, but there is an active private
 sector, and in 1985 the Government instituted sweeping reform
 aimed at cutting back the commercial involvement of the State
 in the economy and at actively encouraging foreign investment.
 Smaller privately owned Mozambican industrial enterprises are
 functioning again. various companies have begun to explore for
 oil, gas, and minerals. The Government published an investment
 code in 1984, signed an agreement with the U.S. Overseas
 Private Investment Corporation, and became a member of the
 International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
 In areas of public health and education, differences in the
 quality of services available to rural and urban populations
 still exist, primarily as a result of limited resources and
 poor security. Medical care is significantly better in
 metropolitan areas. For example, the infant mortality rate now
 averages 158 per 1,000 live births nationwide, but varies from
 a low of 35-40 per 1,000 in sections of the capital to a high
 of 190-200 per 1,000 in some rural areas. Life expectancy at
 birth is 52 years but, again, there are wide differences among
 various parts of the country. In 1977, caloric supply
 available for consumption was estimated to be 83 percent of
 nutritional requirements and may be lower in 1985 due to
 drought and civil strife. Fewer than 10 percent of the
 population has access to safe water supplies and, even in urban
 areas, outbreaks of cholera occur.
 Education continues to be a priority. The Government
 emphasizes teacher training programs, particularly in rural
 areas. Most training centers, however, lack adequate
 facilities and are oversubscribed and understaffed. As a
 result, the number of teachers in rural areas continues to
 increase, but the quality of instruction remains low. The
 World Bank estimates that the primary school enrollment ratio
 was 53 percent in 1983 (62 percent for males and 45 percent for
 females). Although the literacy rate has risen as a result of
 government programs, a rate of 20 percent (including those who
 are only semiliterate) would probably be more accurate than the
 World Bank estimate of 33 percent.
 The Government has continued efforts to safeguard the health
 and welfare of the population. Health and environmental laws
 protecting workers have been enacted, and the Government has on
 occasion closed down firms for noncompliance. Child labor is
 also controlled and the minimum working age (excluding
 agriculture) is 16.
 In spite of the strains imposed by the war and the economic
 collapse, racial harmony remains a hallmark of Mozambican
 society. Largely due to government support, women continue to
 play an increasingly important role in Mozambique, particularly
 in the working levels of the Government. The 1985 national
 congress of the Mozambican's Women's Organization was notable
 for its avoidance of ideology and its concentration on issues
 of direct relevance to women's concerns.
