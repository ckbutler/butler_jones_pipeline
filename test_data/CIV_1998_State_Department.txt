 COTE D'IVOIRE
 Cote DIvoire is a centralized republic dominated by a strong presidency. Members
 of a single political p arty, the Democratic Party of C3ote D'Ivoire (PD CI) have occu-
 pied both the presidency and a majority of seats in the national legislature since
 independence in 1960, although other parties have been legal since 1990. Upon the
 death in 1993 of Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who had been President since independ-
 ence, National Assembly President Henri Konan Bedie became President by con-
 stitutional succession and served out the remainder of Houphouet's term. Due to
 concerns about 1994 changes to the candidacy requirements of the electoral code
 that excluded a leading opposition rival to Bedie, and about irregularities in voter
 registration, the major opposition parties staged an "active boycott" of the 1995
 presidential election, both declining to participate and trying to interfere with the
 voting process; however, President Bedie won 96 percent of the vote. The opposition
 parties and Bedie then reached an accord that allowed for full party participation
 in legislative elections later in 1995. These elections were marred by irregularities
 in voter registration; they were suspended in 3 of the 175 districts due to intereth-
 nic violence, and results in another 3 districts were invalidated, but make-up elec-
 tions in 1996 were orderly and transparent. The PDCI continued to control more
 than the 80 percent of National Assembly votes needed to amend the Constitution.
 In June the National Assembly enacted amendments to the Constitution that fur-
 ther increased the already preponderant power of the presidency and were criticized
 widely. However, in December, after negotiations with a major opposition party, the
 President signed any agreement obliging him to rescind some of these powers in a
 second round of constitutional amendments. The judiciary is subject to executive
 branch and other outside influence.
 Security forces include the army, navy, and air force, all under the Ministry of
 Defense; the Republican Guard, a well-funded 1,200-man presidential security force;
 the national police (Surete); and the Gendarmerie, a branch of the armed forces
 with responsibility for general law enforcement, maintenance of public order, and
 internal security, including suppression of violent crime. A National Security Coun-
 cil, formed in August 1996 and chaired by the former commandant of the gendar-
 merie, coordinates security policy, both internal and external. A Security Staff
 (L'Etat Major de la Securite) collects and distributions information about crime and
 coordinates the activities of the security forces in times of crisis. The Special
 Anticrime Police Brigade (SAVAC) continued its operations. The armed forces tradi-
 tionally have accepted the primacy of civilian authority. Seven of the 18 members
 of the military forces accused of plotting a coup in 1995 were dismissed from the
 military forces, then released from detention in 1996. Four other officers who had
 been suspended were reinstated in April. Security forces, including the SAVAC,
 committed numerous human rights abuses.
 The economy is largely market-based but heavily dependent on the agricultural
 sector. Most of the rural population remains dependent on smallholder cash crop
 production. Principal exports are cocoa, coffee, and wood. Fewer than half of adults
 are literate. Recorded Gross National Product per capita in 1997 was about $680
 on a money basis. Economic growth has resumed since a large currency devaluation
 in 1994, although it has been unevenly distributed. The Government increased the
 always large but previously diminishing share of its operating expenditures devoted
 to basic health services and education. However, economic growth continued to be
 impeded by widespread corruption rooted in a lack of transparent and accountable
 governance. The Government continued to receive substantial assistance from inter-
 national financial institutions.
 The Government's human rights record was characterized by serious problems
 and abuses in a number of areas. The Government enacted constitutional amend-
 ments that fiurther restricted citizens' right to change their government, only some
 
 
 of which the President subsequently agreed to rescind. Members of the security
 forces committed extrajudicial killings, and the security forces beat and abused de-
 tainees and used force to disperse protestors. The Government also used arbitrary
 arrest and detention and often failed to bring perpetrators of these abuses to justice.
 Prison conditions remained harsh and life threatening, although they improved in
 some respects, and international humanitarian organizations recently reported bet-
 ter access to the prison system. Prolonged detention was a problem. The judiciary
 did not ensure due process and was subject to executive branch influence, particu-
 larly in political cases; however, in December the Government released all known
 political prisoners and detainees. Security forces infringed on citizens' privacy
 rights. The Government restricted freedom of speech, the press, assem  y, and
 movement; however, it did not substantially restrict freedom of assembly during the
 second half of the year. Despite some formal restrictions on freedom of association,
 the Government generally permitted it in practice. Between one-fifth and one-third
 of the country's adult population, including many lifelong residents of the country,
 remained politically disenfranchised noncitizens. Discrimination and violence
 against women, abuse of children, and female genital mutilation (FGM) remained
 problems, although a new law made FGM a crime. The minority Baoule ethnic
 group's longstanding domination of the ruling party and the State, which has exac-
 erbated sometimes violent ethnic tensions, continued. Societal discrimination based
 on ethnicity remained a problem. Child labor and forced child labor are problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings by government forces. However, as violent civil crime remained
 widespread, the security forces frequently resorted to lethal force and committed nu-
 merous extrajudicial killings. Credible media reports indicate that the Special
 Anticrime Police Brigade continued its shoot-to-kill policy when pursuing criminal
 suspects. According to estimates in a government-owned daily newspaper, about 78
 persons were killed in the first quarter of 1997 alone. The Government did not pros-
 ecute SAVAC or police personnel for these killings.
 On May 14, police shot and killed Ellele Sombo Mages, a 17-year-old schoolboy,
 during a protest at a high school in Anyama over the expulsion of a student for fail-
 ure to pay what the student union and the Ministry of Education said were unau-
 thorized fees (see Section 1.c.). Following widespread student protests about this
 killing, police sergeant Kouakou Souassi was charged with Sombo's death. In Octo-
 ber a military tribunal sentenced the sergeant to 10 years' imprisonment.
 Police reportedly killed three taxi or truck drivers and seriously injured four such
 drivers during the year.
 On September 10, a policeman killed Assane Sanogo, a taxi driver, in Abidjan,
 allegedly during a petty extortion attempt. On September 18, following a five-day
 general strike by taxi and bus drivers to protest the killing, police officer Firmin
 Adou was arrested and charged with Sangono's murder. The Government also ac-
 ceded to the drivers' other demands, including a compensation payment to
 Sangono's widow and son.
 At an unknown time and place, Police lieutenant Diaby Mamadou and officers
 Fofana and Korahi allegediy beat and killed Zeze Patrice, a man whom they sus-
 pected of having embezzled the proceeds of a vehicle sale. The police reportedly tried
 to beat the truth out of him. Zeze Patrice was paralyzed after the beating and later
 died. On October 12, the three police officers were arrested and-jailed at Abidjan
 military prison.
 On October 15, another taxi driver, Kassim Oumare, died in police custody. Police
 authorities announced that he had hanged himself in his cell by his shoelaces. Ac-
 cording to press reports, Kassim had been in detention since the night of October
 12, when his vehicle injured Coulibaly Yacouba, an officer of the Riot Police Brigade
 (BAE). Coulibaly Yacouba died after being shot four times by police sergeant
 Gohoun Gnapia, who mistook him for a thief. Kassim Oumare's death came 2 days
 after an incident in which BAE personnel beat several taxi drivers and damaged
 nine taxis in the Toit-Rouge quarter of Abidjan in retaliation for Yacouba's death
 (see Section 1.c.). Gohon Gnapia was arrested. At year's end, no arrests had been
 made in Kassim Oumare's death. However, Dignite, the independent trade union
 that represents most taxi and truck drivers, filed a civil suit against the Minister
 of Security and the Prefect of Police in connection with Oumare's death.
 On December 15, gendarmes arrested Camara Yaya and several others at a road-
 block for possessing a small amount of cocaine and took them to the gendarmerie
 school. The gendarmes forced the detainees to run laps around the courtyard.
 
 
 Camara complained of poor health and stopped running, whereupon the gendarmes
 reportedly beat and killed him. Camara's family published an open letter to Presi-
 dent Bedie demanding the arrest and punishment of the gendarmes responsible, but
 they were not known to have been arrested at year's end.
 On December 23, police took Jean Claude Lama, a 16-year-old street child, from
 a roadblock to the first police precinct in Plateau district. The following morning the
 police commissioner announced that Lama had hanged himself in his cell. Friends
 of Lama said that he was looking forward to celebrating Christmas with them, and
 accused police of beating Lama on the night of his death. At year's end, no arrests
 had been made in the case, which authorities called a suicide.
 At least four other prisoners are known to have died in custody, three in Toumodi
 and one in Bouake, as a direct result of harsh prison conditions; credible reports
 indicate that more than 700 persons died in prison in 1997 from all causes (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.).
 There were no developments in the case of six detainees who died in prison in
 1996. They had been held since the "active boycott" of the 1995 presidential election.
 Another active boycott prisoner, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment, died
 in prison in Bouake on August 16. However, in December the National Assembly
 voted unanimously to grant amnesty to all 28 persons still in prison for infractions
 related to the active boycott, of whom 18 had been tried, convicted, and sentenced,
 and 10 were still awaiting trial (see Section 1.d.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The country acceded to the Convention Against Torture in 1995, but has enacted
 no implementing legislation. Although the Penal Code contains general strictures
 against violence against persons, neither the Constitution nor the Penal Code is
 known to provide specific protection for persons in custody against torture or other
 mistreatment, and police sometimes beat detainees or prisoners as punishment, or
 to extract confessions, according to local human rights groups. There were no public
 reports of government officials being tried for these abuses.
 Jurists' union officials reported that police continue to beat suspects to obtain con-
 fessions and that suspects are afraid to press charges against the police officers in-
 volved. Press photographs regularly show criminal detainees with swollen or bruised
 faces and bodies. Several persons detained in Abidjan in April complained that po-
 lice beat them (see Section 1.d.).
 Police frequently used violence to restrain demonstrators. Riot police used tear
 gas and truncheons against protesting students on several occasions during the first
 alf of the year. On at least one occasion police used lethal force against student
 protesters (see Sections L.a. and 2.b.). Police used tear gas to quell a protest in May.
 In two cases, military personnel were disciplined for physically abusing civilians.
 In June four soldiers were jailed for 30 days for beating an imam (Muslim religious
 leader) in a mosque during an attempt to arrest a thief. In August three members
 of the Republican Guard were tried for beating a man in an off-duty nightclub inci-
 dent.
 On October 12, following the death of a Riot Police officer who had been injured
 by a taxi (see Section l.a.), members of the Riot Police Brigade damaged nine taxis
 and beat several taxi drivers in the Toit-rouge quarter of Abidjan. BAE officers in-
 volved were arrested, and the Minister of Security promised to have the damaged
 taxis repaired. Whether that promise was kept, and whether the BAE officers were
 punished, are not known.
 Police routinely harassed and abused noncitizen Africans (see Section 5).
 In December the Government enacted legislation allowing lawyers to assist their
 clients at the stage of preliminary police hearings, that is, during the early stages
 of detention when torture and abuse may be most likely.
 Prison conditions are harsh and life threatening. Problems include overcrowding,
 malnutrition, a high incidence of infectious disease, and lack of treatment facilities
 and medications. These conditions are responsible in part for a high prisoner death
 rate throughout the prison population. HIV/AIDS reportedly is also a significant
 mortality factor. It was credibly reported that more than 700 prisoners died in 1997.
 Comparably complete information for 1998 was not yet available at year's end, but
 at least 60 prisoners are known to have died during the year. Several journalists
 released from prison in 1996 reported that white-collar prisoners are afforded spe-
 cial treatment. The Government has offered access to prisons to nongovernmental
 organizations (NGO's) that seek to provide food and medical care to prisoners.
 According to the Ivorian Human Rights League (LIDHO), conditions at the main
 prison of Abidjan have been especially hazardous for women, who were housed to-
 gether with violent and nonviolent male criminals, as well as with minors. However,
 uring the year the prison began to separate female and male prisoners and to
 
 
 110
 maintain female guards for female prisoners and male guards for male prisoners.
 There continued to be occasional credible reports of childbirth in prison. However,
 during the year, unlike past years, there were no reports that guards raped female
 prisoners. Nevertheless, there were still reports that female prisoners engaged in
 sexual relations with their wardens in exchange for food and more privileges. There
 are still no health facilities for women, and reportedly a number of women have
 given birth at the prison without medical attention.
 Unlike previous years, humanitarian NGO's did not report difficulty in gaining ac-
 cess to prisons. Several humanitarian NGO's, including the International Commit-
 tee of the Red Cross, Prisonniers Sans Frontieres, and Medicins Sans Frontieres,
 had access to the prisons and visited them during the year to provide food and medi-
 cal care to prisoners. However, none of these NGO's was specifically monitoring
 human rights conditions in the prisons. The LIDHO, which does monitor human
 rights conditions in prisons, did not visit prisons during the year because it re-
 mained unable to do so without giving advance notice; the LIDHO has applied for
 authorization to visit prisons at any time without advance notice, but has not re-
 ceived it.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government arbitrarily arrests and
 detains citizens. Under the Code of Penal Procedure, a public prosecutor may order
 the detention of a suspect for only 48 hours without bringing charges. A magistrate
 may order detention for up to 4 months but also must provide the Minister of Jus-
 tice with a written justification for continued detention on a monthly basis. How-
 ever, the law often is violated. Police have held persons for more than 48 hours
 without bringing charges. According to a member of a jurists' union, this practice
 is common, and magistrates often are not able to verify that those not charged are
 released.
 Defendants do not have the right to a judicial determination of the legality of
 their detention. A judge may release pretrial detainees on provisional liberty, if the
 judge believes that the suspect is not likely to flee. The Attorney General in 1996
 referred in public to the long detention periods suffered by prisoners awaiting trial
 in the country's principal prison, the MACA, listing a total prisoner population of
 4,600, of whom 1,741 were detainees who had yet to be tried. Of the detainees, 470
 had been detained for more than2 years, 60 for at least 4 years, and 39 others be-
 tween 5 and 12 years. Based on these figures, pretrial detainees at that time made
 up about 35 percent of the prison population. However, a law enacted in December
 limits pretrial detention to 10 months in civil cases and 22 months in criminal
 cases; if these limits are exceeded, the prisoner must be released on provisional lib-
 erty with no bail, and if the responsible judge takes no action, the prison director
 must act to free the suspect or face sanctions.
 Ten persons arrested in connection with the active boycott of the 1995 presi-
 dential campaign were still in prison and awaiting trial, and more than 100 more
 were on provisional liberty but awaiting trial on charges related to the active boy-
 cott, when, in December, the Government enacted a law granting amnesty to all
 persons convicted or charged in connection with that incident (see Section 3). An es-
 timated 450 such persons originally were arrested. None was known to remain in
 custody at year's end.
 Favide Innocent, a Beninese car importer arrested in 1994 pursuant to an extra-
 dition request by the Government of Togo, remained in detention in the MACA al-
 though various courts had ordered his release on several occasions, most recently
 in April. In November Innocent staged a hunger strike to protest his continued de-
 tention. However, he remained detained at year's end.
 Although it is prohibited by law, police restrict access to some prisoners. Despite
 the frequency of arbitrary arrest, there is no accurate total of suspects held. In April
 police held over 800 unemployed persons and vagrants in investigative detention in
 Abidjan, afer arresting many persons in an effort to identify criminals. Several per-
 sons reported that police beat them.
 The military personnel arrested on charges of coup plotting in 1995 and released
 14 months later remained at iberty, and four were reinstated. No additional mem-
 bers of the military services were detained without charges.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, in practice the judiciary is subject to executive branch and other out-
 side influences. Although the judiciary is independent in ordinary criminal cases, it
 follows the lead of the executive in national security or politically sensitive cases.
 Judges serve at the pleasure of the executive and reports that they submit to politi-
 cal pressure are credible. One jurist claims that he was transferred out of Abidjan
 because of his public appeals for a more independent judiciary.
 
 
 The formal judicial system is headed by a Supreme Court and includes the Cour
 of Appeals and lower courts.
 Military courts do not try civilians. Although there are no appellate courts within
 the military court system, persons convicted by a military tribunal may petition the
 Supreme Court to set aside the tribunal's verdict and order a retrial.
 In rural areas, traditional institutions often administer justice at the village level,
 handling domestic disputes and minor land questions in accordance with customary
 law. Dispute resolution is by extended debate, with no known instance of resort to
 physical punishment. The formal court system increasingly is superseding these tra-
 ditional mechanisms. In 1996 a Grand Mediator was appointed to settle disputes
 that cannot be resolved by traditional means. This office appears designed to bridge
 traditional and modern methods of dispute resolution. During the year, 149 disputes
 including land rights disputes were submitted to it.
 The law provides for the right to public trial, although key evidence sometimes
 is given secretly. The presumption of innocence and the right of defendants to be
 present at their trials often are not observed. Those convicted have the right of ap-
 peal, although higher courts rarely overturn verdicts. Defendants accused of felonies
 or capital crimes have the right to legal counsel, and the judicial system provides
 for court-appointed attorneys; however, no free legal assistance is available. In prac-
 tice many defendants cannot afford private counsel, and court-appointed attorneys
 are not readily available.
 In December the Government granted amnesty for all offenses committed by all
 persons in connection with the active boycott of the 1995 election. As a result, 33
 persons arrested during the 1995 active boycott disturbances, who were serving
 terms ranging from 3 years' to life imprisonment, were released on December 24.
 There were no other reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Code of Penal Procedure specifies that a police official or investigative magistrate
 may conduct searches of homes without a judicial warrant if there is reason to be-
 lieve that there is evidence on the premises concerning a crime. The official must
 have the prosecutor's agreement to retain any evidence seized in the search and is
 required to have witnesses to the search, which may not take place between 9:00
 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. In practice police sometimes use a general search warrant with-
 out a name or address. On occasion police have entered homes of non-Ivorian Afri-
 cans (or apprehended them at large), taken them to local police stations, and ex-
 torted small amounts of money for alleged minor offenses.
 Security forces reportedly monitored some private telephone conversations, but
 the extent of the practice is unknown. Government authorities monitored letters and
 parcels at the post office for potential criminal activity, and are widely believed to
 monitor private correspondence, although no evidence of this has been produced.
 The Government used students as informers at the University of Abidjan (see Sec-
 tion 2.a.).                                                    /
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of expression, and private newspapers frequently criticize government policies, the
 Government imposes significant restrictions. The two government-owned daily
 newspapers, Fraternite Matin and Ivoir' Soir, offer little criticism of government pol-
 icy, while government-owned radio and television offer none at all. While private
 newspapers (8 daily, 19 weekly), opposition leaders, and student groups voice their
 disapproval of government or presidential actions frequently and sometimes loudly,
 the Government does not tolerate what it considers insults or attacks on the honor
 of the country's highest officials. A law enacted in 1991, soon after the Government
 first allowed substantial numbers of private newspapers to operate, authorizes the
 State to initiate criminal libel prosecutions against persons who insult the Presi-
 dent, the Prime Minister, foreign chiefs of state or government or their diplomatic
 representatives, or defame institutions of the State, or undermine the reputation of
 the nation. In addition, the State may criminalize a civil libel suit at its discretion
 and at the request of the plaintiff. Criminal libel is punishable by 3 months to 2
 years in prison. Journalists exercise considerable self-censorship.
 In October, a former minister filed a libel suit against staff of a private Abidjan-
 based daily newspaper, Le Jour, which had reported allegations of his involvement
 in a pedophilia scandal (see Section 5). In the same month, the Government an-
 nounced that it would henceforth initiate criminal libel prosecutions only on behalf
 of the President, and would punish criminal libel convictions by fines rather than
 imprisonment except in cases of libel against the President. The preponderance of
 state-initiated criminal libel prosecutions of journalists since 1991 have alleged libel
 against the President.
 
 
 In June government prosecutors briefly detained and initiated criminal libel
 charges against Guy Badieto and Jean-Louis Pehe, two journalists of the Abidjan-
 based weekly newspaper L'Argument. In May that newspaper had reported that
 President Bedie's wife-had accepted a bribe to induce officials to free a businessman
 being prosecuted for swindling the Government (see Section 3). In November, when
 the case came to trial, the judge dismissed the charges on the grounds that the
 President's wife had not filed charges herself and is not among the officials on be-
 half of whom the State can bring criminal libel charges. By year's end, the Govern-
 ment had not appealed the dismissal, and the President's wife had not filed a libel
 suit.
 In an August letter to the publisher of Notre Voie, a private Abidjan-based daily
 newspaper affiliated with a major opposition party, the Minister of Communications
 cautioned that a series of articles on domestic political repression by the security
 forces that the newspaper had announced it would soon publish "might harm na-
 tional security" and violate provisions of the 1991 press law that forbid the publica-
 tion of national defense secrets.
 On the night of October 11, the Abidjan offices of Notre Voie and an affiliated
 daily, Actuel, were entered forcibly and burglarized by three armed and hooded per-
 sons who stripped and beat the night guard and removed files on corruption involv-
 ing senior government officials and ethnic discrimination in the armed forces, but
 left telephones, computers, and facsimile machines untouched. In 1995 the offices
 of Notre Voie, then called La Voie, had been burned by persons unknown. No arrest
 warrants have been issued in either case.
 Both because literacy is far from universal, and because newspapers and tele-
 vision are relatively expensive, radio is the most important medium of mass commu-
 nication. The Government-owned broadcast media company, Radiodiffusion Tele-
 vision Ivorienne (RTI), owns two major radio stations; only the primary government
 radio station is broadcast nationwide. There are also four major private domestic
 radio stations: Radio France Internationale (RFI), British Broadcasting Company
 (BBC), Africa Number One and Radio Nostalgie. They broadcast on FM in Abidjan
 only, except for RFI, which in November signed an agreement with RTI to allow it
 to broadcast via relay antennas to the north and center of the country. The RFI and
 BBC stations broadcast only internationally produced programming. The Africa
 Number One station, which is 51 percent domestically owned, broadcasts 6 hours
 a day of domestically produced programming; the rest of the time it broadcasts pro-
 gramming from Africa Number One's headquarters in Libreville, Gabon. Radio
 Nostalgie is 51 percent owned by Radio Nostalgie France. The RFI, BBC, and Africa
 Number One stations all broadcast news and political commentary about Cote
 d'Ivoire. The private stations have complete control over their editorial content.
 However, no major private domestic radio station is known to be commonly critical
 of the Government in its editorials, and no journalist of any such station is known
 to have been prosecuted for libel, cautioned or harassed by the Government or mem-
 bers of the security forces.
 Radio station license applications are adjudicated by a commission under the Min-
 istry of Information, which has accepted applications and awarded licenses only
 once, in 1993. On that occasion, the commission denied 7 of 12 applications on a
 variety of grounds, including, in one case, affiliation with a major opposition politi-
 cal party.
 During the year, the Government also authorized 43 community radio stations
 with very limited broadcast strength. Catholic church groups began to operate four
 community radio stations: Radio Espoir in Abidjan, Radio Paix Sanwi in Aboisso,
 Radio Notre Dame in Yamoussoukro, and Radio Dix-Huit Montagnes in Man. No
 Muslim station is yet broadcasting because the Government required that all major
 Muslim associations agree to share a single frequency; however, a Muslim associa-
 tion closely associated with the ruling party dissented (see Section 5).
 There are two television stations that broadcast domestically produced programs.
 Both are owned and operated by the Government. Only one is broadcast nationwide.
 The only private television station, Canal Horizon, is foreign-owned and broadcasts
 no domestically produced programs. The Government has not accepted any applica-
 tions to establish a privately owned domestic television station.
 The National Council of Audiovisual Communication, established in 1991 and for-
 mally organized in 1995, is responsible for regulating media access during the 2-
 week formal political campaign period and for resolving complaints about unfair
 media access. However, members of the ruling PDCI make up the majority of the
 membership of the council.
 The Government does not restrict access to or distribution of electronic media.
 There are three domestic Internet service providers, which have begun operations
 since 1996. All three are private. The licensing requirements imposed by the govern-
 
 
 113
 ment telecommunications regulatory body, ATOI, reportedly are not unduly restric-
 tive.
 The Government continues to exercise considerable influence over the official me-
 dia's program content, news coverage, and other matters, using these media to pro-
 mote government policies. Much of the news programming was devoted to the activi-
 ties of the President, the Government, the PDCI, and pro-Bedie groups.
 The case of 13 employees of the government broadcast media company, RTI, who
 had participated in April 1997 in a strike that reportedly caused an interruption of
 RTI broadcasting, came to trial in November. The RTI employees were tried on
 charges, filed in May 1997, of disturbing public order, willful destruction of public
 property, and interfering with public services (see Section 6.a.). The judge had not
 announced a verdict by year's end.
 There were numerous student protests during the year (see Section 5).
 There is no known law specifically concerning academic freedom, although aca-
 demics have cited laws of French origin concerning the operations of universities to
 support their claims of academic freedom. In practice the Government tolerates
 much academic freedom, but also inhibits political expression through its propri-
 etary control of most educational facilities, even at the postsecondary level. Many
 prominent scholars active in opposition politics have retained their positions at state
 educational facilities. However, some teachers and professors suggest that they have
 been transferred or fear that they may be transferred to less desirable positions be-
 cause of their political activities. According to student union statements, govern-
 ment security forces continued to use students as informers to monitor political ac-
 tivities at the University of Abidjan.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly; however, in practice, the Government sometimes restricted
 this right during the first half of the year.
 Groups that wish to hold demonstrations or rallies are required by law to submit
 a notice of their intent to do so to the Ministry of Security or the Ministry of Inte-
 rior 48 hours before the proposed event. No law expressly authorizes the Govern-
 ment to ban public meetings or events for which advance notice has been .given in
 the required manner. Nevertheless, the Government has sometimes denied the op-
 position permission to meet in public outdoor venues. In January the Government
 prohibited a February march planned by strikers belonging to Dignite, an independ-
 ent federation of trade unions. However, the Government banned no other public
 events or meetings during the year. In September. opposition parties held large pub-
 lic demonstrations against recent government-sponsored constitutional changes (see
 Section 3). Although the Government warned of dire consequences in the event of
 violence, it did not ban the demonstrations, and no violence occurred.
 Police repeatedly used violence to break up demonstrations of which the advance
 notice required by law had not been duly given. During the first half of the year,
 police forcibly suppressed many student demonstrations (see Section 1.c.). Police
 generally used nonlethal force such as tear gas against demonstrators, and a police
 officer who killed a student protestor in May was tried and punished (see Section
 1.a.).
 A 1992 Antivandalism Law holds organizers of a march or demonstration respon-
 sible if any of the participants engage in violence. A leading civil rights NGO, the
 LIDHO, and all major opposition parties condemned the law as unduly vague and
 as one that imposed punishment on some persons for the crimes of others.
 During the second half of the year, the Government neither banned nor broke up
 any public meetings or demonstrations, and did not invoke the Anti-Vandalism Law.
 The Government restricts freedom of association formally, but generally respects
 it in practice. Opposition parties assert that the Constitution permits private asso-
 ciations to form. The Government rejects this interpretation and requires all organi-
 zations to register before commencing activities. In order to obtain registration, po-
 litical parties must provide information on their founding members and produces in-
 ternal statutes and political platforms consistent with the Constitution. At year's
 end, there were approximately 90 legally recognized political parties, of which 3
 were represented in the National Assembly. There were no reports in the past 5
 years of denial of registration. The law prohibits the formation of political parties
 along ethnic or religious lines.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and
 there are no known impediments to religious expression. No faith is favored offi-
 cially. The Government permits the open practice of religion, and there are no re-
 strictions on religious ceremonies or teaching.
 According to a 1988 census, only about 25 percent of citizens were Muslim, about
 23 percent were animist, and 31 percent were Christian; 13 percent practiced no re-
 ligion. However, Muslims make up a substantially larger proportion of the total pop-
 
 
 ulation including noncitizens. Nevertheless, some Muslims feel that their religious
 or ethnic affiliation makes them targets of discrimination by the Government with
 regard to both employment and the renewal of national identity cards (see Section
 5). During the year, the Catholic Church began to operate community radio stations,
 but Muslims' efforts to gain authorization to operate similar stations have been un-
 successful (see Section 2.a.).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although neither the Constitution nor any law provides for freedom of
 movement, the Government does not generally restrict internal travel; however, uni-
 formed police, gendarmes, and water, forestry and customs officials commonly erect
 and man roadblocks on major roads where they demand that passing motorists or
 passengers produce identity and vehicle papers and regularly extort small amounts
 of money or goods for contrived or minor infractions. The killing of a taxi driver by
 a policeman in September occurred at such a roadblock during such an extortion at-
 tempt (see Section l.a.).
 Citizens normally may travel abroad and emigrate freely and have the right of
 voluntary repatriation. There are no known cases of revocation of citizenship.
 The country is a party to the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Ref-
 ugees and its 1967 Protocol, but has not enacted implementing legislation. The only
 current domestic statute is the 1990 immigration law, which includes refugees with-
 out specifying a separate legal status for them. Nevertheless, the Government re-
 spects the right to first asylum and does not deny recognition to refugees, either by
 law or custom. An estimated 124,000 Liberian refugees remain in the country; from
 150,000 to 200,000 refugees have returned either under United Nations auspices or
 independently. There are also several thousand refugees from Sierra Leone and the
 Great Lakes region, including Rwanda and Burundi. There were no reports of per-
 sons who had a valid claim to asylum or refugee status being involuntarily repatri-
 ated to a country where they feared persecution.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in
 health, education, and food distribution programs for refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their govern-
 ment peacefully through democratic means, the Government limited this right in
 practice. Although opposition parties were legalized in 1990, the ruling PDCI party
 has controlied both the presidency and the national assembly continuously since
 independence in 1960, and no president has ever left office in consequence of an
 election. Between one-fifh and one-third of the country's adult population, including
 many lifelong residents of the country, are politically disenfranchised noncitizens
 (see Section 5).
 In 1994 the Government enacted changes to the Electoral Code that included
 more restrictive parentage and residency requirements. These changes had the ef-
 fect of excluding from the 1995 presidential election Alassane Ouattara, a major po-
 tential rival to President Bedie. Citing concern about these changes in the electoral
 code, and about irregularities in the voter registration process, the major opposition
 parties boycotted and tried to disrupt the 1995 presidential election, in which Bedie
 was reelected with 96 percent of the vote.
 Presidential and legislative elections are held every 5 years by balloting that is
 officially described as secret, but allows a voter to leave a polling place with evi-
 dence of how he voted. At polling places on election day, registered citizens receive
 a package of color-coded cards, containing one card for each candidate. Each citizen
 votes, alone inside a closed booth, by depositing into a sealed ballot box an envelope
 containing one of these cards. However, the voter is free to carry the unused cards
 from his package out of the polling place. Consequently voters can and sometimes
 do present these unused ballots as proof of how they voted to agents of candidates
 who pay them for their votes. This balloting system tends to favor an incumbent
 party that can draw directly or indirectly on the resources of the State to reward
 those who vote for its candidates. During negotiations with the ruling party late in
 the year, a leading opposition party demanded unsuccessfully that single and fully
 secret ballots be used in future elections.
 The number of registered voters in districts of the National Assembly, each of
 which elects one representative, varies by as much as a factor of 10; these inequal-
 ities systematically favor the ruling party. National Assembly elections held in 1995
 were marred both by violent incidents and by flaws in the electoral process, which
 were noted by both international and domestic observers. In March legislative by-
 elections were held in three districts. ONE, a domestic NGO that monitors elections,
 cited irregularities in election list compilation and voting card distribution; these
 
 
 115
 irregularities favored the ruling party candidates. In the district of Azaguie, a crowd
 attacked two polling station supervisors found in the cars of the ruling party can-
 didates for the offices of mayor and National Assembly representative at midnight
 on the eve of the election. Ruling p arty candidates won in all three districts, and
 continued to occupy more than the 80 percent of the seats in the National Assembly
 needed to amend the Constitution.
 In practice the presidency consistently has dominated the State. In the name of
 ruling party discipline, the PODI-controlled National Assembly has always enacted
 with very few modifications most bills submitted by the Government. Moreover,
 members of the National Assembly seldom have initiated legislation, and the Na-
 tional Assembly only rarely has enacted legislation introduced by a member rather
 than by the Government. Nevertheless, early in the year, when the Government
 proposed constitutional amendments that would further increase the power of the
 presidency, many of the 175-seat National Assembly's 149 PCDI members initially
 indicated that they would oppose them. However, they changed their minds after
 lunches on June 12 and June 25 to which the President, who is also p resident of
 the PODI, invited all ruling party National Assembly members. At the June 25
 lunch, each guest received an envelope containing about $900 (500,000 OFA francs).
 At the end of June, the National Assembly enacted amendments to the Constitu-
 tion, largely proposed by the President, that diminish the authority of the Prime
 Minister relative to the President, authorize the President to annul elections or to
 postpone announcing election results, extend the presidential term from 5 to 7
 years, mandate the creation of a second legislative chamber (senate) in which one-
 third of the members are to be appointed by President, provide for the president
 of the senate to succeed the President in the event of his death or incapacitation,
 and write into the Constitution the  presidential eligibility restrictions of the 1994
 electoral code. Diverse domestic and international observers--incuding a leading
 domestic human rights NGO (LIDHO), an antitribalist NGO (Notre Nation), and the
 French Socialist Party--criticized these constitutional amendments publicly for
 tending both to limit the right of citizens to change their government and to in-
 crease the already preponderant power of the presidency.
 To protest these amendments, the major opposition parties boycotted the National
 Assembly's vote on them, and organied large street demonstrations in September
 (see Section 2.b.) that began in Abidjan and continued across the country. The new
 constitutional amendments continued to draw widespread criticism and stimulate
 opposition to the Government. On December 16, as part of a formal written accord
 between the ruling party and a major opposition party, President Bedie agreed to
 renounce, in a second round of constitutional amendments, some of the powers con-
 ferred on him by the June constitutional amendments, including: the power to post-
 pone announcements of election results; the power to annul elections; and the power
 to appoint one-third of the Senate, all members of which are now to be elected. How-
 ever, all the other June constitutional amendments remained fully effective.
 As part of the same accord, President Bedie agreed to an amnesty for all offenses
 committed in connection with the "active boyctt" of the 1995 presidential election
 (see Sections 1.d. and i.e.).
 Elections for local PDCI party officials held in August and September led to alle-
 gations of serious irregularities in Treichvilie and Koumassi and to violence that left
 candidates injured in Koumassi.
 In November, Roger Nasra, a businessman on trial for having defrauded the Gov-
 ernent of nearly $2 million in 1995, testified that he had given that money back
 to a senior official of the state treasury for diversion to President Bedie's 1995 re-
 election campaign. The treasury official denied the charges.
 Government and opposition obseers both have indicated that almost half of citi-
 zens do not have national identity cards, without which they cannot vote. The Gov-
 ernent enacted and began to implement a law that simplified and greatly reduced
 the cost of the process by which citizens obtain national identity cards. This was
 intended to increase voter eligibility and registration. However, the same law also
 tripled the cost of residence permits required of noncitizens.
 The major opposition parties continued to demand that elections be organized and
 supervised by an electoral commission independent of the Government, as domestic
 and international election-monitring NGO's have recommended. The Government
 continued to reject this demand.
 Citizens' ability to elect subnational governments is limited. The State is highly
 centralized. Subnational government entities exist on several levels, including 16 re-
 gions, 58 departments, 230 subprefectures, and 196 communities. However, at all
 levels except for communities, which are headed by mayors elected for 5-year terms,
 and traditional chieftaincies, which are headed by elected chiefs, all subnationa
 government officials are appointed by the central Government. Subnational govern-
 
 
 116
 ments generally must rely on the central Government for much of their revenues,
 but mayors have autonomy to hire and fire community administrative personnel.
 Although there are no legal impediments to women assuming political leadership
 roles, only 14 of the 175 National Assembly deputies are women. Women hold 3 of
 the 17 leadership positions in the Assembly. There are 3 women in the 36-member
 presidential Cabinet named in August, and 3 members of the Supreme Court are
 women.
 There are no legal impediments to the exercise of political rights by any of the
 more than 60 ethnic groups in the country. However, it is widely believed that the
 Baoule and other ethnic groups that have tended to support the ruling party are
 overrepresented in both mid-level and low-level a ppointed positions throughout the
 public sector. Since independence Baoules have always held the positions of Presi-
 dent and Defense Minister.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The LIDHO, a human rights NGO formed in 1987 and recognized by the Govern-
 ment in 1990, has investigated alleged violations of human rights actively and
 issued press releases and reports, some critical of the Government. Other groups
 such as Amnesty International and the International Movement of Democratic
 Women also monitored government human rights abuses and published press re-
 leases critical of them.
 The Government has cooperated with international inquiries into its human
 rights practices, which have been chiefly in the area of prison conditions (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, or religion is prohib-
 ited by law, but in practice women occupy a subordinate role in society, Muslims
 complain of governmental discrimination (see Section 2.c.), societal ethnic discrimi-
 nation is a problem, and the Baoule ethnic group dominates the ruling party and
 through it, the Government.
 Women.-Representatives of the Ivorian Association for the Defense of Women
 (AIDF) state that spousal abuse (usually wife beating) occurs frequently and often
 leads to divorce. An AIDF survey found that many women refused to discuss their
 experience of domestic violence; of women who completed the AIDF interview proc-
 ess, nearly 90 percent had been beaten or struck on at least one occasion. Doctors
 state that they rarely see the victims of domestic violence. A severe social stigma
 is attached to such violence, and neighbors often intervene in a domestic quarrel to
 protect a woman who is the known object of physical abuse. The courts and police
 view domestic violence as a family problem, unless serious bodily harm is inflicted
 or the victim lodges a complaint, in which case they may initiate criminal proceed-
 ings. Women's advocacy groups have protested the indifference of authorities to fe-
 male victims of violence and called attention to domestic violence and female genital
 mutilation. The groups also reported that women who are the victims of rape or do-
 mestic violence are often ignored when they attempt to bring the violence to the at-
 tention of the police. The Government does not collect statistics on the rape or other
 physical abuse of women. The Government has no clear policy regarding spouse
 abuse beyond the strictures against violence in the civil code. In December the Na-
 tional Assembly enacted a Law Concerning Crimes against Women, which forbids
 and provides criminal penalties for forced or early marriage and sexual harassment,
 but says nothing about spouse abuse. The AIDF also is active in opposing forced
 marriage and advancing the rights of female domestic workers.
 In rural areas, women and men divide the labor, with men clearing the land and
 attending to cash crops. like cocoa and coffee, while women grow vegetables and
 other staples and perform most menial household tasks. Government policy encour-
 ages full participation by women in social and economic life, but there is consider-
 able informal resistance among employers to hiring women, whom they consider less
 dependable because of their potential pregnancy. Women are underrepresented in
 some professions and in the managerial sector as a whole. Some women also en-
 counter difficulty in obtaining loans, as they cannot meet the lending criteria man-
 dated by banks. These criteria include such elements as title to a house and produc-
 tion of profitable cash crops, specifically coffee and cocoa. However, women in the
 formal sector are paid on an equal scale with men.
 Children.-Primary education is compulsory, but this requirement is not enforced
 effectively. Many children leave school after only a few years. There is a parental
 preference for educating boys rather than girls, which is noticeable throughout the
 
 
 country but more pronounced in rural areas. The primary school enrollment rate for
 girls is increasing in the northern part of the country. In part to combat low enroll-
 ment rates for girls, in January the Government instituted new measures against
 statutory rape of students by school teachers. In January the Minister of National
 Education stated that almost one-third of the 66 percent primary and secondary
 school dropout rate was attributable to pregnancies, and that many of the sexual
 partners of female students were teachers, to whom girls sometimes granted sexual
 favors in return for good grades or money. During 1990-1996, 79 percent of males
 and 58 percent of females of primary school age reportedly were enrolled, according
 to UNICEF statistics.
 Students at universities and secondary schools staged many demonstrations and
 protests about educational issues. In January the Government closed all schools at
 all levels, including primary school, for 10 days, following particularly widespread
 demonstrations. However, student protests became less common during the second
 half of the year, and far fewer school days were lost to protests and demonstrations
 than during 1997, as the Government developed a working dialog with a new stu-
 dent union, FESCI, which the Government had recognized in late 1997. The Govern-
 ment increased its spending on education, and tried and punished a police sergeant
 who shot and killed a student demonstrator (see Section l.a.).
 Cities, especially Abidjan, have large populations of street children. Some children
 are employed as domestics and are subject to sexual abuse, harassment, and other
 forms of mistreatment by their employers, according to the AIDF and press reports
 (see Section 6.d.).
 In September an Abidjan daily newspaper reported allegations by a 14-year-old
 boy that he had been sodomized repeatedly over many months by a network of
 pedophiles that included former Minister of Economic Infrastructure Ezan Akele
 and a foreign ambassador. Leading human rights organizations, including the
 LIDHO, demanded that the alleged pedophiles not be shielded from prosecution. As
 of year's end, no charges had been flied.
 At least hundreds and perhaps thousands of Malian children were trafficked and
 sold into forced labor on Ivorian plantations (see Section 6.c.).
 The Ministries of Health and and of Employment, Public Service and Social Secu-
 rity seek to safeguard the welfare of children, and the Government also has encour-
 aged the formation of NGO's such as the Abidjan Legal Center for the Defense of
 Cldren. In 1996 the Government announced a series of measures aimed at reduc-
 ing the population of street children. These steps include holding parents legally
 and financially responsible for their abandoned children and the development of
 training centers where children can learn a trade. However, no such centers have
 yet opened.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is a serious problem.
 Until December there was no law that specifically prohibited FGM, which was con-
 sidered illegal only as a violation of general laws prohibiting crimes against persons.
 However, the Law Concerning Crimes against Women enacted in December specifi-
 cally forbids FGM subject to criminal penalties of imprisonment for up to 5 years
 and a fine of from roughly $650 to $3,500 (360,000 to 2 million CFA francs); double
 penalties apply for medical practioners. FGM is practiced particularly among the
 rural population in the north and west. The procedure usually is performed on
 young girls or at puberty as part of a rite of passage; it is almost always done out-
 side modern medical facilities and techniques and hygiene do not meet modern med-
 ical standards. In August a young girl died in Seguela from complications after
 FGM. According to the World Health Organization, as many as 60 percent of women
 have undergone FGM.
 Women's advocacy organizations have sponsored campaigns against FGM, forced
 marriage and marriage of minors, patterns of inheritance that exclude women, and
 other practices considered harmful to women and girls. In 1997 the Ministry of the
 Family and Women's Affairs organized a seminar on FGM. In some areas tradi-
 tional authorities, who generally have upheld the practice, began to take part in
 public demonstrations against FGM.
 People With Disabilities.-Until recently there were no laws mandating accessibil-
 ity to buildings, transportation or other public services by the disabled. However,
 on October 30, the National Assembly enacted a law, sponsored by the President's
 wife, that requires the State to educate and train the disabled, to hire them or help
 them find jobs, to design houses and public facilities for wheelchair access, and to
 adapt machines, tools, and work spaces for access and use by the disabled. The law
 covers individuals with physical, mental, visual, auditory, and cerebral motor dis-
 abilities. Laws also exist that prohibit the abandonment of the mentally or phys-
 ically disabled and enjoin acts of violence directed at them. Traditional practices, be-
 
 
 118
 liefs, and superstitions vary, but infanticide in cases of serious birth disabilities is
 less common than in the past. Disabled adults are not specific targets of abuse, but
 they encounter serious difficulties in competing with able-bodied workers. The Gov-
 ernment supports special schools, associations, and artisans' cooperatives for the
 disabled, but crippled persons still beg on urban streets and in commercial zones.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The country's population of about 15 million
 is ethnically diverse. The citizenry-which excludes the large noncitizen part of the
 population-is made up of five major families of ethnic groups. The  kan family
 made up more than 40 percent of the citizenry, according to the 1988 census; the
 largest Akan ethnic group, alargest argest ethnic group in the country, was the
 Baoule, to which perhaps one-fourth of all citizens belong. About 25 percent of citi-
 zens belong to the Mande family, of which the Malinke are the largest group. About
 15 percent of citizens belong to the Krou family, of which the Bet are the largest
 group. Slightly more than 15 percent also belong to the Voltaic family, of which the
 Senoufou are the largest group. Major ethnic groups generally have their own pri-
 mary languages and their non-urban populations tend to be concentrated regionally.
 However, between one-fifth and one-third of the population are Africans, mostly
 from poorer neighboring countries such as Mali and Burkina Faso, who may not
 claim citizenship legally. Birth on Ivorian national territory does not confer citizen-
 ship. The ethnic composition of the whole population including these non-citizens is
 quite different from that of the citizenry alone.
 Societal discrimination on the basis of ethnicity is sometimes practiced by mem-
 bers of all ethnic groups. Urban neighborhoods still have readily identifiable ethnic
 characteristics, and major political parties tend to have readily identifiable ethnic
 and regional bases, although interethnic marriage is increasingly common in urban
 areas.
 Some ethnic groups include many noncitizens, and their share of the electorate
 would be increased by enfranchising noncitizens. Other ethnic groups-such as the
 Baoule-include few noncitizens, and their share of the electorate would be de-
 creased by enfranchising non-citizens. There are societal and political tensions be-
 tween these two sets of ethnic groups. This cleavage corresponds to some extent to
 regional differences; ethnic groups that include many noncitizens are found chiefly
 in the north. Members of northern ethnic groups that are found in neighboring
 countries as well as in Cote d'Ivoire are often required to document their citizen-
 ship, whereas members of ethnic groups seldom found in other countries, including
 the Baoule, reportedly do not have this problem. Police routinely abuse and harass
 non-citizen Africans residing in the country. Official harassment reflects the fre-
 quently encountered conviction that foreigners are responsible for high local crime
 rates, as well as concern for Ivorian national identity.
 Election law changes in 1994 limited presidential candidates to those who could
 prove that both parents had been born in Cote d'Ivoire. This restriction was incor-
 porated into the Constitution in June. In July the Government tripled the cost of
 the residence permits that noncitizens whom the Government regards as nationals
 of other West African countries are required to carry, while greatly reducing the
 cost of national identification cards for citizens. This discriminatory law tended to
 perpetuate the political disenfranchisement of noncitizens by making it harder for
 them to become citizens. It also tended to entrench the electoral power of ethnic
 groups, such as the Baoule, that include relatively few noncitizens.
 Differences between members of the Baoule group and other ethnic groups, espe-
 cially the Bete, are a major source of political tensions and have repeatedly erupted
 into violence, most recently in 1997. Many members of the Baoule group, which has
 long inhabited the east-central region, have settled in towns and on previously
 uncultivated land in other areas, especially in more westerly regions. In the past,
 the Government generally has viewed use of land as conferring de facto ownership
 of land. However, in December, the National Assembly enacted a new Land Use
 Law that establishes that land title does not transfer from the traditional owner to
 the user simply by virtue of use.
 Members of the Baoule ethnic group dominate the ruling PDCI party, and are
 widely believed to hold disproportionate numbers of positions in the public sector,
 including the security forces, the civil service, and state-owned businesses (see Sec-
 tion 3). In September, a non-Baoule army officer complained publicly, in a letter
 published by a private newspaper, about ethnic discrimination against non-Baoules
 in the armed forces; he was reprimanded by the Ministry of Defense. Security forces
 were accused of favoring Baoules in 1997 violence between members of the Baoule
 and Guere ethnic groups.
 In May the Government ordered the Dozos, a traditional group of hunters from
 the north and northwest regions, to cease activities "outside the geographic and cul-
 tural sphere of their origin," and to surrender any modern weapons. Some reports
 
 
 pointed out that the Government's order came shortly after Dozos, some of whom
 ong had served as bodyguards for ruling party politicians, began to perform secu-
 rity functions for opposition party leaders and rallies. However, government and
 Dozo spokespersons indicated that the Government's order responded to infiltration
 of the Dozos by "false Dozos" who had begun to use excessive force in their private
 security roles.
 In July members of the Agni ethnic group burned villages of descendants of Bozo
 immigrants in a fishing rights dispute and drove many Bozos back to their ancestral
 areas in Mali.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides workers with the right to form
 unions. Registration of a new union requires 3 months. For almost 30 years, the
 government-sponsored labor confederation, the General Union of Workers of Cote
 d'Ivoire (UGTCI), dominated most union activity. The UGTCI's hold on the labor
 movement loosened in 1991 when several formerly UGTCI-affiliated unions broke
 away and became independent. In 1992 11 formerly independent unions joined to-
 gether to form the Federation of Autonomous Trade Unions of Cote d'Ivoire. There
 are now also two other registered labor federations not affiliated with the Govern-
 ment.
 Although unions are legally free to leave the UGTCI and join another federation,
 in practice their choice is restricted by anti-competitive official discrimination in
 favor of the government-affiliated UGTCI. On September 26, after a 3-year stuggle
 and thanks to intervention by the International Labor Organization, labor inspec-
 tors were obliged to organize an election of union delegates at the Sip Cata company
 in San Pedro, and to allow Dignite, an independent federation affiliated with a
 major opposition party, to compete with the UGTCI. Dignite's candidates won the
 election, and the union switched its affiliation to Dignite.
 The right to strike is provided by the Constitution and by statute. The Labor Code
 requires a protracted series of negotiations and a 6-day notification period before a
 strike may take place, effectively making legal strikes difficult to organize. The
 UGTCI seldom calls strikes, but it is in disagreement with the Government's plan
 to promote only 5 percent of civil servants, following an 18-year blockage of pro-
 motion for all civil servants. Non-UGTCI unions called strikes, although not so fre-
 quently as in the past. In September taxi drivers in Abidjan struck to protest the
 killing of a taxi driver by a policeman (see Section L.a.).
 Thirteen employees of the government broadcast media company, RTI, who had
 participated in April 1997 in a strike that reportedly caused an interruption of RTI
 broadcasting, were tried in November and December on charges, fied in May 1997,
 of disturbing public order, willful destruction of public property, and interfering
 with public services. They had been detained for 3 months in 1997. The judge had
 reached no verdict by year's end.
 Unions are free to join international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code grants all
 citizens, except members of the police and military, the rights to join unions and
 to bargain collectively. Collective bargaining agreements are in effect in many major
 business enterprises and sectors of the civil service. In most cases in which wages
 are not established in direct negotiations between unions and employers, salaries
 are set by job categories by the Ministry of Employment and Civil Service. Labor
 inspectors have the responsibility to enforce a law that prohibits antiunion discrimi-
 nation. There have been no known prosecutions or convictions under this law.
 There were no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law;
 however, the International Labor Organization's Committee of Experts in its 1993
 annual report questioned a decree that places certain categories of prisoners at the
 disposal of private enterprises for work assignments without their apparent consent.
 There has been no change in this decree.
 The law prohibits forced and bonded child labor; however, the Government does
 not enforce that prohibition effectively In September a private Abidjan daily news-
 paper exposed the widespread practice of importing and indenturing of Malian boys
 for field work on Ivorian plantations under abusive conditions. For example, chil-
 dren recruited by Malians in the border town of Skiasso were promised easy and
 lucrative jobs in Cote D'Ivoire, transported across the border, andthen sold to other
 Malians who dispersed them throughout the plantations of the central region. These
 children were forced to work 12-hour days in the fields and were locked at night
 in crowded sheds, with their clothing confiscated. The Governments of Mali and
 Cote D'Ivoire confirmed the reports. The Government of Mali took steps to halt this
 trafficking and repatriate the children to Mali. By year's end, about 100 children
 
 
 from Mali had been returned to their families. The Government of Mali arrested five
 persons in Sikasso who were responsible for trafficking.
 The extent of this practice was difficult to estimate, because many Malian adults
 also worked on Ivorian plantations in the same area under difficult conditions. Mali
 was not the only source of forced child labor used in the country. In March police
 in Togo arrested four Beninese traffickers taking 22 Beninese children to Cote
 D'Ivoire by way of Togo.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-In most
 instances, the legal minimum working age is 16. However, the Ministry of Employ-
 ment and Civil Service enforces this provision effectively only in the civil service
 and in large multinational companies. Labor law limits the hours of young workers,
 defined as those under the age of 18. However, children often work on family farms,
 and some children routinely act as vendors, shoe shiners, errand boys, car watchers,
 and washers of car windows in the informal sector in cities. There are reliable re-
 ports of some use of child labor in informal-sector mining and also of children work-
 ing in "sweatshop" conditions in small workshops. Primary education is mandatory
 but far from universally enforced, particularly in rural areas. Many children leave
 the formal school system when they are between the ages of 12 and 14, having
 failed secondary school entrance exams.
 Although the Government prohibits forced and bonded child labor, it does not en-
 force this prohibition effectively. There was widespread abuse of foreign children for
 forced labor on agricultural plantations (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government administratively determines
 monthly minimum wage rates, which were last adjusted in 1996. A slightly higher
 minimum wage rate applies for construction workers. The Government enforces the
 minimum wage rates only for salaried workers employed by the Government or reg-
 istered with the social security office. Minimum wages vary according to occupation,
 with the lowest set at approximately $67.90 (36,607 CFA Francs) per month, which
 is insufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The
 majority of the labor force works in agriculture or in the informal sector where the
 minimum wage does not apply.
 Through the Ministry of Employment and the Civil Service, the Government en-
 forces a comprehensive Labor Code that governs the terms and conditions of service
 for wage earners and salaried workers and provides for occupational safety and
 health standards. Those employed in the formal sector generally are protected
 against unjust compensation, excessive hours, and arbitrary discharge from employ-
 ment. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. The law requires overtime payment
 on a graduated scale for additional hours. The Labor Code provides for at least one
 24-hour rest period per week.
 Government labor inspectors can order employers to improve substandard condi-
 tions, and a labor court can levy fines if the employer fails to comply with the Labor
 Code. However, in the large informal sector of the economy involving both urban
 and rural workers, the Government's occupational health and safety regulations are
 enforced erratically, if at all. Workers in the formal sector have the right, under the
 Labor Code, to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy
 to continued employment by utilizing the Ministry of Labor's inspection system to
 document dangerous working conditions. However, workers in the informal sector
 ordinarily cannot remove themselves from such labor without risking the loss of
