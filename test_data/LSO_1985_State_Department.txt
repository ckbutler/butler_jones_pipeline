 LESOTHO
 Lesotho is nominally a constitutional monarchy under King
 Moshoeshoe II, but in fact almost all political power is held
 by Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan and his ruling Basotho
 National Party (BNP). In 1970, Jonathan suspended the
 Constitution, which provided for parliamentary democracy, and
 declared the results of that year's election null and void.
 The Government contended that traditional democratic practices
 were preserved in the ensuing period through the holding of
 public meetings known as "pitsos," but dissent is rarely aired
 at these government-orchestrated gatherings. In 1985 Lesotho
 scheduled its first elections in 15 years. Although a number
 of opposition parties had indicated their intent to field
 candidates, in the end they did not participate, alleging
 general intimidation of opposition leaders and supporters, and
 electoral malpractices. Only Jonathan's BNP candidates
 fulfilled the requirements for election to the National
 Assembly. The BNP candidates, in accordance with Lesotho law,
 were then declared elected (unopposed) on September 17, 1985.
 Sporadic violence occurred during 1985, partly as a result of
 clashes between the security forces and groups opposed to the
 South African regime, and partly in connection with political
 opposition to the regime. The Government cited trouble with
 the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan-African
 Congress (PAC), but especially the threat of and occasional
 attacks by the outlawed Lesotho Liberation Army (an offshoot
 of the opposition Basutoland Congress Party) as justification
 for the recent strengthening of security laws. The heightened
 security posture and undisciplined and poorly trained police
 and military forces contributed to human rights abuses. There
 are unsubstantiated reports that a "death squad" operates
 within the Lesotho Paramilitary Force (the army), with the aim
 of eliminating political opponents of the regime. Death
 threats have been recorded against both supporters and
 opponents of the regime. Some elements of the Basotho Youth
 League, an arm of the ruling BNP, have weapons and intimidate
 political opponents.
 Lesotho is a developing country with a free market economy
 based primarily on subsistence agriculture. The economy is
 highly dependent on remittances by Lesotho citizens engaged in
 migrant labor in South Africa; these remittances amount to
 almost 50 percent of Lesotho's gross national product. The
 Government is likewise dependent on revenue generated by the
 South African Customs Union, which accounts for some 70 percent
 of government revenue. The economy rebounded somewhat in 1985
 after several years of poor performance, caused partly by the
 lingering drought in the southern Africa region.
 The Human Rights Act of 1983, technically guaranteeing many
 fundamental human rights, came into force in July 1984.
 However, the Act is subordinate to the provisions of existing
 law which include temporary detention without trial and other
 restrictions on human rights. The Parliament passed a new
 internal security bill in 1984 which codifies existing security
 laws, removes bail in cases of armed robbery, increases minimum
 sentences for certain security offenses, and allows for the
 detention of witnesses in security cases. While the courts
 have not hesitated to rule against the Government in security
 cases, potential for mistreatment of prisoners prior to trial
 remains high. Mistreatment of those detained for purely
 criminal offenses also occurs.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Sporadic incidents of violence occurred throughout 1985 on
 several fronts. Several clashes took place between Lesotho
 security forces and members of the African National Congress
 (ANC) and the Pan-African Congress (PAC). The latter groups
 are dedicated to the overthrow of the South African Government,
 and some members of the groups have taken refuge in Lesotho.
 Events in late 1985 suggested that the outlawed Lesotho
 Liberation Army (LLA) is stepping up terrorist activities in
 Lesotho. Several deaths also occurred during the 1985 election
 campaign.
 In March, six members of the PAC were killed by a Lesotho
 security patrol near the South African border. Shortly
 thereafter, a member of the Lesotho paramilitary force (LPF)
 was killed by an ANC member, and the house of an ANC member
 was attacked in Maseru. In May, an explosion took the life of
 a South African refugee at his house in Maseru. The victim
 was believed to belong to the ANC and may have accidentally
 blown himself up while making a bomb.
 In August, the Government announced that the LLA had launched
 an attack on the home of a BNP Parliamentary candidate, killing
 four women and two children. The Government protested this
 attack strongly to the Government of South Africa, which had
 previously permitted an opposition spokesman to use the South
 African broadcasting system to threaten violent attacks against
 Lesotho. An elderly member of the ruling BNP. who was
 expected to run for a seat in Parliament, was killed and his
 daughter wounded in an attack on his home outside Maseru.
 That incident remains under investigation, but to date there
 is no indication of the responsible parties.
 On October 6, mortar rounds were fired into the west end of
 the capital of Maseru, allegedly from South African territory.
 There were no casualties. Shortly thereafter, the Government
 reported that its security forces had captured a South
 African-trained terrorist and killed two more. On October 23,
 six women died in a blaze set by armed men. A neighbor who
 came to investigate was also shot to death. At least two of
 the women had previous ties with progovernment groups. On
 November 1, a Maseru-dateline radio broadcast reported that
 three BNP supporters, a chief and his wife and child, were
 killed in an LLA raid that was launched from South Africa.
 Finally, on December 9 Prime Minister Jonathan blamed the LLA
 for the murder of seven Basotho the previous week; he said the
 terrorists were seen crossing back into South Africa.
 In most of these incidents, the Lesotho Government protests
 vehemently to Pretoria, alleging that the South African
 Government knows of these specific attacks beforehand and that
 South Africa generally provides training, refuge, and support
 to the LLA insurgents. South Africa denies the charges that
 it is involved in the incidents and countercharges that
 Lesotho harbors groups which perpetrate violence against South
 Africa. In December, South Africa increased its warnings
 about ANC presence and activities in Lesotho. On the night of
 December 19, nine persons, including South African refugees
 whom the ANC claimed as its members, were assassinated in
 
 
 169
 Maseru. The Lesotho Government blamed South Africa for the
 killings, but that Government denied any responsibility.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Allegations of beatings by police and military personnel
 continue to be reported but are difficult to document.
 According to Amnesty International's 1985 Report, at least one
 state witness in a 1984 trial reportedly testified that he had
 been blindfolded and severely beaten by police until he
 "confessed" to membership in the LLA. Such abuse generally
 takes place during the arrest and interrogation phases, and it
 appears to extend to cases related to national security as well
 as to common crimes. Detention facilities are very poor. In
 view of Lesotho's limited resources, it is unlikely that any
 major improvements can be expected. Prisoners who can afford
 lawyers (and are thus more likely to file lawsuits charging
 abuses) usually receive better treatment. In late 1984, the
 high court awarded about $5,500 in compensation to a chief who
 sued the Government for illegal arrest, detention, and torture
 at the hands of the police in November 1982, illustrating that
 civil remedies are possible for those complaining of human
 rights abuses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Habeas corpus applies to all arrests except those involving
 persons detained under the Internal Security (General) Act of
 1982. This Act provides for preventive detention without
 charge or trial for up to 42 days and for holding detainees
 incommunicado for part of that time. During the second stage
 of the detention, ministerially appointed "advisors"--thus far
 all employees of the Government--report on the health of the
 detainee, investigate whether the detainee has been involved
 in subversive activities, and advise the Minister on the need
 for continued detention. Detainees may make representations
 on their own treatment only through the advisors. The Internal
 Security (General) Act, as amended in 1984, disallows bail in
 cases of armed robbery and allows for detention of witnesses
 in security cases.
 In 1985, observers indicated that there might be as many as
 100 to 200 persons in custody of one sort or another as a
 result of alleged political crimes. At least one political
 detainee, Daniel Moeketsi, died in detention in 1984 according
 to Amnesty International.
 There is no forced labor practiced in Lesotho.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary in Lesotho is independent and has acted to limit
 police and military infringements of law and procedure on a
 number of occasions (see example in 1c). However, the
 Government abruptly notified the Chief Justice, a man known
 for his efforts on behalf of justice and civil rights, that
 his recently renewed contract would instead be terminated as
 of April 1986. Court decisions and rulings are respected and
 obeyed by the authorities. Accused persons have the right to
 counsel. Civil suits alleging maltreatment are accepted and
 
 
 170
 LESOTHO
 adjudicated. Verdicts of Civil Courts may be appealed to the
 High Court. In military cases, decisions may be appealed to
 more senior officers, including the Lesotho army commander,
 but not to civilian courts. Under the system of Roman-Dutch
 law applied in Lesotho, there is no trial by jury.
 Traditional courts do exist, largely in rural areas, but their
 influence is declining, and they generally handle only family
 disputes and cases of violation of custom.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 These rights are generally respected in Lesotho, although
 under the Internal Security Acts of 1982 and 1984 the police
 have wide powers to stop and search and to enter homes or
 other places without a warrant. There have been credible
 allegations of forced entry into the home, but these are quite
 likely the result of indiscipline.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Human Rights Act of 1983 provides for freedom of expression
 but subordinates this freedom to the protection of national
 security. In practice, opposition viewpoints are expressed
 freely only in two Lesotho-language weekly newspapers published
 by the Roman Catholic and Evangelical churches. In 1984,
 criticism centered on the delay in elections, intimidation of
 opposition candidates, the Government's format for elections,
 and the tardy announcement of the voter registration lists.
 This criticism has been tolerated but, at the same time,
 attacked strongly by Lesotho's sole radio station which is
 government-owned and also by a government-published weekly
 newspaper. The Government has also rebutted articles and
 viewpoints on Lesotho in the South African media which are
 widely available in Lesotho. A private daily, The Nation,
 which was temporarily a vehicle for a variety of political
 opinions, closed for lack of financial backing after printing
 46 issues. As elections approached, Radio Lesotho sharply
 stepped up its attacks on opposition parties and politicians,
 depicting them variously as irrelevant groups lacking support,
 political has-beens, or agents of the South African Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Opposition political parties (with the exception of the
 Communist Party) are permitted, and two new parties were
 established in 1985. Permits are required for public and
 private meetings. Groups wishing to hold political rallies or
 organized sessions sometimes encounter difficulties in the
 form of denial or delays in the issuance of permits or of
 investigatory arrests of attendees. Police are normally in
 attendance at such meetings. During the electoral campaign in
 1985, opposition parties complained of harassment and threats,
 particularly from the newly formed National Youth Service,
 which serves as a police auxilliary, and from the Basotho
 Youth League, an arm of the ruling BNP. These groups are
 widely reported to be armed.
 All trade unions in Lesotho enjoy the right to organize,
 bargain collectively, and strike. However, trade unionism has
 played a relatively minor role in society, largely because of
 the small size of the modern manufacturing, retail, and
 
 
 LESOTHO
 service sectors. In 1984, the Government intervened to help
 form a single trade union confederation after negotiations for
 the merger of the two existing confederations broke down.
 Although there is still some opposition to the new
 confederation, named the Lesotho Congress of Free Trade Unions
 (LCFTU), 24 of Lesotho's 28 trade unions participated in the
 LCFTU's first convention in May 1985 and elected the existing
 leadership to 3-year terms. The LCFTU has rewritten Lesotho's
 badly outdated labor laws and expects to submit to Parliament
 later this year the draft agreed to by the Employers'
 Federation and the Government.
 Union, government, and employer representatives have
 participated in delegations to the International Labor
 Organization and other foreign trade union organizations.
 Lesotho has hosted meetings of the labor arm of the Southern
 African Development Coordinating Conference and the
 international mineworkers. The LCFTU is a member of the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, as well as
 of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Lesotho. Free and open religious
 practice is permitted. Christianity is the dominant faith of
 the majority of Basotho, with the principal denomination being
 Roman Catholic. There is a significant Protestant minority as
 well, which is composed of the Lesotho Evangelical Church
 (Presbyterian), the Anglican Church, and a wide variety of
 other denominations. Conversion is permitted, and there is no
 indication that there is any social or political benefit
 attached to belonging to any particular sect.
 The Government has been critical of church groups and leaders,
 accusing them of conspiring with opposition political factions
 which support violence, and has harassed prayer meetings
 calling for national reconciliation. Prominent church leaders
 have been among those who have received death threats.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the country is not restricted, although the
 police and the military sometimes set up temporary roadblocks
 to check insurgent activity. There is no legal restraint on
 emigration, but overseas travel is made more difficult by the
 sizable repatriation deposit required of passport applicants.
 Many citizens of Lesotho perform migrant labor in South
 Africa's mining and other industries.
 Several thousand refugees from South Africa reside in Lesotho.
 They are generally free to move about the country although the
 Government imposes restrictions on their political activities
 as a condition of entry. Until recently, government policy
 has been to integrate refugees into the mainstream of Lesotho
 society to the extent possible. However, since the South
 African raid against refugees in Maseru in 1982, and in light
 of continuing pressure from South Africa, Lesotho has, in
 practice, become primarily a country of transit for refugees.
 Although Lesotho is a signatory of the U.N. Protocol Relating
 to the Status of Refugees, refugees who leave Lesotho on U.N.
 travel documents issued by Lesotho are sometimes not granted
 the right to return. A number of political exiles from
 Lesotho are resident in neighboring countries, notably Botswana
 and South Africa. The 1980 Amnesty Act allows political
 
 
 172
 LESOTHO
 exiles to return after signing statements concerning any
 criminal acts they may have committed, but few have done so.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 Prime Minister Jonathan and the leadership of his Basotho
 National Party have ruled Lesotho since 1965, and, after
 voiding the results of the first postindependence elections in
 1970, did not permit new elections until 1985-15 years later.
 The 1985 elections were marked by a series of opposition
 complaints, first over electoral procedures, and then over
 allegations of harassment at meetings and rallies and over
 death threats to some leaders. The leader of the Marematlo
 Freedom Party filed an urgent petition with the High Court
 requesting a ruling to delay the election date, but the suit
 was dismissed on August 13. As a result, all the opposition
 parties agreed not to participate in the election. On
 nomination day, the candidates of the ruling BNP from each of
 the 60 constituencies were unopposed and were therefore
 declared elected on September 17, 1985. In view of the
 opposition boycott of the elections, it has been difficult to
 assess the true level of support for any of Lesotho's
 political parties. The leaders of 4 of the opposition parties
 were among a list of 20 persons nominated by the King to be
 members of the National Assembly, but according to a recent
 report, all 4 had declined.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In past years, representatives of Amnesty International who
 have visited Lesotho to investigate human rights conditions
 have met with government officials and have been given access
 to some security detainees who complained of abusive
 treatment. In general, the Government has attributed alleged
 human rights violations to an excess of zeal or indiscipline
 by low-level police or military officials. The Government
 maintains that any abuses are not sanctioned by government
 policy and has pointed out that judicial remedies for alleged
 abuses are available in the courts. As indicated in its 1985
 Report, Amnesty International remains concerned about
 detention without trial of suspected opponents of the
 Government and about deaths of prisoners while in custody. In
 1985, Amnesty International brought to the attention of the
 Government of Lesotho reports it had received that death
 threats had been made against 14 named Basotho. As reported
 over Radio Lesotho, the Government said it was not
 knowledgeable about such threats but condemned such action and
 promised to punish the guilty parties if they are found.
 Freedom House rated Lesotho "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Lesotho's population is estimated at 1,512,000, with an annual
 growth rate of 2.6 per cent. Designated by the United Nations
 as "one of the least developed countries," Lesotho had a per
 capita gross national product of $460 in 1983. Lesotho's
 economic plight is complicated by its lack of natural
 resources, its mountainous terrain, and low rainfall.
 Development of water resources, including potential
 hydropower, appears the best long-term prospect for economic
 development.
 
 
 173
 LESOTHO
 Lesotho's economy is closely tied to South Africa's economy.
 Remittances from migrant workers in the Republic of South
 Africa are of crucial importance since over 90 percent of the
 country's imports come from South Africa. Lesotho is a member
 of the Customs Union Agreement between the Governments of
 Lesotho, Botswana, South Africa, and Swaziland, and is a
 member of the Rand Monetary Area. Customs Union receipts in
 recent years have averaged about 70 percent of total
 government revenues. These funds, coupled with donor support
 programs, have managed to prop up a weak economy. Only about
 10 percent of the labor force in Lesotho is employed outside
 traditional agriculture. The prospect of better paying jobs
 has attracted the best of the Lesotho labor force to South
 Africa, including the homelands, at the expense of local
 development.
 Life expectancy was estimated at 54 years in 1985, and the
 infant mortality rate was 98 per 1,000 live births.
 Nutritional standards are barely adequate, with the ratio of
 caloric supply available for consumption to nutritional
 requirements estimated in 1977 to be 102 percent. Drought
 conditions over the last few years, however, have hit some
 areas hard, and cases of malnutrition have been reported. In
 1975, only 17 per cent of the population was estimated to have
 access to safe water. A severe water shortage in the capital
 city in late 1985 caused a major setback in efforts by the
 Government and international donors to improve this situation.
 Lesotho has a long history of church-sponsored primary schools
 throughout the country, which have contributed to a
 comparatively high adult literacy rate, i.e., approximately 60
 percent. School enrollment in 1982 was 128 percent of the
 number of children in the primary age group--lb0 per cent for
 boys and 148 percent for girls. Church and government
 commitment to education is considerable, and despite a
 shortage of funds, universal education and improvement of
 educational quality is underway.
 The Employment Act of 1967 spells out basic workers' rights
 including a 45-hour workweek, a weekly rest period of at least
 24 hours, 12 days' paid leave per year, and pay for public
 holidays. Employers are required to provide adequate light,
 ventilation, and sanitary facilities for employees and to
 install and maintain machinery to minimize the risk of
 injury. Children under 14 years of age are prohibited from
 employment in anything other than family businesses. Children
 under 16 are not allowed to work in excess of 8 hours a day,
 and employers are prohibited from employing any child in
 hazardous conditions. The Government sets minimum wages for
 various types of work. In practice, these regulations are
 generally followed.
 All Basotho have fairly equal opportunities, although in the
 areas of property and contracts married women's rights are
 limited by law and custom. For example, a married woman
 cannot apply for a loan without her husbands' written
 consent. Women in Lesotho have traditionally been the
 stabilizing force in the home and in the agricultural sector,
 given the absence of over 100,000 Basotho men who work in
 South Africa. There are more female than male children who
 complete primary and secondary schools. Better use of women's
 talents and abilities will depend on their access to credit,
 changes in the land tenure laws, and cultural practices. The
 Government speaks of increasing women's rights but is doing
 little to actually upgrade the status of women in Lesotho.
