 MAURITANIA
 Mauritania is governed by the Military Committee for National
 Salvation, established in the wake of a bloodless 1978 coup
 which removed the civilian President, abolished the
 parliamentary system established at independence in 1960, and
 placed the administrative apparatus under military control.
 Colonel Maaouyia Sidi Ahmed Ould Taya, in his role as
 President of the Committee, is Chief of State. He assumed
 power after the peaceful ouster of the former President, Lt.
 Col. Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla, on December 12, 1984. All
 20 members of the Military Committee retain ministerial
 portfolios or occupy other key government posts. Most
 decisions are reached by consensus, ratified at weekly plenary
 sessions, and promulgated by decree in the name of the
 Committee. Prospects for an early return to civilian rule
 appear remote; the military remains the 'custodian of the
 nation's sovereignty.*
 The country faces daunting problems: drought, the Western
 Sahara conflict, racial tensions, slavery (officially
 abolished in 1980), and the 1980 Islamic legal code
 (Shari'a). The recent intensification of the 15-year drought
 has largely destroyed agricultural resources and the nomadic
 culture of the Maurs. The gradual disappearance of
 traditional cultural and religious centers has generated a
 sense of crisis, and the explosive growth of the refugee camps
 threatens the viability of the state. The development of
 social and legal institutions in Mauritania, and indeed the
 country's hope for the future, are hostage to this ecological
 and demographic calamity.
 In early 1984, public disturbances related to a controversial
 decision to recognize the Saharan Democratic Arab Republic led
 to confrontations between security forces and the
 demonstrators in several parts of the capital and at least one
 outlying city. Arrests and confinements were followed by
 accusations that the police had used excessive force and by
 charges that two of the detainees died of torture. The deaths
 did occur, but there is no evidence that they resulted from
 torture. This event, highly unusual in this traditional
 society, generated a strong negative reaction in the general
 populace, as well as in the Government and the Military
 Committee. Government allegations of foreign involvement led
 to the expulsion of all Libyan diplomats and teachers.
 The larger application of individual rights as articulated in
 the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Man confronts
 well-entrenched traditions in a country which was lightly
 touched by the European colonial experience. Limited
 opportunities for females to participate in political life,
 barriers to social mobility, and difficulties of access to
 employment imposed by traditional tribal family connections
 remain basic issues. Most serious of all are the remnants of
 slavery, which has survived three attempts at abolition, and
 Arabization issues concerning the law and schools. Maurs and
 blacks have clashed, sometimes violently, over such issues.
 Assemblies devoted to public discussion other than those under
 government sponsorship are forbidden. The media are tightly
 controlled and opposition groups are banned. The 'Structure
 for the Education of the Masses," advertised as an indigenous
 and peaceful revolution free from all imported ideological
 systems, has led to discussion groups and self-help committees
 in most larger communities. Former President Haidalla
 
 
 214
 MAURITANIA
 encouraged the Structure as a vehicle for the articulation of
 popular grievances, for undertaking civic action projects, and
 for finding local ways to combat desertification.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no reports in 1984 of politically motivated
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of politically inspired disappearances
 during 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Mauritanian law prohibits the use of torture, and there is no
 evidence that it was practiced in 1984, although there were
 charges that two deaths resulted from torture. There is no
 record of summary executions or of degrading treatment of
 prisoners. Public flogging is still occasionally staged.
 Although the Government remains opposed to slavery and has
 established a commission to implement abolition decrees,
 forced labor practices still exist. The United Nations
 Subcommission on Human Rights visited Mauritania in early
 1984. Its report recognized both the continued, limited
 existence of the practice and the serious, though not very
 effective, efforts of the Government to stamp it out. Thus
 Mauritania's 1980 Declaration of the Abolition of Slavery can
 be said to represent a statement of intent, but it is not
 possible as yet to measure the extent of its effect on the
 residual slavery that still exists. The institution persists
 largely in southern Mauritania, where it originated in
 conflicts between nomadic Maurs and settled blacks, even
 though outlawed by French colonial administrators and
 proscribed in the Constitution promulgated at independence in
 1960. Slavery in Mauritania is not identifiable with chattel
 servitude of the American historical experience. There is no
 well-developed market for slaves, and the large class of
 descendants of slaves and freed slaves is regulated by complex
 social obligations. Many freed slaves still give part of
 their wages to their former masters, many of whom provide food
 and clothing and sometimes guarantee employment for the former
 slaves.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Mauritanian law guarantees expeditious arraignment and trial,
 access to legal counsel, and right of appeal. An exception,
 based on legislation enacted before the 1978 coup, is the
 prerogative to detain, without trial or appeal, anyone judged
 to be a threat to national security. Detainees are usually
 confined to their residences, but prisons for the more serious
 cases exist in both Nouakchott and Jereida (maximum security).
 Before his ouster, former President Haidalla on November 20,
 1984, released on bail 6 political prisoners, including the
 
 
 215
 MAURITANIA
 former heads of the national labor union and the student
 union. The new regime of President Taya released 32 political
 prisoners on December 17 and an additional 133 detainees on
 December 19. Those released included a former Prime Minister
 and well-known opponents of the former regime, including
 prisoners named by Amnesty International as "prisoners of
 conscience' or those who were subjects of Amnesty
 International interest. On December 21, the Government
 declared a general amnesty for 69 persons convicted of
 political crimes living in Mauritania or abroad. The amnesty
 was coupled with an invitation to all Mauritanians in exile to
 return home to participate in a program of national revival.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 An inadequate and under-financed judicial system results in
 suspects being held for long periods before trial. The
 Shari'a Islamic code, as instituted in Mauritania in 1980,
 covers adultery, personal theft, and murder. A Muslim judge
 presides over a jury chosen by the governor of the region.
 The defendant has a right to counsel and can appeal a guilty
 verdict to the Supreme Islamic Court within 15 days.
 Circumstantial evidence cannot be admitted as proof of guilt.
 Admission of guilt is sometimes obtained in the context of a
 promised reduction in punishment. An inability to convince
 the sitting magistrate that the Government's charges are in
 error in itself is considered by the courts as a legal
 admission of guilt, as is the convincing testimony of a
 first-hand witness or co-defendant. Extended confinement is
 sometimes used to encourage self-incrimination. All sentences
 must be approved by the President. Opposition to the Shari'a
 code has been expressed by certain blacks and women, who
 believe that the Shari'a code favors the Maur way of life and
 limits the role of women.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Government interference in private affairs, save in instances
 where treason is suspected, is limited. Reflecting the
 nomadic penchant for privacy and the sanctity of confidences,
 a lack of sophisticated equipment to undertake surveillance,
 and the isolation of various parts of the country from one
 another, the Government limits its surveillance to patrols on
 major highways, occasional night-time inspection of vehicular
 traffic, and inspection of mail suspected of containing
 currency or prohibited items. Indeed, the Government is often
 ignorant of information required for the protection of the
 public welfare, because lines of communication run more
 readily along family lines than through a bureaucratic chain
 of command. Association with foreigners and the expression of
 opinion is not discouraged, although most Mauritanians are
 careful not to propagate patently seditious opinions.
 Shortwave broadcasts and Senegalese television are followed
 openly. Videotapes on a wide variety of subjects circulate
 freely in Nouakchott. The Government enforces strictly its
 prohibition of public meetings addressing political themes,
 and the single newspaper is totally controlled by the
 Government, but ideology is low-key.

 MAURITANIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is restricted. Mauritania's only
 newspaper, news agency, and radio/television station are
 government-operated. The Government does not permit criticism
 of its policies or authority, and editorial content of the
 media is controlled. International news magazines and
 newspapers generally circulate freely in Mauritania, even when
 they contain articles critical of the Government. However,
 public sale of certain magazines is prohibited.
 Privite dissent is lively, and family and clan networks act as
 vehicles for communicating complaints and airing dissent. The
 nomadic tradition also provides for candid expressions of
 concern to the leadership, and former President Haidalla often
 encountered frank and candid expressions of opinion on a wide
 variety of subjects when he toured the provinces. In
 practice, the Government appears to concern itself only with
 activities directly related to the destablization or overthrow
 of the military government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly has been suspended since 1978
 when the military assumed control of the country. Following
 the reorganization of the Military Committee in April 1979,
 and again after the March 16, 1981, coup attempt, curfews were
 imposed to discourage public gatherings. There were no
 curfews imposed in 1984, but the aftermath of the spring
 disorders sharply reduced vehicular and pedestrian traffic in
 the late evening almost automatically.
 Labor unions were the only political organizations not
 dissolved after the 1978 military coup. All union activities
 are supervised by the Union of Mauritanian Workers, a
 governmental organization attached to the Ministry of
 Employment and Training. Unions are recognized only when they
 register with the official body and accept an appointed
 director general. Local union officials state there are
 approximately 26,000 members now. Union membership is not
 universal; workers must pay an annual membership fee of $4.00
 but the Government indirectly finances most union activities.
 The right to strike exists in theory, but an extended strike
 would probably be strongly opposed by the Government. A
 demonstration did take place early in 1984, allegedly as the
 result of black discontent with Maur domination of the Union.
 The police used tear gas to break it up, but no known arrests
 occurred.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion of Mauritania; the country's
 official name is the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.
 Virtually all citizens are Muslim. Proselytism and the
 construction of churches and other non-Islamic houses of
 worship are prohibited without express government permission,
 which has been granted in several instances, however, to
 MaUtitania's small Roman Catholic community. Several Catholic
 churches operate freely. There are no restrictions on
 personal religious expression, but in 1982 some members of the
 Bahai faith were threatened with expulsion for alleged
 
 
 217
 MAURITANIA
 proselytizing activities. There were no such reports in
 1984. There is no religious discrimination in employment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country,
 although travelers are frequently subjected to routine police
 checks. Mauritanians must obtain an exit visa to travel
 abroad, but there are no barriers to emigration or
 repatriation. A few Mauritanian officials have left the
 country because of political opposition to the Government.
 The Western Sahara conflict has led to a small immigration of
 refugees from the war into Nouadhibou and other northern
 towns, but there are no political refugees in Mauritania.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The right of citizens to change their government has not
 existed since 1978 when the military abolished Mauritania's
 only political party. At the present time there are no
 elected representatives and opposition groups are not
 tolerated. As illustrated by the December 12, 1984 ouster of
 former President Haidalla, changes in leadership come strictly
 from within the military.
 In 1980, a civilian prime minister was appointed and a draft
 constitution was published providing for a democratic
 multiparty system, but progress toward democratization ceased
 following the late 1980 discovery of an alleged Libyan-inspired
 plot to take over the Government and merge Mauritania and
 Libya into a single state, and the March 1981 attempted coup.
 A military prime minister replaced the civilian incumbent and
 efforts to restore constitutional rule were suspended. In
 1984 the Government attempted to encourage public participation
 in community activities as the Structure for Education of the
 Masses became better established. The movement has emphasized
 decentralization of the Government decisionmaking process and
 expanded scope for local initiative. It is also intended to
 reduce tribal and ethnic antagonism and to parry threats posed
 by foreign ideologies. To date the principal focus has been
 on raising popular awareness of the danger posed by the
 drought, but citizens have used the Structure as a vehicle to
 criticize certain government policies and officials.
 The black population is represented at all levels of
 government, but in numbers far less than its proportion of the
 total population. Many blacks claim that the Maurs are
 substantially overrepresented in the Government and religious
 institutions, since blacks believe they constitute a majority
 of the population. The Government insists, however, that a
 substantial majority of Mauritanians are Maurs. A sizable
 segment of the black population (blacks whose mother tongue is
 Hassaniyya Arabic) is considered by the Government, and
 considers itself, to be Maurs.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Haidalla regime was aware of the continuing Amnesty
 International concerns over a number of human rights issues,
 but considered that the majority of the specific charges were
 
 
 218
 MAURITANIA
 based on misinformation. Nonetheless, the attention paid to
 these issues by the foreign press and foreign governments made
 the Government conscious of the potential cost of violations,
 and highly sensitive to criticism.
 In August 1981, the U.N. Human Rights Subcommission's Working
 Group on Slavery heard a report from the London-based
 Anti-Slavery Society on slavery in Mauritania. The report
 accused the Mauritanian Government of taking no action to
 abolish slavery beyond the 1980 edict declaring it illegal.
 The Government regarded the report as misleading and invited
 the Subcommission to send an expert to Mauritania, which it
 did in early 1984. The expert's preliminary conclusions
 included recognition of the Government's efforts to eliminate
 the "vestiges" of slavery, but noted that these vestiges
 continue to carry considerable weight in Mauritania.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Mauritania's economy, always marginal, has been subject to
 drought for more than a decade, which has intensified in the
 last two years, decimating the livestock and reducing
 indigenous food production to less than 10 percent of the.
 national requirements. Mineral exports, which account for 85
 percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings, have been
 hindered by poor planning, increasing debt, and logistical
 problems. Investment in new iron ore mines undertaken since
 1978 may extend the life of known deposits beyond the year
 2000, but only more buoyant world prices are likely to reduce
 the enormous debt burden incurred. Drought and high import
 prices for food and energy have reduced the monetary reserves
 to a low level. The lack of rain, coupled with the war in the
 Western Sahara, contributed to a rapid population shift to
 urban areas. Nouakchott, a new city built to accommodate
 30,000 inhabitants, now contains a population estimated at
 over 400,000, out of a total national population of
 1,623,000. Elemental needs in hygiene, education, social
 services, employment, and economic development far exceed what
 the Government can provide.
 Small business enterprises are an important part of
 Mauritania's economy; food stands and shops flourish in the
 towns. The Government dominates large-scale industry,
 however, and nearly all major services and utilities are run
 by state-owned firms. These firms offer entrepreneurial
 opportunities to Mauritanians who possess capital to invest;
 but only limited employment opportunities for poor, unskilled
 Mauritanians. Just as Maurs tend to predominate in senior
 government positions, they appear to enjoy favored access to
 senior positions in the state-owned sector.
 In the rural sector, a small population scattered over a vast
 landscape is far removed from many governmental services. As
 the drought has intensified, government efforts have been
 concentrated on supplying essential foodstuffs received from
 international donors to a population increasingly
 malnourished; in large areas the rural population is almost
 completely dependent on food assistance. Instances have been
 recorded of hoarding, illegal sale of donated food supplies,
 and withholding of vital nourishment from slaves and children,
 which take place despite efforts of the Government to change
 isolated communities' traditional responses to the prospect of
 famine. The calorie supply as a percent of requirements (1977
 figure) is 84.98 percent. Mortality rates among infants (in
 
 
 219
 MAURITANIA
 1984, 138.30 per 1,000) and the elderly are expected by
 medical authorities to rise during the coming year despite a
 multinational emergency food assistance effort now under way.
 Life expectancy at birth is 45.43 (1984); the population
 growth rate is 2 percent (1984).
 Inequities in income distribution (GNP per capita is $465.80--
 1982) are more pronounced in Mauritania than in its West
 African neighbors, in part because Mauritania's iron ore and
 fisheries exports require heavy investment of capital,
 technological expertise, and management skills. The tax
 system is progressive, although few Mauritanians appear to pay
 their true tax assessment. Private sector initiatives are
 protected and encouraged. In education, the Government's task
 is complicated by the very sharp divisions between the Arabic-
 speaking Maur population and the blacks, who have traditionally
 preferred to be educated in French and local languages rather
 than in Arabic. The Government abandoned plans in 1981 for
 total Arabization of the educational system after encountering
 widespread opposition. The primary school enrollment in 1981
 is 33.90 percent (1980) of the eligible age group.
 Mauritania's literacy rate remains very low--17.40 percent
 (1976)--and those aspiring to advanced training look for
 financial assistance to go abroad. For Mauritanians who
 obtain such an education, employment prospects in Mauritania
 are bleak.
 Traditional cultural and social values limit the role of
 Mauritanian women in government and business. Some women have
 risen to prominent positions in the fields of health and
 education, and many women are employed as teachers and middle-
 or low-level government bureaucrats. While women are free to
 participate in governmental affairs and business, few women
 attempt to combine a career with their family responsibilities.
 Statistics indicate that only half as many women as men avail
 themselves of educational opportunities, a phenomenon which
 may be due to cultural, rather than legal, constraints. The
 Government has recently recommended the establishment of an
 office for women's affairs.
