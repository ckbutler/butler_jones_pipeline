 CAMBODIA
 The overriding fact in Cambodia is the ongoing struggle for
 control which began in January 1979, when the Vietnamese army
 drove the Khmer Rouge Communist regime of Democratic Kampuchea
 out of Phnom Penh and installed its own puppet regime, the
 so-called People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), under former
 Khmer Rouge division commander Heng Samrin. Vietnam, through
 the Heng Samrin regime, controls most of Cambodia, including
 all major cities and towns, by force of arms. Widespread
 abuses of human rights in Cambodia stem largely from the
 occupation presence of at least 10 Vietnamese army divisions
 and a country-wide civil-military control apparatus which
 maintain the Heng Samrin regime in power. This control is
 challenged by a three-part Khmer resistance movement, the
 Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), which
 holds Cambodia's seat atthe U.N. During the 1984-85 dry
 season, the Vietnamese army overran the main resistance bases
 close to the Thai border. Subsequently, the resistance began
 to implement a guerrilla strategy and to conduct operations
 throughout Cambodia.
 Vietnam has attempted to develop political and economic
 institutions following the Vietnamese model in the areas under
 its control. Power is restricted to the Communist Kampuchean
 People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP), which is dominated by the
 Communist Party of Vietnam. Vietnam seeks popular support for
 the Heng Samrin regime and acceptance of its own military
 occupation by highlighting the brutality of the former Khmer
 Rouge regime and warning that the Khmer Rouge would return to
 power if Vietnamese troops left Cambodia. Vietnam has
 declared that by 1990 the process of institution-building
 within the Heng Samrin regime would be completed and the
 Vietnamese army would leave Cambodia. However, the growing
 dissatisfaction with Vietnamese control and increasingly
 effective resistance to Vietnamese occupation make it unlikely
 that the Heng Samrin regime will be able to sustain itself
 without Vietnamese troops for the foreseeable future.
 The CGDK was formed in 1982, when two non-Communist resistance
 (NCR) groups joined with the Khmer Rouge, which now has
 between 40,000 and 50,000 armed men. While in power from
 1975-1979, the Khmer Rouge compiled one of the worst records
 of human rights violations in history as a result of a
 thorough and brutal attempt at restructuring Khmer society.
 The number of Khmer who died as a result of such policies was
 probably at least 1 million. Since their overthrow by
 Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge claim to have abandoned their radical
 ideology. They are attempting to gain the favor of the Khmer
 people by public support for traditional institutions such as
 Buddhism and by publicizing their links with the popular
 former ruler, Prince Sihanouk.
 In an attempt to achieve international respect, the Khmer
 Rouge formally dissolved the Communist Party of Kampuchea in
 1981, and Khmer Rouge strongman Pol Pot purportedly "retired"
 to an advisory role in 1985. However, the Khmer Rouge top
 leadership remains in place. A number of recent incidents
 have been reported in which the Khmer Rouge acted with great
 brutality and no reliable evidence exists that they have given
 up their ultimate goal of regaining power in Cambodia.
 The Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF), which
 reports approximately 14,000 men under arms, is the larger of
 the two NCR groups. It is led by former Prime Minister Son
 Sann and espouses parliamentary ideals of government. It was
 
 
 673
 CAMBODIA
 formed in 1979 with the merger of several existing NCR groups,
 many led by former soldiers from the period of the pre-1975
 Khmer Republic. Lack of discipline in the KPNLF ranks
 resulted in criminal attacks, extortion, and other crimes
 against some Thai villagers and Khmer and Vietnamese refugees
 in the Thai-Cambodian border areas.
 The other NCR group and the third group in the coalition is
 the National United Front for an Independent, Neutral,
 Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC), headed by
 Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who ruled as hereditary king and
 later head of state until 1970. The appeal of this
 organization centers on the Prince's international stature and
 his popularity within Cambodia. The Sihanoukist National Army
 (ANS) has approximately 9,000 armed soldiers.
 During 1986 systematic violations of human rights continued in
 Cambodia, as Vietnam relied on force to maintain its client
 regime in power against the popular will. The Vietnamese
 continued large-scale forced labor work projects in support of
 combat operations in western Cambodia during 1986, in an
 attempt to cut off infiltration by the resistance. As a
 result, there have been heavy casualties due to mines and
 disease, with reports of over 5,000 deaths from disease alone
 in 1985. Delegations from the Lawyers Committee for Human
 Rights visited resistance-controlled parts of Cambodia in
 November 1984 and January-February 1985, conducting in-depth
 interviews with over 150 people. Resistance authorities did
 not permit them to visit Heng Samrin-controlled areas. The
 Committee's report concludes that, "beyond its general and
 pervasive control of expression and political thought, the
 (PRK) regime has sought to stamp out opposition--both real and
 imagined--with a systematic practice of arbitrary arrest,
 brutal torture, and indefinite detention under degrading
 conditions, at times resulting in death."
 The scope of military and paramilitary activity and associated
 violence by both Vietnam and the Khmer resistance groups grew
 in 1986 as resistance forces increased the geographic spread
 of their activities. In their fight against the Vietnamese,
 the Khmer Rouge have employed terrorist tactics against Khmer
 civilians, including murder and destruction of economic
 resources.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Reports of political killing in the Vietnamese-controlled
 areas of Cambodia have declined since an intensive
 Vietnamese/Heng Samrin internal security campaign against
 suspected opponents in 1983. Khmer resistance groups continue
 to report instances of Vietnamese and Heng Samrin officials
 killing suspects during interrogations. Death in captivity
 due to torture or other mistreatment is common, according to
 the testimony of former prisoners. The Lawyers Committee also
 claimed that KPNLF units had conducted summary executions.
 Civilians continued to be killed in 1986 during attacks by the
 Khmer Rouge on lines of communication and other economic
 targets. Defectors from the Khmer Rouge report that prisoners
 in Khmer Rouge jails have been killed by mines while performing
 
 
 674
 CAMBODIA
 forced labor, such as transporting supplies for guerrilla
 forces in Cambodia. Some former Khmer Rouge believe that
 those deaths were intended by the Khmer Rouge. One former
 Khmer Rouge military officer who defected in 1985 claimed that
 individuals had been executed for marrying without permission.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been reports that Heng Samrin security officials
 have been responsible for the disappearance of persons
 suspected of'being opponents of the regime. Although most of
 those who have disappeared apparently have been imprisoned,
 some may have been killed.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Physical torture has been reported both from rural areas and
 from Phnom Penh prisons. The Lawyers Committee for Human
 Rights reports from its 1984-1985 interviews that persons
 suspected of resistance activity are "routinely tortured" in
 the early months of detention by Vietnamese and Heng Samrin
 officials. According to reports gathered by Amnesty
 International in 1986, people suspected of being involved with
 the resistance run the highest risk of torture, although
 people alleged to have expressed opinions critical of the Heng
 Samrin regime's policies or the role of the Vietnamese in the
 country are also said to risk torture, as are those thought to
 be trying to leave or return from areas under the control of
 the resistance. Torture has been reported to take place
 throughout the country at facilities under the control of both
 the Ministry of Interior (and its subordinate civil police
 forces) and the armed forces, including jails run by the
 Ministry of Defense in Phnom Penh. Vietnamese "experts" are.
 reported to have participated in or been present during
 torture at these centers, especially those at the provincial
 level and above. Such "experts" are also reported to have
 tortured political suspects in centers run exclusively by
 Vietnamese. These include jails run by their propaganda and
 education brigades in the provinces and by the head offices of
 their "expert" corps in Phnom Penh.
 According to Amnesty International, a variety of different
 tortures are reported to have been inflicted on political
 suspects detained for interrogation. The most commonly cited
 are lengthy and repeated beatings and whippings. Detainees
 are said to have been punched and kicked on the body, head and
 extremities; struck with pistol and rifle butts, truncheons,
 wooden staves with sharpened edges, and bamboo or iron bars;
 and whipped with electrical or steel cables, chains, rubber
 hoses, or wet gunny sacks. The victim may be tied up during
 these assaults or blindfolded and hung upside down from the
 ceiling with ropes.
 Other reported tortures, inflicted either after or in
 conjunction with sustained beatings and whippings, include
 near suffocation with plastic or rubber bags, near drowning in
 vats of water; application of electric shocks on the ears,
 eyes, or extremities; forcing of fish sauce or soapy water up
 the nose; blowing of lye powder into the eyes, nose, mouth and
 lungs; extended exposure under corrugated iron to intense
 heat; and the insertion of nails through the thigh muscle to
 the bone. According to a number of reports, suspects have
 been threatened with being shot or beaten to death during
 
 
 675
 CAMBODIA
 interrogation and have been subjected to mock executions.
 Both Amnesty International and the Lawyers Committee note that
 detainees undergoing interrogation in centers higher than the
 district level are generally held incommunicado in small and
 completely lightless solitary confinement cells that are
 poorly ventilated and unsanitary. They are constantly
 immobilized by shackles on both legs; sometimes they also are
 handcuffed. They are allowed no bedding or mosquito netting.
 Detainees whose ill-treatment during interrogation is being
 intensified are also deprived of food and water to
 progressively undermine their physical strength and resistance
 to illness. They may not bathe or go outside their cells to
 relieve themselves and are permitted no medication or medical
 attention.
 The aim of this cruel treatment is reportedly to compel
 detainees to confess to crimes and to inform on other suspects
 or on people considered opponents by the authorities.
 Although it is rarely reported that a suspect has been killed
 during the actual interrogation, there are frequent reports of
 detainees dying during the indefinite period of detention
 without charge or trial that usually follows interrogation.
 Such deaths reportedly occur even though the torture is over
 and conditions have improved. The causes appear to be a
 combination of internal injuries sustained during torture,
 unattended diseases contracted during or after torture, and
 inadequate diet. Suicides also have been reported, as well as
 cases of detainees having become insane after torture and
 ill-treatment.
 After several months of the interrogation phase, detainees are
 usually transferred to larger, "daylight cells" which they
 share with other prisoners, and eventually to work camps prior
 to release. A Heng Samrin security service official who
 defected to the border in late 1984 reported that political
 prisoners in Phnom Penh were confined in isolation for up to 3
 months while being interrogated by the Vietnamese military.
 This source claimed that criminal suspects were frequently
 beaten and tortured by the Interrogation Bureau of the Heng
 Samrin police (the Ministry of Interior). The Lawyers
 Committee claims that there are numerous instances of torture
 of political detainees by Interior Ministry personnel.
 Cambodians who left Khmer Rouge control in late 1984 report
 that those who violate minor regulations, for example, by
 conducting unauthorized trading, are punished by detention and
 forced labor. Those committing more serious offenses, such as
 trying to escape from Khmer Rouge control or having
 unauthorized contacts with foreigners, have been confined in
 underground cells for periods of up to 3 months or forced to
 work in dangerous, mine-infested areas. A number of
 Vietnamese prisoners who had been in Khmer Rouge hands ended
 up in Thailand following Vietnamese attacks on Khmer Rouge
 bases in early 1984. Press photographs of the Vietnamese
 indicated that they were close to starvation. A group of
 Vietnamese captives released by the Khmer Rouge in 1986 also
 report being beaten senseless, forced to do hard manual labor,
 and forced to fight each other for the amusement of their
 captors. However, other Vietnamese captives released during
 the year have reported more acceptable treatment by the Khmer
 Rouge.
 Treatment of Vietnamese and Heng Samrin military prisoners by
 the NCR groups generally has been adequate, but there were a
 
 
 676
 CAMBODIA
 number of instances in 1986 where Vietnamese and Khmer
 civilians arriving at the border were abused and held on the
 Cambodian side for extortion, reportedly by undisciplined
 elements of the KPNLF. In October 1986, the KPNLF leadership,
 Thai authorities, the U.N., and the International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC) cooperated in moving people away from the
 main area where these abuses were occurring, bringing those
 practices to a temporary halt. Given the nature of the
 no-man's land on the Cambodian side of the border, however,
 the problem may reappear.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The authorities often detain, interrogate, and jail resistance
 sympathizers for extended periods of time without formal
 charges. Separate sections within the Heng Samrin police are
 responsible for investigation of activities by the
 non-Communist (KPNLF and ANS) and Communist Khmer Rouge
 resistance groups. The Ministry of Interior maintains at
 least three prisons in Cambodia in which suspected supporters
 of the resistance are held without formal charges, often for
 periods in excess of 3 years. Provincial police and joint
 Vietnamese/Heng Samrin military internal security units
 maintain additional detention and interrogation centers.
 Regulations of the Heng Samrin regime call for the arrest and
 "reeducation" of "any person carrying out propaganda campaigns
 to sabotage internal unity and Kampuchea-Laos-Vietnam
 solidarity." Such "reeducation" means indefinite detention to
 force a change in political values.
 Combined with brutal treatment of suspected resistance
 collaborators, the Heng Samrin'regime also operates an amnesty
 program for those resistance soldiers who voluntarily
 surrender with their weapons to the regime. According to an
 official of the program who defected in 1986, returnees are
 debriefed and returned to their home villages. Informers in
 the village then determine over a period of time whether the
 individual is an authentic defector or still works for the
 resistance, in which case he would be rearrested.
 There is a virtual absence of legal process under the Heng
 Samrin regime for those detained. Detainees are almost never
 informed of the charges against them, nor are they given
 access to a lawyer or informed of any rights or legal
 protections.
 During 1986 the Heng Samrin regime officially extended
 compulsory military service from 3 years to 5 for men between
 the ages of 18 and 30. However, deserters from the Heng
 Samrin army say that the tour of duty limits frequently are
 not observed in practice--one claimed that he was forcibly
 conscripted in 1982 and had still not been discharged, nor had
 any hope of it, when he deserted to the border in mid-1986.
 In Vietnamese-controlled areas, forced labor is common,
 although it is not primarily used as a sanction or a means of
 racial, social, or other discrimination. The Vietnamese and
 the Heng Samrin regime have systematically conscripted Khmer
 civilians from throughout Cambodia for work on military-
 related projects in or near combat areas along the
 Thai-Cambodian border. The numbers of these forced laborers
 remained in the tens of thousands during 1986 as they were
 organized into paramilitary units in a massive program to
 construct physical obstacles to infiltration. They have
 suffered frequent loss of life from mines, malaria, and other
 
 
 677
 CAMBODIA
 diseases in the remote border areas. Their forced
 participation places their lives at risk when Vietnamese or
 resistance military actions occur nearby.
 The Khmer Rouge also require labor from all persons under
 their control and prevent them from leaving, either to return
 to areas controlled by the Vietnamese or to join other
 resistance groups. Khmer Rouge defectors in 1986 report that
 they were forced to carry supplies and ammunition into the
 interior of Cambodia in support of military operations,
 claiming they were punished if they failed to carry out these
 tasks.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Political prisoners under the Heng Samrin regime are regularly
 denied the right to trial. Figures on the numbers of
 political prisoners in Cambodia are only rough estimates. A
 recent arrival at the border who had been held in the main
 prison in Phnom Penh estimated the total population to be a
 little over 1,000. A second prison, Prey Sar, reportedly
 holds approximately 1,000 prisoners, including many political
 prisoners. Trapeang Phlong in Kompong Cham Province
 reportedly contains about 600 prisoners, who are transferred
 there from Phnom Penh and the provinces for the labor
 "rehabilitation" phase of their confinement prior to release.
 The Lawyers Committee heard testimony that the major jail in
 Battambang held 876 prisoners as of March 1984. A former
 inmate of the Kompong Som jail reported that in October 1984
 it held about 180 prisoners, most of whom had been captured
 trying to escape from Cambodia. A former prisoner, who
 escaped from the Koh Kong province jail in April 1985,
 reported that it held about 120 prisoners, mostly political.
 The Lawyers Committee also reported the existence of prisons
 run by what it termed the Vietnamese "special branch," such as
 the one designated 7708 in Phnom Penh. This is in fact the
 designation of 1 of at least 20 propaganda/civic action units
 of the Vietnamese army which work with Heng Samrin authorities
 in each of the 4 military "fronts" and special zones in
 Cambodia to maintain internal security. The Lawyers Committee
 estimated that political prisoners number in the thousands
 overall.
 The Heng Samrin regime has reestablished courts and begun to
 develop a legal system. However, trials are used primarily
 for purposes of propaganda or public intimidation, with the
 verdict already decided. Show trials in 1980 and 1983 were
 intended primarily to publicize the "confessions" of the
 accused. There are few procedural rights for defendants.
 According to a former prisoner who arrived at the Thai border
 in 1986 and had gone through a Heng Samrin trial, defendants
 are required to memorize carefully and rehearse in advance all
 the questions and answers to be presented in court. A 1982
 law on court organization provides the right of counsel only
 with prior approval of the court. The 1981 Constitution
 provides for public trials, but allows for closed sessions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Heng Samrin authorities search whenever and wherever they
 wish. Networks of informers report to the secret police, and
 Vietnamese personnel are assigned to monitor all levels of the
 Heng Samrin internal security apparatus. Refugees arriving at
 
 
 678
 CAMBODIA
 the border in 1986 also report the development of tightly
 controlled fortified villages in areas of resistance
 activity. Access to these villages is controlled by Heng
 Samrin or Vietnamese troops, and people are forcibly relocated
 into them to prevent contact with resistance forces. Heng
 Samrin authorities also began in 1986 to require that families
 in contested areas account for missing family members.
 Failure to explain adequately their absence results in the
 assumption that they are with the resistance and the
 relocation of the family to a fortified village. There are
 also reports that the regime confiscates the majority of rice
 and other foodstuffs from villagers in an effort to prevent
 cooperation with the resistance.
 The Khmer Rouge maintain strict control on the social activity
 of those under their control. For instance, they punish
 people marrying without permission, having contacts with
 foreigners, and listening to unauthorized radio broadcasts.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 In Heng Samrin areas the press and radio are wholly controlled
 by Hanoi and its client regime. Criticism of the regime is
 not tolerated, nor are foreign books and periodicals
 permitted, except those officially distributed. There have
 been reports of arrests for listening to foreign radio
 broadcasts. A similar situation exists in the Khmer Rouge
 camps. The non-Communist groups do not have similar
 restrictions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only associations permitted by the Heng Samrin regime are
 those created to support the regime, such as those for
 farmers, women, and youth. Organized labor is totally under
 the regime's control, and industries have organized branches
 of the official "trade union for national salvation."
 Collective bargaining is unheard of.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 When in power in Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge disestablished
 Buddhism as the state religion. Since being driven from
 power, the Khmer Rouge have tried to give the impression of
 reform. However, defectors from the Khmer Rouge zone in 1985
 report that Buddhism is still discouraged by Khmer Rouge
 authorities. Christianity and Islam were even more ruthlessly
 suppressed by the Khmer Rouge when they controlled the country
 and are not known to have been revived in Khmer Rouge-
 controlled areas since.
 The Heng Samrin regime has permitted the return of religious
 practices, but has not reinstated Buddhism as a state
 religion, nor does it actively encourage it. The number of
 Buddhist temples (wats) is far fewer today than before 1970,
 and there are generally only two to four monks per wat, far
 fewer than before the war. It is forbidden for men under 50
 year's of age to be ordained. Religious affairs are overseen
 by the National United Front for Construction and Defense, the
 same government agency that seeks to organize women, youth,
 workers, and religious groups to support the state.
 Communities which want a wat must apply to the local front
 committee for permission. At the second Buddhist Monks'
 
 
 679
 CAMBODIA
 Conference in Phnom Penh on July 4, 1984, a resolution was
 passed forcing Buddhism into the "two strategic tasks of the
 party--namely, to defend the fatherland and build it through
 the period of transition step-by-step toward socialism." At
 the Fifth Conference of Buddhist Monks on October 3, 1986, PRK
 politburo member Chea Sim praised the contributions of the
 Buddhist monks and laymen in Phnom Penh for their
 implementation of the party's and state's political line
 toward Buddhism. In general, the Heng Samrin authorities
 attempt to use Buddhism as one of a number of organizations
 for "mass mobilization" to implement party policies.
 Christian groups are harassed by the Heng Samrin regime. The
 Protestant and Roman Catholic communities in Phnom Penh
 reportedly are not authorized to meet. Muslims, most of whom
 are ethnic Chams rather than Khmer, have been encouraged by
 the Heng Samrin regime to renew their religious community, and
 Muslims have spoken out in public in support of the Heng
 Samrin regime and against the excesses of the former Khmer
 Rouge regime.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Heng Samrin regime tries to control tightly all travel
 within the areas under its control. 'A system of neighborhood
 surveillance, modeled after the Vietnamese system, was
 introduced in 1981. A system requiring family registration
 and identification books was begun in 1980, and in 1983 the
 registration effort was placed under the police in each local
 administrative unit. Complex regulations govern movement of
 families and individuals within Cambodia. Passes are required
 for internal movement-between villages. Checkpoints are
 ubiquitous, and bribes as well as passes are required to pass
 them, although checkpoints can often be dodged by avoiding
 roads. Only a few top Heng Samrin regime officials travel
 abroad. Other Khmer seeking to leave the country flee to the
 Thai border in order to enter U.N.-supported refugee camps in
 Thailand. The Heng Samrin regime routinely imprisons those
 caught attempting to flee to the border as well as those
 believed to be returning from border encampments affiliated
 with the CGDK. The Heng Samrin regime has agreed in principle
 to accept returning displaced persons from camps in Thailand,
 but has taken only one elderly woman so far because it has put
 off reaching an agreement with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on the mechanics of
 repatriation. Most of the Khmer allowed refugee status in
 Thailand have been approved for resettlement and departed for
 Western countries. Over 20,000 Khmer approved for refugee
 status remain at the Khao-i-Dang holding center in Thailand.
 Another 247,000 Khmer who have not been accorded refugee
 status in Thailand remain as displaced persons in camps on
 Thai territory near the border.
 The Khmer Rouge also tightly control movement within their
 zone and attempt to prevent the non-Communists from operating
 in or crossing what they consider their "liberated areas" in
 Cambodia. In one instance in 1984, a group of approximately
 500 Khmer escaped from Khmer Rouge control and joined a
 non-Communist group. Several smaller groups of Khmer Rouge
 escaped to the non-Communists in 1985 and 1986.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Khmer people do not enjoy the fundamental right of
 
 
 680
 CAMBODIA
 self-determination. The KPRP, a Party which acknowledges a
 serious shortage of members, controls political life in areas
 controlled by-the Heng Samrin regime. Major policies are
 approved by Vietnam, and many day-to-day administrative
 decisions, especially in internal security matters, are made
 unilaterally by Vietnamese officials. Both Hanoi and Phnom
 Penh have rejected any change in the system imposed following
 the Vietnamese invasion, calling the situation "irreversible."
 Political aspirants in Heng Samrin areas must study the
 current political dogma, which centers on acceptance of the
 Vietnamese explanation for Hanoi's dominant position in
 Cambodia. Middle- and high-level Heng Samrin officials must
 attend political indoctrination courses taught by Vietnamese
 at political schools in Phnom Penh and in Vietnam. Relatively
 few Heng Samrin officials are considered reliable by the
 Vietnamese. Highest positions of trust are given to Khmei
 loyal to Hanoi prior to 1975 followed by pre-1978 defectors
 from the Khmer Rouge, other former Khmer Rouge cadre,
 non-political "intellectuals" (including many pre-1975 school
 teachers), and low-ranking officials of pre-1975 governments,
 in that order. While attempting to build an indigenous
 Communist Party and government structure in Cambodia, Vietnam
 itself maintains complete control. Elections in Heng Samrin
 areas do not allow genuine political participation, but rather
 are staged by the regime to attempt to demonstrate legitimacy,
 and to underscore the relative status of leaders by varying
 reported percentages of the "vote." Reports suggest that in
 the 1981 national elections, percentages were manipulated and
 some victors were named regardless of the number of votes they
 received. Vietnamese district level advisors were reliably
 reported to have picked candidates for lower level elections.
 Although National Assembly members are supposed to serve terms
 of 4 years, and the second round of elections should have been
 held in 1986, none were held and none are scheduled.
 The Khmer Rouge Communist Party of Kampuchea was formally
 dissolved in December 1981, but, it continues to exist in areas
 controlled by the Khmer Rouge. In fact, the party, in which
 power is concentrated in the hands of fewer than 10 people,
 controls all political, economic, and military life in those
 areas. No opposition is possible. Although Pol Pot
 purportedly "retired' in 1985, and assumed an advisory
 position on national security, defectors from the Khmer Rouge
 report that power continues to be held by the pre-1979
 leadership.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Human Rights violations in Cambodia have been the subject of
 intense international attention since 1978, when the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission and its Subcommission on the
 Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities
 began investigating the problem. In March 1986, the
 Commission adopted the latest in a series of resolutions on
 Cambodia. This recognized the continued effectiveness of the
 CGDK with Prince Sihanouk as President, reiterated its
 "condemnation of persistent occurrence of gross and flagrant
 violations of human rights in Kampuchea," and reaffirmed "that
 the continuing illegal occupation of Kampuchea by foreign
 forces deprives the people of Kampuchea from exercise of their
 right to self-determination and constitutes the primary
 violation of human rights in Kampuchea at present."
 
 
 681
 CAMBODIA
 Authorities in the areas controlled by the Heng Samrin and
 Khmer Rouge have not permitted investigation of charges of
 human rights violations. In late 1984, the Heng Samrin regime
 declined to permit the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights to
 visit areas it controls. The Lawyers Committee conducted
 another study in 1986 and its findings will be made public.
 The Heng Samrin regime and the Khmer Rouge areas have Red
 Cross organizations, but neither they nor any other groups in
 those areas have a role in the protection of human rights.
 The non-Communist camps along the Thai-Cambodian border have a
 substantial daytime presence of voluntary and international
 organization staff who have intervened to secure better
 treatment of minorities, such as Vietnamese refugees among the
 Khmer. Representatives from the ICRC have conducted
 interviews with prisoners held in KPNLF stockades.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Directives issued by the Heng Samrin regime in 1982 seemed to
 accord a privileged status to Vietnamese immigrants vis-a-vis
 Khmer residents, and there have been reports of Vietnamese
 taking advantage of their privileged status to force Khmer out
 of desirable occupations or land. Khmer arriving on the
 border in 1986 reported that Vietnamese pressure and
 commercial taxes in the cities are continuing to drive out
 Khmer and Chinese merchants whose places are being taken by
 Vietnamese, who are able to avoid taxation. Regime Circular
 351 issued in 1983 specified particular measures against
 ethnic Chinese who, according to the circular, are being used
 by enemies of the State "to engage in espionage, psychological
 warfare, economic warfare; and to spread turmoil in the market
 place." Chinese with "questionable family histories" are
 encouraged to report to authorities to "clear themselves."
 Reports from border travelers indicate that many Vietnamese
 have moved into Cambodia to join other returning residents who
 had been expelled during the Khmer Republic or Khmer Rouge
 periods. Most are traders or fishermen, but a large group of
 Vietnamese farmers have settled on rich marshland in Takeo
 Province.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There is no known minimum age for the employment of children.
 No attention appears to have been given by authorities to
 ensure acceptable conditions of work, and there is little
 information on this subject. Wage scales for the few
 industrial and government workers are set by the State and are
 universally regarded as insufficient, forcing employees to
 supplement their wages in some manner.
