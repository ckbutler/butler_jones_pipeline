 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a one-party state with a strong presidency. Although
 human rights enjoy extensive constitutional guarantees in
 Zambia, the president possesses sweeping power, conferred on
 him by emergency legislation in 1964 and by his presidency
 of the party, to suspend them in the interest of state
 security. In accordance with the constitution, the parliament
 also reserves the right to suspend basic constitutional
 guarantees. Since the parliament, like all Zambian political
 institutions, is subordinate to Zambia's single party, the
 party views have a decisive effect and can significantly
 influence parliamentary decisions. During the entire period
 of the Rhodesian conflict, which greatly strained Zambia's
 political and economic system, restraint was demonstrated in
 the use of extraordinary powers. Internal security continues
 to be a sensitive issue; in the last 12 months the government
 alleged a coup plot, charged labor dissidence and detained
 key labor leaders.
 Although the increase in detentions (as well as proposed
 legislation affecting the freedom of the press and labor
 unions) necessarily raises questions about the future,
 Zambia still possesses a relatively open political system.
 Additionally, Zambia continues to serve as a country of
 first refuge in the region even though the end of the
 Rhodesian conflict removed its heavy burden of Zimbabwean
 refugees.
 Life in Zambia's western province remains economically
 uncertain due to less than full Zambian government control
 of an area that has sometimes fallen victim to incursions
 by South.African forces in search of SWAPO and other guer-
 rilla forces harbored there.
 The threat to security in Zambia that its officials see
 as posed by South African incursions and potential encourage-
 ment to opponents of President Kaunda's government is con-
 sidered by some observers to be in part at the base of
 Zambian government actions against what it considers as its
 political enemies.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Zambian government policy opposes the use of torture, which
 is specifically prohibited under the constitution. There
 have been allegations that individual military personnel and
 police officers have resorted to brutality when arresting or
 interrogating people, especially in prominent criminal cases
 and those involving national security. Alleged victims of
 such mistreatment, however, have not been prevented from
 registering their complaints through the courts. The latter
 have consistently rejected statements obtained under duress.
 The supreme court, in particular, has strongly criticized
 arresting authorities in this matter. However, the prospect
 of disciplinary action against officials guilty of mistreat-
 ment does not constitute an effective deterrent.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is not
 common. Nonetheless, charges of maltreatment are made.
 
 (310)

 made. There have been no incidents of official resort to
 corporal or capital punishment reported. Zambian prisons
 are overcrowded, understaffed, unsanitary and have little
 or no rehabilitative facilities.
 Prison system officials have stated openly that, given their
 continuing acute shortage of funds, it is difficult to meet
 inmates' basic needs. The necessity to upgrade Zambia's
 prisons is an issue of public debate.
 c. Disappearances
 Permanent disappearances among Zambians are virtually an
 unknown phenomenon. In those infrequent instances of
 temporary disappearance alleged to have occured, the
 individual has reappeared and been accounted for within a
 few days. Given the proximity of parts of Zambia to zones
 of conflict in Angola and Namibia, some partisan groups
 operate in the vicinity with little effective Zambian control.
 There have been reports of politically motivated disappear-
 ances of non-Zambian activists in Namibian or South African
 causes, but these have taken place without involvement of
 Zambian authorities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under the state of emergency in effect since independence in
 1964, the president has wide discretion to detain or restrict
 the movements of individuals. A legacy of the British
 colonial administration, that authority has not been amended
 since, although detention procedures have been revised to
 conform with the provisions of the constitution. Those
 revisions have increased, rather than diluted, the president's
 detention authority. Through the repeated application of
 detention orders the president can, in effect, prolong
 indefinitely the incarceration of a detainee.
 Presidential detainees enjoy certain rights including formal
 receipt of the reason for their detention, publication of
 their detention in the government gazette, access to counsel,
 immediate representation to the detaining authority, and the
 right to seek judicial review by an independent and impartial
 tribunal of the detention order after one year. Further,
 the detainee has access to the high court and supreme court.
 In fact, the government this past year has denied lower
 courts' jurisdiction and has insisted that presidential
 detainees appear before the high court.
 Habeas corpus is also available to persons detained under
 presidential order, but the government is not obliged to
 accept the recommendations of the review tribunal. One
 current detainee who successfully obtained a writ of habeas
 corpus was redetained as soon as he left the judge's chambers.
 Law officers and defense personnel also enjoy extraordinary
 powers under emergency legislation. Police officers of
 assistant inspector rank or above may arrest without a
 warrant and detain an individual for up to 28 days if the
 officer has reason to believe grounds exist to justify a
 presidential detention order. Nonetheless, the police must
 supply the detainees with the reason for this detention
 within 14 days or the detention is void. Security officers
 also enjoy broad power of search.

 At least thirteen prominent businessmen, lawyers and mili-
 tary officers detained in October 1980 for allegedly planning
 a coup d'etat were held for nearly a year before they were
 brought to trial. Their cases are moving very slowly.
 Four senior labor leaders were detained in July 1981 but the
 high court has since released them under a writ of habeas
 corpus.
 Responsible estimates of the total number of persons cur-
 rently under presidential detention order range from several
 hundred to less than a thousand. It is not known how many
 of these were detained for their political activities. In
 most cases detainees have been either released or formally
 charged once investigation of their cases has been com-
 pleted -- a process that can take several months. Amnesty
 International listed in its 1981 report as its main human
 rights concern in Zambia the detention without trial of real
 or suspected government opponents. Amnesty International
 also noted that some long-term political detainees were
 released in 1981.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Zambian government guarantees the right to a fair
 public trial. This right is not observed in the case of
 presidential detainees. The safeguards of English common law
 are theoretically provided in court cases. Lawyers handling
 even sensitive political cases have generally expressed
 confidence in the independence of the Zambian judiciary.
 However, the arrest of one of Zambia's most prominent
 lawyers in connection with last year's alleged coup plot,
 the deportation of a foreign lawyer representing one of
 those so detained, and the transfer of a senior magistrate
 involved in the case, as well as other plot-related issues,
 have been the subject of public concern and debate.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The Zambian constitution guarantees the privacy of the home.
 This is generally respected except in isolated incidents
 related to the national emergency and in some cases involving
 the deportation of illegal aliens. Security forces normally
 have search warrants when investigating homes.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of expression and assembly are circumscribed by
 the constitutional ban on all political activity outside the
 one-party structure. Nonetheless, some freedom has been
 permitted in practice. The press regularly reports criticism
 of governmental policies expressed in parliament and by the
 general public. The two national dailies are owned or
 editorially guided by the government and the party but
 criticism of government performance is permitted. Both
 papers have been sharply critical of government economic
 policies and cases of corruption have been widely reported.
 However, direct criticism in the press or by the general
 public of the head of state and the national philosophy,
 Humanism, is prohibited. Section 69 of the penal code
 states that any person intending to bring the president into
 "hatred, ridicule or contempt" is liable, on conviction, to
 imprisonment for three years or less. Few journalists
 
 
 313
 have transgressed the prohibition and experienced
 observers report that there have been only two or three
 convictions since independence.
 Censorship of foreign publications exists but is not strin-
 gent. News reports from western wire services are often
 rewritten before publication, not necessarily due to direct
 government censorship, but often as a reflection of the
 newspapers' editorial perspectives on the particular issue.
 Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed and
 has been strongly supported by President Kaunda. Christian
 missionaries have been quite active in recent years, although
 aggressive or mass proselytizing, especially where open-air
 meetings are concerned, must be cleared by the ministry of
 home affairs. Jehovah's Witnesses are specifically prohibit-
 ed by presidential order from proselytizing. Zambia has no
 specific state religion and there is considerable harmony
 among the many sects represented in the country. Many of
 Zambia's large Asian population are Hindu. There is a
 Hindu temple In the capital.
 All of Zambia's 18 labor unions come under the Zambian
 Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU). Member unions are strong
 defenders of worker interests and enjoy the right of collec-
 tive bargaining. Under existing legislation, strikes are
 permitted only for specific reason and only after all
 other methods of resolving labor-management disputes have
 been exhausted. Although the ZCTU operates under general
 supervision from Zambia's single party, it maintains inde-
 pendence of action. ZCTU spokesmen frequently question and
 challenge government policy. The ZCTU is regarded by
 experienced, outside observers as an effective and democratic
 trade union organization. The government's detention of
 four senior labor leaders (since released) in the wake of
 strikes last July, however, is a source of concern to
 Zambia's unions and international groups concerned about the
 continued independence of Zambia's labor movement.
 Women participate freely in the social, economic, and
 political life of the country. Several hold senior positions
 in the party and the government. They are represented in
 the professions and at the national university. At the
 same time, the majority of Zambian women still play tradi-
 tional roles in a society where rapid urbanization has
 served to undermine the importance of such roles. Female
 participation in the wage labor force lags far behind that
 of males; half of all the women engaged in formal sector
 employment occupy jobs among the least remunerative.
 Under statutory law, women enjoy full equality with men.
 This is not the case with some customary law which relegates
 women to a different status, particularly in such areas as
 inheritance. Similarly, at rural hospitals, women may not
 be sterilized without their husband's and senior relatives'
 permission.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The President may, under emergency power, restrict the
 movements of individuals within Zambia. Foreign diplomats
 may not travel outside a 40 kilometer radius of Lusaka
 without prior written permission of the ministry of foreign
 affairs. This restriction is enforced. The government also
 
 
 314
 reserves the legal right to refuse or withdraw passports
 to prevent foreign travel by individuals whose activities
 abroad are considered inimical to Zambian interests. The
 government denied foreign travel to several individuals,
 including a prominent labor leader in 1981. The exercise of
 freedom to emigrate is permitted by the government; however,
 strict currency regulations make emigration difficult.
 Refugees are generally accorded considerable freedom unless
 they engage in activities considered to be violations of
 Zambian civil order or security. Zambia is noted for its
 humane policy of offering haven to refugees in the region,
 During the Rhodesian war, Zambia provided refuge to over
 60,000 Zimbabwean refugees. Virtually all of the Zimbabweans
 who wanted to return have been repatriated. There are no
 forced repatriations.
 Zambia currently hosts an estimated 44,000 refugees (25,000
 Angolans; 10,000 Zaireans; 3,000 Namibians; 3,000 South
 Africans; 3,000 miscellaneous).
 About half of the total have spontaneously settled and been
 largely integrated into local communities along Zambia's
 western and northwestern border. The Zambian government
 has been able to provide little material aid to the refugees,
 but has cooperated with international relief efforts. Anti-
 South African government groups including SWAPO and the
 African National Congress exert considerable control over
 the welfare and freedom of movement of the Namibian and
 South African refugee populations respectively.
 c. Preedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Under the 1973 constitution, the United National Indepen-
 dence Party (UNIP) became the only legal political party in
 Zambia. Candidates for political office at any level must
 be members of UNIP. Their qualifications are subject to
 close examination for suitability by party authorities.
 This system is described by the Zambian leadership as "one-
 party, participatory democracy." There is considerable
 competition, often involving multiple candidacy during the
 party selection process. Within this one-party framework
 the elections are by universal suffrage in which secrecy of
 the ballot is protected. In practice the Zambian political
 system is open to individuals of widely differing opinions
 provided they are willing to operate within the one-party
 structure and not challenge President Kaunda's preeminent
 position.
 In 1978, UNIP amended its constitution to limit candidates
 to those with five years continuous party membership. The
 change was appealed by a prominent politician who had
 planned to run against President Kaunda that year, but it
 was upheld by the courts. As expected, President Kaunda
 was renominated by the party and stood as the sole candidate
 in the December 1978 presidential elections.
 The five-year rule of continuous party membership applies
 as well to 17 labor leaders who were suspended from UNIP
 during strikes in January 1981. Although the party has
 expressed its willingness to welcome them back into its
 ranks, UNIP insists that they first purchase new membership
 cards. By so doing, they would tacitly admit that their
 heretofore continuous membership had lapsed. The secretary
 general of the ZCTU, elected to parliament in 1978, has
 since been denied his seat in the national assembly on this
 technicality.

 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International sent a message to the UNIP secretary
 general on January 10, 1981 expressing *deep concern over
 the detention without charge* of the alleged October 1980
 coup plotters. Their trial began in November 1981. Various
 foreign, regional, and international labor organizations
 apparently petitioned the government to release the ZCTU/labor
 leaders as well during their incarceration from July to
 November 1981. It is not known if the government of Zambia
 ever replied.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The Zambian government has stated it is firmly committed to
 meeting the basic needs of its population, and has undertaken
 substantial expenditures on education. However, at present,
 the country is suffering from a sluggish economy marked by
 high inflation, serious unemployment, and scarce financial
 resources. There has been a significant decline in GDP for
 the past several years. Real per capita income has fallen
 sharply below its level at independence seventeen years ago.
 Nonetheless, the expansion of social welfare programs Is
 subordinated to overall economic needs.
 President Kaunda has voiced strong support for the need to
 diversify the national economy, with particular emphasis on
 developing Zambia's significant agricultural potential. The
 average income of rural inhabitants is far below the 1979
 average per capita income of $510 and is estimated to be less
 than one-third the average earnings of urban dwellers. This
 imbalance has generated heavy rural-to-urban migration (over
 40 percent of the population is urban) producing high un-
 employment in urban areas. Scarce foreign exchange, limited
 managerial skills, faulty planning, and weak government and
 party institutions continue to be identified by observers as
 factors constraining the government's ability to meet the
 economic needs of its people. Over half the households in
 the nation remain below the basic minimum income.
 Further, the gap between the rural and urban areas in terms
 of income, education, housing, nutrition, and the avail-
 ability of public services is vast and continues to increase
 in favor of the urban dweller. Eighty-six percent of the
 urban population has access to safe water, for instance, as
 opposed to 16 percent of the rural dwellers. An ILO report
 published in 1977 noted that 10 percent of the population
 (almost exclusively urbanites) claims nearly 50 percent of
 the total income--more than twice that of the income share of
 the lowest 60 percent of the population. Within the urban
 community itself there are also significant inequalities.
 The top 10 percent claimed over 40 percent of the total income,
 the bottom 60 percent received a mere 25 percent. Women
 are accorded a full role in the development process, and
 in fact, the more recent primary school enrollment figures
 show that 89 females are enrolled for every 106 males.
 However, because many of them are burdened with heavy
 household duties, their opportunities for advancement lag
 behind those of men. Within the context of Zambia's tradi-
 tional society, their primary role is to have children.
 Zambia's birthrate, which stood at 2.8 percent in 1970, is
 now 3.1 percent according to the 1980 census which registered
 a 40 percent increase in population from 1969. The total
 fertility rate in 1979 was 6.1 live births per woman. That
 is one of the highest in the world (life expectancy at birth
 is 46.7 years for males, 50 years for females.) Barring a
 dramatic turnaround in Zambia's economy, its ability to
 sustain even existing social services will be seriously
 impaired in the future by its rapidly expanding population.
