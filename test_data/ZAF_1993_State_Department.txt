 SOUTH AFRICA
 South Africa underwent sweeping political change during 1993. In December the
 Transitional Executive Council (TEC), a multiparty, multiracial body, was given
 broad administrative and monitoring powers in the period leading up to the April
 1994 elections--the first elections in South Africa open to all citizens regardless of
 race. The implementation of the TEC marked the first time in South African history
 that the black majority (75.5 percent) participated in the official political process.
 Nevertheless, through most of the year South Africa continued to be governed by
 a system that kept virtually all real power in the hands of the white minority (13
 percent of the population). The National Party, in power since 1948 and currently
 led by State President de Klerk, continued to rule the country.
 The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the Conservative Party (CP), and several other
 conservative groups suspended their further participation in the negotiations proc-
 ess as a result of the decision to hold the national election next April 27. Subse-
 quently, the remaining parties reached agreement on establishing, in addition to the
 teC, independent bodies to run the election and regulate state-controlled media in
 the pre-election period.
 In December the Parliament ratified an interim constitution and bill of rights
 which for the first time guarantee all South Africans such rights as universal suf-
 frage, equal protection under the law, and freedom of speech, assembly, association,
 and religion. The constitution is to be enacted by proclamation on April 27, 1994;
 provision has been made to enable earlier implementation of certain portions of the
 constitution and bill of rights, but these steps had not been taken by year's end.
 The interim constitution also provides for the dismantling of the homelands sys-
 tem, but at the end of the year the 10 homelands were still in place. The homelands
 are heavily subsidized by the Government, some are fragmented parcels of territory
 in impoverished rural areas, and all are agriculturally backward areas without the
 infrastructure needed for development. Of the four so-called independent homelands
 (collectively known as the TBVC states), which only the South African Government
 recognized as sovereign, Transkei, Ciskei, and Venda are ruled by military govern-
 ments, while Bophuthatswana is governed as a one-party state. Authorities in
 Bophuthatswana and Ciskei, in particular, continued to suppress free political activ-
 ity, especially that of the African National Congress (ANC). The six so-called self-
 governing homelands are Gazankulu, KaNgwane, KwaNdebele, KwaZulu, Lebowa,
 and Qwaqwa. According to 1990 census data, the homelands, which comprise 13
 percent of the country's territory, are home to 33 percent of South Africa's black
 population.
 The Government is backed by a powerful security establishment. The South Afri-
 can Defense Force (SADF) has about 65,000 active duty personnel, consisting of
 25,000 white conscripts and 40,000 permanent force personnel, approximately two-
 thirds of whom are black, Asian, or coloured." Additionally, the armed forces of the
 so-called independent homelands, which are expected to be absorbed into the new
 national defense force, number approximately 9,800. The reserve forces, which form
 the bulk of available military manpower in South Africa, are all white and consist
 of a citizen force of 180,000 and 155,000 reservists. The multiracial South African
 Police (SAP) numbers 112,000 and is 40 percent white. The officer corps in both the
 SADF and the SAP is overwhelmingly white. The SAI)F assisted the police in pa-
 trolling the so-called unrest areas and continued to be active in respondingto the
 heightened violence in Natal and the Transvaal. Members of the SADFand the SAP
 were responsible for human rights abuses during the year. The Internal Stability
 Unit, a part of the SAP, has been discredited by its heavy-handed tactics. The home-
 lands security forces continued to be funded by the South African Government and
 were run largely by SAP and SADF members seconded by the Government.
 Some opposition groups and human rights organizations continued to allege that
 a "third force," made up of rogue security force members, engaged in or orchestrated
 various violent incidents to upset the political transition. While credible evidence ex-
 isted of individuals within the security forces fomenting violence, there was no evi-
 dence of a widespread, high-level conspiracy within the security forces to undertake
 such activities. In December the Commission of Inquiry Regarding the Prevention
 of Public Violence and Intimidation, also known as the Goldstone Commission,
 found "credible evidence" that a five-man hit squad was responsible for the deaths
 in Natal of ANC members as well as supporters of the IFP and other organizations.
 The three men arrested in the case were former members of the KwaZulu police and
 had received training from the SADF. Further arrests were expected at the end of
 1993.
 
 
 265
 Several paramilitary organizations and homelands security forces outside the
 central Government were accused credibly of human rights abuses, including
 targeting political opponents for elimination and carrying out extrajudicial killings.
 The KwaZulu Police were unequivocally charged by the Goldstone Commission of
 operating a hit squad specifically targeting IFP opponents. The Azanian People's
 Liberation Army (APLA), the armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC),
 claimed responsibility for attacks on police and civilian targets. The Afrikaner Re-
 sistance Movement (AWB) expressed determination to defend Afrikaners against
 "black domination." Although Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the
 ANC, suspended its armed struggle, some of its operatives, particularly in Natal,
 have been credibly accused of targeting political opponents.
 South Africa has a well-developed industrial economy based on mining and manu-
 facturing and smaller, but important, sectors based on agriculture and services. It
 has a mixed economy, with substantial government intervention and a number of
 state-owned enterprises existing jointly with a strong private sector. A chief char-
 acteristic of the private sector is the high concentration of ownership by a small
 group of integrted conglomerate structures.
 Although South Africa's deepest and most protracted recession since the 1930's
 appeared to have bottomed out in early 1993, there has been no net increase in jobs
 in the productive sectors in more than a decade, and per capita income among all
 races has fallen. Unemployment in the formal sector is approximately 40 percent.
 According to government statistics, nearly half of all employable blacks are either
 unemployed or work in the informal sector; 350,000 new job seekers of all races
 were expected to enter the job market during the year. Average per capita income
 in the homelands was lower than in South Africa proper. Many of the employable
 residents living in the homelands typically migrate or commute to more prosperous
 areas of the country in search of work.
 While the Government has increased spending on blacks in recent years, major
 economic and social reform will be required to reduce income disparities and to re-
 dress the socioeconomic legacies of apartheid in such areas as education, housing,
 and health care. Human rights groups estimate that 7.5 million blacks have no per-
 manent shelter.
 Certain areas in South Africa are awash in violence, much of it criminally moti-
 vated. Political violence, a component of the overall violence continued at a high
 level in 1993. According to the Human Rights Commission (HRC), 4,364 people died
 from politically related violence during the year. Most observers agreed that all par-
 ties, including the ANC, the IEFP, and government security forces bear some meas-
 ure of responsibility for the continuing pattern of violence, despite the 1991 National
 Peace Accord signed by State President de Klerk, ANC President Mandela, IFP
 Chief Minister Buthelezi, and 23 others.
 Positive developments in the area of worker rights continued in 1993, including
 the passage in September of legislation to expand the legal rights of agricultural
 and domestic workers. Bills to promote the equality of men and women and to pro-
 tect women against violence from their spouses were also enacted.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajjudicial Killing.-Certain areas in South Africa are
 awash in violence, much of it criminally motivated. Political violence, a component
 of the overall violence in South Africa, continued at a high level in 1993; the HRC
 documented 4,364 politically related deaths during the year. The HRC reported that
 over 250 police and security personnel lost their lives in political violence during the
 year, this was a record high. A major cause of political killings was violent con-
 frontations between ANC and IFP followers. Another important cause of deaths was
 the series of apparently random attacks by unknown terrorists intent on disrupting
 South Africa's movement toward nonracial democracy by aggravating tensions be-
 tween the ANC and IFP. Evidence of acts of political violence by individuals at-
 tached to the military, police, and homelands police continued to emerge in 1993.
 Human rights organizations alleged that in some cases these individuals were part
 of a conspiracy-the so-called third force--to disrupt the political transition. A pre-
 liminary report of the Goldstone Commission concluded that the PAC's military
 wing, APLA, may have used Transkei as a springboard for attacks against members
 of the police, the military, and white civilians in general. Other groups which con-
 tributed to the high level of violence and extrajudicial killings included rightwing
 organizations local self-defense units (SDU's), criminal gangs which claimed affili-
 ation with pofitical parties, and ill-disciplined labor strike enforcers.
 
 
 266
 The ANC-IFP conflict often took the form of fighting between hostel residents,
 usually but not always affiliated with the IFP, and residents of nearby townships
 and informal settlements, frequently identified with the ANC. Black South Africans
 of all ages, gender, political affiliation, and ethnic grouping were affected. Train and
 taxi commuters, passersby, and people in their own homes were victims of violent
 attack.
 Many township youths, some with affiliation to the MK or South African Com-
 munist Party (SACP), formed armed SDU's, purportedly to protect residents from
 outside attack. In fact, many SDU's have been accused of vigilante-style murders
 of suspected "informers" or IFP sympathizers, acts of intimidation, such as demands
 for "protection" money from local shopkeepers, and common crimes such as car
 theft. ANC leader Chris Hani said shortly before his death that the ANC was un-
 able to control certain SDU's that had branched into criminal activities.
 KwaZulu in Natal Province also experienced continuous high levels of violence.
 Both IFP and ANC officials have made credible allegations that their supporters
 were deliberately targeted by the other party for assassination, as cycles of revenge
 killings continued. According to the Independent Board of Inquiry, 27 ANC officials
 were killed in 1993, while 12 IFP officials were killed during the year.
 Chris Hani was assassinated by a white rightwing zealot in April. In October the
 Rand Supreme Court sentenced to death the gunman and one accomplice, who was
 a leader in the CP. A trial was to take place against another defendant for his role
 in an alleged plot to assassinate SACP chairman Joe Slovo, though the charges were
 subsequently dropped. In July police officers and bodyguards for ANC Deputy Presi-
 dent Walter Sisulu clashed, resulting in the death of an ANC bodyguard. Authori-
 ties investigating the incident reported the death to be accidental.
 On December 13, in a gruesome racist attack in Randfontein, several white men
 in camouflage uniform forced two cars off the road and shot their black occupants,
 several of whom were children, killing three and injuring four.
 Whites in South Africa were also the victims of violent attack. In July masked
 gunmen shot and threw grenades at a congregation attending services in St. James
 Church in Cape Town, killing 11 and injuring over 50. Other whites were slain in
 attacks on tour buses and private cars. Patrons of bars and clubs were attacked in
 several incidents, including a highly publicized December incident in which masked
 gunmen attacked a Cape Town pub, killing four people. Although in many instances
 responsibility for these attacks remained unclear, individuals purporting to speak
 for APLA, the PAC's military wing, claimed responsibility for some of them.
 Government investigations of violent deaths in black areas have been inadequate.
 ANC officials noted the disparity between the hundreds of personnel devoted to
 round up black activists suspected in the St. James Church massacre and the re-
 sources deployed a week earlier when 33 people were killed in a violent rampage
 in Tembisa Township in the Witwatersrand.
 In late 1992, President de Klerk directed Lieutenant General Pierre Steyn to in-
 vestigate allegations of SADF involvement in a destabilization campaign against the
 ANC and MK. Steyn reportedy presented his findings to the Government during
 the year, but no report was made public.
 While credible evidence existed of individuals within the security forces fomenting
 violence, there was no evidence of a widespread, high-level conspiracy within the se-
 curity forces to undertake such activities.
 In October various incidents occurred that implicated members of the SAP in
 extrajudicial killings. In one incident Wellington Mbili, a member of MK, the ANC's
 military wing, died in police custody. Police claimed they shot Mbili in self defense,
 but eyewitnesses said Mbili was handcuffed in SAP custody following his apprehen-
 sion.
 According to the HRC, the number of deaths in detention decreased from 123 in
 1992 to 36 in 1993. The HRC said that such figures are based on media reports,
 because the police have been unforthcoming to the HRC. The decline in numbers
 may be due in part to greater media scrutiny and to an agreement permitting offi-
 cials of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to make unannounced
 visits to detainees in police stations throughout South Africa. Under the agreement,
 ICRC delegates can meet detainees alone, make unannounced followup visits and
 pass their findings to higher governmental officials. However, deaths continued to
 occur under highly suspicious circumstances (see also Section l.c.).
 On April 14, Sam Tambane, secretary of the ANC's Soweto branch, and three oth-
 ers were killed when police opened fire on a crowd protesting the assassination of
 ANC leader Chris Hani. Independent witnesses denied police claims that they acted
 in self defense. The Government announced an investigation into the incident.
 
 
 267
 In February Michael Thithi, who claimed he was assaulted by police during an
 interrogation, also reportedly witnessed the beating death of his coaccused, Johan-
 nes Malekek Matsubukane, during police interrogation.
 Inquests conducted in 1993 concerning the deaths of antiapartheid activists dur-
 ing the 1980's revealed that operatives carried out political killings on the orders
 of high-ranking government officials.
 In iecember the Goldstone Commission released credible evidence, based on an
 investigation conducted by the KwaZulu Police Commissioner, that a number of hit
 squads had been operating in Natal. The three men arrested in the case were
 former members of the KwaZulu police and had received training from the SADF.
 Further arrests were expected at the end of 1993. Goldstone reported the high
 "probability" that the hit squad had been responsible for the murder of nine ANC
 members, supporters of the IFP, and others. Violence in Esikhawini in northern
 Natal decreased dramatically following the arrest of the KZP officers implicated in
 the hit squad investigation.
 In a separate incident allegedly involving KwaZulu Police attacks on ANC sup-
 porters, the ANC claimed some of its supporters in Khojane village were killed in
 September by attackers from a nearby IFP/KwaZulu government military training
 camps. Information about such training camps is ofen shrouded in some mystery.
 For example, in September, after the press reported on an alleged KwaZulu training
 cam p in Umfolozi Game reserve, IFP Chief Minister Buthelezi confirmed that the
 KwaZulu Parliament had established a camp to train SDU's for Zulu protection.
 In May the Ciskei Council of State granted unconditional indemnity from prosecu-
 tion to all members of the Ciskei Defense Force (CDF) involved in the 1992 Bisho
 massacre, in which CDF troops killed 29 and injured hundreds of ANC marchers.
 In October Oupa Gqozo, the homeland's military leader, was cleared of charges that
 he murdered Charles Sebe, the former commander of the CDF in 1991.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known cases of antigovernment activists dis-
 appearing during 1993.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Government has established guidelines and regulations prohibiting torture of
 detainees. Any cases of torture were violations of government regulations. Neverthe-
 less court testimony and sworn affidavits continued to allege tat members of the
 SAP and homelands police mistreated detainees severely, though the incidence of
 such violations continued to decline. The HRC reported allegations of beatings, elec-
 tric shock, and partial suffocation.
 Michael Thithi reported being assaulted by police during an interrogation. A dis-
 trict surgeon reportedly found no signs of the assault, but after Thithi disputed that
 report, another court-ordered examination indicated that he had indeed been beat-
 en. In February, three ANC members charged with a 1992 murder alleged that they
 were severely beaten while in custody of the Ciskei security police. The men were
 allegedly denied medical attention after the assault. The ANC also alleged that Rob-
 ert Manope was assaulted by the Boputhatswana police after being summoned to
 the Mogwase station and accused of recruiting for the ANC. These allegations were
 backed with a medical report indicating that Manope suffered extensive bruising
 over most of his body.
 Also according to HRC data, an MK member was assaulted and tortured in a
 Soweto police station on May 21. She alleged being hit with a rifle and pistol butts
 and subjected to electric shock. In May a PAC member alleged being beaten and
 threatened with indecent assault while undergoing interrogation at a Durban police
 station. In August Sibusiso Zulu, accused of murder in the March 1993 "Table
 Mountain Massacre" in which six schoolchildren were slain, told the court that he
 was assaulted by policemen during interrogation in an effort to extract a confession
 from him.
 On August 24, the Rand Supreme Court granted the ANC an interim order inter-
 dicting the Ministers of Defense and Law and Order, the heads of Modderbee and
 Boksburg prisons and 8 East Rand police station commanders and the forces under
 their commands from assaulting, abusing, threatening, or ill-treating 123 detainees
 under their custody. The court action followed allegations that a number of East
 Rand detainees had been assaulted while in custody.
 The ICRC has access to all detainees in South African and homeland prisons and
 can report substandard prison conditions to authorities.
 In August the Motsuenyane Commission, an ANC-appointed body, released re-
 sults of its investigation of human rights abuses in ANC camps during the organiza-
 tion's years of exile. The report cited numerous instances of murder, torture, beat-
 ings, solitary confinement, and imprisonment without trial and named individuals
 directly and indirectly involved in the abuses, some of whom are now high-ranking
 ANC officials. The ANC accepted the conclusions of the report and made a public
 
 
 268
 apology, but did not respond to nor provide an accounting of all those alleged to
 have disappeared or been mistreated. Many observers criticized the ANC for not
 punishing the perpetrators or compensating the victims. The ANC called for the es-
 tablishment of a truth commission to investigate human rights abuses across the
 political spectrum and to arrange for victim compensation. By the end of 1993, no
 such commission was established.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In November the multiparty negotiating
 council agreed to repeal the Public Safety Act (PSA) and the Internal Security Act
 (ISA)-laws permitting authorities to detain individuals without charge. As of year's
 end the necessary legislation was approved but had not yet gone into effect.
 The PSA authorized warrantless searches and detentions for up to 30 days in
 order to combat or prevent public disturbance, disorder, riot, or public violence, or
 in order to maintain or restore public order in unrest areas. Several human rights
 organizations criticized the Government for invoking the PSA excessively in order
 to declare unrest areas. At the end of the year, 15 magisterial districts remained
 unrest areas under the PSA.
 The ISA allowed the police to detain and interrogate persons suspected of terror-
 ism or subversion or of withholding information about such crimes for a period up
 to 10 days without arrest; continued incarceration required judicial approval. A de-
 tainee did not have an automatic right to legal counsel during the first 10 days of
 detention and the right to legal advice was limited to the preparation of opposition
 to an application by the authorities extending the detention period. The ISA per-
 mitted 14 days of preventive detention.
 The HRC reported that during 1993 a total of 622 people were detained under
 the PSA or ISA. According to Lawyers for Human Rights (LHR), the police generally
 do not block access to such detainees.
 According to the HRC, detentions in most of the so-called independent homelands
 were down sharply. The HRC reported no detentions in Transkei, Ciskei, or Venda
 during 1993. Bophuthatswana, however, detained 153 people under security legisla-
 tion during 1993.
 In many cities, street children were arrested and held in adult jails or prisons
 while awaiting trial. While some were arrested on criminal charges, many were ar-
 rested for such petty offenses as loitering. These children were often held in over-
 crowded cells, and sometimes suffered physical or sexual abuse. Most jails and pris-
 ons have no educational or counseling facilities.
 There were no reported cases of exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Judicial independence continued to strengthen in
 South Africa in 1993, as it had in recent years. Allegations of political interference
 with the courts are few and declining. Moreover, during 1993 the South African
 bench took up a number of cases, such as the Webster and Goniwe inquests, which
 further exposed abuses during the apartheid era. The degree of politicization in judi-
 cial selection appears to be diminishing. Members of the Constitutional Court, which
 will come into effect in 1994 as the supreme judicial body on all constitutional mat-
 ters, including the bill of rights, will be appointed by a process that further attenu-
 ates the influence of political parties.
 Persons charged with common crimes are generally presumed innocent until prov-
 en guilty, but Parliament has modified the general presumption of innocence for
 some security offenses. Both security-related and common criminal cases are tried
 in civilian courts.
 Although defendants in criminal cases may retain legal counsel, a 1991 study
 found that 71 percent of those convicted in ordinary criminal cases had no represen-
 tation. A pilot public defender's program, begun in Johannesburg in 1991 has been
 highly successful. Courts usually appoint counsel for capital cases when the defend-
 ant cannot afford a lawyer.
 Intimidation of participants in the legal process undermined the administration
 of justice. For example, several witnesses to the murder of American Amy Biehl,
 who were prepared to testify against her suspected murderers, were threatened and
 intimidated from testifying, forcing the prosecution to drop charges against several
 of the accused.
 The judiciary is headed by the Appellate Division (court of appeals) of the Su-
 preme Court in Bloemfontein and six regional supreme courts. Only 1 of the 142
 judges of the appellate division and the regional supreme courts is not white.
 Judges, appointed by the State President, serve until age 70 and may only be re-
 moved through impeachment by Parliament. By tradition, judges of the appellate
 division and the supreme courts are chosen from the senior ranks of the elite corps
 of South African Supreme Court Practitioners (advocates). According to the Ministry
 of Justice, only six nonwhite senior advocates are practicing at the bar. The power
 of the judiciary at all levels continues to be circumscribed by the principle of par-
 
 
 269
 liamentary sovereignty, under which judges possess no authority to alter, strike
 down, or refuse to enforce laws of Parliament.
 Serious offenses, including capital crimes, are tried in the supreme courts. Lesser
 offenses are heard by magistrates, career employees of the executive branch civil
 service. The presiding judge or magistrate determines guilt or innocence. Juries
 were abolished in 1969.
 Prospects for nonwhite law school graduates to receive "Articles of Clerkship,"
 which qualify them for admittance to the bar, were enhanced considerably. New
 routes of entry into the profession are open, including credit for work at offices of
 public defenders, university law clinics, and similar community-based entities that
 offer legal assistance to indigent clients.
 So-called people's courts, which emerged in part due to the black community's dis-
 trust of the existing court system, continued to operate sporadically. These tribunals
 pass "judgment" on criminal charges and carry out 'sentences." The people's courts
 are headed by mostly self-appointed "community leaders' who often mete out "jus-
 tice" based on rumors arising from political or personal rivalries.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence .-Al-
 though the security forces retained the capacity and the formal legal authority to
 engage in domestic surveillance activities including the use of informers, the open-
 ing of mail, and the monitoring of telephone calls, the dramatically changed political
 environment diminished their willingness to engage in these activities. This is not
 true of the local authorities in Bophuthatswana and Ciskei, who continued to mon-
 itor the political activities of the citizenry.
 With the repeal of the PSA, police will no longer have brad authority to conduct
 searches and seizures without warrants in designated unrest areas. Even outside
 of unrest areas, there has been an unequal application of the Law of Criminal Pro-
 cedure. White citizens have generally enjoyed protection from unreasonable searches
 and seizures; black citizens have usually not.
 The legacy of apartheid has left vast numbers of South Africans landless; more
 than 8 million people live in squatter camps. Conflict continues between those who
 currently own land and those who contend that the land was forcibly taken from
 previous occupants. The Prevention of Illegal Squatting Act gives landowners and
 lcal governments the authority to remove black populations from 'white" areas. De-
 spite central government authorities' increased toleraiice of squatter settlements,
 some local authorities continue to pressure squatters to move. The problem of forced
 relocation of residents of informal settlements is particularly pronounced in rural
 areas where land owners are able to exploit the prvisions of the Act.
 In Bophuthatswana conflicts between authornties and squatters continued to de-
 prive many residents of their homes. In February Bophuthatswana authorities de-
 molished an informal settlement on disputed land in Markolong without securing
 a court order or a legal judgment on the dispute. At least 100 people were rendered
 homeless as a result.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedoms of speech and press are respected in
 practice. Both the mainstream and the so-called alternate press kept the public well
 informed and criticized both the Government and the opposition.
 The South African Broadcasting Coration (SABC), once seen as the Govern-
 ment's mouthpiece, underwent profound changes. A new board of directors with a
 black woman as head was appointed. In Sptember Parliament passed legislation
 to create the Independent Broadcasting Authority with power to license new and
 privately owned broadcast outlets. A second bill established the Independent Media
 Commission to monitor the media coverage of the political campaign and to seek to
 ensure a level playing field for all parties in the months leading up to the April
 1994 election. Radio news reporting, in particular that of privately owned Radio 702,
 was reasonably balanced.
 Although rarely invoked, considerable legislation permitting the Government to
 restrict and penalize the press remained on the books. Under the Criminal Proce-
 dure Act the Government subpoenaed a journalist from    an Afrikaans-language
 newspaper who refused to answer questions concerning an article he wrote report-
 ing remarks made by a black youth leader at an open rally. The journalist received
 a 1-year prison sentence. The sentence was under ap peal at year's end.
 Laws restricting the publication of information about the SAP, SADF, petroleum
 issues, and prisons and mental institutions remained on the books. The ISA allowed
 the Minister of Law and Order to ban organizations and their publications. Prohibi-
 tions against the publication of such materials as pornographic material are in ef-
 fect.
 
 
 270
 Opposition  ups, and especially militant youths, continued to harass and attack
 members of the press despite calls from leaders for them to exercise restraint. In
 one incident, an SABC cameraman was murdered by a gang of youths while cover-
 ing a story in Sharpeville, near Johannesburg. The result nas been de facto hin-
 drance of the press from covering developments in certain volatile areas.
 There are no official restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Political parties and organiza-
 tions enjoy broad freedoms of assembly and association. While the ISA gave the
 Minister of Law and Order authority to ban political gatherings in order to maintain
 public order, he has not used that authority in over 2 years. He did, however, fre-
 quently invoke his authority to declare certain areas "unrest areas." All demonstra-
 tions or public gatherings in an unrest area had to be approved by the area police
 commissioner. Although decisions to prohibit an event could be appealed to the
 courts, such appeals were never successful. In some cases, authorities could deny
 permission for a demonstration outside unrest areas if it was felt that the event
 would threaten life or property.
 In some of the homelands, local officials continued to obstruct the right of peaceful
 assembly. Opposition political groups in Bophuthatswana were routinely denied per-
 mission to meet or organize and their "illegal" gatherings were forcibly dispersed.
 Among the so-called self-governing homelands, KwaZulu, the only one with its own
 security force, has a particularly poor record. Local KwaZulu officials often used
 their authority to hamper severely political activity by groups other than the IFP
 and to harass non-IFP leaders. There were many credible accounts of death threats
 to intimidate political activity. For example, residents of Gerzinsila and Nyanini
 Townships in Natal were forced to attend an IFP rally and told that those absent
 from future rallies would be killed. In addition, the climate of violence existing in
 many parts of KwaZulu has resulted in so-called no-go areas where in some cases
 ANCand in other cases IFP leaders cannot organize meetings without risk to their
 lives. Such no-go areas also exist in some urban townships. ANC and IFP sym-
 pathizers shared culpability for this.
 Many white landowners fearing their workers might be influenced by "radical"
 ideas of worker rights and plitical empowerment, violently opposed efforts by the
 ANC and other predominantly black political groups to hold public gatherings, effec-
 tively preventing these groups from organizing. Similarly, certain bliack groups have
 disrupted township gatherings organized by representatives of predominantly white
 political parties, suc as the National Party and Democratic Party. For safety rea-
 sons, the SAP urged whites to stay away from some townships altogether.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There are no restrictions on the expression and practice
 of religious belief nor on proselytizing.
 d. eedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-South Africans have no restrictions on movement throughout their
 country and are free to travel overseas, emigrate, or repatriate. Those choosing to
 emigrate, however, are limited in the amount of money they can take out of South
 Africa.
 The Government and private monitoring groups estimated that as man as
 500,000 Mozambicans, displaced by civil unrest or economic hardship, were in South
 Africa. Approximately half the Mozambicans in South Africa have settled in border
 transit camps in the homelands of KaNgwane and Gazankulu, the only places in
 South Africa where Mozambican refugees have enjoyed some measure of protection.
 Under the Admission of Persons Act, they are allowed to stay there temporarily be-
 cause of their ethnic ties with homeland residents. Although some of these refugees
 have lived in the homelands since 1986, refugee officials reported that some
 Mozambicans were slowly returning to their country as the peace process continued
 to hold there.
 In August the Government and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) signed a long-negotiated agreement allowing the UNHCR to assist refu-
 gees arriving in South Africa. Until then, the ICRC and other nongovernental or-
 ganizations housed and cared for the refugees. In October the UNHCR and the Gov-
 ernments of South Africa and Mozambique signed a tripartite agement establish-
 ing a joint commission and procedures for handling the organized, voluntary repatri-
 ation of Mozambican refugees. Although the KaNgwane and Gazankulu authorities
 did not participate in the negotiations leading to the September and October agree-
 ments, they were kept informed and welcomed these developments.
 Despite these developments, involuntary repatriation of Mozambicans from South
 Africa continued. Those Mozambicans settling outside KaNgwane and Gazankulu
 are considered illegal aliens under the Aliens Control Act. According to the Ministry
 of Home Affairs, during 1993 the Government deported 80,261 illegal Mozambicans
 and 15,680 aliens from other (mostly southern Afican) countries.
 
 
 Despite the South Africa-UNHCR memorandum of understanding, the tripartite
 agreement, and periodic representations on human rights abuses, an electrified
 fence on the border between South Africa and Mozambique remained in place as a
 deterrent measure.
 The Government extended through 1993 its 1991 mandate to the UNHCR to mon-
 itor the repatriation of South African exiles, most of whom were affiliated in some
 way with antiapartheid organizations while in exile. An estimated 7,000 exiles had
 returned to South Africa prior to the 1991 agreement. As of year's end, a further
 10,836 persons had been cleared to return under UNHCR auspices. The number of
 exiles who have actually returned through the end of 1993 was 7,303.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 South Africa underwent sweeping political change during 1993. In December the
 Transitional Executive Council (TEC), a multiparty, multiracial body, was given
 broad administrative and monitoring pwers in the period leading up to the April
 1994 elections--the first elections in South Africa open to all citizens regardless of
 race. The implementation of the TEC marked the first time in South African history
 that the black majority (75.5 percent) participated in the official political process.
 Nevertheless, prior to establishment o the  C, South Africa continued to be gov-
 erned by a system that kept virtually all real power in the hands of the white mi-
 nority (13 percent of the population), while the black majority was denied any mean-
 ingful share of power, or even representation, in the national Government. While
 there existed parliamentary chambers to represent South Africa's mixed race and
 Asian population groups, members of those groups consistently boycotted the elec-
 tions for those bodies, most recently in 1989; in any case, the 1983 Constitution kept
 all real power in the hands of the chamber for whites.
 A transitional constitution, agreed to in November by the negotiating parties and
 ratified by Parliament in December, will govern the country beginning on April 27,
 1994, and until an elected constitutional assembly drafts a final one. The future con-
 stitution includes an extensive, fully justiciable bill of rights. It also provides for an
 independent judiciary, including a constitutional court and nine provincial govern-
 ments directly elected by proportional representation.
 The transitional constitution for the first time guarantees all South Africans such
 rights as universal suffrage, equal protection under the law, and freedom of speech,
 assembly, association, and religion. The constitution is to be enacted by proclama-
 tion on April 27, 1994. Provision was made to enable earlier implementation of cer-
 tain portions of the constitution and bill of rights, but these steps had not been
 taken by year's end.
 Multiparty negotiations, suspended since June 1992, resumed in April 1993. On
 July 2, most participating parties formally agreed that the first nonracial election
 would be held on April 27, 1994 and that the body so elected would both write a
 final constitution and form the basis for a multi party transitional government to
 rule the county for an interim period. The IFP, CP, and several other conservative
 groups suspended their further participation in the negotiations process as a result
 of these decisions and later formed a coalition called the Freedom Alliance. Subse-
 quently, the remaining negotiating parties reached agreement on establishing, in
 addition to the TEC, an Independent Electoral Commission, Independent Media
 Commission, and Independent Broadcasting Authority, all of which are intended to
 level the playing field for all parties in the preelection period. Parliament passed
 the enabling legislation for these bodies in late September.
 While the provisions of the interim constitution will require dismantling the
 homelands system, at the end of the year the 10 homelands were still in place. Par-
 liament, however, passed legislation reinstating South African citizenship to people
 residing in the homelands, enabling them to participate in the April elections. The
 homelands are heavily subsidized by the Government, some arc fragmented parcels
 of territory in impoverished rural areas, and all are agriculturally backward areas
 without the infrastructure needed for development. Of the four so-called independ-
 ent homelands, which only the South African Government recognized as sovereign,
 Transkei, Ciskei, and   Venda   are  ruled  by  military  governments, while
 Bophuthatswana is governed as a one-party state. Authorities in Bophuthatswana
 and Ciskei, in particular, continued to suppress free political activity, especially that
 of the ANC. The six so-called self-governing homelands are Gazankulu, KaNgwane,
 KwaNdebele, KwaZulu, Lebowa and Qwaqwa. According to 1990 census data, the
 homelands, which comprise 13 percent of the country's territory, are home to 33 per-
 cent of South Africa's black population.
 The participation rate of women in the higher echelons of government and politics
 has historically been extremely low. Out of 308 members of the current Parliament,
 
 
 272
 
 only 8 are women. There is only 1 woman minister out of a total of 22, and only
 1 woman deputy minister out of a total of 12. There are no women occupying direc-
 tor-general positions in government departments.
 In devising the interim constitution, the multiparty negotiating council prohibited
 gender discrimination in the bill of rights and provided for the primacy of the prin-
 ciple of equal treatment of women over the right of traditional leaders to exercise
 their tribal prerogatives. The ANC announced that at least a third of its candidates
 for South Africa's new democratically elected parliament will be women.
 In the Supreme Court system, there are currently 142 serving judges, only 1 of
 whom is a woman. A second woman has been appointed and will assume her re-
 sponsibilities in 1994. Out of several hundred senior advocates practicing at the bar,
 only five are female.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government has permitted an increasingly broad range of domestic and inter-
 national organizations to monitor, investigate, and report on human rights issues.
 The U.N., European Union, Commonwealth of Nations, and Organization of Afri-
 can Unity have stationed observer groups in South Africa to monitor the violence.
 These observers attend demonstrations, marches, and other mass events. They also
 monitor the compliance by all participating organizations to both the principles of
 the National Peace Accord andthe Goldstone Commission guidelines for marches
 and political gatherings. In addition, the observers consult regularly with the Gov-
 ernment, political parties, community organizations, and civic groups. The observer
 groups enjoyed near-total freedom of access to all geographic areas, institutions, and
 personalities except in Bophuthatswana.
 The UniteA Nations Observer Mission in South Africa (UNOMSA), Amnesty Inter-
 national, Africa Watch, the ICRC, and other organizations are in general agreement
 that the Government has improved its responsiveness to their requests for access
 to information, officials, and facilities. In January Africa Watch was for the first
 time granted access to detainees in South African police stations and prisons. The
 Government permitted the ICRC to increase the number of its delegates from 12
 to 30 in order to visit more prisons and jails. The ICRC characterized its relations
 with the South African Department of Correctional Services as "good."
 In rontrast, human rights agencies made credible accusations that some local au-
 thorities refused access to files and intimidated investigators of alleged police bru-
 talities and unlawful detentions. For example, an attorney investigating a case of
 unlawful police detention claimed that he was confronted by a group of officers who
 forcibly entered his home, physically threatened him, manhandled his wife, and ad-
 vised him to "stop what he was doing."
 The treatment of human rights monitors by homeland governments at times con-
 trasted sharply with that by the South African Government. While ICRC delegates
 have complete access to prisoners and police station detainees in Bophuthatswana,
 homeland authorities have not agreed to meet with ICRC to discuss ICRC's program
 of basic medical and humanitarian assistance to victims of violence. UNOMSA re-
 ports that despite persistent efforts to observe events there, Bophuthatswana au-
 thorities have invariably denied UNOMSA's requests for permission to enter their
 territory. In a widely publicized incident, a group of UNOMSA, Commonwealth, and
 OAU observers were granted permission to attend an Ascension Day service in
 Bophuthatswana in May, but, upon arrival, were barred from entering the church
 and detained by police for an hour.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The transitional constitution passed by Parliament in December includes a bill of
 rights which guarantees equal protection of the law to every South African citizen,
 regardless of race, gender, religion, disability, language, or social status. The transi-
 tional constitution is to be enacted on April 27, 1994.
 Women.-Although gender discrimination, particularly against black women, re-
 mained a serious problem, Parliament advanced the rights of and protections for
 women when it passed the Promotion of Equality Between Men and Women Act and
 the Prevention of Family Violence Act in September.
 The Promotion of Equality Between Men and Women Act eliminates all remaining
 vestiges of a husband's traditional power over his wife in property and financial
 matters. It also revokes the power of courts to direct that women not be present
 at certain trials, removes all legal differentiation between men and women in mat-
 ters of citizenship, makes the provisions of the Sexual Offenses Act equally applica-
 ble to men and women, abolishes certain provisions in the law which traditionally
 
 
 273
 discriminated against married and pregnant women, repeals the prohibition against
 women entering premises where liquor is sold, and eliminates the legal barrier
 which excluded women from underground mining work and other high-risk occupa-
 tions.
 The Prevention of Family Violence Act simplifies the injunction and arrest proce-
 dures related to domestic abuse against women and children. The Act empowers
 judges and magistrates to enjoin an offending spouse from engaging in certain be-
 haviors and, simultaneously, to issue an order authorizing the automatic arrest of
 the spouse, if he or she breaks the injunction. The resulting penalty can range up
 to 12 months' imprisonment. The Act also places a legal obligation on persons who
 have reason to suspect a child is being abused to report that fact to the appropriate
 authorities, and makes it possible for husbands to be convicted of marital rape.
 Children.-Black children in particular have suffered under South Africa a apart-
 heid regime which segregated much of the black population in poverty-stricken
 homelands and fractured families by forcing their income earners to migrate in
 search of work. Without adequate parental guidance and protection, many children
 have drifted toward a life of crime and delinquency and have been caught up in the
 maelstrom of political violence.
 By all statistical measures of social progress, it is clear that the welfare, protec-
 tion, and development of black children have been almost completely neglected. For
 example, while the infant mortality rate for whites is 6 per thousand, it is 66 per
 thousand for blacks.
 During the year, the police's Child Protection Unit investigated 17,124 crimes
 against children, involving such crimes as rape, indecent assault, assault-both
 common and with intent to do grievous bodily harm-and violations of the Child
 Care Act, among others.
 As South Africa makes the transition to a democratic, nonracial society, the Gov-
 ernment has noted the need to correct the glaring shortfalls in support and services
 for the vast majority of the country's children. Accordingly, a 1992 children's sum-
 mit adopted a Charter for Children's Rights in South Africa, which calls, inter alia,
 for the protection of children from all types of violence.
 National /Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-With a view to the April 1994 nonracial
 elections, the ruling white minority began to share its closely held political powers
 and prerogatives with nonwhites. The TEC, its subeouncils, the IEC, IMC, and IBA
 are administered by people who are both racially diverse and representative of a
 wide spectrum of political thought and opinion. The transitional constitution and
 bill of rights provides for a nonracial society as one of the entrenched rights of all
 South Africans.
 Despite the near-total repeal of the statutory foundations of apartheid, pervasive
 discrimination and segregation persisted in 1993. Nevertheless, some private firms
 and public corporations have voluntarily instituted affirmative action recruitment
 practices, even at the highest levels. Dr. Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, a black woman,
 was appointed to head the SABC, long viewed as the principal propaganda vehicle
 of the Government, and Mr. Yacoob Abba Omar, an Asian, was appointed General
 Manager of Public Relations at ARMSCOR, the centerpiece of South Africa's defense
 industry.
 Persons born before 1991 are still classified in the race group to which they were
 assigned at birth. Until September 1993, the Government continued to discriminate
 in the payment of old age pensions, with whites receiving the highest annuity,
 "coloureds' and Asians somewhat less, and blacks the least. Pension rates wore
 equalized in like employment categories, but disparity persisted between the pen-
 sions of management and clerical workers, who were usually white, and those of
 manual or unskilled laborers, who were usually black. The disparities between man-
 agerial a'nd clerical pensions, on the one hand, and those of manual and unskilled
 laborers, on the other, are a reflection of past race-based discrimination in job op-
 portunities.
 In education the disparity in spending on blacks and whites decreased but re-
 mained great. The average student-teacher ratio in white schools is 20:1, while it
 is 38:1 in black schools, excluding those in the homelands. Under current law, pri-
 mary school education is compulsory only for white, Asian, and mixed-race children.
 Prior to May, the Government charged matriculation examination fees, which pre-
 vented many poor black students from taking the examination and from graduating.
 Of black matriculants, 38 percent passed their 1992 final examinations, whereas 95
 percent of white matriculants did. According to the Department of Education and
 Training, 328,890 students were enrolled in South African universities in 1993 (not
 including students in the so-called independent homelands). Of these, 46.8 percent
 were whlte, 40.2 percent were black, 7.2 percent were Indian, and 5.4 percent were
 "coloured. During 1993 increasing numbers of white schools opted to permit black
 
 
 274
 
 students to enroll. The decision to enroll black students depended upon the voted
 consent of white parents.
 The Government repealed its policy of mandatory military conscription of exclu-
 sively white males. The Government and the ANC began discussions on creating a
 new defense force which would include some of the military wings of liberation
 movements and some homeland armies. Although the Government instituted affirm-
 ative action programs in the security services over the last 4 years, over 90 percent
 of officers are white. Significant changes, however, are in progress as more minori-
 ties and women are graduating from the military academy.
 People with Disabilities.-South Africa has begun to move from a "medical-wel-
 fare" conception of disability to one of civil rights and self- empowerment.
 The participants in the multiparty negotiations included disability as a basis for
 nondiscrimination, along with race, gender, ethnic onr*n, color, sexual orientation,
 age, religion, conscience, creed culture or language. in preparation for the 1994
 eltiUa   wyers for Human Rights and Disabled People South Africa made rep-
 resentations to the Government on such issues as ensuring that polling stations w I
 be architecturally accessible to wheelchair-using voters and that blind voters are
 able to cast a secret ballot.
 In 1991 Lawyers for Human Rights, a leading organization fighting prejudice and
 discrimination, established a disability rights unit. This unit has intervened in some
 50 legal cases and represented numerous disabled people less formally in their deal-
 ings with the bureaucracy. The majority of these cases involved either arbitrary de-
 terminations of ineligibility for social assistance benefits or employer decisions deny-
 ing equal work opportunities on the basis of disability.
 In 1986 architectural requirements were incorporated into the National Building
 Code to ensure equal access to public buildings for the physically disabled. However,
 these were rarely enforced and, until recently, public awareness of them was vir-
 tually nonexistent.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-south Africa's Labor Relations Act entitles all work-
 ers in the private sector to join labor unions of their choosing. Membershi in the
 200 registered trade unions was a pproximately 2.9 million in 1993. An additional
 360,000 workers were members of the 46 unregistered unions, bringing union mem-
 bership to 3.26 million workers or 52 percent of the employed, economically active
 population. Probably more than half of all union members are black.
 Groups historically excluded from labor law, especially farmworkers domestic
 workers, and public sector employees, made some progress in 1993. The basic Con-
 ditions of Employment Act was extended to farmworkers and domestic workers, and
 Parliament passed an Agricultural Labor Relations Act, after considerable consulta-
 tion with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South Af-
 rican Agricultural Union (a farmers' organization), which extends some trade union
 and bargaining rights to farm workers. Nevertheless, domestic and farmworkers do
 not have the rght to strike, as defined by South African labor law. The Parliament
 passed also a Public Sector Labor Relations Act designed to consolidate and clarify
 public sector labor law.
 Nevertheless, South African labor relations continued to be characterized by a
 patchwork of labor law and practice largely designed to inhibit or restrict trade
 union organization and activity. The result is an uneven and sometimes volatile
 labor relations climate, in which trade unions must rely as much on their own orga-
 nization and strength as on their legal rights to achieve their objectives.
 Trade unions continued to accuse the Government and others of using intimida-
 tion and violence to undermine trade union activity. For instance, COSATU, the
 country's largest trade union federation, claimed the KwaZulu government, in collu-
 sion with the IFP and the South African Government, blocked COSATU from orga-
 nizing in northern Natal by denying meeting venues, harassing union members, and
 killing union leadership. The Goldstone Commission, during an investigation of the
 KZP, declared on December 8 that credible evidence indicated the KZP used hit
 squads to attack and kill ANC and COSATU members in northern Natal. A SAP
 raid against organizations supposedly linked to APLA resulted in the offices of the
 National Council of Trade Unions (NACTU), South Africa's second largest trade
 union federation, being ransacked by police and several of its officers and affiliate
 members being detained.
 COSATU is Tormally aligned with the ANC and the SACP. At a September special
 national congress, COSATU declared its support for the ANC in the April 1994 elec-
 tions, and offered 20 federation and affiliate members to stand for election on ANC
 slates. NACTU, while officially independent from political groups, has considerable
 contact with the PAC and the Azanian Peoples' Organization (AZAPO).
 
 
 275
 Historically, both federations have used strikes and "stayaways" to facilitate lib-
 eration alliance objectives in South Africa's negotiated transition to democratic gov-
 ernment. COSATU has played an especially important role in this regard. Its mass
 action expertise, including its mobilization and crowd control capabilities, were par-
 ticularly evident during the nationwide protests following Chris Hani's assassina-
 tion.
 Most private sector workers regardless of race enjoy the right to strike. Work
 stoppages triggered by collective bargaining disputes, and occasionally political is-
 sues, have been commonplace. Industrial action during the first 9 months of 1993
 was down nearly 23 percent from the comparable 1992 period, with strikes account-
 ing for 2.4 million lost workdays.
 Nationwide strikes by the South African Democratic Teachers Unions (SADTU)
 and the South African Municipal Workers Union (SAMWU) accounted for nearly all
 public sector strike activity, or about 70 percent of the lost workdays.
 Wage disputes provoked 67 percent of strike activity in 1993 while grievances,
 retrenchments, and discipline accounted for the remainder. The drop in strike activ-
 ity during 1993 was attributable to greater union concern regarding job security and
 more sophisticated management labor relations techniques.
 Strikers and union leaders are protected by law from retribution by employers for
 union organizing and participation in lawful strikes. Some companies however, use
 what they describe as retrenchments to remove shop stewards and other union offi-
 cials from the work force. Also, the patchwork nature of South African labor law
 the illegality of public sector strikes, and the political nature of some stayaways and
 other industrial action, leave ample room for employers to take disciplinary actions
 against trade unionists. Ultimately, a trade unionist's best protection in such cir-
 cumstances comes more from the strength of the union than the effectiveness of the
 law.
 Historically, public sector employees have be en legally prohibited from striking.
 A Public Sector Labor Relations Act, which takes effect in January 1994, clarifies
 the collective bargaining process for public sector employees but still sharply re-
 stricts strike activity. COSATU has argued that the Government's definition of es-
 sential services is too broad and is specifically designed to block public sector strike
 activity. As was evident by the increase in public sector strike activity in 1993, the
 illegality of striking did not deter major public sector unions.
 South Africa does not restrict union affiliation with regional or international labor
 organizations. COSATU and NACTU are affiliated internationally only with the Or-
 ganization of African Trade Union Unity. Many of their affiliates, as well as inde-
 pendent unions, are members of international trade secretariats and have developed
 contacts with their counterparts in North America and Western Europe.
 A member of the International Labor Organization (ILO) from its inception in
 1919, South Africa withdrew from the organization in 1964, but remained bound by
 the 12 ILO Conventions it had ratified. A 1992 ILO fact-finding mission to South
 Africa made numerous recommendations to bring the country's labor regime up to
 international standards. To date, only a few of these recommendations have been
 implemented.
 Following COSATU protests, the Government did consult with COSATU regard-
 ing the Public Sector Labor Relations Act. The legislation passed parliament and
 will go into effect beginning in 1994. COSATU, while acknowledging that the law
 clarifies the collective bargaining process for public servants, argues that the law's
 broad definition of essential services, and its limitation of lawful strikes to 30 days,
 undercuts trade unions' ability to bargain successfully. In November the ILO's gov-
 erning body voted to suspend its Declaration of Action Against Apartheid. Should
 this decision be ratified by the June 1994 ILO Conference, the ILO will be able to
 establish an office in South Africa and resume direct, in-country contact with the
 trade union movement.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Government does not
 interfere directly with union organizing in the private sector and generally has not
 intervened in the collective bargaining process. The law prohibits discrimination by
 private sector employers against union members and organizers. Complaints regard-
 ing employer discrimination against union members can be brought to the labor
 courts. In the case of a judicial finding against an employer, the court can order re-
 instatement of a worker or other compensation. Disputes over recognition are rel-
 atively few.
 Black unions have made increasing use of South Africa's Industrial Council or
 centralized collective bargaining system. COSATU views the centralized collective
 bargaining system as crucial to trade union economic influence and has sought to
 expand the subject of such bargaining beyond wages and benefits to include indus-
 try restructuring, job grading and training, and other personnel issues. It has se-
 
 
 276
 
 verely criticized business efforts in some sectors to do away with centralized collec-
 tive bargaining.
 Much of COSATU's and other trade union federations' participation in the Na-
 tional Economic Forum and the National Manpower Commission-two tripartite fo-
 rums representing government, labor, and business-is designed to strengthen trade
 union influence over labor and economic policy.
 South Africa's labor law does not apply to the so-called homelands, where union
 organizing is actively discouraged. Nevertheless, trade union activity is on the in-
 crease in almost all the homelands. The struggle between trade unions and home-
 land governments, especially in Bophuthatswana, has been intense and sometimes
 violent. Bophuthatswana enacted regressive labor legislation in 1993 which outlaws
 all foreign trade unions and criminalizes membership in or bargaining with such
 unions. The law has also led to harassment and detainment of union organizers rep-
 resenting various COSATU affiliates.
 Management and black trade unions have voluntarily resorted to private medi-
 ation services to resolve industrial disputes. The Labor Relations Act establishes an
 Industrial Court to rule in labor-management disputes. The most common com-
 plaints filed with the Court concern dismissals, followed by unfair labor practices.
 A Labor Court of Appeals oversees the Industrial Court and can overturn its deci-
 sions.
 South Africa has no export proecessing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution does not prohibit
 forced labor; however, common law does not permit it, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Basic Conditions of Employ-
 ment Act prohibits the employment of minors under the age of 15 in most indus-
 tries, shops, and offices. The Mines and Works Act prohibits minors under 16 from
 working underground. There is no restriction, however, on the age at which a per-
 son may work in agriculture. Use of child labor on farms, often in harsh and dan-
 gerous conditions, is common. Child labor in the informal economy is also common-
 place. Enforcement of existing child labor laws by the Government is weak and reac-
 tive, depending largely on complaints being lodged against specific employers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legal minimum wage in South Afri-
 ca. The Labor Relations Act instead provides a mechanism for negotiations between
 labor and management to set minimum wage standards by industry. Over 100 in-
 dustries come under the provisions of the Act. According to a labor research service
 survey, cleaners, who are among the lowest paid of organized workers, earned an
 average monthly salary of approximately $247 (842 rand). The same survey showed
 drivers earning $428 (1,456 rand) per month.
 A comparison of wage information gathered by the Government's Central Statis-
 tical Service and in a March 1993 study done by the University of Port Elizabeth's
 Institute for Planning Research regarding household subsistence levels, shows that
 in the manufacturing sector alone, only 17 of 30 subsectors paid an average wage
 to black workers higher than the subsistence level salary. In the construction sector,
 average salaries for all subsectors were below subsistence level. Wages paid to work-
 ers in unorganized sectors such as agriculture and domestic household work, are
 also below subsistence level.
 Most industries have a standard workweek of 46 hours, as well as vacation and
 sick leave. Overtime is voluntary and limited to 10 hours a week. The law does not
 mandate a 24-hour rest break. The recent extension of the Basic Conditions of Em-
 ployment Act to farmworkers and domestic workers has, for the first time, estab-
 ished workweek standards for both groups.
 Attention to health and safety issues increased in recent years but remained inad-
 equate. The state-funded National Occupational and Safety Association (NOSA)
 claims the number of workers suffering disabling injuries annually has dropped sig-
 nificantly over the last decade. Nevertheless, injury and death at the workplace, es-
 pecially in heavy manufacturing and mining, is still common. The National Union
 of Mineworkers (NUM) reports that two workers are killed every day in mine acci-
 dents. In 1993 the Government agreed to the NUM's request for a Mines Commis-
 sion of Inquiry to investigate the occupational health and safety laws, but only after
 several mine accidents left nearly 70 miners dead.
 South African occupational safety and health laws, while requiring employers to
 avoid placing their workers at unreasonable risk, do not give workers the right to
 remove themselves from a hazardous job. An employee's decision to leave a hazard-
 ous work site could possibly lead to dismissal, but more probably would result in
 disciplinary action. The occupational safety and health laws do provide protection
 for workers who report or file complaints against unsafe working conditions. Such
 workers may not be dismissed or reduced in rank or salary because of their actions.
