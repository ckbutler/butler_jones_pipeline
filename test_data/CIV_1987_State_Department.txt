 COTE DIVOIRE
 Cote d'Ivoire, a former French colony which gained
 independence through a peaceful transfer of power in 1960, is
 a one-party state with a civilian government. Power is
 concentrated in the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI)
 and its long-time leader, President Felix Houphouet-Boigny,
 now 82 years old. Although the freedom to form other parties
 is included in the Constitution, in practice no other party
 has been allowed to participate in the political process. A
 somewhat more open system has nonetheless evolved since
 competitive elections were held in 1980 for PDCI, municipal,
 and legislative positions. Membership in the party organs,
 the number of municipalities with elected leadership, and
 representation in the National Assembly have all steadily
 expanded in the last 27 years to reflect the growth and
 diversity of the Ivorian population. Basic policies are set
 within the PDCI, and the unicameral National Assembly has
 never publicly challenged a policy put forth by the party.
 The Ministry of Internal Security includes the Surete National
 and the Gendarmerie, the national police service, which is
 structured along French lines. The Surete has an arm that is
 responsible for intelligence gathering and counterespionage.
 The Gendarmerie is responsible for territorial security,
 especially in the rural areas.
 Cote d'Ivoire has enjoyed considerable economic development
 since independence, and the country now has an annual per
 capita income of $786 (1986). The Ivorian economy is market
 oriented and open to foreign investment. During the 1980's,
 however, Cote d'Ivoire has been squeezed by a heavy debt
 burden and falling prices for its exports, principally coffee,
 cocoa, and tropical woods, on world markets. In 1987 the
 country experienced a decline in its gross domestic product
 (GDP) for the first time since independence. Prices for coffee
 and cocoa decreased, and the Government was forced in May to
 suspend payments on its foreign debt.
 The human rights situation in Cote d'Ivoire in 1987 remained
 generally satisfactory. The President continued to advocate
 "dialogue" in settling disputes, seeking to involve dissenters
 in the operation of the one-party structure rather than to
 isolate them.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of officially sanctioned political
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of officially sanctioned abduction or
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Ivorian penal code prohibits official violence without
 "legitimate justification." The coe does not, however,
 specifically mention or prohibit torture nor does it define
 
 
 COTE DIVOIRE
 what constitutes "legitimate justification" or the level of
 violence officials may use if it is "justified." There were
 no eports of torture during 1987, nor any evidence of
 systematic cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of persons,
 including prison inmates. Foreign Africans are routinely
 treated more roughly by police on arrest than are Ivorians.
 Prisoners are usually allowed visits from attorneys of their
 choice and from family members, who must provide food to
 supplement the sparse prison diet. Prison conditions are
 poor. Sanitation and medical facilities are minimal.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Ivorian Constitution and pertinent statutes prohibit
 arbitrary arrest or imprisonment. However, the Government
 occasionally detains persons considered a threat to internal
 security. It also takes firm nonviolent measures against acts
 it considers as threats to internal security. For example,
 the Goverhment has used the threat of forced conscription to
 discourage student involvement in antigovernment activities.
 Some prominent critics of the Government have chosen to live
 and write elsewhere; on the other hand, political exiles from
 a number of countries have found Cote d'Ivoire a hospitable
 safe haven.
 Under the Ivorian penal code, a public prosecutor can order
 the detention of a suspect for up to 48 hours without bringing
 charges. The code dictates that further detention must be
 ordered by a magistrate who can authorize additional periods
 of up to 4 months, but who must also provide the Minister of
 Justice, on a monthly basis, with a written justification for
 continued detention. There have been reports that local police
 have held persons for more than 48 hours in a few cases, but
 that higher officials have disciplined police for these
 violations.
 In July 1987, the Secondary Teachers' Union Congress, one of
 three unions outside the government-sponsored federation, was
 suspended. Thereafter a group of teachers,, supported by the
 Government, ousted'the old leadership, which reportedly
 disagreed with government policy. Some teachers publicly
 protested the Government's action and subsequently, in
 September and October, 16 secondary teachers were detained.
 In a civil trial in December, three teachers were found guilty
 of embezzlement of union funds, fined, and sentenced to several
 months each in prison. Two teachers were released, and 11
 others required to perform national military service.
 There have been no reports of forced labor in Cote d'Ivoire.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The modern judicial system is headed by a Supreme Court and
 includes a Court of Appeals and lower courts. There is
 general agreement that the judiciary is independent of the
 executive in practice as well as under the Constitution's
 separation-of powers.provisions. Defendants accused of .
 felonies or capital crimes have the right to legal counsel,
 and indigent defendants are eligible for court-appointed
 attorneys. In practice, however, such attorneys are not
 readily available.
 Ivorian law establishes the right to a fair public trial.
 This provision is generally respected in urban areas. In
 rural areas, justice is often administered at the village
 
 
 COTE DIVOIRE
 level through traditional institutions which largely handle
 local matters such as domestic disputes, minor land questions,
 and family law. Dispute resolution is by extended debate,
 with no known instances of resort to physical or similar
 punishment. These traditional courts are increasingly
 superseded by the formal judicial system.
 Civilians are not tried by military courts. There are no
 appellate courts within the military justice system. Persons
 convicted by a military tribunal occasionally request the
 Supreme Court to set aside the tribunal's verdict and order a
 retrial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 All Ivorian citizens are considered to be members of the
 PDCI. Party regulations call for active participation in
 party activities and payment of dues which are collected in
 most cases through deductions from pay checks. Most party
 regulations, however, are not strictly enforced. Ivorians who
 choose not to participate do not suffer retaliation. It is
 not known what percentage of the population actively
 participates in the party.
 The Code of Penal Procedures specifies that a police official
 or investigative magistrate may conduct searches of homes
 without a warrant if there is reason to believe there is
 evidence concerning a crime on the premises. The official
 must have the prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects
 seized in the search. He is required to have witnesses to the
 search, which may not take place between the hours of 9 p.m.
 and 4 a.m. Legal safeguards against arbitrary searches
 generally are respected in urban areas but are sometimes
 ignored in the countryside.
 In the past, there have been scattered reports of forced entry
 of the home, specifically involving foreign Africans. There
 is no evidence that correspondence and telephone conversations
 are monitored.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is a limited range of free expression in Cote d'Ivoire.
 Critics of the Government feel free to, and do, express
 themselves in informal situations without fear of reprisal.
 Public criticism of basic policies, the party, or the
 President, however, rarely occurs.
 The Government owns majority shares in the two daily
 newspapers, and their editorial opinion follows the policies
 of the PDCI. The one weekly newsmagazine is controlled by the
 party. Several periodic pamphlets are published privately.
 The Ministry of Information, Culture, Youth, and Sports
 operates radio and television stations and a wire service.
 Government policy assigns the media a positive role in
 promoting national unity and development. It allows criticism
 of failures to execute policy but not criticism of the policies
 themselves. Investigative journalism is permitted except with
 respect to the Government and its policies. The Government
 has occasionally banned a critical publication, such as the
 book, "Islam and the Cote d'Ivoire.*. Foreign publications are
 readily available, but occasionally issues which are
 
 
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 particularly critical of the Ivorian Government, the party, or
 the President are seized. The magazine Jeune Afrique was
 banned from the country in November after the Government took
 offense at one of its articles.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is generally respected, except when the
 Government perceives a significant and immediate danger to
 public order. Limits, such as the cancellation of gatherings,
 occasionally are placed on the expression of controversial
 views in public forums. As a result of student disorders in
 1982, only apolitical gatherings are now permitted on campus,
 but students still speak freely about politics in informal
 situations. There is little tradition of assembly for purely
 political purposes outside the established party structure.
 Major unions are organized within a government-sponsored labor
 confederation, the General Union of Cote d'Ivoire Workers
 (UGTCI). Secondary, university, and primary school teachers'
 unions have been exceptions and until this year they each
 mointained.independent trade unions. In July 1987, the
 congress of the Secondary School Teachers' Union was
 interrupted by disturbances, whereupon the union leadership
 suspended the proceedings. A second group thereafter convoked
 the congress again and elected a new leadership which won
 government endorsement. Spokesmen for both secondary and
 university teachers accused the Government of interference in
 internal union affairs and abridgement of their right to
 choose their own. leadership. Shortly after the replacemert of
 the Secondary Teachers' Union leadership, the Primary School
 Teachers' Union asked to join the UGTCI, leaving only the
 university teachers outside the fold.
 The leader of the UGTCI occupies a senior position in the
 party hierarchy. Union membership is encouraged but not
 mandatory... The UGTCI is a relatively passive coordinating
 mechanism rather than an active force for workers' rights.
 However, the UGTCI hap representatives in every major business
 enterprise, and the UGTCI secretariat often plays a mediation
 or conciliation role in relations between labor and management
 in individual businesses. Collective bargaining within each
 company takes place under UGTCI leadership.
 The right to strike exists under statute, but in practice
 strikes are rarely authorized by the UGTCI. Although there
 were no official strikes in 1987, there were several "work
 stoppages." In one case, after workers had refused to work
 for 7 days and the UGTCI was unable to settle the dispute, the
 Government stepped in and settled the dispute in favor of the
 workers.
 The 1983 secondary teachers' strike was broken by a
 presidential decree ordering teachers back to the classrooms
 and threatening them with fines and prison sentences for
 noncompliance. Generally, the Government negotiates with
 strikers and resolves at least some of their economic
 grievances. Aside from the dispute with secondary school
 teachers and the arrest and detention of 16 of their members,
 there have been no reports that professional groups have
 experienced persecution or harassment. The Government,
 however, attempts to bring such groups under its wing or that
 of the party.
 
 
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 Unions, trade associations, and professional bodies are
 permitted to maintain relations with recognized international
 professional, bodies in their fields. The UGTCI is a member of
 the continent-wide Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 Cote d'Ivoire is a member-state of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO), and the UGTCI participates in Ivorian
 delegations to ILO conferences and events.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There are no known impediments to religious expression. There
 is no dominant religion, and no particular faith is favored by
 the Government. The open practice of religion is permitted,
 and there are no restrictions on religious ceremonies or
 teaching.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Ivorian Government exercises minimal control over domestic
 travel, but internal roadblocks for identity and customs
 checks are common. Persons stopped at such roadblocks are
 sometimes harassed by the police. Ivorians can travel abroad
 freely and can emigrate without discrimination. Ivorians have
 the right of voluntary repatriation. There are no known cases
 of revocation of citizenship.
 Cote d'Ivoire's refugee and asylum practices are liberal. The
 country has resettled or granted safe haven to Angolans,
 Burkinabe, Eritreans, Ghanaians, Guineans, Liberians, and
 Vietnamese.
 While in Cote d'Ivoire, refugees receive 1-year renewable
 resident visas for their first 5 years in the country, after
 which they may apply for permanent residence. Cote d'Ivoire
 does not take any significant responsibility for the economic
 and social welfare of refugees, which becomes the concern of
 private and international organizations.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Political participation is limited to the PDCI, which is
 headed by President Houphouet-Boigny. No opposition groups
 exist openly, and their formation is discouraged. Therefore,
 in practice the citizens of Cote d'Ivoire are unable to change
 the one-party system of government.
 Within the party, the President wields power through a
 13-member Executive Committee, a 57-member political bureau,
 and a 208-member steering committee. Political power is
 concentrated in the President's hands, and most important
 decisions are made by the President himself. The National
 Assembly initiated its first legislation in history to promote
 job creation in the rural and small business sectors during
 the 1986-87 legislative year. The Assembly also confirms and
 ratifies legislative initiatives received from the President.
 Within this strict one-party system, the Ivorian Government
 continues to encourage more open participation in the
 political process by expanding the size of the party
 institutions and by permitting party members to contest
 legislative, municipal, and local party elections. In the
 case of the 1985 legislative elections, for example,
 
 
 81
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 approximately 577 individuals ran for the 175-seat National
 Assembly. Many incumbents were defeated in all three
 elections.
 .Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovermental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Governmenthas been cooperative toward inquiries into its
 human rights situation, the last of which occurred in 1981.
 Cote d'Ivoire has a local chapter of Amnesty International.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no apparent discrimination based on race, sex,
 religion, language, or social status. The most lucrative
 government and private sector jobs seem to be concentrated
 among the minority Muslim (30 percent) and Christian (15
 percent) populations, a phenomenon attributable more to
 urbanization and access to education than to a systematic
 pattern of discrimination. However, all religions are
 represented at top levels of government and throughout
 society. Although French is the official language and the
 language of instruction in the schools, radio and television
 broadcasts are provided in major local languages. Social and
 economic mobility are not limited by policy or custom.
 Non-Ivorian Africans living in the Cote d'Ivoire are estimated
 at over 3 million; about half come from Burkina Faso and the
 rest from other nearby countries. These foreign workers play
 an important role in the Ivorian economy, especially in
 agriculture. The Government's policy of Ivorianization
 requires that all positions be offered to Ivorians before
 foreigners; this prevents foreign Africans from obtaining most
 of the higher paying wage and salary jobs in the modern sector.
 Althopgh males clearly play the preponderant role overall,
 some Ivorian traditional societies accord women considerable
 political and economic power. Nonetheless, in rural areas
 tribal customs dictate the division of menial tasks, which are
 performed mostly by women. Children often work on their
 parents' land, and in Abidjan some children routinely act as
 vendors of consumer goods in the informal sector. Female
 circumcision continues to be practiced among elements of the
 Ivorian population, although it is rare in urban populations.
 Official party policy is to encourage full participation by
 women in social, economic, and political life. The role of
 women has recently won somewhat greater prominence. In July
 1986, the President appointed a new Minister for Women's
 Affairs, a cabinet-level position first created in 1976 but
 which had been vacant for almost 2 years. Women remain
 lightly represented at the higher levels of government and the
 party. Ten women are deputies in the 175-seat National
 Assembly and 28 women are members of the 208-member Steering
 Committee of the PDCI.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Government enforces a comprehensive work code of law, the
 Code du Travail, governing the terms and conditions of service
 for salaried workers and providing for occupational safety and
 health standards.
 
 
 82
 COTE D'IVOIRE
 Extensive safeguards protect those employed in the modern
 sector against unjust compensation, excessive hours, and
 capricious discharge from employment. In most instances, the
 minimum working age is 16, and minimum wages vary according to
 occupation, e.g., a skilled worker would earn the equivalent
 of $0.77 per hour. Wage levels increase for workers with more
 experience and skills. Month-long paid vacations and a
 substantial severance pay are guaranteed. Government medical
 insurance and retirement programs provide an element of income
 security for salaried employees in the modern sector.
 However, there is a large informal sector of the economy,
 involving both urban and especially rural workers, in which
 many of these occupational regulations and safeguards are
 enforced erratically at best.
