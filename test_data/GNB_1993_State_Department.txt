 GUINEA-BISSAU
 The Republic of Guinea-Bissau is led by General Joao Bernardo Vieira, who
 serves as Head of State, President of the Council of State, Commander in Chief, and
 General Secretary of the previously sole legal political party, the African Party for
 the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC). In elections held in
 June 1989, Vieira, the only candidate, was elected for a second 5-year term as Presi-
 dent. Effective power and day-to-day decisions rest in the hands of the President
 and the Counci[ of State. The Government controls the pace of political reform and
 in 1993 formed a National Elections Commission charged with organizing legislative
 and presidential elections in March 1994. In accordance with the 1991 onstitution,
 it legalized 12 political parties, including the PAIGC, which are expected to partici-
 pate in these elections. Only the PAIGC is represented in the National Assembly.
 The national police forces have primary responsibility for internal security, while
 the armed forces (FARP) provide for external security and may be called upon to
 assist with internal security in case of emergency. Both institutions are under the
 control of the Government and were responsible for human rights abuses.
 The population of 1 million is engaged largely in subsistence agriculture. There
 are some exports of cashews, peanuts, and fish. Following the Government's failed
 postindependence efforts to exercise central control over the economy, the PAIGC
 started liberalizing the economy in 1986. International Monetary Fund stabilization
 and World Bank restructuring agreements led to some improvement in the economic
 situation. However, the economy remained weak due to the lack of monetary and
 fiscal control, a small and inexperienced private sector, and a heavy debt burden.
 Although progress was made, notably in legislation providing for legislative and
 presidential elections, human rights remained circumscribed. The Government con-
 tinued its practices of arbitrary detentions, physical mistreatment and other forms
 
 
 of harassment, occasionally targeting supporters of opposition political parties. Pre-
 ferring indefinite detention in many instances, it rarely brings cases before the
 courts; and thus is often responsible for the denial of fair trial. Controversy still sur-
 rounds the assassination of a key military commander, an incident which the Gov-
 ernment claims was part of a coup attempt on March 17. Members of the police and
 security forces were rarely tried or punished for abuses.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In March the commander of the
 rapid reaction forces, Major Robalo, was murdered, allegedly by a man named
 Amadu Mane. Security forces captured Mane, who remained in prison awaiting trial
 at year's end. Government and military officials alleged opposition party support for
 the killing, while opposition leaders accused the Government of instigating it. The
 Government detained some 49 persons for involvement in the killing (see Section
 I.d.).
 In August the authorities freed seven police officials jailed in 1992 for involve-
 ment in beating to death Ussumane Quade, a military officer, even though their
 trial had not concluded. The Government announced that Quade had committed sui-
 cide but refused to return his body to relatives for burial.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known cases of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits cruel and inhuman punishment, and evidence
 obtained through torture or other coercion is invalid, these constitutional provisions
 are rarely enforced. Security and police authorities systematically employ torture
 and abusive interrogation methods, usually in the form of severe beatings, and are
 rarely punished. Prison conditions are poor but not life threatening. There were no
 reported deaths as a result of imprisonment during 1993. Women are kept in sepa-
 rate areas within prisons. There were no reports of rape in prison in 1993.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In the aftermath of the March 17 case,
 49 persons were detained without charge or trial for 2 months while a military com-
 mission of inquiry investigated. Among the detainees were the president of one op-
 position political party and an active member of another.
 In June, following the commencement of closed trials by the Supreme Military
 Tribunal, 10 of the detainees, including those from the opposition, were released
 from  prison, pending the outcome of charges-not yet specified-placed against
 them. Ambiguity surrounded the Tribunal's legal right to detain the suspects and
 conduct a commission of inquiry investigation. During the first 2 months of the de-
 tainees' imprisonment, the Government denied the defendants access to lawyers and
 family members, but authorized medical care and visits by the International Com-
 mittee of the Red Cross and the Human Rights League of Guinea-Bissau (LDH).
 The legal system provides for procedural rights, such as the right to counsel, the
 right to be released if charges are not brought within a short period of time, and
 the right to a speedy trial. However, the judicial system generally fails to provide
 adequate protection of these rights.
 Security and police forces continue to have the administrative power to detain
 suspects without reference to judicial authority or warrants occasionally through
 the device of house arrest. Once detained, the Government holds persons without
 charge or trial for extended periods of time, sometimes incommunicado. Bail proce-
 dures are not routinely observed.
 The number of political detainees (pretrial) and prisoners held at year's end was
 unknown. Human rights monitors estimated that 90 percent of the prison popu-
 lation are pretrial detainees arrested without warrants and imprisoned without
 charges filed against them. There were no known cases of exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial. -Traditional law still prevails in most rural areas,
 and many urban dwellers bring judicial disputes to traditional counselors to avoid
 the costs and problems associated with the official legal system. With some excep-
 tions, the official judicial system is based on the Portuguese model, which does not
 use juries, and courts are usually composed of three judges, two assistants, and a
 presiding officer for a tribunal of six. Because of low salaries and a lack of training,
 judges ar sometimes subject to political pressures and corruption. Defendants have
 the right to private counsel or may choose to be represented by a court-appointed
 attorney who generally receives no pay. Judges' determination as to who is given
 access to accusatory material and witnesses is sometimes arbitrary.
 Trials involving state security are conducted by the Supreme Military Tribunal
 and are usually not open to outside observers. Military courts try all cases involving
 members of the armed forces as defendants or accused. The Supreme Court is the
 
 
 126
 final court of appeal for both civilian and military cases, except those involving na-
 tional security matters. In this instance the Council of State reviews all decisions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 1991 Constitution provides for the inviolability of domicile, person, and correspond-
 ence, but these rights are not always respected. Judicial search warrants are seldom
 utilized. International and domestic mail may be subject to surveillance, and police
 sometimes force entry into private homes. Membership in the PAIGC, while not re-
 quired, plays a role in government appointments and promotion opportunities, par-
 ticularly in the interior.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press. It states that citizens have the right to express themselves freely and
 make public their views by all means available, as well as having the right to be
 informed and to inform without hindrance or discrimination. This right cannot be
 limited or hindered by any form of censorship. Citizens openly debated the at-
 tributes of the 12 legalized political parties and their candidates.
 On August 2, by order of the Supreme Military Tribunal, the authorities arrested
 opposition leaders Joao Da Costa and Tagne Na Waie for having violated the condi-
 tions of their earlier release by engaging in political activities, notably by appearing
 on a television show and discussing various political subjects. They were released
 on August 6 after a brief appearance before the Supreme Military Tribunal's pros-
 ecutor.
 The television, radio, and newspapers continue to provide a relatively balanced se-
 lection of public opinion, and opposition political parties took advantage of their ac-
 cess to television and radio air time.
 All media are owned and controlled by the Government, with the exception of sev-
 eral opposition party monthly publications and one irregularly appearing news-
 paper. Stron g criticism of the Government occurs only in the opposition papers. The
 Government s PAIGC party tended to receive greater media coverage than other po-
 litical groups. Journalists continued to practice some self-censorship. One opposition
 party unsuccessfully tried to establish its own radio station; it is not clear whether
 this initiative failed because of political or economic considerations.
 Academic freedom is observed in schools and research institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of assembly and association, government approval is required for
 all assemblies and demonstrations. Most opposition parties, including several fledg-
 ling political and labor groups, held legal political rallies. The opposition jointly or-
 ganized and received government authorization for a demonstration in February
 which was closely supervised but not disturbed by security forces. There were con-
 tinued credible reports of the local authorities verbally harassing opposition ele-
 ments during rallies in the interior.
 Several new professional, religious, and regionally oriented associations formed.
 One new political party was legalized, bringing the total to 12.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Religious freedom is provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Christians, Muslims, and animists worship freely, and pros-
 elytizing is permitted. Religious groups must be licensed by the Government, but
 there were no reports of groups being refused licenses.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In connection with the March 17 case, the authorities ordered opposi-
 tionpolitical party members Joao Da Costa and Tagne Na Waie to remain within
 the Bissau area unless their travel to other areas was authorized by the Supreme
 Military Tribunal.
 Foreign travel and emigration are generally not restricted. Citizens have the right
 to return and are not subject to political revocation of their citizenship. There are
 no provisions for asylum.
 The number of refugees from the Casamance region of southern Senegal, where
 Senegalese troops have been fighting Casamance rebels, increased dramatically be-
 tween the end of 1992 and mid-1993, with estimates of at least 14,000 persons, not
 including those who remained followingfighting in 1990 and 1991. The Government
 cooperated with international relief efforts and continued its policy of placing no
 pressure on refugees to return to Senegal.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although citizens are not free to change their government, slow progress was
 made towards democratic and multiparty presidential and legislative elections, now
 scheduled for March 27, 1994. The National Assembly approved changes in the elec-
 
 
 toral law, including provisions for secret balloting and universal suffrage, and
 named several independent members to the National Elections Commission which
 began preparations for an electoral census and a civic education program.
 While the Government consulted opposition parties to a greater degree than in
 the past, the Government continued to control the pace of reform, and the PAIGC-
 dominated National Assembly rejected some of the measures unanimously approved
 by the multiparty Transitional Commission established in 1992.
 Some citizens are disqualified as presidential candidates because of a controver-
 sial new law requiring all candidates to have parents and at least one grandparent
 on both the maternal and paternal sides of the family born in Guinea-Bissau.
 Women are inadequately represented in the political process. Two of 17 Cabinet
 ministers are women (one is head of the Ministry for the Advancement of Women).
 In the National Assembly, 19 percent of the members are female.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Human Rights League of Guinea-Bissau (LDH) claims over 3 000 members
 throughout the count  and is the leading organization for advancing human rights.
 It is unded by memer' dues as well ashy assistance from foreign nongovern-
 mental organizations and several countries, including Germany and-Sweden. The
 LDH and international human rights monitors continued to investigate human
 rights cases without overt government interference until May, when the Govern-
 ment began refusing access to all prisoners on the basis of allegations of LDH in-
 volvement in the alleged March 17 coup attempt. Members of the LDH reported oc-
 casional verbal harassment by police. The Government did not respond to LDH re-
 ports on mistreatment of prisoners and poor prison conditions, or to Amnesty
 International's call for an inquiry into the death of Ussumane Quade (see Section
 L.a.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-While officially prohibited by law, discrimination against women per-
 sists. Women are responsible for the majority of the work on subsistence farms and
 have limited access to education, especially in the rural areas. Women do not have
 equal access to employment opportunities, largely due to their level of education,
 and because, among certain ethnic groups, women are prohibited from owning or
 managing land and inheriting other property.
 Physical violence, including wife beating, is an accepted means of settling domes-
 tic disputes. While police will intervene in domestic disputes if requested, the Gov-
 ernment has not undertaken specific measures to counter social pressure against re-
 porting domestic violence, rape, incest, and other mistreatment of women. Rapes are
 infrequent.
 Children.-Government expenditures on children's welfare are inadequate, but
 roughly commensurate with total resources available to the State. There are no
 known patterns of societal abuses directed specifically against children.
 Within certain ethnic groups, especially t e Fulas and Mandinkas, female genital
 mutilation (circumcision) is still a widespread practice and occurs at an early age.
 It continues to take place despite official prohibition and educational campaigns as-
 sisted by United Nations organizations which educate the public about the damag-
 ingphysical and psychological aspects of the practice.
 People with Disabilities.-The law does not specifically prohibit discrimination
 against people with disabilities, and in practice persons with disabilities have un-
 equal access to employment and education. The State has made some efforts to as-
 sist disabled veterans through pension programs, but these programs do not ade-
 quately address veterans' health, housing, and nutritional needs. There is no legisla-
 tion mandating accessibility.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Constitution grants all workers except
 military personnel the freedom to form and join independent trade unions, and leg-
 islation approved in 1991 enumerates the rights and obligations of new unions. The
 vast majority of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture. Only a small
 percentage of workers are in the wage sector and are organized.
 There were 11 individual craft unions registered and operating during 1993. All
 unions are officially inde  ndent of the Government but seven unions are affiliated
 with the National Trade Union Confederation (UNT(6) which still retains close infor-
 mal ties to the PAIGC. The four independent unions are comprised of teachers,
 transport and communications workers, judicial employees, and health workers. The
 law does not favor UNTG-affiliat8d unions over others.
 
 
 128
 The Constitution recognizes the right of workers to strike and in theory, workers
 have protection from retribution against strike activities. The only legal restriction
 on strikes is the requirement for prior notice, which must include the reasons for
 the strike and its expected duration. There were no illegal strikes in 1993. Three
 legal strikes occurred: two of these resulted in direct negotiations with government
 employers that satisfied most of the demands of the striking employees. A third
 strike carried out by the Teachers' Union was not resolved, and despite laws prohib-
 iting such practices, retribution against strikers took place. Several teachers sup-
 porting the strike lost their jobs or were transferred to positions of lesser respon-
 sibility. Several other labor disputes were resolved via nonbinding arbitration con-
 ducted by unions or by the Mimstry of Public Works, Civil Service, and Administra-
 tive Reform.
 All unions legally have and exercise the right to affiliate freely with national con-
 federations and international labor organizations of their choice. Unions cultivate
 contacts with a wide range of labor organizations worldwide. UNTG is affiliated
 with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution does not
 provide for or protect the right to bargain collectively, and in practice there were
 no instances of genuine collective bargaining. Most wages are established in bilat-
 eral negotiations between workers and employers, taking into consideration the
 minimum salaries set annually by the Government's Council of Ministers. Because
 of the shortage of wage-paying jobs, however, the employer in many cases is free
 to set salaries.
 The Government's provision for the protection of workers against antiunion dis-
 crimination has very little effect where union membership is very low. Despite pres-
 sure from the International Labor Organization, no laws were adopted to establish
 penal sanctions against employers practicing such discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is not
 permitted by law and not known to exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The General Labor Act of 1986 es-
 tablished a minimum age of 14 for general factory labor and 18 for heavy or dan-
 gerous labor, including all labor in mines. These minimum age requirements are
 generally followed in the small wage sector, but there is minimal enforcement by
 inspectors from the Ministry of Administrative Reform, Civil Service and Labor in
 other sectors. Children in the cities are often involved in street trading, and those
 in rural communities do domestic and field work for no pay. The Government does
 not attempt to discourage these traditional practices.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Although not consistently enforced, the Gov-
 ernment's Council of Ministers establishes minimum wage rates for all categories
 of work, the lowest of which is the monthly wage of $13.95 (150,000 Pesos), set an-
 nually. This wage is inadequate to maintain even a minimum standard of living,
 and workers must supplement their income through other work, reliance on the ex-
 tended family, and subsistence agriculture. Although not enforced, the maximum
 number of hours in a normal workweek is 40.
 Legal health and safety standards for workers are established through the co-
 operation of the unions and the Ministry of Administrative Reform, Civil Service,
 and Labor, they are then adopted into law by the National Assembly. However,
 these standards are not enforced, and many persons work in conditions which en-
 danger their health and safety.
