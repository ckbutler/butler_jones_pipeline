 BANGLADESH
 Prior to December 6, Bangladesh was ruled by President H.M.
 Ershad, the former Army Chief of Staff, who seized power in
 1982 in a bloodless coup. On December 6, Chief Justice
 Shahabuddin Ahmed became Acting President of an interim
 Government in Bangladesh during a ceremony in which President
 Ershad first swore him in as Vice President and then
 resigned. Earlier that day, the former President had
 dissolved the Parliament. Acting President Shahabuddin was
 the choice of the major opposition parties to oversee the
 process of parliamentary elections, which are scheduled to be
 held on February 27, 1991.
 This abrupt change followed 2 months of demonstrations by
 opposition parties calling for President Ershad's
 resignation. Violent confrontations between opposition
 demonstrators and police and paramilitary forces left about
 100 dead and approximately 1,000 injured. A state of
 emergency was imposed on November 27, suspending basic
 freedoms including freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and
 association. The state of emergency was lifted on December 5.
 Bangladesh, under its Constitution, has a presidential form of
 government and a unicameral Parliament of 300 members. The
 President appoints the ministers, 20 percent of whom do not
 have to be Members of Parliament. The Prime Minister, also
 appointed by the President, serves more as the leader of the
 parliamentary majority than as leader of the Government.
 Parliament held two sessions in 1990.
 The police and paramilitary forces, all of which are
 controlled by the Home Affairs Ministry, bear primary
 responsibility for maintaining internal security.
 Paramilitary forces include the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), which
 guards the borders; the Bangladesh Ansars, a home guard which
 assists the police in maintaining law and order; and the
 Village Defense Parties (VDP), a uniformed but normally
 unarmed local militia. The police and security forces have
 been responsible for human rights abuses. The army plays an
 internal security role in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT),
 where attacks by tribal insurgents against security forces,
 Bengali settlers, and other tribals continued in 1990.
 Bangladesh remains one of the world's poorest and most densely
 populated countries. Government programs aim at economic
 development through reduced population growth, increased crop
 yields, decentralization of administration, and increased
 freedom for the private sector. Largely as a result of
 bountiful harvests, the economy had begun to recover from the
 devastating flood of 1988. It was dealt a major blow in
 August, however, by the Persian Gulf crisis which increased
 oil prices and forced the return of over 60,000 wage earners
 from the Gulf. Widespread civil disturbances in October and
 November further weakened the economy.
 Overall, the human rights situation was little improved in
 1990. Until December 6, there remained significant
 restrictions on the ability of citizens to change their
 government through democratic processes and on freedom of the
 press. There are also major restrictions on women's and
 workers' rights, as well as problems of arbitrary detentions,
 prisoner abuse, and deaths in police custody.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Violent confrontations between opposition groups,
 progovernment groups, and government security forces resulted
 in about 100 deaths and approximately 1,000 people injured
 between October 10 and December 6. Some casualties were a
 result of the use of excessive force-by security forces;
 others were due to interparty clashes and attacks on security
 forces. By year's end, no investigations of these incidents
 had been initiated.
 Following President Ershad's resignation, there were numerous
 incidents of revenge attacks against members of Ershad's
 Jatiyo Party that included destruction of homes, other
 property, and party offices.
 The March elections held in 427 of Bangladesh's 460
 subdistricts were relatively peaceful, but sporadic violence
 resulted in more than 20 deaths and over 100 injuries. There
 were a number of credible~reports of deaths of persons in 1989
 and 1990 while in police custody (see Section l.c.). There
 was also periodic violence on university campuses as student
 wings of various political parties clashed repeatedly, causing
 injuries and sometimes deaths.
 For a discussion of killings related to the Chittagong Hill
 Tracts (CHT) insurgency, see Section l.g.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed reports of disappearance resulting
 from official actions in 1990. As in the past, however, armed
 tribal insurgents in the CHT kidnaped a number of persons in
 raids on Bengali and tribal villages.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although the Constitution forbids torture and cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading punishment or treatment, police treatment of
 accused criminals and other detainees, including those held on
 political charges, is usually 'rough and can include torture
 and other abusive treatment during interrogations. Beginning
 in 1989, human rights groups began to devote particular
 attention to investigating fatalities in police custody, which
 according to press reports had increased to 21 in 19B9 from 8
 in 1988. It is not clear if this reported rise is the result
 of greater police brutality or is simply the result of having
 better information in 1989.
 In January 1990, Amnesty International (AI) published a
 special paper on four cases in which persons died while in
 police custody. The Government maintains that in three of
 these cases the victims died as a result of beatings by
 persons other than the police prior to their arrest. In the
 fourth case the Government admitted probable police brutality
 but there was no indication that charges had been filed by
 year's end.
 
 
 1389
 BANGLADESH
 Human rights groups publicized the death in Chittagong in May
 of a student leader who was fatally beaten, allegedly while in
 police custody. At year's end, the incident was still being
 investigated by the authorities. During nationwide student
 protests in October, a student at Rajshahi University died of
 head wounds while in police custody. According to press
 reports, the police claimed to have arrested him for robbery,
 but could not provide reasonable cause for his injuries.
 Human rights groups also documented another case in July in
 which police allegedly applied electric shocks to a suspect
 who had refused to pay a bribe. There were also persistent
 reports of the rape of female prisoners.
 Three classes of prison facilities exist. Class "C"
 cells-which generally hold common criminals, suspected
 terrorists, and low-level political workers--are the worst.
 They often have dirt floors, no furnishings, poor quality
 food, and the use of handcuffs and fetters is common.
 Prisoners in these cells reportedly suffer the most abuse,
 such as beatings and being forced to kneel for long periods.
 Conditions in "B" and "A" cells are markedly better, with the
 latter reserved for "prominent" persons.
 Mistreatment of ordinary citizens frequently goes unpunished,
 but police and jail officials involved in mistreating
 prisoners are sometimes disciplined in cases where the victim
 or his family and friends can attract publicity or persuade
 human rights groups to investigate the allegations. Despite
 increased public awareness, however, abuses continue. Reports
 persisted of abusive treatment of citizens by a variety of
 lower-level government officials, party bosses, and labor
 leaders. This treatment included the use of violence and the
 threat of violence.
 The Government has not interfered with human rights groups'
 inquiries into cases of prisoner abuse but seldom undertakes
 its own investigation and seldom punishes those responsible
 for such abuses. Apparently in response to reports of
 prisoner abuse, the Home Affairs Minister now requires a
 magistrate's investigation of any deaths in police custody.
 For a discussion of torture and other cruel treatment related
 to the CHT insurgency, see Section 1.g.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Special Powers Act of 1974 (SPA), the Government can
 detain a person without charge for an initial period of 30
 days to prevent the commission of "any prejudicial act" as
 loosely defined -in the legislation. The Government is
 obligated to charge the detainee formally by the end of this
 period or release him if it fails to file a charge. The
 person can legally be held until completion of an
 investigation if the Government brings a charge. In practice,
 though not in law, the detainee has 15 days to respond to the
 specific charge in writing to the Home Affairs Ministry, which
 can grant early release. Detentions under the SPA are not
 subject to judicial review until after 6 months, at which time
 a committee of three jurists examines the case to ascertain
 whether there is sufficient reason to continue the detention.
 Although the detainee is theoretically entitled to see a
 lawyer at the time he is detained, in practice a lawyer is
 generally not allowed to see the detainee until a specific
 charge has been filed.
 
 
 1390
 BANGLADESH
 According to a 1989 Supreme Court decision, abuse of the SPA
 is rampant. Human rights activists report that the SPA is
 often used against political opponents in rural areas and to
 detain indefinitely suspected criminals against whom the
 Government has insufficient evidence for a formal charge. The
 Supreme Court criticized the Government's practice of issuing
 new detention orders against persons as soon as the original
 detention order has expired or been vacated by the courts.
 The Government put the number of SPA detainees at 3,088 as of
 June, an increase from the 2,157 registered as of April 30,
 1989. Persons detained under the SPA are often subsequently
 charged under criminal statutes.
 In September the Government announced its intention to
 introduce a bill in Parliament to repeal the SPA. Almost
 immediately after assuming power, the Acting President
 promised to repeal the SPA soon. On December 12, however, the
 interim'Government used the SPA to intern the former
 President, his wife and prominent members of the former regime.
 The right of a detainee to a judicial determination of the
 legality of his detention exists in local law. Bangladeshi
 legal and human rights organizations, however, continued to
 report cases of suspects who were arrested on minor charges
 but who remained in jail for long periods without trial.
 The state of emergency in effect from November 27 until
 December 5 permitted arrests for strikes; processions,
 political or labor activities, or for making or printing
 statements against the Government. There were reports of
 resulting arrests, but the number and disposition of the cases
 is unknown.
 There were no reports of persons being exiled in 1990.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 While the Supreme Court is generally considered independent in
 most cases, the Government sometimes brings pressure to bear
 in political or security cases. Civilian courts hear civil
 and criminal cases in public trials, and the right of counsel
 is respected. Criminal courts are rife with corruption.
 Though generally considered fair, civil courts are
 overburdened and effectively available only to those who can
 afford representation. The time-consuming and expensive
 process of pursuing cases discourages many from seeking
 redress through the courts. There are few legal aid programs
 to assist litigants and no public defenders. Although the
 legal time limit for disposal of criminal cases is 240 days at
 the district level and 120 days at the magistrate level, a
 shortage of judges and courts and a backlog of over 500,000
 criminal and civil cases makes longer delays a common
 occurrence. Prominent lawyers believe there is little chance
 these backlogs will be cleared.
 The Government claims to hold no political prisoners.
 Bangladesh human rights groups assert, however, that some
 persons detained under the SPA are actually political
 prisoners. Although such groups do not maintain statistics on
 the number of political prisoners in the country, informed
 observers believe the number could run into the hundreds,
 particularly during periods of political unrest.
 
 
 1391
 
 BANGLADESH
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Bangladesh law ordinarily requires a judicial warrant before
 authorities enter a home, and courts require evidence
 supporting a reasonable suspicion before issuing a warrant.
 However, the SPA permits authorities to search premises
 without a warrant under certain circumstances, and authorities
 have in the past entered the homes of opposition leaders and
 detained individuals and searched their premises without
 warrants. The Government's civilian and military intelligence
 services are widely believed to monitor the opposition by such
 means as selective wiretaps and interception of mail.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 While government forces generally exercised restraint in
 dealing with the October and November disturbances, they were
 accused of excessive use of force in firing on demonstrators
 in several instances.
 Despite government efforts to address tribal grievances in
 1990 by devolving power upon locally elected district councils
 in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, the longstanding Shanti Bahini
 (Peace Force) insurgent movement remained active. This
 insurgency began in the early 1970's and has been sustained by
 the tribal people's fears that their traditional way of life
 and special status in the hill areas are being undermined by
 settlers from the overpopulated plains. Despite government
 policy that since 1985 has discouraged settlement in the Hill
 Tracts, Bengali plainsmen continue to settle there. More than
 300,000 ethnic Bengalis are now in the three hill districts
 along with approximately 500,000 tribals.
 Access to the Hill Tracts is limited by government travel
 restrictions, difficult terrain, and the unsafe travel
 conditions caused by the ongoing insurgency. Due to this
 limited access, the truth of accusations of atrocities and
 abusive treatment of civilians committed by the insurgents or
 security forces cannot be verified. In 1990 the security
 forces remained under strict government orders to avoid
 reprisals against the tribal people and to prevent others from
 such retaliations. Some tribals allege that the security
 forces attempt to elicit cooperation by detaining tribals for
 short periods following Shanti Bahini attacks. However,
 complaints of human right  violations in the Hill Tracts
 continued to be far fewer than those received as recently as
 1987. Al and local human rights groups continue to monitor
 the Chittagong Hill Tracts situation closely and to encourage
 the Government to safeguard the rights of tribal people.
 In an effort to disrupt the Government's local autonomy
 program, Shanti Bahini insurgents targeted tribal leaders,
 military personnel, and Bengali and tribal villages, resulting
 in more deaths and destruction of property in 1990. Precise
 figures are not available, but these attacks killed dozens of
 persons. In May insurgents forced some 1,000 tribals to flee
 their homes. One report estimated that 15,000 tribespeople
 crossed over to India between February and May. However,
 during 1990, thousands of tribals who had fled to India since
 1986 returned to the CHT, where the Government is attempting
 to rehabilitate them. Some tribals charge that the army is
 keeping them concentrated in camps with little opportunity to
 work, thus perpetuating dependence on the national Government.
 
 
 1392
 BANGLADESH
 During 1990 the Government began to devolve authority upon
 local councils, as required by the 1989 limited autonomy
 legislation. However, the autonomy process has proceeded
 slowly, with only 3 of 22 areas "in the hands of the local
 councils. 'The issues of greatest concern to the
 tribals--control over land and law and order--have yet to be
 completely devolved upon the councils.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and expression
 and freedom of the press, subject to "reasonable restrictions"
 in the interest of national security, international relations,
 and public order, decency, and morality. In practice, the
 Government has a variety of means to attempt to control the
 press. These include: formal and informal censorship,
 "guidance" from the press information department, temporary
 closures of newspapers, control of newsprint, and arrest or
 intimidation of journalists. The SPA allows the Government to
 ban domestic publications, to hold any newspaper employee
 responsible for the paper's content, and to compel journalists
 to reveal news sources. During the state of emergency from
 November 27 to December 5, all publications were subject to
 censorship; however, a strike of newspaper .employees from the
 second day of the emergency made this a moot point as no
 newspapers were published until after the emergency was
 lifted.
 Most private publications are heavily dependent upon
 advertisements from the Government or government-owned
 corporations. These advertisements reportedly account for as
 much as 75 percent of advertising revenues. Although all
 newspapers are theoretically eligible to receive public sector
 advertising if they meet minimum circulation requirements,
 publishers complain-that the placing and withholding of
 advertising, as well as payment for it, are often used as a
 means of influenc*hg the press. After the Government in April
 withdrew advertising from .the Bengali-language daily Shakti in
 respons7to a critical editorial, the newspaper adopted a
 progovernment stance. The interim Government appeared to lift
 formal and informal restrictions om the press when it assumed
 office December 7.
 One newspaper, the Khoborer Kagoj, was banned for commentary
 objectionable to the Government in 1990. The ban was
 rescinded within a week, however, by court order. The
 Government lifted prohibitions on several publications banned
 since 1984 for publishing commentary critical of the
 President, including the Bengali-language weeklies Robbar, Jai
 Jai Din, and Ashey Din Jai. In May the Government also
 withdrew.its SPA-based ban imposed on the Bengali-languaqe
 daily Meillat in December 1989 for publishing reports on
 opposition-sponsored general strikes. Bans on some newspapers
 appear to be permanent.
 Bangladesh has 74 dailies and 290 weeklies and periodicals.
 Three of the four Dhaka English-language dailies and most
 English-language periodicals and newspapers are privately
 owned and reflect the views of various political parties. All
 major newspapers report on both government and opposition
 activities, although coverage of the opposition is less
 extensive in the government-owned publications. Articles and
 
 
 1393
 
 BANGLADESH
 editorials critical of the Government appear, but criticism of
 former President Ershad, his family, or the armed forces was
 not tolerated under the Ershad regime.
 The Government owns and operates all radio and television
 facilities. In the print media, it owns two Dhaka newspapers,
 including one English-language daily, and one Rajshahi daily.
 The Government also owns BSS, the national news service. Two
 wire services, Eastern News Agency and the United News of
 Bangladesh, are privately owned.
 In addition to banning newspapers for publishing
 "objectionable" material, the authorities occasionally place
 individual journalists under detention. In January a
 photographer for the Bengali daily Meillat was detained under
 the SPA, but was released after the High Court ruled that his
 detention was unlawful. Opposition political parties also
 exert pressure on newspapers and magazines hostile to them in
 efforts to intimidate them. Tactics include anonymous
 threatening telephone calls and threats of arson.
 Although 56 foreign publications (18 dailies and 38
 periodicals) are generally available in Bangladesh, the
 Government has sometimes used the Customs Act of 1969 to
 prevent the importation of foreign. publications for various
 reasons. The Government invoked the Act to prohibit a
 Bengali-language translation of the New Testament in 1990,
 butlater withdrew its ban. The government ban on the book
 "The Satanic verses" remains in effect. No foreign
 journalists were arrested, barred from entry, or expelled in
 1990. Bangladeshi journalists were invited to visit the CHT
 under government escort. In August the State Minister for
 Cultural Affairs announced the Government's intention tO seek
 repeal of legislation requiring drama groups to obtain
 certificates of approval to perform. In recent years, no
 drama group in Dhaka has bothered to apply for such
 authorization, but the law continued to be enforced-outside
 the capital. Drama groups are required to submit scripts to
 the local authorities, and actors who perform in unauthorized
 plays are theoretically subject to arrest. The Government
 censors films primarily to ban pornography. All films from
 South Africa and Israel are prohibited.
 Students are generally free to express a wide range of
 political opinion through campus organizations and
 publications, and political parties sometimes use student
 fronts to organize demonstrations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Permits are not required for public meetings Sit-ins,
 marches; and rallies are common forms of political expression
 .in Bangladesh. Occasionally they lead to violence, with both
 the demonstrators and the police accusing each other of
 provocation.
 The Constitution assures every citizen the right to form
 associations, subject to "reasonable restrictions" in the
 interest of morality or public order. In practice,
 individuals are free to join private organizations and
 associations. There are no restrictions on affiliations with
 international organizations.
 The right of peaceful assempbly and association was legally
 suspended during the state of emergency. However,
 
 
 1394
 BANGLADESH
 restrictions were largely ignored by demonstrators and
 securityofficials.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Bangladesh, 87 percent of whose people are Muslims, has
 recognized Islam as its state religion since the passage in
 June 1988 of-the Eighth Constitutional Amendment. This
 amendment alsb states that all other religions may be freely
 practiced. Although conversion is possible, there is strong
 social resistance to conversion from Islam. Most
 proselytizing by Bangladeshi citizens is directed toward such
 minority groups as Hindus and tribal peoples. In July there-
 were reports that local officials in Kurigram had been leading
 a campaign of persecution against Muslims suspected of having
 converted-to Christianity. Houses of several Muslims thus
 suspected were allegedly burned. Although proselytizing by
 Bangladeshi citizens is permitted by the Constitution, five
 Bangladeshi-,Christians who had worked with Muslims in Kurigram
 were subsequently charged under the SPA or under a provision-
 of the penal code criminalizing the "outraging of religious
 feelings." In November the High Court Division of
 Bangladesh's Supreme Court declared illegal the detention of
 one of the-Christians. Other members of rel-igious minorities
 have reported-being questioned by security authorities about
 conversion activity.
 Government policy continues to permit various religions to
 establish places of worship, train clergy, travel for
 religious purposes,'and maintain links with coreligionists
 abroad. Missionaries, including foreign clergy who serve  .
 expatriate congregations, are permitted but they may not
 proselytize Muslims. Some missionaries perceive the various
 obstacles they face, including lengthy delays in obtaining
 orrenewing security clearances and residence and reentry
 visas, as intended to curb Christian influence by reducing the
 number of missionarie-and limiting their humanitarian.-
 activities.. Appeals to the Government have sometimes been
 successful in removing such obstacles.
 Despite official assurances of freedom of religion and
 equality of treatment, the'establishment of Islam as the state
 religion continued to cause concern in 1990 among Hindu,
 Christian, and Buddhist minorities. Some minority group
 members complain that this constitutional change has
 emboldened-Muslim fanatics and criminal elements hostile to
 the minorities.
 A number of Hindu shops, temples, and homes in Chittagong,
 Dhaka, and other cities were attacked in October following the
 assault by Hindus on the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, India.
 There were no confirmed deaths of Hindus in Bangladesh as the
 result of the rioting, although two or three Muslim looters
 were shot by police. As in 1989, there were reports of
 harassment, beatings, robbery, vandalism, and encroachment on
 property directed against non-Muslims.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration,--and Repatriation
 Bangladeshi citizens are free to move about within the
 country, except in designated areas of the CHT. Travel by
 foreigners is also restricted in the CHT and some other border
 areas. Bangladeshis are generally free to visit and emigrate
 abroad, subject to foreign exchange-controls, but civil
 
 
 1395
 BANGLADESH
 servants wishing to travel abroad must obtain permission from
 the President's Office. In some instances, persons considered
 to be security risks are barred from traveling abroad.
 Following the fall of the Ershad regime, the former President,
 his family, and senior members of the regime were barred from
 leaving the country. The Supreme Court in July declared
 illegal the seizure in 1986 of a former Member of Parliament's
 passport. The right of repatriation is observed.
 More than 250,000 non-Bengali Muslims, known as Biharis or
 "stranded Pakistanis," remain in Bangladesh pending
 resettlement in Pakistan. After independence in 1971, these
 persons opted for Pakistani citizenship and Pakistan agreed to
 accept them, provided financing for resettlement costs was
 made available from outside sources. A Saudi Arabia-based
 social organization has been trying for several years to raise
 money for this purpose and claims that sufficient funds could
 be found if permission were granted for the Biharis to
 -resettle. The main obstacle to resettlement continues to be
 communal tensions and recurrent violence between Biharis
 already in Pakistan and other ethnic groups, which makes the
 addition of some 250,000 more Biharis a politically difficult
 issue for the Government of Pakistan. The Biharis, most of
 whom still reside in 66 camps throughout Bangladesh, may seek
 employment and conduct other activities, but they face
 disadvantages as noncitizens. Biharis may apply for
 Bangladeshi citizenship at any time, and those who do are
 granted full rights of citizenship.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Prior to President Ershad's resignation, the governing party's
 dominance of the electoral process, political polarization
 between the Government and the opposition and between the
 opposition parties, and the fraud and violence which have
 characterized national and local elections in recent years
 left serious doubts about the ability of Bangladeshi
 citizensto change their government peacefully and
 democratically.
 The resignation of the Ershad Government in response to
 popular discontent, and commitments made by the interim
 Government and the political parties to work toward free and
 fair elections, if implemented, may serve to restore the
 rights of citizens to change their government. The elections
 scheduled for February 27, 1991 will-provide the first
 opportunity to test this commitment-
 Significant numbers of opposition party members won seats as
 subdistrict chairmen in polls held in March. Domestic and
 foreign observers considered the March elections to have been
 free and fair in many aspects, such as the impartiality of the
 security forces, the level of multiparty activity, and the
 uniform applicability of election procedures. In some areas,
 however, observers noted violence and intimidation at the
 polls (though less than in some earlier local elections),
 voter identification problems, and allegations of ballot box
 stuffing. Prior to these elections, the Government also
 updated its 1983 voter lists. The Government allowed the
 Washington-based National Democratic Institute for
 International Affairs and Manila-based Eastern Regional
 Organization for Public Administration to observe the
 elections. These observers made a number of recommendations
 for improving the electoral process.
 
 
 1396
 BANGLADESH
 Following the March local elections, the Minister of Home
 Affairs met with-human rights activists to discuss ways to
 enhance the integrity of the polls. Human rights observers,
 while welcoming buch meetings, remained doubtful of the
 Government's sincerity.,
 .According to the Constitution, presidential elections must be
 held within 180 days of the vacancy resulting from former
 President Ershad's December 6 resignation. Parliamentary
 elections must be held within 90 days of the December 6
 dissolution of Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 Sof Human Rights
 The GQvernment remains sensitive to international opinion
 regarding human rights issues. Although there were no visits
 to Bangladesh in 1990 by representatives of AI or similar
 groups, the Government responded to inquiries by investigating
 reports of several allegations of mistreatment and deaths of
 prisoners in police custody and harassment of Christian
 converts from Islam. When security conditions permit, the
 Government has allowed occasional escorted visits to the
 Chittagong Hill Tracts by members of the diplomatic corps.
 International human rights organizations represented in
 Bangladesh include the International League for Human Rights,
 The Law Association for Asia and the Western Pacific, and The
 International Commission of Jurists. There are also a number
 of local human rights organizations that investigate
 allegations of abuse and seek prosecutions of human rights
 violators. Human rights groups are also active in promoting
 awareness of human rights and the law among the country's
 largely uneducated rural majority. Although the Government
 generally does not hamper these groups' activities; it
 occasionally reminds them to avoid sensitive political
 issues. There have also been reports that the Home'Ministry
 refuses to permit local human rights organizations to receive
 funds from sources abroad.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 By custom and Islamic tradition, women occupy a subordinate
 place in society. A family's ability to seclude its women is
 a symbol of rising social status. These underlying attitudes
 and social barriers circumscribing the participation of women
 in activities beyond the home are strongly entrenched and show
 few signs of weakening. For the approximately 86 percent of
 Bangladeshi women who live in rural areas, early marriage,
 high childbearing rates, and long hours of household and farm
 labor leave little opportunity for nonfamily interests or
 outside employment. Even in urban areas and among the
 affluent, the traditional social system makes women
 economically dependent upon their husbands and other male
 relatives. Except in the export-oriented garment industry,
 women are virtually absent from the cash-earning work force.
 There are daily press reports of domestic violence against
 women: murder, rape and other physical abuse, breach of
 matrimonial contract, denial of inheritance'rights, and
 desertion. The suicide rate among women is reportedly higher
 than among men.
 
 
 1397
 
 BANGLADESH
 Laws to protect women include the Anti-Dowry Prohibition Act
 of 1980, the Cruelty to Women Act of 1983, the Child Marriage
 Restraint Act of 1984, and the Illegal Trafficking of Women
 Act of 1988. Enforcement of these laws is lax, however. It
 is a capital offense to traffic in women, to kill a woman in
 the course of rape, or to murder a woman for dowry. Even so,
 dowry killings, in which the husband or his family attack and
 sometimes murder the bride for nonpayment of a supposedly
 promised dowry, are believed to occur frequently in rural
 areas. Although newspapers occasionally print reports in
 which a husband accused of dowry killing is tried and
 punished, the vast majority of these cases are believed to go
 unreported and unpunished.
 The National Advisory Committee Against Repression of Women
 has established local branches in rural areas to address the
 problem of abused women. Nevertheless, there is still little
 recourse for victims of crimes committed within the family or
 home.
 Members of minority religious groups are disadvantaged in
 practice, though not in the law, in their access to government
 jobs, including in the military, and political office. In the
 years immediately following Bangladesh's independence, members
 of some minorities, principally Hindus, lost or had serious
 difficulty retaining their properties as a result of the
 prejudicial administration of vested property laws. These
 laws permitted the Government to use or even sell property
 belonging to persons who left what is now Bangladesh between
 1965 and 1971. Although President Ershad reaffirmed a 1984
 executive order requiring the return of such property to the
 original owners, in practice this has not been widely
 followed, and some human rights activists contend that
 property is still occasionally seized under these laws. In
 addition, in May former President Ershad appointed a prominent
 Baptist, Michael Adhikari, as his advisor on nongovernmental
 organization affairs, with the rank of minister. Adhikari was
 the highest ranking member of the Christian community in the
 Government.
 Discrimination against the tribal people in the CHT with
 respect to property rights has been an issue in the past.
 Until 1985, tribal land, for which there is frequently no
 deed, was parceled out by authorities to Bengali Muslim
 settlers in the CHT. Tribal people's property rights were
 also violated by the issuance of false deeds, physicalattacks,
 actions taken following the failure to meet mortgage payments,
 or confiscation by the army in areas where the tribal
 insurgency is active. There have been no reports of such
 violations in the past 3 years.
 The Government suspended the transfer of land and took
 additional steps to grant authority over land allocation and
 regulation to the tribal-dominated local government councils.
 In July the councils assumed control over primary education,
 health and family welfare, and agricultural extension. Even
 with such improvements, many tribal people remain concerned
 about their ability to retain their distinct culture in the
 face of incessant pressure from the dominant Bengali culture.
 Also in July, the Government created a new Ministry of Special
 Affairs (Welfare) specifically charged with minority,
 including tribal, affairs. Its duties apparently will include
 the administration of "special areas," i.e., areas largely
 inhabited by tribals or religious minorities, as well as

 providing increased government attention to tribal problems,
 such'as property rights and destruction of their forest
 habitat.
 In 1990-international organizations became increasingly aware
 of discrimination against the Garo tribal people in north
 central Bangladesh, where seizures of tribal land, in part
 under the auspices of a joint government and Asian Development
 Bank-sponsored rubber plantation program, has become a
 particular problem. Based upon human rights activists'
 reports, the Asian Development Bank suspended a rubber
 plantation project because of complaints that the Government
 was taking no action to prevent the illegal seizure of tribal'
 land.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of association. The
 Constitution also provides for the right to form labor unions,
 subject to government approval. Only 3.4 per cent of the
 labor force is unionized, however. The Government explicitly
 denies the right to unionize to civil servants and to workers
 employed in the Export Processing Zone. Although the
 Government has the legal right to suspend unions, it took no
 such action in 1990.
 Workers in trade associations or unions may draw up their own
 constitution and rules, elect officers, develop programs, and
 conduct business without government interference. However,
 there are a large number of rival unions, a circumstance which
 tends to fracture labor solidarity and to inhibit effective
 union -activity. The 1989 amendment of the Industrial
 Relations Ordinance of 1969, which is aimed at containing
 labor unrest and'helping industries minimize fractious labor
 disputes, redefined the term "establishment" with a view to
 limiting the number of trade unions in any particular
 enterprise. Nevertheless, labor unions are powerful and
 important in such sectors as jute, tea, and transportation.
 Although there are no restrictions on forming confederations
 or affiliating with international organizations (all three
 worldwide trade union federations have local affiliates),
 union members need government clearance to travel to
 international labor mebtings. No such clearances were
 withheld in 1990.
 The right to strike is not specifically recognized in the law
 but is an accepted and common form of protest. Numerous
 strikes were'held in 1990, often resulting in concessions
 tothe workers. The Essential Services Ordinance of 1958
 permits the Government to bar strikes for 3 months in any
 sector deemed "essential." The Government occasionally
 applies this regulation more broadly to sectors that may not
 be considered "essential".
 Most labor unions and federations are associated with, and
 dominated by, a political party, with union activities more
 often mounted in response to the demands of political patrons
 than to the needs of union members. The largest single labor
 organization is an extension of the government party.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 By law, workers have a limited right to collective
 bargaining. Public sector employees cannot form unions or
 margain collectively. There is no formal process of
 mediation. Except in the Chittagong Export Processing Zone
 (EPZ), unions in the private sector can generally bargain
 collectively without government interference. The Government
 suspended union activity in the EPZ in 1985, and the
 suspension remains in effect. The country's labor laws do not
 apply in the EPZ. The Industrial Relations Ordinance of 1969,
 amended in November 1989 on the basis of proposals made by a
 tripartite consultative committee, places additional curbs on
 workers by providing for the transfer of union officials,
 excluding the union president and executive treasurer, without
 their consent. Ordinary workers have participatory rights in
 union business in theory, but both union leaders and employers
 often violate them in practice. Union leaders allegedly make
 decisions without consulting members, and allegations have
 been lodged of irregularities in union elections. Employers
 throughout the public and private sectors frequently ignore
 laws prohibiting antiunion discrimination. This practice is
 especially prevalent in the garment industry, where the work
 force is predominantly female.
 Employers also have been accused of harassing union leaders
 and of firing workers for union activities. - Although laws
 against such practices exist, the difficulties of prosecuting
 a court case against an employer discourage union attempts to
 have them enforced.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory,labor.
 Although this prohibition is substantially respected, there
 have been unsubstantiated reports of bonded labor on some tea
 and rubber plantations. The Government actively seeks t.
 prevent the trafficking of bonded- laborers- into other south
 Asian countries.
 d, Minimum Age- for Employment of Children
 The Employment of Children Act prohibits the offering of
 employment to any person under the age of 14, but the act is
 not enforced. Sanctioned-by tradition and encouraged by dire
 economic necessity, child labor is a serigus problem- Legal
 minimum ages for various types of employment, which range from
 12 to 17. are seldom enforced, and the country's poverty is
 such that children are regularly engaged in all available
 jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated the number of
 child laborers at approximately 3 million-in 1986, although
 informed observers assert the number is higher. These
 children  pedal rickshaws, serve as domestic servants, work as
 helpers in transport services, carry loads at railway
 stations, labor at construction sites, work in great numbers
 in agriculture, and are also found in textile mills and
 garment factories. Although Bangladesh ratified the U.N.
 Convention on the Rights of the Child in September, economic
 pressures discourage widespread enforcement of the
 Convention's provisions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Workers in Bangladesh, like the population in general, suffer
 from one of the world's lowest standards of living, and many
 
 
 1400
 
 BANGLADESH
 Bangladeshis live at below subsistence level. Those lucky
 enough to procure industrial jobs, regardless of the
 conditions, are able to provide their families with a
 rudimentary standard of living which is considered higher than
 average. Regulations regarding minimum wage rates, hours of
 work, and occupational safety and health are rarely enforced.
 The Factories Act of 1965 and the Shops and Establishments Act
 of 1965 limit normal working hours to a maximum of 8 hours per
 day and 48 hours per week. With overtime, the'workweek may
 not legally exceed 60 hours. There is no nationwide minimum
 wage as such. Rather, a minimum wage commission sets minimum
 wages within each industry, and within each specialty within
 an industry. Under Bangladeshi law, an employer who does not-
 pay the required minimum wage is subject to fines and
 imprisonment of up to 1 year, but the law is rarely enforced.
 Although the law stipulates that overtime work is to be
 compensated by double the hourly rate, the law has little
 practical effect. An International Labor Organization survey
 in 1989 concluded that employers generally pay little
 attention to safety,-health, cleanliness, and working
 environment. Bangladesh law dictates proper safety standards
 and work conditiQns. The industrial inspectorate of the
 Ministry of Labor is charged with insuring that these
 standards are adhered to and prosecuting those in violation.
 However, enforcement is lax, safety equipment and precautions
 are largely unknown, and the small number of safety inspectors
 are frequently untrained and underpaid.
