 DOMINICA
 Dominica is a member of the British Commonwealth, with a
 system of parliamentary democracy which is a legacy of the
 pre-1978 British colonial rule. The Prime Minister, Eugenia
 Charles, was democratically elected in July 1980. A period of
 political instability, including two armed attempts to
 overthrow the Government, marked the first year of her tenure,
 but recently the political atmosphere has calmed. The Charles
 Government now enjoys broad support, although the opposition
 is vocal in criticizing the slow progress of economic
 development. Prime Minister Charles played a visible role as
 Chairperson of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States
 during the Grenada crisis.
 Dominica is one of the least developed countries in the
 Eastern Caribbean. The country has largely recovered from
 hurricane damage suffered in 1979 and 1980 allowing the
 Charles Government to focus on encouraging foreign investment
 and, with the assistance of external donors, to rehabilitate
 basic economic infrastructure. Slow global recovery from the
 worldwide recession of the early 1980's has further hampered
 economic progress and the Government's attempt to develop the
 country.
 The only security force in the country is the police. A
 Special Service Unit has been organized as a branch of the
 police, and the police force has also established a marine
 wing to function as a coast guard. The military was disbanded
 in 1981 following several violent coup attempts.
 Dominica continues to have a good human rights record. There
 have been no reports of significant violations of human rights
 in 1984.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no reports in 1984 of killing for political
 motives.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of disappearance in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports of torture or cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment in 1984. Jones Sampson, one
 of the six soldiers convicted of murder of a policeman during
 the 1981 coup attempt, began a hunger strike in prison in
 September, according to press articles. These articles have
 also reported that the Dominican Home Affairs Minister stated
 that the Government had no intention of force-feeding Sampson
 but would continue to monitor the situation, provide for
 regular visits by doctors and continue to offer him food.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that anyone arrested shall be
 brought before a court within 72 hours, and this is honored in
 practice. The Dominican government abides by the

 constitutional provisions on arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. There have been no reports of arbitrary
 arrests, other forms of detention, or summary exile in 1984.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Dominica provides for public trials before an independent and
 impartial court. There is a presumption of innocence and
 defendants are allowed legal counsel. An appeal can be made
 if it is believed that these judicial rights have been
 violated.
 Former Prime Minister Patrick John remains free pending a
 Privy Council decision on his appeal from a 1982 West Indies
 Associated States Court of Appeal order that he be tried for
 coup plotting in 1981.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry and search. There
 have been no reports of the state's arbitrary intrusion into
 the private life of the individual.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government affirms the right of free expression, which is
 provided in the Constitution. The opposition press freely
 criticizes the Government without interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to assemble peaceably is honored without
 exception. Opposition groups hold rallies and meetings
 without hindrance from the Government. Labor has the right to
 organize and conduct strikes. Labor unions are independent
 but are small in number and do not constitute a significant
 political force. The Banana Growers Association is a strong
 trade association which does play a significant independent
 political role.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Dominicans are primarily Roman Catholic or Anglican. There is
 also a small Muslim community. No restrictions are enforced
 against any religious group, including the Rastafarians,
 although the 1979 'Dread Act* which prohibits membership in
 the Rastafarian cult is still in force.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are guaranteed in law and honored in practice.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 Dominica has a freely elected parliamentary system of
 government in which citizens have a real choice of policies
 and candidates from the ruling and opposition parties. In the
 1980 elections, the ruling Dominica Freedom Party won 17 seats
 in the House of Assembly; the Democratic Labour Party and
 independents each won 2 seats.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is responsive to complaints about any human
 rights violations.
 There are no branches of international human rights
 organizations in Dominica. The Dominica National Workers
 Union's human rights committee, a Marxist-Leninist
 organization, occasionally has published allegations of human
 rights violations in Dominica. The committee's most recent
 allegation, in 1983, was that the death of Eustace Bobb was
 caused by the police. The police have denied this and
 provided details of an inquest which strongly indicate that
 Bobb was murdered by members of the Rastafarian movement, with
 which he was closely identified.
 Freedom House again listed Dominica as free on its 1984 "Map
 of Freedom."  Dominica is not mentioned in the 1984 Amnesty
 International Report.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Dominica is a small and poor country with a population of
 74,000 people and a high emigration rate.  The 1984
 population growth rate was minus 0.2 percent. The country
 relies heavily on banana exports and subsistence agriculture.
 Its estimated per capita Gross National Product was $707 in
 1982 and is among the lowest in the region.
 The Government places significant emphasis on education. With
 the assistance of external donors, it has rebuilt many primary
 schools which recent hurricanes had destroyed. Adult literacy
 is estimated to be 94.1 percent.
 The Government has made a concerted effort to improve health
 care through the construction of public health clinics. A
 major restructuring of the public health administration has
 improved the level of service in rural areas. At 15.2 per
 thousand live births, Dominica has one of the lowest infant
 mortality rates in the Eastern Caribbean.
 There are no legal restrictions on the role of women in
 Dominican society. Past tradition, where women were limited
 to the home and family, is rapidly being overcome.
 Improvement in educational opportunities for women and the
 example set by Prime Minister Eugenia Charles are expected to
 lead to greater participation of women in public life.
 Freedom House stated in its most recent report that "the
 rights of the native Caribs may not be fully respected.*
