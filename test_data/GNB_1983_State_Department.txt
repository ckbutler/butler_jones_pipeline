 GUINEA-BISSAU
 The Republic of Guinea-Bissau is ruled by a "Provisional Govern-
 ment* established following the coup d'etat in November 1980 led
 by General Joao Bernardo Vieira. President Vieira serves as
 Head of State, President of the Revolutionary Council, and
 Secretary General of the African Party for the Independence of
 Guinea and Cape Verde. Until August 1983, President Vieira also
 served as Minister of Defense and Minister of Interior and
 Security. The country is a one-party state where opposition
 political activities are not permitted.
 The Government is headed by a Prime Minister who is appointed by
 the President and serves subject to the supervision of the Revo-
 lutionary Council. The Revolutionary Council is composed of
 ranking military authorities and senior party members. The
 Council and the President exercise all effective political
 authority. Ministers are appointed by the President in consul-
 tation with the Revolutionary Council. The legislature was
 dissolved following the 1980 coup. A series of government com-
 missions has met throughout 1983 to prepare for legislative and
 Presidential elections, to draft a new constitution, and to pre-
 pare for the reestablishment of a permanent government structure.
 No date for elections has yet been set, and the results or
 progress of the commissions' work in other areas has not been
 made public. In August, the President announced the creation of
 a National Security Council which will reportedly replace the
 current Revolutionary Council following the election of a
 National Assembly.
 Economic, commercial, and development activities are centrally
 government controlled. All major economic activities are super-
 vised by the Government through a system of business/commercial
 entities established, staffed, financed, and controlled by the
 Government. There is a small private retail sector. In
 response to the severe deterioration of the economy caused by
 eight years of statist policies, the Government in 1983 prepared
 a series of economic reform recommendations, including the
 proposed revitalization of the private sector and more efficient
 controls over public expenditures. These recommendations were
 generally endorsed by the party in September. Per capita gross
 national product (GNP) is, according to 1981 estimates, approxi-
 mately $185. Direct foreign grant assistance is required to
 cover a large portion of the Government's current operating
 budget. Imports and exports declined in 1983.
 Although the nature of the one-party state apparatus limits the
 political freedom of Guinea Bissauans, integrity of the individ-
 ual is normally respected. There were some improvements in the
 human rights field in 1983 over the previous year. In May, the
 Government released eight individuals detained following the 1980
 coup. Simultaneously, the Revolutionary Council granted amnesty
 to 38 individuals who had been tried and found guilty of treason
 in 1976-77 under the previous government for activities during
 the independence struggle. Twenty-five members of that group had
 been condemned to death, but the sentences were later commuted.
 A number of senior government officials were dismissed in the
 August 1983 Cabinet shuffle and remain under detention or house
 arrest. The Government has stated they will be brought to trial
 for unspecified "irregularities." In addition, six senior party
 members have been suspended by the party and three others have
 been expelled for having "betrayed" party objectives. In
 
 (165)
 
 
 166
 November 1983, the President announced that there were no
 political prisoners in Guinea-Bissau. Efforts continue to
 reduce the degree of arbitrariness in the system, and the
 Government has announced publicly that those members of the
 Government jailed in August will be brought to trial. It has
 also declared its intention to return to some form of consti-
 tutional government. There are no current restrictions on
 citizens' right to travel throughout the country. There have
 been no government assassinations, and the incidence of
 arbitrary arrest has declined. There were no interventions
 by international human rights groups in 1983.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were no cases of government-ordered or -sanctioned
 assassinations in 1983, nor have there been any terrorist
 incidents during the same period.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of disappearance in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reported cases of torture in 1983. Prison
 conditions are poor and unsanitary. Interrogation methods are
 at times harsh, entailing intimidation and occasionally solitary
 confinement. Medical treatment, medicines, and food are in
 short supply. Military security and police officials are poorly
 trained and unsophisticated. There is one documented case of
 prolonged solitary confinement during the investigation of a
 drug ring involving Guinea-Bissau and foreign nationals. Most
 observers suspect there have been other instances of such
 confinement.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In August 1983, several senior members of the Government and
 armed forces were relieved of their duties and placed under
 detention or house arrest. Although the Government has only
 charged them with "irregularities" in performance of their
 duties, rumor accuses them of corruption.
 There is no published civil or criminal code. Habeas corpus
 (as a carryover from the Portuguese penal code) does exist in
 practice in urban areas but is not generally observed outside
 major urban centers. In rural areas, a wide variety of tradi-
 tional law prevails. In many national security cases, arrests
 and detentions take place without formal safeguards. Bail
 procedures appear not to exist. In past years, international
 human rights groups have appealed to government authorities on
 behalf of detainees, but the Government reportedly failed to
 respond. There have been no known interventions by such groups
 in 1983. There are no known cases of government-imposed exile
 in 1983.
 
 
 167
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Nonpolitical offenders in other than the most important criminal
 and civil cases are often tried in rural areas outside the formal
 courts and under traditional (tribal) law. The following infor-
 mation applies to the modern legal system. The private practice
 of law is prohibited. Defendants are assigned legal assistants
 from the Ministry of Justice when availabl. The court system is
 not an independent branch of government. The civilian courts are
 essentially a continuation of those which existed under Portu-
 guese colonial rule. The Supreme Court is the highest civilian
 court of appeal. Regional military courts have jurisdiction over
 military, militia, and security personnel on military missions.
 The Supreme Court (also known as the War Court) has jurisdiction
 over more serious crimes such as acts against state security,
 attempts against the lives of party members, treason, and piracy.
 It is also an appeals court for the regional military courts.
 The death penalty may be appealed to the Council of State. The
 interval between arrest and trial may be lengthy. With the
 exception of the small group of senior officers arrested in
 August 1983, there are no known political prisoners at this time.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The partially suspended Constitution guarantees the inviolability
 of domicile. This right is not respected in the case of serious
 crimes or matters involving state security, when legal
 protections such as the need for search warrants and the
 definition of who can issue and serve them are unlikely to be
 observed. Absent a democratically elected government, an
 independent judiciary, or a published criminal code, there is
 no established or guaranteed protection against intrusion by
 the state into the private lives of individuals. International
 and domestic mail and other forms of communication are considered
 insecure. Opposition to the Government and public criticism of
 government officials are prohibited. However, intrusion into the
 daily life of ordinary citizens by the Government is the
 exception rather than the rule--save at times of great political
 tension or in cases involving national security.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 All information media in Guinea-Bissau are owned and controlled
 by the Government. Independent reporting or editorial comment on
 domestic or international affairs does not exist. Coverage of
 food shortages and the current economic crisis is, however,
 common. Journalism is considered a function of the state and
 the party. At the national level, no expression of political
 opposition to the party or the Government is permitted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All organizations and associations in Guinea-Bissau are integral
 parts of the state or the party. The National Labor Union is a
 "mass-action" organ of the party. It claims 20,000 members. It
 is forbidden to organize public employees--a prohibition dating
 from colonial days. Strikes, while not illegal, have not taken
 place.  (Presumably this is because the vast majority of salaried
 workers are employees of the state.) Opposition to government
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 12
 
 
 168
 policies is prohibited. In rural areas, however, popular criti-
 cism of regional government authorities has forced the Government
 to replace some officials. There are no non-governmental or non-
 party associations affiliated with international bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no religious discrimination. The majority of the popu-
 lation is animist, but other religious groups exist and their
 worship is unimpeded. Religious missions operate secular activ-
 ities throughout the country. Parochial schools operate openly.
 Conversion is permitted. The pursuit of a particular faith does
 not appear to advantage or disadvantage individual secular
 activities. Muslims account for approximately 30 percent of the
 active religious community.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no longer routine restrictions on the freedom of move-
 ment within the country or on travel abroad. Exit permits are,
 however, required for Guinea-Bissau nationals and many foreign
 expatriate workers. Citizens are not required to obtain special
 permits for internal travel as was the case under the previous
 government. Travel is restricted when interregional smuggling
 of agricultural products is suspected. The principal constraints
 on foreign travel appear to be economic and administrative, and
 a scarcity of foreign exchange. There are no known bars to
 emigration. Since the country's borders are not rigidly con-
 trolled, there is believed to be a significant degree of un-
 authorized cross-border movement. There are no significant
 refugee groups in Guinea-Bissau. The Government is generally
 sympathetic to the principle of asylum. There is no sexual or
 other discrimination with regard to travel. There have been no
 known repatriation problems in 1983.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Guinea-Bissau is governed by a small group of senior party
 and military authorities. All political activity must take place
 within the single political party. There is no legal mechanism
 available to challenge the party or the state. The highest
 authority of the party is the Central Committee. That group is
 subject to the authority of the Revolutionary Council. The
 Revolutionary Council and the party have some overlapping
 membership. The state and the party both assert the role of
 women in development and party affairs. Men, however, continue
 to dominate party and government positions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Guinea-Bissau has not been active in international or regional
 human rights bodies. It has no record of sustained involvement
 with outside bodies concerned with human rights. The 1983
 Amnesty International report expressed concern about the earlier
 detention without trial of officials of the former administration
 and of alleged political opponents of the Government. No
 response to those inquiries was received. All of these detainees
 were, however, subsequently released. Freedom House rates
 Guinea-Bissau "not free.'

 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Guinea-Bissau is among the least developed countries in the
 world. According to World Bank statistics, the current popula-
 tion is estimated (1983) at 827,000 with a population growth rate
 of 1.8 percent. As of December 1982, the Government estimates
 the population growth rate to be 2.2 percent with average family
 size at 6.3 persons. Per capita gross national product (GNP) is
 estimated (1981) at $185. Life expectancy at birth is 41.9 years,
 and the infant mortality rate is approximately 142 per 1,000
 live births. The World Bank estimates adult literacy at 28.4
 percent, but the Government puts overall literacy at not more
 than 15 percent. No more than 12 percent of the population has
 access to safe water. Eighty-seven percent of the population live
 in communal villages (tabancas), which are the country's basic
 economic and social units. The remaining 13 percent are concen-
 trated largely in and around the capital city of Bissau.
 Average population density is approximately 22 inhabitants per
 square kilometer. The Government estimates that there is one
 hospital bed for every 650 inhabitants and one doctor per 10,000
 inhabitants. Of an active population of approximately 450,000,
 only 25,000 are salaried wage earners.   Most of these are civil
 servants. Employment and educational opportunities are extremely
 limited. Primary school enrollment is estimated at 96 percent.
 Although extremely fertile, less than one-half of the arable
 land is currently under cultivation. Guinea-Bissau's principal
 natural resources include fish, lumber, some minerals, and
 probably petroleum. A four-company consortium is currently
 negotiating a lease concession for offshore petroleum
 exploration. The economy is dramatically bipolar. The monetar-
 ized urban economy and the traditional subsistence agriculture
 rural economy operate, to a large extent, independently of each
 other. Foreign economic assistance to Guinea-Bissau is substan-
 tial. Grant flows from bilateral and multilateral donors
 average approximately $60 million per year.
 There is no government or party discrimination against women. The
 National Women's Movement is a party organization and is active
 nationally. Women hold some senior government and party positions
 and political activity by women is officially encouraged at all
 levels. By statute, party organizations must have a stated
 proportion of women officeholders. In practice, however, women
 do not hold any prominent positions at the national level.
 Official discrimination against women in the modern sector of
 society does not take place; in the rural sector, however, tradi-
 tional male-dominant sociological ideas and practices prevail and
 consequently limit the role of women.
