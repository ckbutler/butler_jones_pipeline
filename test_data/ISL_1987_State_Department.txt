 ICELAND
 Iceland is a vigorous, multiparty, parliamentary democracy in
 which freedom of the press and freedom of association are
 sacrosanct. Its literate and educated people participate
 in high percentages in regular fair and free elections which
 determine the distribution of power among political parties
 and leaders.
 The civil and criminal justice systems offer equal protection
 to all. The nation has no indigenous military forces or
 political security apparatus.
 Iceland has a mixed open economy in which all of its citizens
 epjoy the right to hold private property.
 Icelanders have long been strong defenders of human rights
 both at home and internationally, and the country has an
 exemplary human rights record.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political killings do not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of abductions, hostage taking, or
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are all prohibited by law and do not occur in
 practice. The operating methods of the police and prison
 conditions in Iceland are excellent, and there are no known
 instances of beatings or any other abuses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Due process is provided by law and observed in practice. The
 Icelandic Constitution states that any person detained by the
 authorities must be brought before a judge within 24 hours and
 either charged, released on bail, or released unconditionally.
 Any unfavorable judicial ruling at that point may be appealed
 immediately to a higher court. Preventive detention and
 forced labor are not practiced. There were no allegations of
 arbitrary arrest.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants may confront witnesses and otherwise participate in
 public trials which are fair and free from intimidation. In
 addition, defendants are guaranteed the right to competent
 legal counsel of their own choice. In cases where defendants
 are unable to pay attorney fees, the State does so. The
 courts are free of political control. Although the lower
 court system is administered by the Ministry of Justice, the
 Supreme Court carefully guards their independence and
 fairness. Juries are not normally used, but multijudge panels
 
 
 945
 ICELAND
 are common, especially in the appeals process, and due process
 is rigorously observed. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the Constitution and in practice, there is longstanding,
 deep respect for the autonomy and rights of individuals. A
 warrant from a court is required for entry into a home except
 in cases of hot pursuit. Arbitrary intrusions by official
 entities, political organizations, or any other organized
 group into the private beliefs or personal liberties of
 individuals did not occur.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution expressly forbids censorship and other
 restrictions on the freedom of the press and a person's right
 to express his thoughts. Individuals and the media exercise
 the right to criticize the Government freely in this
 pluralistic society. In Iceland's schools and institutions of
 higher education, most of which are publicly owned, academic
 freedom prevails.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides that persons have the right to join
 together formally or informally to form associations without
 governmental authorization. A varied and wide spectrum of
 .voluntary organizations plays a vital role in Icelandic
 politics and society. All such organizations and groups are
 free to maintain international contacts. In addition, the
 Constitution provides for the right to assemble unarmed,
 except when it is feared that such gatherings may cause
 riots. In practice, plans for public meetings are virtually
 never forbidden, and the authorities only rarely modify them.
 Workers and employers make extensive use of the rights to
 establish organizations; draw up their own constitutions and
 rules; choose their own policies and representatives; and
 bargain collectively on wages, working conditions, and other
 related issues. More than 90 percent of all employees belong
 to labor unions. With only a few limited exceptions, unions
 have and utilize the right to strike when differences over
 wages or working conditions cannot be resolved at the
 bargaining table. In short, labor relations are highly
 organized and democratic. Labor unions are active and
 influential in the nation's economic and political life.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Lutheran Church is the established church of
 Iceland and the vast majority of citizens are nominally
 members, there is complete freedom for other faiths. A
 variety of both Christian and non-Christian faiths are allowed
 to proselytize freely. Religious affiliation is not a factor
 in political or economic life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Icelanders have freedom to travel. at home and abroad, to
 emigrate, and to return to Iceland at will. Refugees, of whom
 
 
 946
 ICELAND
 there are few, are never compelled to return to a country in
 which they would face persecution.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The political system is an open, fully functioning,
 parliamentary democracy in which voters freely choose the
 members of Parliament who, in turn, make the laws of the land
 and determine the composition of the Cabinet. Parliamentary
 elections are held at 4-year intervals unless Parliament
 dissolves itself before the end of its full term.
 In the last parliamentary election in April 1987, seven
 political parties ran slates of candidates in all eight of
 Iceland's multimember electoral districts, and three more
 parties ran slates in one or more districts. As a result of
 the votes cast in this election, seven parties won seats in
 Parliament, including two which had not previously had seats.
 Because no single party had a majority of seats in Parliament,
 negotiations among the parties resulted in the orderly
 transfer of power to a new three-party coalition government in
 July 1987.
 Iceland's Parliament (the Althing) reflects the political
 views of a broad spectrum of the population rather than of any
 single individual or clique. Voting in elections and
 membership in the various political parties are open to all
 citizens who are 18 years of age or older; primary elections
 are used to select most parliamentary candidates; multimember
 districts and proportional representation increase the chances
 for minority viewpoints to be represented; and there is a
 strong cultural insistence on having the views of all
 significant groups represented.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No serious human rights violations are alleged to have
 occurred. However, one Icelander has raised the question of
 whether it is a violation of his human rights for the same
 local official both to accuse him of violating a traffic law
 and to pass judgment on his guilt. This case reportedly has
 been referred to the European Commission on Human Rights.
 Several human rights organizations are active, including
 Amnesty International which did not comment on Iceland in its
 1987 report. The Government and populace of Iceland support
 international efforts to improve human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Iceland's ethnically homogeneous population is fiercely
 egalitarian and opposed to discrimination regardless of
 whether based on sex, religion, or other factors. Women's
 average wage rates in nonagricultural employment in 1985
 amounted to 90.4 percent of those of men. Although women have
 long participated freely in the nation's social, economic, and
 political life, they nevertheless continue to be
 underrepresented in the professions, management, and politics.
 Women in all of Iceland's political parties are continuing
 efforts to expand their roles and power. One political group,
 
 
 947
 ICELAND
 the Women's List, which ran slates in all eight electoral
 districts in the last parliamentary election, has this as its
 primary goal. In the April 1987 parliamentary election, the
 Women's List succeeded in raising its share of the popular
 vote to 10.1 percent compared with 5.5 percent in the 1983
 election) and won six seats in Parliament (compared with three
 in the previous election). As a result, women now hold 13 out
 of 63 seats in the Althing. A woman holds I of the 11 Cabinet
 ministries, and Iceland's popularly elected Chief of State,
 the President, is a woman.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 In the workplace, Icelandic workers are protected by laws
 which effectively ensure their health and safety as well as
 guarantee them unemployment insurance, paid vacations, and
 reasonable working conditions and hours. The employment of
 children below the age of 16 in factories, on ships, and in
 other places where hazardous conditions prevail or hard labor
 is required, is prohibited by law. Largely as a result of the
 efforts of unions, the prevailing level of minimum wages is
 sufficient to give workers and their families decent living
 conditions. Food, shelter, health care, and education are all
 guaranteed without discrimination to those who lack adequate
 income because they are too old, too young, sick, or otherwise
 disadvantaged.
