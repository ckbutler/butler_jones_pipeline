 ECUADOR
 Ecuador is a~constitutional republic. The President and
 members of. the-unicameral-Congress are chosen in free
 elections. -Members of the Supreme Court, chosen by Congress,
 preside over an independent judiciary. Elections in 1979 ended
 7 years of. militaryrule,. and since then democratically elected
 administrations have governed Ecuador.
 Seventeen registered-political parties and a free and partisan
 .press participate.in a lively and contentious democratic
 political,process. -A coalition of opposition parties dominates
 the 1986-1988,Congress. The first round of general elections
 is scheduled for January 31, 1988, to elect the next Congress
 and provincial and municipal offibials. A second round between
 the twd.leading presidential candidates is scheduled for.May
 1988.        .                                     .-    ,

 A small group of violent leftists, Alfaro Vive Carajo (AVC),
 maintains links with the Colombian M-19 guerrillas. During

 measures have.general-ly favored the industrial and commercial
 sectors... The lpbor movement is small but broad-based and
 active. Extensive rural poverty persists, especially among
 highland Indians.
 Ecuador maintained generally good human rights standards in
 1987. The most prominent human rights issues in 1987 were the
 treatment of prisoners and detainees, judicial procedures, and
 questions of-government regulation of the communications media.
 RESPECT-FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 i espect-for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 -Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no substantiated charges of politically motivated
 killings by government forces during the year.
 Subversive activity was almost wholly clandestine in 1987. On
 April 30, the police stormed an AVC safe house north of Quito,
 leaving Salomon Gonzalo Molina dead and capturing several
 other persons. Ecuadorean human rights groups charged
 excessive police violence. The Government rejected these
 charges in its account of the confrontation.

 In June Eddy Dutan, a young student labor activist, was shot
 and killed in Cuenca by an army corporal during a late night
 altercation between a group of students and several off-duty
 military personnel. Some Ecuadorean politicians and human
 rights activists charged that this killing was politically
 motivated, but to date these charges remain unsubstantiated.
 The corporal involved has not been charged.
 Two policemen were detained in 1986 after each had shot and
 killed a student taking part in a demonstration. By late
 1987, no penal action had been taken against them, and they
 remained on the police force, although on administrative
 suspension.
 Human rights organizations charged that provincial governments
 remain indifferent to deaths in disputes over land tenure.
 They denounced the alleged killing of six members of the Vera
 family by an armed group in El Triunfo, Guayas Province, as
 the family prepared to fence off a land claim. They reported
 that community leader Jose Sharupi was killed by a policeman
 in Paroto Yacu, Pastaza Province, during a land dispute. In
 December police accompanied by armed civilians carried out
 government orders to expel 600 mining families from a claim in
 El Oro Province; the violent confrontations left 2 miners dead,
 and others were alleged to be missing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no substantiated cases of disappearance attributable
 to the Government in 1987.
 Human rights monitors decry the Government's lack of public
 response to disappearances said to have occurred in 1985 and
 1986. They allege the disappearances of three persons detained
 by the military in Esmeraldas Province in 1985: Manuel Bolanos
 in October, Luis Vaca in November, and Consuelo Benavides
 Cevallos in December. They allege the disappearance of two
 persons arrested by police in Quito: Jaime Otavalo in August
 1985 and Manuel Yanez in May 1986. The Government maintains
 that there was no official involvement in these disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law. Police reportedly beat suspects
 or treat them harshly, usually during initial interrogations.
 There also have been reports in 1987 of mistreatment by the
 military of prisoners immediately following capture. Although
 mistreatment of detainees is not officially sanctioned, human
 rights groups maintain the Government is responsible and say
 little has been done to reprimand or discourage continuing
 abuses. The Government has made no clear statement condemning
 the use of excessive force.
 Human rights groups and the congressional opposition assert
 that 44 cases of torture occurred in the first 6 months of
 1987, an increase over the 1986 rate of such reports. They
 have published claims that torture caused the death in prison
 of Felix Sarmiento in La Troncal, Canar Province, and that
 beatings in police detention caused the subsequent death of
 Nilo Gamboa Rocafuerte in Guayaquil. Government Minister Luis
 Robles testified to Congress in April that security agents had
 been detained and an investigation was ongoing in the case of
 peasants tortured by police in Canar- Province.

 Air force.commandos who killed two bodyguards and held the
 President'and others hostage for a day in January were said to
 have been roughly tre-ated during tfnsfer to detention.
 Physiciang who examined them shortly afterwards found bruises.

 Human rights organizations charge that in June 1987 Ecuadorean
 military unitstentered the homes of two families in Santa
 Cecilia, Napo Province, and tortured several family members,
 including'an 8-year old-child.
 In late September, an opposition bongressional deputy scheduled
 toï¿½quetion the Minister of Government on human rights issues
 was beaten everely by unknown assailants. The Government
 denied 'any- respobsibility- iT the matte'r, ahd the President
 Condemned the attack.-.The erptratorb and motive remain
 unknown.                     -     - ",
 Ecuadorean prison guards sometimes use solitary confinement'
 and beatings for disciplinary purposes, even though this is
 contrary to prison regulations.  Prisonerb often bribe guards- .
 to avoid punishment and to improve their living conditions.
 The congressional Commission bh .Human Rights (CHR) is studying
 draft legislation to improve'th-e penitentiary system and
 respect forbasic human rights.. The lack of funds for reform
 is a afaj'ozobstacle.             -
 Humancrights .groups maintain that police-uhjustifiably applied
 the so-called ley de fuga (the law of escaping prisoners) on
 five occasions in 1987. This practice, unsanctioned by
 legislation but permitted in practice, allows police to fire
 upon fleeing prisoners. Escapees are general-ly"not armed, and
 human rights groups argue that they would normally be willing
 to surrender if challenged.. .
 Detaindees under civil ontrol charged with terrorism or
 subvertion generally have not been mistreated if detained in
 Quito, but those detained in the Guayaquil penitentiary often
 are treated more harshly. Detainees under civil'control are
 allowed frequent family visits. The few detainees under
 military control are usually held incommunicado and 'reportedly
 have been jnistreated.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest,-Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor-
 The law provides for a judicial determination of the legality
 of detention. -Preventive detention is illegal. The criminal
 code forbids isolated confinement for more than 24 hours and
 detention withouticharge for more than 48 hours, but this is
 not always respected in practice. Human rights organizations
 accuse the Government 'of continuing illegal detentions of
 suspected terrorists and their family members. In February
 the Quito Bar Association denounced an increase in illegal
 detentions" there, often in connection with requests for bribes.
 Mayors and municipal council presidents have the constitutional
 right to order the release of detainees and do so very
 liberally, irrespective of the severity of the charges.
 There is no forced or compulsory labor. Forded exile is not
 practiced.

 ECUADOR
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There were no Ecuadorean political prisoners in 1987. In 1986
 and 1987 Ecuadorean security forces held under house arrest
 three Spanish Basques who had been expelled from France under
 suspicion of terrorist activities. Two of the Basques
 subsequently were expelled from Ecuador, and one remains under
 house arrest.
 The Congress elects the Supreme Court and has the power to
 impeach judges, to fix the budget of the judicial branch, and
 to ratify the Supreme Court's judicial review decisions. From
 time to time, the Supreme Court investigates allegations of
 judicial inefficiency or improprieties and may remove judges.
 Defendants have the right to counsel as soon as arrested.
 They can call witnesses on their own behalf, cross-examine all
 witnesses, refrain from testifying against themselves, and
 appeal sentences to intermediate or higher courts. Although a
 public defender system is mandated by the 1979 Constitution,
 none has yet been implemented.
 The judicial system is inefficient and corruptible, in part
 because many judges are inexperienced and poorly paid.
 Detainees may wait 2 years or longer for trial, placing
 additional burdens on the prison system. According to the
 congressional CHR, approximately 50 percent of all prisoners
 have not been charged or sentenced. Time spent awaiting trial
 is counted toward completion of the final sentence, but some
 long-term detainees have been found innocent. Those unable to
 afford legal counsel face the longest periods of pretrial
 detention.
 As in most civil law systems, there is no trial by jury.
 Judges play a central role in investigations as well as in
 deciding guilt or innocence. The Attorney General, the
 Solicitor General, and provincial prosecutors carry out
 investigations and prosecutions. These officials also defend
 state interests in criminal and civil cases, receive complaints
 against judges, conduct fiscal inspections of lower courts,
 and provide legal opinions in all court cases.
 The autonomous Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal (TGC) is
 composed of representatives named by the President, the
 Congress, the judiciary, municipalities, business, and labor.
 The TGC is empowered by the Constitution to investigate
 breaches of constitutional or human rights. The TGC submits
 its findings to Congress but has no statutory power to enforce
 them. The President has rejected some rulings and as a
 symbolic gesture has refused to publish them in the Official
 Register. The TGC has focused public attention on human
 rights issues by calling hearings, investigating complaints of
 abuses, publicly admonishing the President and others, and
 requiring government officials, including the Minister of
 Government, to answer questions.
 Military courts may try only those cases involving infractions
 of military regulations or acts against military
 installations. After the kidnaping of the President in
 January, 90 air force personnel were arrested and investigated
 for complicity. Military courts-martial conducted prompt and
 thorough proceedings in which 60 men received prison terms and
 the remainder were set free.

 ECUADOR
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Police must-,have, a warrant to enter a dwelling except in the
 case of hot pursuit. Although the Government generally
 respects the sanctity of the home and privacy of
 correspopdence, at times the police have been involved in
 illegal, surreptitious entries. The President of the Congress
 criticized recent illegal violations of individuals' homes.
 One human rights group claimed that reports received of
 violations of homes and private property rose from 18 cases in
 1986 to 33 in 1987.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Cdnstatution provides for freedom of speech and
 expression. The Ecuadorean media are essentially privately
 owned and legally free from direct government control. Twelve
 daily newspapers, dozens of weeklies, numerous magazines, 10
 television stations, and more than 450 radio stations operate
 in Ecuador and present a diversity of political opinion.
 The media yigorQusly. debate political issues. Opppsition
 politiciaps and local human rights observers hve accused-the
 Government of Using a variety of pressures'to soften or
 silence media.criticism of its policies. The Inter-American
 Press Ass6ciation (IAPA) has supported.,some journalists who
 complained of official harassment after they criticized the
 Government. At its November meeting, the IAPA adopted a
 report by the publishers of Quito's major newspapers which
 criticized-government limitations on press.freedom. The
 Presideht qf. Ecuador and the government press service rejected
 the report'.s contentions.
 For several years the "Government has refused to place official
 notices in a leading daily paper critical of the Government.
 Since 19.84 the. Government has prevented the opening of a
 television station o~ned by political adversaries. Despite
 congressional exhortations and an adverse court ruling in
 1987, the Government persisted in its policy and posted
 security forces outside the station to prevent technicians
 from entering the transmission tower.
 The news director of one television station lost his job
 allegedly because of newscasts too critical of the Government.
 He maintains that supporters of the Government ransacked his
 office and arranged his dismissal from subsequent employment
 with a newspaper.
 Ecuadorean law prohibits defaming the President. The
 Government ordered the closure for 15 days of 3 radio stations
 which transmitted recordings of antigovernment remarks by
 demonstrators during a general strike on March 25. The
 closure order was condemned by the press, the TGC, the IAPA,
 and the political opposition as government censorship. The
 stations were allowed to resume broadcasting 6 days after
 closure. Journalists reported being detained by the police
 during the March 25 demonstrations, and some have accused the
 police of breaking cameras and exposing film.
 After declaring illegal a strike called for October 28, the
 Government used emergency powers to prevent newspapers from
 
 
 470
 ECUADOR
 publishing comments by strikers or politicians that day and
 ordered all radio stations to join a government broadcasting
 network. The Government closed 11 Quito stations and several
 elsewhere for 24 hours when they refused to join the network.
 There is no apparent political censorship of foreign or
 domestic books, films, or works of art. There is no evidence
 of government interference with academic inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of free assembly and
 association. This generally is observed in practice. Public
 rallies require prior approval from local governments, which
 is usually granted.
 On May 30, the President signed a decree giving the Government
 the authority to oversee foundations supported by foreign
 political parties. In the following weeks, the Government
 investigated foundations associated with two leading
 opposition parties. No judicial action resulted from the
 investigations.
 Opposition parties called for a national strike on October 28
 to protest the refusal of the government Minister to leave
 office after congressional censure. The President responded
 by declaring a 1-day state of emergency, invoking his
 constitutional powers to respond to "grave domestic commotion
 or catastrophe." Three strike leaders were arrested on the
 eve of the strike. The day of the strike passed without any
 significant incidents.
 Labor organizations represent about 15 percent of the country's
 economically active population. The labor movement, organized
 into four major confederations and many independent unions,
 reflects widely different political orientations and has links
 to international labor organizations.
 All private sector employees and government blue-collar workers
 enjoy the right to organize unions, bargain collectively, and
 strike. Government white-collar workers may not strike, and
 the Government does not grant bargaining rights to their
 unions.
 The 50-year-old labor code provides for a considerable
 government role in the resolution of labor-management
 disputes, especially through conciliation tribunals of the
 Ministry of Labor.
 Trade union leaders are elected by their membership.
 Membership dues of recognized unions are collected by the
 Government and given directly to the union leadership. The
 Constitution provides for formal labor participation in
 government through representation on the executive boards of
 several national institutions. Labor leaders meet regularly
 with the Minister of Labor and other senior government
 officials to discuss current problems.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, Ecuador has no state
 religion. Citizens and residents are free to practice the
 religion of their choice. The Constitution prohibits the
 election of members of the clergy to-the Congress, the
 Presidency, or the Vice Presidency.

 ECUADOR
 Foreign missionaries of many faiths have operated freely in
 Ecuador fr. many years. Radio HCJB, the "Voice of the Andes,"
 has funptfo'ned for more than 50 years as an evangelical
 Christian shortwave fadio seivice~supported largely by
 contributions from.the United States.
 d. Freedom of .*ovement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel,. Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Ecuadoreans may travel-freely at home or abroad.
 Persons fr m other Latin American countries have readily found
 asylum in Ecuador.' No cases of involuntary repatriation of
 persons fleeing pdlitical persecdtion were reported in 1987.
 Section 3 Resb4ct for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Ecuador is a multiparty democracy with 17 registered parties
 representing the full political spectrum. Thirteen of these,
 including 2 avowedly Marxist parties, are represented in the
 unicameral Cqngress.
 Ecuadoreans 18 years of age and older have the right to vote.
 Voting is mandatory for .literates and voluntary for
 illiterates- Political articipation and suffrag. are open to
 all citizens without discrimination on the basis of sex,
 ethnic origin' or socioeconomic status.. All citizens have the
 right to form and join'political'parties.
 Only certified pRlitical parties may present candidates for.
 election.. For certification, an aspiring party must present'a
 petition beaiingi a minimum number of voter signatures. Since
 the return to democracy in 1979, Ecuadorean politics have been
 characterized by strident partisanship, and shifting alliances.
 Strong'political rivalries among indiyiduals and ideological
 and regional differences account for-much of the rough and
 tumble nature ofi the political process.
 The inauguration of the current President in August 1984
 marked the feirst peaceful transfer of power from one
 democraticallf'elected admilnistr-ation to another in 24 years.
 Midterm congressional elections in June 1-986 gave opposition
 parties a majority in the 1986-1988 Congress. On.a number of
 occasions the President and the opposition congressional
 majority have traded charges of unconstitutional behavior.
 General elections are scheduled for January 31, 1988 to select
 final contenders for the Presidency, as well as congressional
 deputies, mayors, prefects, and other local officials. The
 President,-who by law cannot succeed himself, has declared
 full support for the democratic process. A final round in
 mid-May 1988 is set to elect the next President and Vice
 President. Ten presidential candidates representing the
 entire rpnge of registered parties were campaigning in late
 1987.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government seeks to be responsive to international
 inquiries on human rights issues. An Ecuadorean serves on the
 Human Rights Committee established under the United Nations
 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and on the United
 
 
 472
 ECUADOR
 Nations Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
 Discrimination. The Foreign Ministry has an office responsible
 for providing detailed replies to queries from outside Ecuador
 concerning human rights matters.
 Ecuadorean human rights bodies are free to investigate human
 rights practices within the country, although there were
 occasional accusations of official harassment of provincial
 church leaders and some other human rights activists in 1987.
 The congressional Human Rights Commission (HRC), formed in
 November 1986, was active in 1987. In April the Minister of
 Government testified to'the HRC that the Government was
 investigating charges of police abuses in Canar Province. The
 Minister stated in August that he would endeavor to improve
 prison conditions and would seek to reform the penal code and
 judicial system, while continuing to respond to terrorist
 actions with force.
 Representatives of the International Labor Organization's
 regional office in Lima travel regularly to Ecuador in order
 to consult with government officials on labor policies and
 programs.
 The Latin American Human Rights Association (ALDHU) is
 headquartered in Quito, as is an office of Amnesty
 International.' Other active human rights organizations
 include the Ecumenical Commission on Human Rights (CEDHU) and
 the National Human Rights Commission.
 During 1987 the Government has been generally unwilling to
 engage in substantive dialogue about human rights with private
 organizations.
 On September 28, Minister of Government Luis Robles was called
 before the full Congress to answer six formal queries about
 alleged human rights abuses, under a Constitutional procedure
 of "political judgment* which empowers Congress to examine the
 suitability of high officials for continued service. The
 Minister rejected the process of hearings as procedurally
 defective and left without addressing the questions which had
 been formally notified to him. After a day of debate, Congress
 voted his censure and removal from office. The President
 refused to recognize the validity of the vote and retained
 Robles. In late 1987, a civil suit charging usurpation of
 office was pending against Robles.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, color,
 sex, language, religion, political, or other affiliation,
 social origin, or economic position.
 The urban poor are predominantly of mixed race or black. The
 Indian population is primarily rural and poor. There is no
 overt or legally sanctioned discrimination practiced against
 these groups.
 The Constitution establishes complete political equality for
 men and women. There are few highly placed women in the
 political structure. Three of the 71 congressional
 representatives elected in 1984 were women; one was elected in
 the 1986 midterm election. Several women occupy prominent
 
 
 473
 ECUADOR
 positions in the present Government, though none at the
 ministerial level. A woman is a vice presidential candidate
 for a major political party.
 Although women still suffer some discrimination under civil
 law, in_1987 changes were made in laws concerning divorce,
 property-:distribution, and inheritance which in-theory give
 women equal rights with their husbands as required by the
 Constitution. Women usually receive wages lower than men
 employed in similar positions and have less prospect of
 advancement. ..
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The labor, code prescribes a standard 40-hour workweek with
 paid pnnual vacations. Ecuador enforces a minimum wage law.
 The wage.,isnot-suffiqient to support a family; to maintain a
 modest stpndard of.,living, a family must supplement it with
 earning fgom-other employment.
 Employment of individuals under the age of 18, the age of
 majority in-Ecuador, requires parental permission. This
 regulation is gefierally obseryed in larger enterprises;
 howeverLajlargepercentage of rural children are active in the
 work force.            .
 The labor, code mandates safe. and healthy working conditions
 and holds employers responsible for maintaining such
 conditions. The autonomous Social Security Institute is
 responsible.for monitoring complaints cojncerning working
 conditions and, has legpl power to enforce compliance. In
 general, enforcemet is adequate.
