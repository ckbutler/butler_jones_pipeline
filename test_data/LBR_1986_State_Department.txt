 LIBERIA
 Liberia is in a transition from military to civilian rule.
 Legally, the process is nearly complete. The Second Republic
 of Liberia came into being on January 6, when the new
 Constitution became effective. Samuel K. Doe, previously head
 of the military government which came to power in a 1980 coup,
 remains in the executive mansion as President and head of the
 National Democratic Party of Liberia (NDPL), the ruling
 political party. The legislature, consisting of a House and
 Senate along American lines, and the Supreme Court and lower
 courts are in place and functioning. Elections to complete
 the civilianization process in municipal and county offices
 took place in late 1986 and were scheduled to continue in
 early 1987.
 Politically, however, Liberia has not overcome the controversy
 and uncertainty caused by events which occurred during the
 transition. The 1980 coup and the interim 5 years of military
 rule also have witnessed an unprecedented degree of political
 violence. This violence included public executions of former
 government officials, widespread political thuggery, and an
 aborted coup attempt by exile dissidents in 1985. While
 Liberia is no longer ruled by a military government, the army,
 whose enlisted members are generally poorly educated and
 inclined toward petty extortion, continues to provide the major
 support for the current administration. There is also a new
 element of tribalism, with President Doe's small Krahn tribe
 dominating a new elite in somewhat the same way the Americo-
 Liberians he and his enlisted colleagues overthrew in 1980
 dominated Liberia for 140 years. Domestic tension heightened
 in late 1985, when October elections--in which Doe's NDPL's
 claim of a narrow victory was widely believed to have been
 fabricated--were followed a month later by a coup attempt
 launched from neighboring Sierra Leone by exile dissidents.
 The bloody coup attempt, followed by harsh government
 reprisals, reintroduced political violence on a scale similar
 to the 1980 coup and left bitter memories on all sides to be
 overcome.
 Suspicions remain on both sides. Intimidation has not been
 eliminated, sometimes occurring by unruly government
 followers, and Liberians have valid reason to be concerned
 about the prospect of undisciplined military forces and
 coercive political measures. During most of 1986, government
 restrictions fell heavily on opposition parties, particularly
 in the aftermath of the abortive November 1985 coup.
 Opposition meetings were prohibited or broken up, and the
 supporters harassed. Their efforts to form a "grand coalition"
 of opposition parties were blocked by the Government's
 contention that such a coalition was patently illegal, and
 their leaders consequently faced contempt proceedings which
 resulted in a judge incarcerating three of them in Liberia's
 maximum security prison.
 Liberia's mixed economy suffered a significant decline in 1986,
 with foreign exchange shortages and continued government
 mismanagement accelerating an economic decline. The lack of
 government fiscal discipline and serious mismanagement are the
 most important factors in the current economic difficulties,
 exacerbated by large foreign debts, weak export markets, and
 widespread misuse of government funds. The Government has
 conducted a fairly comprehensive analysis of the problem and
 formulated an economic recovery program, but its implementation
 is seriously flawed.

 LIBERIA
 During 1986 Liberian society struggled to recover from the
 events of late 1985, and, by the end of the year, political
 conditions had improved substantially. There were efforts at
 national reconciliation negotiations between the Government
 and opposition leaders, all political prisoners were released,
 no newspapers were banned (although three different papers
 were the target of various government actions and there is
 considerable self-censorship), the legislature was beginning
 to assert its constitutional prerogatives, and travel rights
 had been restored to former detainees. While the December
 legislative byelections and municipal elections appeared fair,
 the only opposition party participating in those elections
 withdrew 3 days before the voting. Administrative
 arrangements were faulty, but there were no serious
 allegations of organized or widespread fraud. There was no
 evidence of politically motivated killings or disappearances
 during 1986, and the extent of political violence and
 intimidation decreased steadily.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were substantial numbers of killings during 1985, some
 connected with the attempted November 1985 coup and many more
 with subsequent reprisals. Reports of these violent reprisals
 in late 1985 continued to emerge during early 1986. There was,
 however, no evidence of political killings occurring during
 1986.
 b. Disappearance
 As was the case with political killings, reports of
 disappearances associated with the 1985 coup attempt
 occasionally surfaced later. There was no evidence of official
 complicity in disappearances during 1986.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The new Constitution, implemented on January 6, 1986, states
 that no person charged, detained, or otherwise held in
 confinement shall be subject to torture or inhuman treatment.
 Beating and abuse of prisoners--both criminal and political--is
 fairly common. While there is no evidence that these beatings
 have official sanction, there have been no evident government
 efforts to halt them. There have been instances of government
 soldiers abusing opposition party officials. Two members of
 an opposition political party were beaten severely by executive
 mansion bodyguards prior to a planned political rally. After
 they were released from the hospital, they were brought to
 court to answer charges of holding a rally without a permit.
 In another case, soldiers took two opposition party officials
 to a military barracks where they said they were tortured and
 beaten. The officials said the soldiers tried to force them
 to make statements against the leadership of their party,
 which they refused to do. They were released and hospitalized.
 Soldiers have also been involved in beatings and abuse of
 nonpolitical civilians. Soldiers reportedly flogged eight high
 school students for allegedly stealing $1,000.
 
 
 164
 LIBERIA
 Prison conditions are bad. Cells are often small, over-
 crowded, and without windows or ventilation. Food, exercise
 opportunities, and sanitation facilities are usually
 inadequate. An opposition leader complained that she and
 other prisoners in her group were not fed the first 3 days of
 their incarceration, probably due to inept prison management.
 Allegations of abuse and degrading treatment within the prison
 system are widespread. The maximum security prison at Belle
 Yella is notorious for its harsh regimen, including hard labor
 and especially poor living conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution guarantees due process of law. Though police
 must have a warrant for arrests and persons must be charged or
 released within 48 hours, in practice these constitutional
 guarantees in 1986 were often ignored in political cases.
 Persons have the right to legal counsel and to bail in
 noncapital offenses. Where the accused is unable to secure
 his or her own lawyer, the court is required to provide legal
 services. There was only one case in 1986 which involved a
 court-appointed attorney. Monrovia has an abundance of
 attorneys who regularly handle civil and criminal cases, often
 without payment.
 As many as several hundred persons, detained in the aftermath
 of the November 12, 1985, coup attempt, were detained without
 charge or any judicial review of their detention for several
 months into 1986. All were released in June. One prominent
 opposition party leader, arrested shortly after the attempted
 coup in November 1985, still had not been brought to trial
 6 months later. There were allegations that the grand jury
 wanted to dismiss the case for lack of evidence, and an
 indictment was brought in her case only after some members of
 the grand jury were arbitrarily replaced. When finally
 indicted in April, the indictment itself did not conform to
 minimum international legal standards since the charges
 included such acts as "overtly embracing" an alleged coup
 plotter. The preliminary trial proceedings were under way on
 June 6 when President Doe announced a general amnesty for all
 those involved in the November 12, 1985, coup attempt. In
 another case, an opposition leader, arrested and charged with
 sedition, was denied access to counsel for 4 days. Six
 members of the Liberian Border Police were held for nearly 7
 months in detention before they were formally charged with
 treason. They were also released in the June 6 amnesty.
 Some miscarriages of justice appear due more to administrative
 slip-ups than to malice. For example, the Monrovia city court
 released several detainees, held for 2 to 3 months, from the
 central prison because no writs of arrest could be found, and
 there was insufficient evidence for their conviction.
 The Constitution prohibits forced labor, and the practice is
 firmly condemned by the Government.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Liberia's civilian court system is based on Anglo-American
 jurisprudence. The Constitution guarantees fair public trials
 and states that there shall be no interference with the
 lawyer-client relationship. There are constitutional
 guarantees for lawyers against government sanctions or
 interference in the performance of legal services. Three
 lawyers, active in human rights and political cases, were
 
 
 165
 LIBERIA
 suspended from practice by the Supreme Court, one for 2 years
 and the other two for 1 year each. They were suspended as a
 result of what the court called "unethical and unprofessional
 zeal" in defense of opposition politicians in the "grand
 coalition" case. The legal system is often subject to
 manipulation by the Government, but the opposition employs
 technicalities to its own advantage as well. Reports of
 financial or political pressure on lower courts are not
 uncommon, but there is generally greater respect for Supreme
 Court rulings.
 In one of the most prominent cases of the year, the Supreme
 Court charged four opposition leaders with contempt and ordered
 each to pay a fine of $1,000 or go to jail. This was based on
 a June 23 press statement in which. the opposition parties
 referred to themselves officially as a "grand coalition" in
 violation of an earlier ruling declaring the "grand coalition"
 an illegal entity since it had not undergone the proper
 registration procedures. One of the opposition leaders paid
 the fine and was released, three others refused and were taken
 to the Monrovia central prison. They were subsequently
 transferred to Belle Yella, a maximum security prison in Lofa
 County, for what the Government said were security reasons,
 but the transfer was contrary to the writ of arrest and
 constitutional guarantees against detainees being incarcerated
 among convicted prisoners.
 The wives of the three jailed opposition leaders submitted a
 writ of habeas corpus to a Monrovia court to challenge the
 legality of their husbands' detention. The judge denied the
 writ on the grounds that he had no authority in Supreme Court
 cases. Their fines were later paid, and they were released.
 There are credible reports that the Government pressures
 judges in political cases. The presiding judge in the
 well-publicized treason trial of alleged coup participants was
 accused of bias for his handling of the case. There were
 credible reports that partisans from both the prosecution and
 the defense attempted to bribe the jury. Reportedly, the judge
 attempted to intimidate the jury when it failed to render a
 guilty verdict. Court proceedings came to a standstill when
 the judge left the city after reading the verdict privately
 and did not return until ordered to do so by his superiors.
 He ordered a retrial, but the defendants were released on
 June 6 under the general amnesty before the case could be
 retried. The Liberian National Bar Association submitted a
 petition calling for the judge's impeachment as a result of
 his actions during the trial.
 Traditional courts, presided over by tribal chiefs, are not
 bound by common law or conventional judicial principles but
 apply customary and unwritten law to domestic and land
 disputes as well as petty crimes. These decisions may be
 reviewed in the statutory court system or appealed to a
 hierarchy of chiefs; administrative review by the Internal
 Affairs Ministry and, in some cases, a final review by the
 Head of State may follow. Allegations of corruption and
 incompetence in the traditional courts are common.
 There are currently no known political prisoners in Liberia.
 In addition to the June 6 general amnesty, President Doe in
 September granted clemency to two military officers detained
 because of alleged involvement in an April 1985 assassination
 attempt.
 
 
 166
 LIBERIA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution guarantees the rights of individuals against
 interference with privacy of person, family, home, or
 correspondence except by court order.
 For the most part, Liberians are free of invasion of privacy
 or state interference in their lives. However, despite
 significant improvement since the immediate post-1980 coup
 period, military indiscipline remains a problem reflecting a
 general lack of professionalism in the armed forces. This
 surfaces in random instances of harassment of the civilian
 population, such as vehicle searches, shakedowns, or arbitrary
 interrogations. In some instances, persons are compelled to
 undergo further questioning at police or military headquarters.
 Members of the opposition complain frequently about
 surveillance by government security officials. At one point
 in 1986, several opposition leaders avoided sleeping in their
 own homes, but this is no longer the case. In at least one
 case, government agents maintained conspicuous surveillance of
 one opposition personality and subjected her and her family to
 blatant harassment, including threats of physical harm.
 Opposition members often complain that their telephone calls
 are monitored.
 Thefts from the local mail have been reported, and there have
 been instances of tampering with international mail. There is
 no evidence that this is officially sanctioned.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the
 Constitution and includes freedom of speech and of the press.
 The Constitution also stipulates that persons are held "fully
 responsible for the abuse thereof." Decree 88a, passed by the
 military Government in 1984, declares the spread of "rumors,
 lies, and disinformation" a felony. During its 1986 session,
 the Senate voted to repeal Decree 88a, but the House of
 Representatives did not, and it remains in force.
 There were five daily newspapers being published in Monrovia at
 the end of 1986, only one of which is government controlled.
 Among the independent papers, there is considerable open
 sympathy toward opposition viewpoints.
 At the opening of the rural radio system, President Doe issued
 a warning to journalists, stating that "any journalist caught
 disrupting the peace and stability of the nation will be dealt
 with under the law and will be barred from practicing
 journalism." In August the Information Minister asserted that
 some journalists were in the pay of the opposition and that
 those who abused their constitutional guarantees would be
 subject to the penalties of the law. He also warned foreign
 journalists that anyone provoking disunity would be deported.
 Such warnings and administratively imposed fines resulted in a
 certain degree of self-censorship. In April one independent
 daily newspaper was fined $200 by a senate committee for
 failure to credit the official news agency with a certain
 statement about a student demonstration. In August the
 Ministry of Information fined another daily newspaper $1,000
 for incorrectly reporting the death of an imprisoned opposition
 
 
 167
 LIBERIA
 leader. The newspaper refused to pay the fine, and the
 newspaper's stance was sustained by the courts. The following
 month, the Sun Times newspaper was fined $3,000 for reprinting
 a resolution passed in July by a Liberian opposition group in
 the United States which was highly critical of President Doe's-
 Government and called for imposition of economic sanctions
 against Liberia until he was overthrown. The newspaper's
 license was revoked when it did not pay the fine within the
 prescribed period. The newspaper must pay the fine and
 reregister before it can resume publication.
 The independent Daily Observer, which had been banned in early
 1985, reopened in August 1986. A mysterious fire in March in
 its publisher's office prevented the paper from resuming
 publication earlier. The publisher also received threats from
 government officials. The editor of another independent
 newspaper, Footprints, cited financial problems and a
 government threat as reasons for his decision to cease
 publication. In March President Doe lifted the ban on the
 Press Union of Liberia. Practicing journalists are required
 to be accredited by the Minister of Information, but
 procedures procedures are lax and there are journalists,
 including foreigners, without up-to-date accreditation.
 The authority for government sanctions against independent
 newspapers is based on Decree 46, which established the
 Ministry of Information and gave it supervisory power over the
 media. The spirit of Decree 46 appears to contradict the
 guarantee of a free press contained in the Constitution
 enacted January 6. However, the Supreme Court has not been
 asked to rule on the matter.
 There is no general prohibition against receiving foreign
 publications, but the Government occasionally bans a
 particular issue of a foreign periodical. The magazine West
 Africa, which published articles critical of President Doe, is
 still banned in Liberia.
 The government-controlled Liberian Broadcast System runs one
 radio and one television station which give priority to
 government news. The Government's rural communication network
 offers a combination of entertainment and development
 information to otherwise isolated areas. Two religiously
 affiliated, independent radio stations are in operation and
 report critically on local events, though their news programs
 have also been subjected to government scrutiny.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful assembly and association is guaranteed
 in the Constitution. A 1975 law requires permits for public
 marches and demonstrations. Government auditoriums and
 schools are theoretically open for use by all parties.
 However, there are frequent opposition complaints of unfair
 treatment in practice. Permits for rallies and marches are
 only selectively granted. When opposition meetings do take
 place, participants have been subjected to intimidation and
 harassment. Joint rallies and even organizational meetings of
 the collective opposition are not allowed. An opposition
 rally scheduled for March 21 was stopped by a writ of
 prohibition issued by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court
 ruled that the rally was illegal because, among other reasons,
 the group had not requested permission from the Ministry of
 Justice in accordance with the 1975 law. In April another
 rally in Monrovia ended in violence. The leaders of the
 
 
 168
 LIBERIA
 opposition party and 37 supporters were arrested and charged
 with not having a permit for the rally. The charges were
 subsequently dropped.
 In early August, three opposition parties wrote separate
 letters to the Justice Ministry requesting permission for a
 march on August 18. The Justice Minister warned that the
 march was illegal on the grounds that the Supreme Court had
 ruled that the three parties operating as one entity
 constituted an illegal association. At the same time, an
 organization of "concerned women" publicized plans for a
 similar march on the same day to deliver a petition of
 grievances to the Justice Ministry and then an identical
 petition to the American Embassy. After warnings from the
 Justice Ministry that such marches were illegal and
 inflammatory, the women held a prayer service attended by the
 "concerned women," as well as other opposition party members.
 After the service, some demonstrators began walking toward the
 Ministry, and the police used tear gas to disperse the crowds.
 Three people--two "concerned women" and one journalist--were
 briefly arrested.
 The ruling NDPL party maintains a "task force," composed of
 several hundred young men, mostly unemployed, which opposition
 parties claim exists for the sole purpose of harassing and
 intimidating political opponents. Confrontations between
 party zealots--e.g., the ruling party's task force and
 opposition bodyguards and some members--were frequent,
 particularly early in 1986. The task force disrupted an
 opposition rally outside Monrovia, beating participants. The
 Government says it does not authorize such activities, and
 33 task force members were arrested. In August other incidents
 against opposition leaders led to the arrest of 12 task force
 suspects. Early in January 1987 .a number of task force leaders
 were detained on misdemeanor writs issued by the Ministry of
 Justice in connection with threats against government officals.
 There is no formal policy within the Government or business
 community requiring membership in the ruling NDPL. However,
 many Liberians believe that a prospective employee's chances
 are substantially improved if he is an NDPL member. Continuing
 to hold a government position is also allegedly easier if one
 is an NDPL member. Most senior officials of the major
 opposition parties who had been employed by the Government or
 state-owned organizations lost those jobs.
 In 1986 the House of Representatives voted to repeal the 1981
 Decree 2a, which bans student political activity on campuses.
 Although the Senate has not yet acted, and Decree 2a
 technically remains in effect, the students have been involved
 in political activities on campus without restrictions and with
 the approval of the universities and the Government. Student
 elections were held without incident at Cuttington University
 in June and at the University of Liberia in October.
 Workers have the right to form unions, organize, and bargain
 collectively. Liberia has a national trade union
 confederation, the Liberian Federation of Labor Unions (LFLU),
 as well as several independent unions. Organized labor
 represents only 20 percent of the workers in the monetary
 sector of the economy. Approximately 70 percent of all
 workers are engaged in subsistence agriculture and are not
 affected by the union movement. Union organizing, collYective
 bargaining, and the internal operations of trade unions are
 largely free from government interference. Decree 12 of the
 
 
 169
 LIBERIA
 military Government outlawing strikes is still operative in
 Liberia, but brief strikes have occurred despite this ban. In
 two strike actions this year, the workers returned to work
 after the Supreme Court issued an injunction against the
 strike. Underlying the strike actions was the issue of union
 recognition. In one case, the newly created labor court ruled
 for management against the workers, who had struck to protest
 management's refusal to recognize their union since they work
 for state-owned corporations. The labor court ruled that the
 strike would have led to chaos and would have robbed the
 Government of much needed revenue. The other strike action is
 currently awaiting a Supreme Court ruling and concerns a union
 still in the process of accreditation.
 The LFLU is a member of the Brussels-based International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, as well as the continent-
 wide Organization of African Trade Union Unity. In 1985 the
 Liberian Government was cited by the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) for violations of ILO Convention 87,
 regarding freedom of association, because Liberian legislation
 does not recognize the right of Liberians in the public
 service or in government enterprises to unionize or the right
 to strike. The Liberian Government, the unions, and employers
 have jointly drafted a new labor code which eliminates the
 objectionable legislation cited by the ILO, but the new labor
 code has not yet been passed by the Senate. An ILO-
 representative visited Liberia in 1986 to promote the labor
 code and encourage its passage.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution states that freedom of religion is a
 fundamental right of all Liberian citizens. No religion has
 preference over any other, and there is no established state
 religion. Christianity, brought by 19th century settlers and
 spread through the interior by missionaries, has long been the
 religion of the political and economic elite. The majority of
 the rural population continues to practice local religions.
 Approximately 20 percent of the population is Muslim. The
 Liberian Council of Churches, an organization comprised of
 most of the Christian sects in Liberia, has earned the respect
 of Liberian society and played a major role in the ongoing
 reconciliation efforts between the Government and the
 opposition parties held in mid-1986. During 1986 reports
 surfaced of conflict between several Christian communities and
 the traditional and secret male initiation society, Poro,
 resulting in beatings of church members and damage to church
 properties. The dispute revolved around Poro assertions that
 Christian clergy were divulging Poro secrets in their campaign
 to win converts. The Government sent officials to investigate
 and subsequently convoked tribal leaders to Monrovia, but thus
 far it has been unsuccessful in eliminating the problem.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees every person the right to move
 freely throughout Liberia and to leave and enter Liberia at
 any time. In practice, however, both domestic movement and
 foreign travel sometimes are restricted. Police and military
 check points were evident within Monrovia and throughout
 Liberia, although less so as the year wore on. This has the
 effect of impeding movement, especially after dark, when
 police check private and public transportation. It is common
 
 
 170
 LIBERIA
 for individual citizens to pay bribes at the checkpoints to
 avoid being harassed.
 Exit visas are required for departure and occasionally are
 denied. A week after President Doe granted executive amnesty
 to all persons accused of activities related to the November
 1985 coup attempt, the Government imposed a foreign travel ban
 on them, and a number of passports were confiscated. The ban
 was lifted in late December. One opposition leader, under the
 restrictions of the travel ban and denied an exit visa, fled
 the country. Another opposition official, after having
 received an exit visa, had her passport confiscated at the
 airport, although it was later returned, and she was allowed
 to leave. In midyear, while Monrovia teachers were on strike,
 the president of the teachers' union was denied an exit visa
 to take advantage of a United States Information Service
 international visitor's grant. Opposition party figures on
 occasion have been prevented from leaving Monrovia to travel
 in the interior.
 Refugees are not generally forced to return to the countries
 from which they have fled.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Political power remains concentrated in the hands of the
 President and ruling party, the NDPL, which still rely to a
 large degree on the military for control. The legislature is
 dominated by the NDPL, and although the Government, if
 determined, can get its way, consultations take place and the
 legislature is beginning to assert itself. Liberians have
 long maintained at least a formal commitment to democracy and
 the importance of law in society. In 1985 multiparty elections
 took place, and legislative byelections and municipal elections
 were held in late 1986. The 1985 elections were marred by
 significant irregularities, but the 1986 elections were
 apparently open and fair. Decree 88a, the courts, the
 elections commission, and the police have been employed to
 constrain opposition parties and leaders. Thus, in Liberia,
 despite constitutional guarantees and universal suffrage,
 representative democracy has not yet been achieved.
 The new Constitution of the Second Republic prohibits the
 creation of a one-party state. Free and fair elections by
 secret ballot are guaranteed. The Constitution provides for
 an elections commission to monitor all political activities in
 the country. The elections law empowers the commission to
 certify parties, conduct all elections, and count election
 ballots. The five commission members are appointed by the
 executive for life and currently are all ex-NDPL members.
 Representatives of the opposition argue, therefore, that a
 prerequisite for fair elections is the creation of a more
 independent vote-counting mechanism.
 The opposition accuses the elections commission of abusing its
 powers under the Constitution and elections law to limit the
 effectiveness of the opposition parties. They cite commission
 threats to revoke the registration certificates of the three
 opposition parties for continuing to act as a "grand coalition"
 in violation of the Supreme Court ruling. President Doe also
 has publicly and arbitrarily warned the opposition leaders not
 to function as a single political entity.
 
 
 171
 LIBERIA
 The first byelections were held in December. Six legislative
 seats were~contested, and the NDPL won all six. Three
 opposition parties refused to participate. A fourth party,
 the United Peoples Party (UPP), was unbanned in October. It
 had proposed candidates in-the by-elections but withdrew 3 days
 before the elections. The UPP's complaints about election
 procedures were largely met a week before polling day.
 Independent candidates also participated and were elected, but
 turnout was very low in these municipal elections and
 byelections.
 President Doe and the opposition parties (excluding the UPP)
 held reconciliation talks under the auspices of the Liberian
 Council of-Churches in May and June. The talks broke down
 over opposition demands for new general elections.
 Reconciliation efforts under private auspices started again in
 October. The Liberia People's Party (LPP) remains technically
 banned. However, members of the LPP have affiliated themselves
 with other groups, and the LPP as an organization has
 virtually disappeared from the local scene.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government met with an official from the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in February and allowed an
 ICRC representative to meet privately with all political
 prisoners in February. Foreign observers, including the
 American Bar Association, Amnesty International, The Lawyers
 Committee for Human Rights, The International Human Rights Law
 Group, and The Fund for Free Expression were allowed to cover
 the treason trial of James Holder, Robert Phillips, and
 Anthony Marquee.
 After press speculation about the health of the three
 opposition leaders held temporarily at Belle Yella, the
 Government permitted representatives of the independent press
 and a film crew to fly to the prison to interview the
 prisoners. The three prisoners appeared healthy and talked
 freely.
 A nonpartisan group of Liberians formed a human rights
 organization in Monrovia called The National Alliance for
 Peace and Human Rights. The Government did not cooperate in
 its request for formal incorporation, but there has been no
 attempt to prevent it from meeting.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution states that "only persons who are Negroes or
 of Negro descent" shall qualify by birth or naturalization to
 be citizens of Liberia. The Constitution also states that
 only Liberian citizens can own land. Otherwise, there is no
 officially sanctioned discrimination on the basis of race,
 sex, religion, language, or social status.
 President Doe's small Krahn tribe has a predominant role in
 the new elite which has been established since the overthrow
 of the Americo-Liberians in 1980. Members of the Krahn tribe
 hold a disproportionate number of posts in the Government and
 the military.
 
 
 172
 LIBERIA
 The status of women varies depending on the region of the
 country. In urban areas and along the seacoast, women can
 inherit land and property. In rural areas where traditional
 ties are strongest, a woman is normally considered the
 property of her husband and his clan and is not usually
 entitled to inherit from her husband. In newly urban areas,
 many women are subject to both customary and statutory legal
 systems. Female circumcision is widely practiced by those
 Liberians following traditional religions. Women in Liberia
 have held ministerial and ambassadorial positions and are
 represented in the professions throughout the modern economy.
 Women hold two cabinet posts and several national judicial
 positions. There are two women in the national legislature,
 one in the Senate and one in the House. The Ambassador to the
 United States is a woman.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Liberia's labor laws provide for minimum wages and health and
 safety standards. The workweek is normally 40 hours.
 Inspection is not rigorous, however. Employees are prohibited
 from employing children under 16 years of age during school
 hours. This is a difficult statute to enforce, especially
 since many children are engaged in subsistence farming. Any
