 SOUTH AFRICA
 South Africa is a multiracial country whose laws codify the
 doctrine of apartheid (racial separation) under which the
 white minority dominates national political institutions and
 defines the basic rights and obligations of people according
 to their racial or ethnic origin. Accordingly, the black
 majority suffers from pervasive discrimination in political,
 economic, and social life. The Black African majority (73%)
 continues to be denied the basic rights of citizenship and
 political participation except through the government device
 of designating tribal areas as rural 'homelands' and through
 tightly controlled urban councils.
 Soutn Africa in 1984 continued the gradualist reform process
 seen in recent years and the implementation of a new
 Constitution which for the first time provides limited
 representation in Parliament to "colored" (mixed race) and
 Asian South Africans. But 1984 also witnessed a widespread
 boycott of elections held under that Constitution and
 outbreaks of serious urban unrest over political and economic
 grievances, resulting in at least 200 deaths. The Government
 responded with increased use of state repression, including
 police violence against urban protesters and widespread
 detentions under stringent security legislation. Army units
 assisted police in cordon and search operations in townships.
 As the year ended, basic questions about government thinking
 on the pace and direction of further reform remained
 unanswered.
 South Africa's parliamentary system is dominated by the 16.2
 percent of the South African population which is white.
 Previous elections have been free and fair for whites. The
 1984 colored and Asian elections were also fairly conducted,
 although only a minority of eligible voters participated. The
 press is outspoken, but circumscribed by legislation,
 government pressure, and self-restraint. Free labor unions
 exist and the right of collective bargaining has been extended
 to the growing number of black unions that have emerged in
 recent years. Trade unionists frequently suffer official
 harassment, persecution, and detention.  South Africa's
 judiciary is independent, but security legislation encroaches
 broadly on judicial power.
 The new Constitution approved by white voters in 1983, which
 went into effect in September 1984, abandons the former
 all-white Westminster model and creates a strong executive,
 the State President. The carefully structured Parliament,
 based on a racial ratio of 4:2:1 (white: colored: Asian),
 ensures white control and continues to deny any national role
 to blacks, but does require participation on some legislation,
 including that affecting blacks, by all chambers of
 Parliament. The full impact of the new Constitution on
 apartheid legislation will only become evident once these
 institutions begin to function, starting in early 1985. While
 1984 passed without further repeal of major apartheid
 legislation, the South African Government pledged that its
 next step is to address the issue of black participation in
 the political process. The Government also signaled its
 willingness to take a more realistic view towards black
 residency rights in urban areas by such moves as the extension
 of 99-year leaseholds for blacks in the Western Cape, and by
 shifting the emphasis from "influx control* to keep blacks out
 of the cities to one of orderly" urbanization.

 SOUTH AFRICA
 The practice of apartheid remains the basis for the
 organization of South African society.   Discriminatory laws
 and practices are woven throughout the fabric of South African
 life. Important examples include:   (a) the Constitution
 itself, (b) legislation which limits black South Africans to
 generally resource poor and overpopulated "homelands', or
 deprives them of citizenship through creation of "independent"
 homelands; (c) influx control or "pass" laws which prescribe
 the conditions under which black workers and their families
 may remain outside the homelands; (d) separate and unequal
 educational systems for the various race groups; (e) the Group
 Areas Act, which mandates separate residential areas for
 whites, coloreds, Asians, and blacksl (f) the Immorality and
 Mixed Marriages Acts (now under review) which make sexual
 relations or marriage between whites and persons of other
 races illegall (g) the Separate Amenities Act, which limits
 the use of public facilities to persons of a particular race
 group (without requiring equivalent facilities for other race
 groups). Through the years, the South African Government has
 also enacted legislation that, in the name of security,
 curtails the civil liberties of any person whose statements,
 actions, or associations are viewed as a serious threat to
 established order. An effective judicial remedy against the
 denationalization of blacks or against forced resettlement
 still does not exist.
 As South Africa increasingly industrializes, the need for
 skilled black labor has created a black labor force of nearly
 10 million people residing near existing urban industrial
 areas. These realities, created by economic growth, conflict
 directly with the basic aim of "grand apartheid', namely the
 perpetuation of the physical separation of whites from
 nonwhites, and they serve as well to focus attention on
 political and human rights for the 10 million urban blacks.
 In recent years black workers have benefited from rising wages
 and improving conditions of service, but they are increasingly
 vulnerable to the economic cycle.
 At least 200 people were killed in violent political
 demonstrations in black "townships" during 1984, some as a
 result of internecine strife but most as a result of action by
 the police. Hundreds of individuals, including prominent
 trade union, student, and community leaders, were detained by
 the Government in connection with anti-constitution
 demonstrations and subsequent expressions of disagreement with
 government policy, such as a widespread work "stayaway" held
 in the Transvaal November 5-6. Some detainees were released
 by the Government December 7 and 10, but others were charged
 with "subversion" or treason.
 Also in 1984, the African National Congress (ANC) continued
 its campaign of violence against the South African Government,
 with bomb attacks throughout the country. The South African
 Government sought to curtail ANC activity through both police
 and diplomatic means, most notably through the signing of the
 Nkomati Accord with Mozambique. Unlike in previous years, the
 South African defense force waged no cross-border attacks
 against neighboring states in 1984. South African troops
 remain in south central Angola pending completion of the
 agreement on disengagement of forces signed with the Angolan
 Government in Lusaka in February 1984. In Namibia, South
 African troops still fight the Southwest Africa People's
 Organization (SWAPO), a Marxist-oriented liberation movement
 seeking independence for Namibia. In keeping with its
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 20
 
 
 296
 SOUTH AFRICA
 regional/security goals, the South African Government became a
 mediator between the Mozambican Government and guerrillas
 seeking to topple it.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were three known deaths in detention cases during 1984,
 (nine in 1983). Widespread social unrest in black townships
 resulted in nearly 200 deaths of blacks either at the hands of
 other blacks or the police.
 On February 22, 1984, Sergeant J. Van As of the security
 police was sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting Paris
 Malatji while the latter was in detention for interrogation in
 1983. Van As was the first security policeman prosecuted for
 an incident carried out in the line of duty.
 The African National Congress (ANC) claimed responsibility for
 a string of sabotage acts during 1984. Targets were primarily
 installations and offices involved with the administration of
 apartheid, including police offices and courts, in both white
 South Africa and "independent' homelands. Durban and
 Johannesburg suffered the largest number of bombings in 1984.
 While ANC stated policy was to avoid civilian deaths, a number
 of innocent civilians died in ANC incidents, the most
 significant being two bombings in Durban which involved the
 deaths of seven people.
 b. Disappearance
 South African law does not require notification of a
 detainee's family, lawyer, or other person when an individual
 is detained or released, and people have simply disappeared
 into police custody for long periods. The Second Police
 Amendment Act of 1980 prohibits unauthorized publication of
 the name of any person detained for "the prevention of or
 combatting of terroristic activities." Police spokesmen
 usually do not volunteer information on detainees but will
 often respond to written inquiries about their status. As of
 the end of October, South African police had not released
 information on 31 persons arrested at a funeral in September.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Security legislation allows police considerable latitude in
 the arrest of suspects and in the interrogation of detainees.
 Defendants and witnesses in a number of political trials have
 testified in court that they were assaulted or abused by
 police during interrogation. Despite a 1982 ministerial
 directive to improve police handling, allegations of
 mistreatment of detainees during detention continued to be
 made in 1984. In a widely publicized trial, which focused
 attention on this question, former student leader Auret Van
 Heerden brought a civil suit against 10 security policemen for
 damages as a result of his alleged mistreatment during
 detention in 1981-82. The Supreme Court acquitted all but one
 policeman who was forced to pay Van Heerden $1,000, and made
 Van Heerden pay all court and legal fees for the defendants.
 
 
 297
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Van Heerden has filed an appeal against the court ruling.
 Venda security police continued to intimidate individuals they
 regarded as threats to state security. They used surprise
 visits, unexpected searches, and long questioning sessions in
 their own offices to frighten people.
 Sections 18-23 of the Internal Security Act authorize the
 Minister of Law and Order to issue banning orders. Any person
 judged by the Minister as endangering law and order,
 threatening state security, or promoting the aims of communism
 or an unlawful organization can be (1) made to resign as an
 officer or member of any organization; (2) restricted to or
 excluded from certain areas; (3) prohibited from meeting with
 more than one person at a time; (4) ordered to report
 regularly to police stations; and (5) prohibited from being
 quoted or published. No court of law can challenge the
 Minister's power to issue banning orders, although the
 Internal Security Act does provide for administrative review
 of banning orders. According to the South African Institute
 of Race Relations, over 1,400 South Africans have been banned
 at one time or another since 1950. Approximately 370 of these
 persons left the country. One banning order on an individual
 was issued during 1984. In September 1984, the South African
 Government lifted the banning orders on Reverend Beyers Naude
 and Moki Cekisani. AS of November 1984, the number of banned
 persons was 12, including one person banned in the Transkei
 under legislation adapted from South Africa.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Four clauses of the Internal Security Act authorize detention
 without charge or trial for varying--in some cases
 unlimited--periods. The Minister of Law and Order himself
 issues orders under Section 28, which he has characterized as
 preventive detention. Senior police officials may detain
 people for interrogation under Section 29 when offenses such
 as terrorism, sabotage, or inciting a revolutionary situation
 are suspected. Access to the detainee is severely restricted,
 and no court may challenge arrests under the provisions of
 this law. According to the Detainees Parents Support
 Committee, the South African Institute of Race Relations, and
 the South African Council or Churches, 572 people were
 detained as of August 30, 1984. The Minister of Law and Order
 refuted this figure and claimed that 242 were detained during
 the same period. The Minister stated to a journalist in late
 October that from January 1 to September 19, 138 people had
 been detained under Section 29, with 70 released. Under
 Section 15, of those detained in the same period in
 particularly violent situations for up to 14 days, 79 of 80
 were released within the two-week period. Of 19 people
 detained under Section 28, none are now detained without
 charge; six were charged with treason or subversion. The
 Minister's figures do not include detentions in the
 *independent" homelands of the Transkei, the Ciskei and
 Venda. As a result of demonstrations against government
 policy that occurred between late August and November,
 hundreds of persons were detained under Sections of the
 Internal Security Act and the Criminal Procedures Act, but
 precise figures are not yet available. Some of these
 individuals have been released but face charges of
 .subversion" or high treason.
 
 
 298
 SOUTH AFRICA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 While the principle of habeas corpus is affirmed in South
 African common law, it is nullified in practice by various
 security law provisions. If a person cannot pay for his or
 her defense, limited funds for legal assistance are available
 through the publicly funded Legal Aid Board or various private
 organizations. However, these sources do not accept all
 cases, nor do they meet more than a fraction of the total
 need. As a rule, the court will appoint counsel without
 charge only in cases involving capital offenses.
 Because security detainees may be interrogated without access
 to counsel, they may admit to actions or charges the
 implications of which they may not fully understand.
 However, such statements often are not admissable in court.
 Many trials are held in camera or in distant parts of the
 country, making it difficult or impossible for family or
 others to attend. If deemed necessary by the court, witnesses
 may testify without being publicly identified. Security and
 criminal trials are held before regular courts, which are
 generally regarded as independent of executive or military
 control, although all judges and practically all magistrates
 are white. The black population has virtually no
 representation in the judicial system.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The system of apartheid, or political and social separation of
 ethnic groups, necessarily implies extensive government
 regulation of areas of social, personal, and family life,
 which in most democratic countries are considered matters of
 free choice. Membership in an ethnic group or race is based
 on definitions and decisions of the Government. In doubtful
 cases, racial classification is determined administratively by
 a racial classification board empowered to weigh evidence and
 to issue a verdict on an individual's race when the parents'
 racial classification is not known.
 Under apartheid, the people with whom one associates are not a
 matter of free choice in many cases. The Immorality and Mixed
 Marriages Acts, for example, prohibit marriage or sexual
 relations between the races, although the Government tolerates
 some instances of *mixed' marriage. Prosecutions and
 convictions for violation of the Immorality and Mixed
 Marriages Acts have remained fairly constant over the past 20
 years, averaging around 180 per year. In mid-1984, a
 Parliamentary Select Committee began study of changes,
 possibly including repeal of the Mixed Marriages Act and the
 relevant sections of the Immorality Act, but in September left
 decisions to the tricameral Parliament. The Separate
 Amenities Act allows premises to be reserved for the exclusive
 use of persons of a particular race. In recent years the
 Government has expanded the scope of administrative exceptions
 from apartheid laws allowing some restaurants, drive-in
 theaters, private hospitals, parks, libraries, and other
 public amenities to admit persons of all races upon
 application. Certain legal barriers to interracial sport have
 also been lifted. Although the Government announced in
 February that segregation of public facilities would now be
 discretionary rather than mandatory, few significant changes
 have occurred. A move by the Pretoria City Council to close
 13 parks to blacks was defeated in April 1984. In October,
 
 
 299
 SOUTH AFRICA
 the Durban City Council announced it would renew efforts to
 open Durban beaches to all races.
 Freedom to choose one's own associates is largely and
 sytematically limited by the Group Areas Act, which decrees
 that the four officially distinguished racial groups, white,
 colored, Asian, and African, must live in separate areas. In
 the case of black South Africans, this means residing in one
 of the 10 "homelands" unless employment and state permission
 (so-called Section 10 rights) to reside in an urban area can
 be obtained. Until 1983, black home ownership outside the
 homelands was extremely limited by laws and restrictions.
 Most urban township homes are rented from the Government which
 owns and subsidizes them. Some more prosperous blacks
 construct their own houses in urban areas, but they cannot own
 the land. Since 1983 blacks may obtain 99-year leases on land
 in many urban areas for home construction, but they still do
 not enjoy freehold rights. In September 1984, the 99-year
 leasehold privilege was extended to the Western Cape and that
 area dropped a policy of labor preference for coloreds,
 potentially easing employment of blacks. Parliament amended
 the Group Areas Act in mid 1984 to grant the State President
 the authority to open central business districts to black
 entrepreneurs. The decision must be made in consultation with
 local authorities.
 Since the pattern of group residence called for under the
 apartheid system does not correspond to the actual location of
 the various groups, the Government has forcibly relocated many
 people. The forced resettlement of black and colored
 "squatters" in urban areas and removal of black settled
 communities, so-called "black spots," from designated white
 areas to black tribal homelands have continued, despite an
 announcement by the Minister of Cooperation and Development in
 early 1984 that no more forced removals would take place. In
 early 1984, the Government forcibly removed the people of
 Mogopa, and throughout 1984, authorities knocked down squatter
 shacks near Cape Town. Since 1961 an estimated 3.5 million
 blacks, coloreds, and Asians have been forcibly relocated
 either in the homelands or to other parts of urban areas,
 according to statistics given in a 1983 report by the Surplus
 Peoples Project and a South African Council of Churches
 booklet published in 1984. The Minister of Cooperation and
 Development confirmed in May that two million blacks had been
 resettled since 1960. However, this figure does not include
 834,400 resettled coloreds and Asians. (An additional 730,000
 blacks found themselves inside the homelands when the
 boundaries were drawn.) Resettlement areas, particularly in
 the homelands, usually have inadequate facilities and
 inadequate land and water for agriculture. The Government has
 also required some white farmers to sell their land and
 relocate to allow for the creation of the homelands. However,
 the compensation paid by the Government in these cases is
 generally considered adequate.
 Blacks' residences and travel are regulated by a system of
 "influx control" or "pass" laws which severely restrict the
 number of blacks entitled to remain in a given urban area for
 more that 72 hour at a time. Periodically, police conduct
 raids or sweeps of the restricted area during which all passes
 are checked. All persons illegally resident are arrested
 and/or transported to their associated homeland.   In May
 1983, the appeals court upheld a Supreme Court decision in the
 landmark Rikhoto case that migrants who have worked 10 years
 
 
 300
 SOUTH AFRICA
 or more for the same employer or 15 years for different
 employers are entitled to permanent city residency. Blacks
 are winning Rikhoto rights, but the process is time-consuming,
 and the effects are not yet widespread. The Government
 effectively tied the granting of such rights to the
 availability of housing, and many people eligible for
 permanent city residency are prevented from taking up
 residency because of housing shortages.
 In one administrative improvement in the influx control system
 in 1984, the Government assigned the "pass courts" to the
 regular magistrates' courts under the jurisdiction of the
 Department of Justice, resulting initially in fewer
 convictions on pass law violations. In late April 1984, the
 Minister of Cooperation and Development withdrew the highly
 contentious Orderly Movement and Settlement of Black Persons
 Act, partially because of its impact on those eligible for
 Section 10 rights.
 The Black Urban Areas Consolidation Act allows police to enter
 homes without a warrant if any black is suspected of illegally
 residing or working in the area. The Criminal Procedures Act
 of 1977 authorizes a judge or magistrate to issue a search
 warrant if reasonable belief exists that "the internal
 security of the Republic or the maintenance of law and order
 is likely to be endangered by or in consequence of a 'meeting'
 being held in a given place". Under this same Act a police
 officer may enter, search, and question anyone in a place
 without a warrant if the officer has reason to believe a
 warrant would be issued but the delay caused by first
 obtaining the warrant would defeat the purpose of the search.
 In October 1984, 7,000 men of the South African police and the
 South African Defense Force surrounded the black township of
 Sebokeng, south of Johannesburg, and implemented a
 house-to-house search for "criminal elements." Police
 arrested 354 persons under various sections of the Criminal
 Procedures Act, most of whom were brought before specially
 established courts the same day, but others continued to be
 held. The stated purpose of the operation was to quell
 continuing unrest in the township in the wake of violence
 which broke out at the time of the colored and Asian elections.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The basically white-owned press continues to be a vigorous
 critic of the Government of South Africa. The press remains a
 vital channel of communication within South Africa and with
 the outside world. However, this press freedom is
 increasingly circumscribed by legal restrictions on coverage
 of certain topics and "voluntary" self-regulation. Thus, the
 Media Council, created in 1983, has upheld the principle of
 self-censorship in reporting. In a September 1984 ruling
 against the Pretoria News, the Council stated that a newspaper
 has a responsibility to base comment only on "true facts" to
 ensure fair reporting. The Government has restricted the
 areas on which the press may report. Among the proscribed
 areas are energy supplies, including petroleum and nuclear
 energy, and protection of "official secrets". In May 1984,
 the South African Government announced its willingness to
 relax the provisions of the Prisons Act governing press
 coverage of prison conditions. In addition to restrictive
 legislation, the Government occasionally takes direct action
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 301
 SOUTH AFRICA
 to suppress press activities, including banning newspapers and
 journalists. In late September 1984, the police searched the
 offices of Afrascope, an independent film organization, seized
 videotapes and other material and subsequently detained a
 staffer. Except for newspapers, direct government censorship
 of all publications, films and public entertainment is
 authorized by the Publications Act of 1974. In November the
 government subpoenaed 15 journalists in connection with its
 investigations of township unrest.
 Television and radio are not directly censored, but these
 media are government monopolies. Reports and comments opposed
 to the Government, while permitted, are limited and
 controlled. Such controls and the tenor of government media
 are matters of widely critical comment in the press. The
 government-appointed Publications Committee established by the
 Publications Act may prohibit the distribution or possession
 of publications, films or other public entertainment that in
 its view is "obscene" or "blasphemous" (interpreted more
 broadly than in the U.S.); brings any section of the public
 into ridicule; harms relations between sections of the publicl
 or is prejudicial to the safety of the State. Decisions of
 the Publications Committee may be appealed to the
 government-appointed Publications Appeal Board, but not to the
 courts. During 1984, the Publications Appeal Board adopted a
 more relaxed attitude toward censorship, lifting, for example,
 in January 1984 the ban on the Freedom Charter, a document
 outlining African nationalist principles. Also, in August the
 Board overturned a decision by the Publications Committee to
 ban the Windhoek Observer because of its alleged
 anti-government activities, and its disregard of censorship
 laws.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of association is regulated by a complex set of laws
 which prescribe separate schools, residential areas, and
 public facilities for different racial groups and prohibit
 interracial sex or marriage. In addition, the Political
 Interference Act of 1968 makes it unlawful for a person of one
 racial group to join a political party which has members of
 another racial group; to participate in an election campaign
 for a person of another racial group; or to address a group
 for the purpose of promoting a political party. However, the
 Opposition Progressive Federal Party announced in September
 1984 its intention to open the party to members of all racial
 groups in defiance of the Political Interference Act.
 The Internal Security Act obstructs freedom of assembly as it
 gives magistrates the power to prohibit gatherings under
 certain conditions, to impose conditions on the holding of
 meetings, and to close off areas to the public to prevent
 prohibited gatherings. In response to widespread unrest in
 1976, the Minister of Justice banned all outdoor gatherings
 except sports or specially authorized meetings. Though
 originally invoked for a one-year period, the ban has been
 renewed each succeeding year and is still in effect. In
 August 1984, following unrest surrounding the colored
 parliamentary elections, the Minister banned all indoor
 meetings of a political nature, except those held by
 officially recognized political parties. The ban remained in
 effect until the first session of the new Parliament ended at
 the end of September. Leaders of the election boycott
 
 
 302
 SOUTH AFRICA
 campaign were detained after staging peaceful protests on the
 day of the colored elections.
 With regard to labor unions, the Labor Relations Act in
 principle allows total freedom of association. However, this
 principle does not as yet apply across the board. The mining
 sector is covered by the Mines and Works Act which still
 contains certain racially based employment criteria. More
 than two million agricultural and domestic workers are not
 covered at all. Problems still exist with the issue of union
 registration under the Act. However, the number of negotiated
 wage settlements continued to increase, providing greater
 leverage by non-whites in the nation's economic life. In a
 milestone case, the National Union of Mineworkers staged the
 first legal strike by a union of black mineworkers in
 September 1984 when negotiations with the Chamber of Mines
 reached a stalemate. The strike ended after one day when a
 negotiated wage settlement was reached. Workers of all races
 are prohibited by law from picketing. Aside from the National
 Union of Mineworkers strike, virtually all strikes have been
 illegal, but the Government has not usually prosecuted leaders
 in the vast majority of strike incidents. As noted in section
 l(f), in September 1984 the Government abolished colored job
 reservation in the Western Cape.
 As of June 30, 1984, 18 black trade unionists were detained.
 An unknown number of black trade unionists are presently
 serving jail sentences. Two trade unionists remain banned.
 Moreover, in the wake of a successful November 5-6 politically
 inspired protest work Istayaway' (the word strike was never
 used), in which 7 trade union organizations participated
 jointly with a broad-based political opposition front, 21 more
 trade unionists were detained, including the leaders of the
 two most prominent black trade union confederations, some of
 whom were subsequently released. Thousands of workers at the
 Government's SASOL fuel plant were fired for participating in
 the politically oriented stayaway.
 Contact with international labor groupings and other national
 labor centers, including United States labor organizations, is
 monitored but allowed. Foreign trade unionists wishing to
 visit South Africa sometimes encounter visa problems. Some
 South African trade unionists wishing to travel abroad have
 been refused passports.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of worship is generally respected. Religious
 organizations are allowed to hold meetings and other
 activities without interference as long as they do not
 seriously challenge government policies. As with other
 aspects of South African life, churches are often divided
 along racial lines, but many churches (including a growing
 number of white churches) do challenge apartheid as a matter
 of theological doctrine. Church groups are very active in
 urging either support for or opposition to the new
 Constitution. Effective January 1, 1984, amendments to the
 Defense Act provide, for the first time, alternative service
 options for religious objectors to National Military Service.
 Conscientious objectors on non-religious grounds continue to
 be subject to a maximum six-year sentence for refusing to
 serve.
 
 
 303
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Government ministers often criticize the South African Council
 of Churches (SACC) and its General Secretary, Anglican Bishop
 and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Desmond Tutu. During 1984 the
 South African Government released its report of an
 investigation of the SACC. The report was critical of some
 activities such as poor administration of funds and support of
 'confrontationist' bodies; but despite SACC fears, the
 Government has taken no action against the organization. Some
 clergymen who actively oppose government policy have
 previously been banned, but a prominent critic, Reverend
 Beyers Naude, was unbanned in 1984.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 White South Africans, other than banned persons, must obtain
 permits to visit some black areas, but are otherwise free to
 move about the country. Whites must possess valid travel
 documents in order to travel abroad and to emigrate legally.
 Legal restrictions exist for Asians who wish to reside in or
 visit the Orange Free State and certain parts of the Natal
 Province. These restrictions are lifted only with special
 permission.
 The influx control, or "pass law,* system is described in
 Section I (f) of this report.
 A citizen's access to a South African passport has been
 declared a privilege, not a right. According to a court
 ruling in 1982, the Minister of Home Affairs has an
 " unchallenged right to revoke' a passport without 'ascribing
 any reasons for his action.* The Government generally
 requires that an individual assigned to an "independent"
 homeland travel abroad on a homeland travel document. Since
 no country except South Africa recognizes the 'independent'
 homelands as sovereign states, this negates the validity of
 such passports. Many blacks refuse invitations to travel
 abroad to avoid appearing to accept non-South African
 citizenship through acceptance of a homeland passport.
 Through its restrictive passport policies, the Government has
 blocked or hampered the travel from South Africa of some
 participants in U.S. Government-funded programs or private
 activities taking place abroad.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 For many decades, South Africa's national democratic
 institutions were reserved for whites only. Under the new
 Constitution, which came into effect in September 1984,
 political participation at the national level is no longer
 strictly limited to white South Africans, but includes some
 representation for Asians and coloreds. However, national
 political rights for black South Africans, who comprise 73
 percent of the population, continue to be denied. Under the
 terms of the new Constitution, all officially registered and
 recognized political parties may operate as freely as the
 ruling national party. Elections for the two new chambers of
 Parliament were held despite a boycott campaign led by the
 United Democratic Front and a relatively low level of
 participation through both failure to register and then low
 voter turnout.

 The new Constitution created a tricameral Parliament with
 racially based chambers for whites, coloreds, and Asians.
 Members for each house were elected on separate voter roles.
 Each chamber has primary responsibility for legislation
 affecting its own racial constituency. A strong executive,
 the State President, decides which issues of general concern
 should be treated by all chambers. He may ask the President's
 Council, a multi-racial consultative body, for an advisory
 opinion. The Supreme Court may review whether the State
 President followed prescribed procedures but may not pronounce
 on an issue itself. The leaders of the Asian and colored
 chambers became members of the State President's Cabinet for
 General Affairs, but they have no specific portfolio. The
 State President is elected by an electoral college containing
 50 whites, 25 coloreds, and 13 Asians. The State President
 replaces the former Prime Minister and has the power to
 dissolve Parliament and to call new elections. The new
 Parliament sat for only an abbreviated session in September
 1984. At the session, the members of the colored and Asian
 chambers were sworn in and the new State President was elected
 and inaugurated. The President's Council met the following
 week. Until the Parliament sits for a normal session
 beginning January 25, 1985, effectiveness of the new system
 remains unknown.
 With the implementation of the new constitution, the South
 African Government was confronted with the issue of black
 political participation. Currently the Government requires
 that national-level black political aspirations be realized
 through the "homelands."  Since 1970, all blacks have been
 considered to be citizens of one of 10 designated homelands,
 created by the Government and destined for eventual
 "independence." Each black is assigned to an ethnic group and
 to a homeland from birth regardless of whether the individual
 was born in, has lived in, or has ever visited that homeland.
 When a homeland becomes "independent," all blacks assigned to
 that homeland lose their South African citizenship and regain
 only the "citizenship" of the homeland. The South African
 Government stated in 1984 that it had no intention of
 abolishing the homeland system.
 Nearly 10 million blacks live in townships near white urban
 areas. In 1983 the South African Government created a special
 cabinet committee to consider means for political
 participation by these blacks. The cabinet committee has held
 a number of publicized meetings with leaders of black
 homelands, both "independent" and "self-governing." While
 discussions have been confidential, the State President
 himself has pledged to find "suitable political mechanisms"
 acceptable to urban blacks and to pay special attention to the
 issue of black citizenship and nationality. How this might
 affect the denationalization of blacks by imposing homeland
 "citizenship" is not yet clear.
 At present, urban blacks may participate in local elections
 for community council members who, in terms of the Black Local
 Authorities Act, exercise some limited control over township
 affairs. However, elections held in 1984 were heavily
 boycotted. The role of these local authorities is severely
 circumscribed by their continuing financial and administrative
 dependence on the South African Government. While the Black
 Local Authorities Act of 1982 raised the rights and
 responsibilities of these black municipal authorities to the
 status of white municipal governments, it did nothing to
 
 
 305
 SOUTH AFRICA
 redress problems of credibility or inadequate financial
 resources. Town councils and councillors were the focus of
 much of the violence which occurred in black townships in
 September and October 1984 and which underscored the weakness
 of these local authorities. In October 1984, the Government
 authorized black local authorities to form their own police
 units responsible to the local level, rather than the South
 African police. This decision has met strong opposition
 within the black community.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 South Africa extends little or no cooperation to various
 United Nations bodies or private organizations, like Amnesty
 International, which investigate South Africa's human rights
 record. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 is permitted access to convicted security prisoners and visits
 them annually. The ICRC does not visit security prisoners
 sentenced to death because the South Africa Government refuses
 to permit the Committee to speak to the prisoners in private.
 The ICRC does make recommendations for improvements in prison
 conditions which have often been implemented. Access to most,
 but not all, security detainees is denied. In its 1984
 report, Amnesty International expressed concern about the use
 of detention without trial and alleged torture and ill-
 treatment of political detainees, and also about the use of
 banning orders to restrict political opposition to the
 Government. In its 1984-85 report, Freedom House rates South
 Africa "partly free."
 A number of South African organizations observe, report, and
 contest human rights violations in the country. Black
 political organizations are active in calling for a society
 based on internationally accepted principles of human rights.
 In June 1980, a Lawyers for Human Rights Association was
 formed to monitor and suggest changes in the human rights
 situation in South Africa. The multi-racial Black Sash
 organization reports extensively on the abuses of the influx
 control system, based on its experience in assisting blacks
 who have run afoul of the pass laws. The South African
 Council of Churches speaks out on a wide range of human rights
 issues and is active in assisting persons incarcerated under
 security laws and groups denied their human rights. The South
 African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR) numbers among its
 activities the compilation of lists and statistical
 information on security detainees and banned persons. The
 SAIRR annual report is a primary source on questions of human
 rights in South Africa. The Detainees' Parents Support
 Committee also compiles statistics on persons detained under
 security legislation and provides support for families of
 detainees.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The South African economy is dualistic in nature, containing
 both a highly sophisticated modern sector and a large
 underdeveloped rural sector where the vast majority of people
 are engaged in simple subsistence agriculture. Virtually the
 entire white and Asian populations, and a significant
 proportion of the colored population, receive their income
 from the modern economy. Most of the economically active
 
 
 306
 SOUTH AFRICA
 African population of approximately 7 million also participate
 in the *first world* economy, though generally at
 significantly lower rates or renumeration and skill/authority
 levels. However, various apartheid regulations ("influx
 control*) effectively exclude many Africans from seeking
 opportunity in urban areas. Roughly half of the African
 population resides in the various homelands, which for the
 most part are resource-poor and lacking in job opportunities.
 There has been considerable economic development in a few
 homeland areas, aided by several government decentralization
 programs. Nevertheless, subsistence agriculture, supplemented
 by remittances from relatives working in "white" South Africa,
 is the most prevalent source of livelihood. Since many, if
 not most, of the economically active males in the homelands
 seek employment in the modern sector of "white" South Africa,
 a disproportionate number of dependents (women, children, and
 the elderly) actually reside in the homelands. Over 60
 percent of the population from 20-65 residing in the ten
 homelands is female. Though agricultural progress is being
 achieved in some rural black areas, the homelands as a whole
 do not produce enough food to feed their resident populations,
 despite government claims that the homelands are potentially
 self-sufficient agriculturally.
 The South African economy has slowed perceptibly in the past
 three years, and was a factor in the 1984 unrest. The South
 African Government has estimated that an annual real growth of
 5 to 6 percent is necessary for the economy to absorb the
 approximately 250,000 African entrants to the labor market
 each year. An even higher rate of growth would be necessary
 to reduce present black unemployment. However, there seems to
 be very little possibility of South Africa experiencing such
 growth in the foreseeable future. World Bank data indicate a
 relatively high per capita gross national product of $2,717 in
 1983. Income distribution has traditionally been skewed along
 racial lines, though this phenomenon has diminished to some
 degree.
 African unemployment is not measured directly. Government
 figures show an incease in unemployment among the economically
 active population throughout 1983 and 1984. This does not
 reflect conditions of unemployment and underemployment in the
 rural areas. The official unemployment rate among Africans
 was recorded at 8.0 percent (488,000 unemployed) in June
 1984. As the economy continued to experience a downturn
 unemployment rose, generally a phenomenon more serious among
 the African population. Unemployment among whites is less
 than one percent and is only marginally higher among Asians
 and coloreds. Private estimates of total black unemployment
 (including the 10 homelands) range up to 25 percent or more.
 A respected South African University study indicates that the
 black share of personal income has been rising slowly in
 recent years from 23 percent of the total in 1970 to 29
 percent in 1980. A South African Government statistical
 survey conducted in 1983 found that the average salary for
 Africans has more than trebled since 1979 while white average
 earnings have not quite doubled in the same period. An
 average African salary, it found, is around $145 per month
 while the average colored person takes home $192, and the
 average Indian $270. Whites, on the other hand, have an
 average monthly salary of just more than $550. An African
 worker in the mines earns an average of $136 a month; his
 
 
 307
 SOUTH AFRICA
 colored colleague earns an average of $235, Indians are paid
 $380, and whites $750. The white/black wage gap is slightly
 wider in the public service than in the private sector as a
 whole (including all homelands), where the black average is
 $137 a month as opposed to a white average of $510.
 According to the World Bank, the South African population was
 31,698,000 in 1984 with an overall growth rate of 2.4
 percent. The most recent census of the country's population,
 taken in 1980, records average annual population growth rates
 by racial groups from 1970 to 1980 as: whites, 1.7 percent;
 coloreds, 2.2 percentl Asians, 2.4 percent and Africans, 2.7
 percent. Official World Bank statistics indicate an overall
 infant mortality rate of 87.9 per 1,000 live births in 1984.
 Official government statistics on infant mortality by racial
 group in 1978 were: whites 14.9; coloreds, 80.61 and Asians,
 25.3. Records for Africans are incomplete, but estimates of
 infant mortality among this sector of the population range up
 to more than 200 per 1,000 live births, especially in rural
 homelands such as Ciskei. The higher rate of infant mortality
 among Africans is ascribed largely to poor sanitary conditions
 and low standards of nutrition. These factors, combined with
 the lack of sufficient hospitals and doctors for blacks,
 especially in the African homelands, account for the
 differences in life expectancy among the different population
 groups. World Bank statistics for 1980 show a life expectancy
 of 64.1 years for all South Africans. A 1983 South African
 Government report indicates whites have a life expectancy of
 70.3 years, Asians 65 years, coloreds 59 years, and Africans
 57.5 years.
 The drought experienced in South Africa over the past three
 years has exacerbated the problem of malnutrition among
 Africans, especially children. A respected university study
 done in 1981--before the drought became serious--found 2.9
 million children (mostly Africans) suffering from at least
 mild forms of malnutrition. As the drought has continued, the
 situation has deteriorated. The South African Government has
 provided drought relief of $20 million to the African
 homelands and is currently spending $13 million for short-term
 job creation to combat the effects of the recession and the
 drought. Many government critics believe these amounts fall
 far short of what is necessary and have called upon the
 government to provide money for emergency feeding schemes.
 Private relief organizations are currently feeding
 approximately one million people at a cost of over $200,000
 per month.
 The most recent World Bank data available indicate that as of
 1960, 57 percent of the adult population of South Africa was
 literate. Since for whites, coloreds, and Asians, school
 attendance is compulsory, it is likely that virtually all
 adult members of these groups are literate. Some surveys have
 claimed that 50-60 percent of all adult Africans are
 literate. Such findings are difficult to corroborate given
 the rural nature of so much of the African population and
 disagreement over standards used to gauge literacy. In 1981
 African pupil enrollment was just over five million in regular
 primary through high school grades. Only slightly more than
 one percent of enrollment was in the last grade of high
 school, illustrative of a high drop-out rate. A private study
 indicted that of African school-leavers, some 54 percent
 departed prior to achieving literacy.

 SOUTH AFRICA
 Under the new Constitution, education is an *own" affair with
 whites, coloreds, and Asians having separate departments and
 ministers of education. African education is separate from
 these three departments and the South African Government has
 until recently steadfastly resisted the idea of a single
 educational system for all. The Department of Cooperation,
 Development and Education recently stated that the new
 Department of National Education is the central education
 department recommended by the DeLange Commission on Education,
 with the duty to prescribe general education policy and
 standards for all population groups. Within the present
 system, the Government has been devoting dramatically
 increased funds for educating blacks. The Government states
 that the budget for black education increased from $35 million
 in 1972 to $354 million in 1984 (not constant dollars). There
 remains, however, a huge disparity between spending on blacks
 as opposed to whites, with the Government spending
 approximately $7 on each white student for every $1 spent on
 each African student.
 The South African Institute of Race Relations estimates per
 capita spending on education as $692 for whites, $436 for
 Asians, $296 for coloreds and $96 for Africans. These figures
 only apply in "white" areas. Amounts spent in the homelands
 are even lower. Student/teacher ratios are 18.2 for whites,
 23.6 for Asians. 26.7 for coloreds and 42.7 for blacks in
 'white' South Africa. In the homelands the ratios vary from
 31.9 to 49.7 Nevertheless, the trend is toward a narrower gap
 in expenditure and educational opportunities for all racial
 groups. Starting in 1981, free compulsory education up to the
 fourth grade began to be gradually introduced for Africans.
 It is now in effect at 250 schools with a total of 100,000
 students affected. African enrollment at "white" universities
 (for subjects not offered in the largely segregated black
 universities) has been growing slowly but substantially.
 South Africa suffers from a housing shortage that continues to
 worsen. The African population is the hardest hit. Early in
 1982, a South African Government department announced that
 almost 120,000 housing units would have to be built annually
 in "white* South Africa to overcome the shortage within ten
 years. For Africans alone, the Department said some 52,000
 units would be needed every year. The situation in the
 homelands is worse, yet the amount spent on housing in South
 Africa dropped from 2.7 percent of GDP in 1970 to 2.3 percent
 in 1980. A one-year program to sell 500,000 government-owned
 houses (most of which are occupied by Africans) at discounts
 of up to 40 percent begun in July 1983, has been extended
 beyond its original one year and will continue until July
 1985. During the first 14 months of the program, however,
 only 32,000 homes were sold. The sale of houses was
 universally welcomed, but many government critics are
 disappointed that the Government has refused to grant freehold
 rights to Africans. The granting of 99-year leasehold rights
 (which are now renewable) to some blacks is a sign that
 freehold may be forthcoming.
 Women in South Africa suffer legal, cultural, and economic
 discrimination, most of which is based on traditionrather
 than codified in law. The latest South African statistics
 show that women constitute 41.1 percent of the workforce, but
 only hold 12 percent of managerial positions. Women
 traditionally earn lower wages than men. Women are
 politically underrepresented. No women presently serve as
 
 
 309
 SOUTH AFRICA
 ministers in the Government. Two members of the President's
 Council are women. Only 3 of the 178 "white" parliamentary
 seats are occupied by women; 9 women stand alongside 167 men
 on provincial councils. During 1984, women's organizations
 actively supported female candidates at local levels with
 moderate success. Maternity benefits are not quaranteed;
 a pregnant woman can legally be dismissed from her job.
 Abortion is illegal. No fertility/contraceptive legislation
 exists. Until 1984, married female teachers were
 discriminated against in terms of job placement and pay. New
 legislation will gradually phase out quotas in school faculty
 hiring practices; previously 40 percent of all jobs were
 reserved for men, even if no qualified men wdre available.
 Married women will now compete equally with single women
 teachers. The legislation supports equity of pay for
 teachers, but tradition dictates that men receive higher
 salaries because they probably support families.
 One important change in the status of women in South Africa in
 1984 was passage of the Matrimonial Property Act, which
 abolishes the marital power of the husband. All marriages
 will automatically occur in community of property unless an
 antenuptial contract establishes a different financial
 relationship. The accrual system will be used for marriages
 in community of property, so that a wife may share in the
 accrued assets of the marriage at its dissolution. Married
 women may now enter contractual arrangements on their own
 merit. The legislation's one major drawback is that it
 applies only to white, colored and Asian women, although a
 parliamentary committee promises to examine the possibility of
 extending its provisions to black women as well.
 While sexual discrimination in South Africa tends to cut
 across racial distinctions, black women continue to suffer
 more than white, colored, and Asian women. Domestic workers,
 most of whom are black, are not protected by minimum wage laws
 and do not qualify for sick leave or maternity benefits. The
 Machinery and Occupational Safety Act, passed in early 1984,
 will extend to domestic workers who may claim some
 compensation from the employer for injuries sustained on the
 job. Changes in black taxation that took effect in February
 hit black married women harder than men. Married black women
 may pay as much as three times more tax than married men, as
 they are taxed at a higher rate. Black women are perpetual
 minors before the law. The Government's failure to extend the
 Matrimonial Property Act to black women has drawn heavy
 criticism from blacks and whites. Black women are also
 severely limited in their ability to own property and rent
 accommodations in urban areas where they find employment.
 Increasingly, black women are turning to jobs previously held
 by men, such as trenchdigging, because they can earn a bit
 more than as domestic worker.
 Against this background of traditional discrimination, a
 nascent women's rights movement has taken root in South
 Africa. Women's organizations, very often multiracial, have
 been at the forefront of the struggle for civil rights, on the
 premise that civil rights for all must ultimately mean
 equality for women.
