 MALAWI
 The year 1993 gave promise of ending one-man, one-party rule in Malawi. In Oc-
 tober 1992, Malawi's leader since independence, the Life President, Dr. H. Kamuzu
 Banda, called for a referendum to determine whether or not Malawi would continue
 as a one-party state. On June 14, 1993, Malawians voted by a margin of two to one
 in favor of a multiparty system. Two days later Banda publicly accepted the results
 and acknowledged the need for change.

 In late 1993, seven political parties were legally registered and operating openly,
 and multiparty elections were scheduled for May 17, 1994. Dialog between the oppo-
 sition and the ruling Malawi Congress Party (MCP) resulted in the establishment
 of a National Consultative Council (NCC) and a National Executive Committee
 (NEC), both with representatives from all registered parties, to oversee changes in
 the Constitution, laws, constituency boundaries, and election rules and procedures.
 In November, Parliament passed bills eliminating from the Constitution single-party
 clauses (such as Banda's Life Presidency), appending a bill of rights, establishing
 a multiparty electoral law, and repealing detention-without-trial prvisions of the
 Public Security Act, as well as the Forfeiture Act and Malawi's restrictive dress
 code. Late in the year President Banda underwent brain surgery. During this pe-
 riod, the MCP established a Presidential Council to rule in his place. The Council
 dissolved in early December when doctors pronounced Banda fit to resume presi-
 dential duties. As 1993 came to an end, President Banda's nominally parliamentary,
 single-party Government was in a caretaker status.
 Internal security is the responsibility of the National Police. An increasingly as-
 sertive populace, the growing independence of the judiciary, and an active opposition
 press, in addition to international pressure and the predisposition of some senior
 government officials, influenced the police force to curtail the worst of its abuses
 against the Banda Government's political opponents. The police, however, still em-
 ployed physical force in dealing with suspected criminals and, in some cases, de-
 prived them of their legal rights (see Section 1f.). There were no reports of police
 being tried and punished in the courts for such abuse, but credible reports indicated
 that prison officials were disciplined, and in some instances fired, for such behavior.
 During the referendum campaign, the MCP's Youth League and the paramilitary
 Malawi Young Pioneers (MYP) intimidated and harassed multiparty advocates. In-
 timidation by the Youth League and the MYP diminished sharply after the referen-
 dum and disappeared entirely in December when the army moved to disarm the
 MYP. The initial stages of disarmament were violent; over 20 people were killed,
 and extensive property damage was done to MYP and MCP facilities. Four soldiers
 also were killed. The army quickly enlisted the cooperation of the police to address
 civilian aspects of the disarmament operation.
 Small, densely populated, and landlocked, Malawi has a predominantly agricul-
 tural economy. Near y 90 percent of the population derives its income from farming.
 The main cash crops are tobacco-Malawi s most important foreign exchange earn-
 er-tea, coffee, and sugar. In 1993 the economy was rocked by severe shortages of
 foreign exchange, high inflation, and scarcity of critical agricultural and industrial
 inputs. Shrinking real wages led to wildcat strikes throughout the country, which
 exacerbated declines in productivity.
 The gradual improvement in Malawi's dismal human rights record evident in
 1992 accelerated in the first half of 1993 as campaigning commenced for the referen-
 dum. "Pressure groups" (i.e., parties in waiting) began to hold public rallies, attract-
 ing crowds often in excess of 20,000 in spite of instances of MYP intimidation of
 multiparty supporters, police manipulation of rally permits, and arbitrary detention
 of opposition activists. Returning exiles were in several instances detained on arriv-
 al. In some cases, opposition leaders successfully took the Government, the MCP,
 and the MYP to court for such abuses. Over a dozen political prisoners were re-
 leased in 1993, including Chakufwa Chihana, Vera Chirwa, Gwanda Chakuamba
 Phiri, Fred Kazombo Mwale and three arrested in 1965 in connection with an armed
 rebellion led by former cabinet minister Chipembere.
 Limitations on the activities of Asians remained in effect.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no political killings in
 Malawi in 1993. Although both during and after the referendum campaign vague
 rumors circulated of suspicious deaths at the hands of the police and the MYP, they
 were difficult to substantiate, despite the efforts of international observers monitor-
 ing politics and human rights in Malawi. In February Flora Kapito, an employee
 of the Electricity Supply Commission who had been arrested in May 1992 for pos-
 session of multiparty literature, died of injuries sustained while she was in prisn.
 Opposition calls to investigate the case o three Government ministers and a par-
 liamentarian who died suspiciously in 1983, officially in an auto accident, yielded
 no response from the Government.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported cases of disappearance for political
 reasons in 1993.
 
 
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Credible reports indicated that police continued to beat prisoners during initial de-
 tention and interrogation at police stations. The police also continued to deny mon-
 itoring groups access to these facilities, thus calling into question the Government's
 willingness to hold police accountable for such abuses.
 There were no specific reports of women targeted for abuse by the police or other
 Government entities in 1993. Conditions in prisons improved, partly as a result of
 inspections and recommendations by the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC), but the Government acknowledged there was room for more improvement.
 The prisons are seriously overcrowded, nutrition is inadequate, and sanitation poor.
 The substandard conditions can be attributed largely to a lack of funding. To im-
 prove the penal system, authorities have demoted or fired abusive wardens. In No-
 vember Parliament separated the prison service from police oversight and authority.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In November Parliament passed amend-
 ments to the Preservation of Public Security Act (PPSA), repealing those portions
 which authorized detention without trial. The courts had already been ordering the
 release of those detained without charge or trial. By year's end, it was too early to
 determine how effective the Government would be in ensuring that police no longer
 arrested people without bringing charges against them or referring their cases to
 the courts.
 The early stages of the referendum campaign were marred by the arbitrary arrest
 and detention of political opponents of the MCP. United Democratic Front Chairman
 Bakili Muluzi was arrested in February on charges that he had embezzled MCP
 funds when he was the MCP's Administrative Secretary and then Secretary General
 from 1977 to 1981. He was released on bail on February 18. The court dismissed
 the case against Muluzi for lack of evidence on April 1, but police rearrested him
 the same evening indicating that they would file new charges for the same offense.
 He was released the next day. Reverend Peter Kaleso was arrested and briefly de-
 tained early in the year for purportedly insulting the Life President while speaking
 at a public rally. A magistrate judge later acquitted Kaleso. In January Felix
 Mponda Phiri, editor of the New Express, was detained on returning to Malawi with
 the first edition of the paper, held for 17 days, and released without being charged.
 The number of new cases of arbitrary arrest and detention of the Government's
 political opponents decreased gradually during the referendum campaign and all but
 ceased thereafter. However, arbitrary arrests and detentions of a less vocal group,
 suspected criminals, did not decrease perceptibly.
 Long-term prisoner Vera Chirwa was released in January. Her husband Orton
 died in prison in 1992. Both were serving life sentences on charges, widely consid-
 ered spurious, of plotting to overthrow the Government and assassinate the Life
 President. Chakufwa Chiiana, arrested in April 1992 and sentenced in December
 of the same year on sedition charges, was released on June 12, 1993. The Supreme
 Court of Appeals reduced his original concurrent sentences of 18 and 24 months to
 9 months in March 1993, and he received the standard 3 months off for good behav-
 ior. In October, to mark President Banda's return from surgery in South Africa, the
 Government declared amnesty for 229 prisoners. These included people who were
 convicted of political crimes, had served long sentences, were ill, or had dem-
 onstrated good behavior. The remaining prisoners considered that the process of de-
 termining eligibility for amnesty was a random one and staged a riot, during which
 two prisoners died.
 Although the Banda Government never practiced forced exile as a means of politi-
 cal control, a sizable number of Malawians left the country over the years for politi-
 cal reasons. When these voluntary exiles started to return to Malawi to participate
 in activities prior to the referendum, police detained most and held them witn~out
 charge for periods ranging from 24 hours to several months,
 In a few cases, police continued to hold detainees despite court release orders.
 Fred Kazombo Mwale, the President's nephew, and two of his wives had been held
 without charge on a presidential detention order since 1991. A High Court justice
 ordered their release in early 1993, but police and prison officials did not comply
 with this order. Mwale and his wives were finally released in July as national and
 international attention on their case intensified.
 Edward Jika, of the Zambia-based United Front for Multiparty Democracy, was
 detained in early 1993 when he entered Malawi. A High Court justice ordered police
 and prison officials to present him in court, which they failed to do. As a result,
 the justice ordered his release. Police and prison officials ignored this order also
 until shortly after the referendum, when they released him.
 Foflowing the referendum, President Banda declared a general amnesty for all ex-
 iles. Most remaining political detainees were released, and exiles began to return
 to Malawi without incident. In November Parliament created a returnees' committee
 
 
 167
 to assist the exiles in rejoining the community. The committee estimated that ap-
 proximately 500 Malawians returned by year's end.
 Incommunicado detention continues, but to a lesser degree. Police continued spo-
 radically to restrict access to prisoners. Chakufwa Chihana's wife and his lawyer
 were at times denied the right to visit him. The lawyer of returning exile Edward
 Jika was denied access to his client. In July the High Court, citing the U.N. Univer-
 sal Declaration of Human Rights, ruled that there was no legal basis for restricting
 the access of lawyers to their imprisoned clients. Subsequently, defense lawyers
 could gain access to clients.
 Pretrial detainees made up a high proportion of the prison population. Poor record
 keeping and the reluctance of the police force to account for its activities precluded
 an accurate estimate of numbers of pretrial detainees. According to sources in the
 legal community, however, there are probably several hundred. The Government
 has acknowledged the problem and attempted to address it by setting aside specific
 time for court personnel to review and process pretrial cases.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Malawi has both traditional and modern court
 systems. In the past, only the regional and national traditional courts tried capital
 offenses. The Attorney General, however, announced the suspension of these courts
 in October, citing the NCC's intention to review the appropriate role of the tradi-
 tional court system. The trend toward moving serious criminal and political cases
 from traditional to modern courts continued in 1993. In most cases, only the modern
 courts permit legal counsel. The right of appeal exists in both systems. By law, de-
 fendants and their attorneys are guaranteed access to government-held evidence. In
 practice, they often do not see the evidence against them until they are in court.
 The modern court system consists of magistrate courts and the High Court, whose
 members sit on a Supreme Court of Appeal when the need arises. The President
 appoints the Chief Justice and, after consultation with the Judicial Service Commis-
 sion, other court justices. According to constitutional amendments passed in Novem-
 ber, the President must have parliamentary approval before removing a judge for
 incompetence or misbehavior.
 Traditional court justices, including justices of the National Traditional A ppeal
 Court, are appointed directly by the President. A typical traditional court panelcon-
 sists of three traditional authorities and a magistrate judge. Police officials handle
 the prosecution, and defendants conduct their own defense. In April a traditional
 court sentenced Dedza District MCP Chairman MIombwa Phiri to death for shooting
 a district police commissioner, whom he was alleged to have suspected of multiparty
 leanings. Amnesty International protested the sentence, noting that traditional
 court proceedings lacked the fundamental features of a fair public trial, such as the
 defendant's right to counsel. The case was under appeal at the end of the year.
 Through seminars, workshops, and training, some improvements have taken place
 in the functioning of the traditional court system. At year's end, with the suspension
 of the regional and national traditional courts and a review of the entire system
 under way, many in the legal community, including high court justices, were pre-
 dicting that the future of traditional courts was at the local level, where they would
 continue to hear cases involving small claims and customary law.
 In 1993 the modern courts became increasingly bold in their decisions against the
 Government and the MCP. In one case, the court awarded, and the Government
 paid, Machipisa Munthali the equivalent of over $1 million for wrongful imprison-
 ment. After completing a 6-year sentence in 1974, Munthali was immediately
 redetained without charge, trial, or explanation for an additional 18 years. Another
 long-term detainee-turned-opposition politician, Aleke Banda, successfully sued the
 MCP for defamation of character based on remarks against him which an MCP offi-
 cial made at a referendum campaign rally. The court awarded $75,000 in damages,
 which Banda collected with difficulty from the MCP. In the appeal of Chakufwa
 Chihana's sedition case, the Supreme Court granted both the defense and the pros-
 ecution the right to employ British queen's counsels to make their arguments. The
 Supreme Court stopped short of acquitting Chihana, instead reducing his sentence
 to 9 months.
 The Government has not removed any judicial officials in response to the judi-
 ciary's newfound independence.
 No known political prisoners remained at the end of 1993.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Over-
 sight of the police was a significant weak link in the political transition process. Po-
 litical liberalization has inlibited, but not completely ended, the practice of the po-
 lice entering houses at will, under special entry authority, to conduct searches for
 suspects or incriminating evidence. During the MYP disarmament operation in De-
 cember, the army and police, with Government approval, entered many private
 homes in search of hidden MYP members and weapons.
 
 
 The forced purchase of MCP membership cards stopped. There were occasional
 threats of forced population resettlement during the referendum campaign, pri-
 marily to inhibit opposition activity in MCP strongholds. The MCP did not carry out
 these threats, however, and after the referendum, generally shifted from negative
 to positive incentives to generate political support.
 Parliament repealed the Decency in Dress Act in November. The Act had banned
 slacks or skirts above the knees for women, and long hair and bell-bottom slacks
 for men.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of the Press.-In the past, two government/MCP-controlled newspapers
 and one government radio station spread the Government and party line on all sub-
 jects. An opposition editor and a UDF official were briefly detained on press-related
 charges in early 1993. In March the Government temporarily banned two opposition
 newspapers, the UDF News and Alliance for Democracy's (AFORD's) Malawi Demo-
 crat. The High Court later lifted both bans.
 The unfettered, aggressive media were an explosive new force. By the end of 1993,
 more than 20 independent newspapers were in circulation. In September the Ma-
 lawi Broadcasting Corporation, based on a broadcasting code of conduct worked out
 between the Government and the opposition, canceled long-running, regularly
 sc heduled pro-Banda/MCP programs. Independent journalists practiced less self-cen-
 sorship. The independent press criticized the Government vigorously, and after the
 disarmament of the MYP in December, even MBC reporters and producers began
 broadcasting news items and press statements critical of the Government.
 In November Parliament changed the sedition laws to include "intent to incite vio-
 lence" as a necessary component of sedition. Parliament did not, however, repeal the
 law prohibiting journalists from publishing or communicating outside of Malawi any
 information which might tarnish the country's reputation. The chief public prosecu-
 tor must authorize any prosecution brought under this law.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-A November 1993 amendment
 to the Constitution provides that "no person shall be hindered in the enjoyment of
 his freedom of assembly and association," as long as he does not infringe upon the
 rights of others, endanger public order or public morality, impose restrictions on
 public officers, or act in a manner not "reasonably justifiable in a democratic soci-
 ety."
 During the referendum campaign, police and other government officials grudg-
 ingly granted freedom of assembly. While oppsition groups frequently faced prob-
 lems in obtaining permits for rallies, large political meetings were held although po-
 litical parties other than MCP were still illegal. The Government tolerated the so-
 called pressure groups as forums for free political association but often harassed
 their members.
 Following the referendum, Parliament legalized political parties. Police then
 granted rally permits readily, although there were occasional reports of MCP offi-
 cials encouraging local officials to change the venue of an opposition rally at the last
 minute so that the MCP might use the original location for its own rally. During
 the labor strikes that occurred around the country in September, police did not ar-
 rest strikers for failing to obtain permits. As in the past, individuals and organiza-
 tions associated freely in nonpolitical activities.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Malawi does not have a state religion. Religious groups
 may establish places of worship and train clergy but must register with the Govern-
 ment. An informal presidential decree that no new religious groups should be reg-
 istered served to prevent legitimate religious groups from establishing a presence
 in Malawi. In general, however, restrictions on all religious practices eased. In Sep-
 tember the Government revoked its ban on Jehovah's Witnesses and certain other
 religious groups which refused to join political parties or accept a ruling government
 as sovereign.
 Religious groups are free to establish and maintain links with their churches in
 other countries, and the Government dees not restrict members from traveling
 abroad for religious purposes. Malawi's sizable Muslim minority (estimated at 20
 percent of the population) conducts its religion and builds mosques freely. Foreign
 Islamic organizations have funded the latter with no governmental interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Freedom of movement both within and outside the country improved in
 1993. President Banda declared a general amnesty for all exiles in June, and many
 returned. Denial of passports on political grounds was no longer common. le-gal pro-
 visions restricting the movement of those convicted of political or criminal offenses
 continued in force. Employees still had to request permission from their employers
 to travel abroad, but such clearance appeared to be routinely granted. In a few
 
 
 cases, police delayed the travel of political opposition leaders at checkpoints between
 regional boundaries, but it was not clear whether such actions were taken on indi-
 vidual initiative or at government direction. Formal emigration was neither re-
 stricted nor encouraged. Malawi does not apply any particular restrictions of the
 movement of women or most minorities (including expatriates) except for Asian resi-
 dents and citizens, who while free to travel within the country, must nominally re-
 side within four urban areas (Lilongwe, Zomba, Mzuzu, and Blantyre/Limbe). In
 Lilongwe, a planned capital, they must live in designated neighborhoods. Asians are
 also banned from running any business outside the urban areas, although the politi-
 cal parties, through the NCC, tentatively discussed the possibility of lifting this pro-
 hibition.
 Malawi continued to host Mozambican refugees, the largest refugee population in
 Africa. The Mozambique Peace Accord, signed on October 4, 1992, brought an end
 to open hostilities in that country, but fears among refugees were slow to subside.
 Because of the devastation wrought by more than 16 years of war and southern Af-
 rica's worst drought in a century, refugees did not return to many areas of Mozam-
 bique. While the Government of Malawi encouraged their return, it made no at-
 tempt to force the refugees to depart before they were ready and able to do so. The
 Government and international organizations estimated that more than 300,000
 Mozambican refugees left Malawi for their homes, with 700,000 remaining.
 While this large number of refugees strained Malawi's roads, health care facilities,
 and land, fuel, water, and food resources, the Government continued to cooperate
 with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other relief
 organizations to sustain the Mozambican refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Freedom to change their government peacefully was the cornerstone on which
 Malawians began to build a new political system. At the beginning of 1993, politics
 was dominated by the President for Life and his Malawi Congress Party, the only
 legal party. Parliament rubber stamped the President's decisions, and candidates in
 all elections were preapproved by the President. After the national referendum, the
 opposition and the ruling party negotiated a transitional arrangement which gave
 the former a formal role in monitoring the existing Government and in crafting and
 introducing legislative reforms. In June Parliament repealed the section of the Con-
 stitution which prohibited parties other than the MCP, and granted Malawi's politi-
 cal exiles general amnesty. The principal mechanisms of the transition are the NCC
 and NEC, which include equal numbers of representatives from each registered po-
 litical party. The NCC is a deliberative body in which the parties are working out
 the constitutional, legal, and electoral shape of the new system. The NEC plays a
 monitoring role, tracking the progress the Government and Parliament make in im-
 plementing the decisions of the NCC.
 Malawi's first multiparty elections for a president and parliament are to be held
 on May 17, 1994. As in past single-party elections and the referendum, suffrage is
 to be universal among adult citizens, without regard to gender or tribal (indigenous)
 origins. In November Parliament passed laws related to the elections scheduled for
 May, including the lowering of the voting age to 18 years.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In the past, the Government did not allow either domestic or international organi-
 zations to investigate alleged human rights abuses. This situation began to change
 in 1992 when the Government invited the ICRC to inspect Malawi's prisons. A two-
 erson delegation from Amnesty International visited Malawi for 2 weeks in Novem-
 er and met with government officials, the police, opposition leaders, and others. A
 few domestic human rights groups formed in 1993, but at year's end had not devel-
 oped methods for monitoring the country's human rights situation.
 The Government continued to refuse to investigate, despite opposition calls for a
 commission of inquiry, the 1983 deaths of three government ministers and a par-
 liamentarian. At the time of the deaths, the Government claimed the four had died
 accidentally in an automobile wreck. For years, however, widespread rumors alleged
 that the accident had been staged and that the men had been shot for political rea-
 sons on the orders of senior government officials. In the fall of 1993, several inde-
 pendent newspapers conducted and reported investigations which they claimed pro-
 duced evidence implicating the Government in these deaths.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women and men above the age of 20 have equal legal status and are
 supposed to receive equal pay for equal work. In practice, however, women do not
 have opportunities equal to those of men. Historically, women have been unable to
 complete even aprimary education and are therefore at a serious disadvantage in
 the job market. Women constitute 70 percent of all full-time farmers. Thirty percent
 of these women are heads of household. The Government included in its 1993 devel-
 opment policy a specific plan of action for women. The plan proposes that each min-
 istry designate an officer to deal with issues concerning women and women's affairs.
 Most ministries have done so and are trying to allocate funds to support women's
 programs in their respective ministries. The Government reserves 33 percent of the
 places in secondary school for girls. In 1993, for the first time, all of these spaces
 were filled. However, women may not attend school at any level if they become preg-
 nant. University women may return to their studies 6 months after the birth of a
 child. The Government cooperated closely with international donors seeking to en-
 hance educational opportunities for females, especially at the primary school level.
 Both the Government and nongovernmental organizations have sponsored pro-
 grams to support better general education for women and girls. The National Com-
 mission on Women disseminates information on women's rights. Women across the
 country began to form groups advocating empowerment of women in various fields.
 The "Women's Voice" group, for example, encourages women to participate in the
 political process.
 Malawi society does not practice systematic violence against women. However,
 spousal abuse is common, althou  it is not discussed openly by women. Occasion-
 ally the press reports instances of sexual abuse and harassment of female students
 by their male teachers. There are no apparent efforts by the Ministry of Education
 to address this problem.
 Children.-The Government does not spend a high percentage of its budget on
 children's health and welfare. Despite women's access to maternal health services
 and extension programs, infant mortality remains the 10th highest in the world.
 Very few orphanages exist, and the Government is only beginning to address the
 necessity of intervening on behalf of children as the AIDS epidemic destroys tradi-
 tional extended family and village care. There is no pattern of societal abuse against
 children, though a few small ethnic groups continue to practice female genital muti-
 lation.
 National /Racial/Ethnic/Minorities.-Citizens of the northern region occasionally
 experience discrimination in employment outside that region. Most Malawians of Af-
 rican heritage are members of indigenous tribes, which are not discriminated
 against by the Government or society. By law, Asians may not own businesses in
 agriculture or transport and strict rules govern where they may own property.
 People with Disabilities.-The Government has not mandated accessibility to pub-
 lic buildings for the disabled, but it does help and support them. Self-supporting
 businesses, run by and for the disabled, operate successfully in Malawi. Special
 schools and training centers target individuals with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Because most Malawian households derive their in-
 come from the agricultural sector, either directly from what they produce or through
 seasonal, informal employment on estates, government figures indicate that only
 473,000 persons-approximately 14 percent of the work force-earn formal wages.
 Approximately 10 percent of this group-fewer than 50,000 employees-are orga-
 nized in trade unions. Most organized workers are unskilled laborers on large agri-
 cultural estates.
 Restrictive colonial labor legislation was subsumed largely intact into Malawian
 law. In response to continuing bouts of labor unrest, however, Ministry of Labor offi-
 cials announced in September plans to review and modify the legislation.
 Malawian workers have the legal right to form and join trade unions. For govern-
 ment workers, the right is limited to unions whose membership consists solely of
 government employees. By law and in practice, all unions have been required to af-
 filiate with the Trade Union Congress of Malawi (TUCM). The TUCM, ostensibly
 independent of the Government, was until late 1993 highly restricted in its activi-
 ties. In response to a prolonged eeriod of sporadic strikes, late in the year a group
 of new TUCM leaders formed a caretaker committee" which they tasked with the
 revitalization of the TUCM. At the same time, the Ministry of Labor announced a
 policy of decentralized dialog, negotiation, and collective bargaining in labor matters
 which, inter alia, emphasized the right of workers and employers to organize freely
 
 
 171
 into trade unions and employers' associations, respectively. At year's end the effec-
 tiveness of these actions was uncertain.
 In 1993, Malawi experienced unprecedented labor unrest. Starting in May, spo-
 radic work stoppages at individua companies occurred in Blantyre, the country's
 main commercial city. In August, September, and October, wildcat strikes-includ-
 ing a nationwide civil service strike-spread throughout the country. The unrest
 was generally nonviolent, two exceptions being the fatal shooting of a striker at a
 sugar plantation and the destruction of a tobacco estate's medical clinic. Govern-
 ment intervention was limited, and negotiated resolutions of workers' demands was
 the norm.
 Malawi's official unions played no significant role in either leading or resolving
 the labor unrest in 1993. In contrast, Joint Consultative Committees (JCC)-worker/
 management councils established within the last 2 years in numerous private enter-
 prises and state-owned firms-provided forums for negotiations and were often suc-
 cessful in defusing tensions. Ideally, the committees were to consist of elected rep-
 resentatives of workers and management. Often, however, worker representation
 was determined by employer appointment.
 The TUCM is a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU) although the ICFTU suspended the TUCM in December, and the Organi-
 zation o? African Trade Union Unity. It also belongs to the Southern African Trade
 Union Coordination Council (SATUCC). The Government closed SATUCC's Malawi
 office in 1992, following the arrest of its chairman, Chakufwa Chihana, on charges
 of sedition. In September 1993, SATUCC received the Government's approval to re-
 open its Malawi office and it plans to return in early 1994.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected by law, but its use is limited by stark labor market realities. Unskilled labor-
 ers outnumber available positions by a ratio of eight to one. By contrast, skilled
 workers, because of their scarcity, enjoy a relatively high demand for their services
 and, therefore, higher salaries. The latter have had some success when negotiating
 employment terms, either on an individual basis or, as was the case with the rail
 road union, collectively.
 Antiunion discrimination by employers is prohibited by statute, but enforcement
 of the provisions through civil suits does not occur. Most individual labor disputes,
 usualy in the form of a worker claiming unfair dismissal, are initially referred to
 the   inistry of Labor for resolution. The Ministry typically attempts to encourage
 a settlement between the parties and does not actually adjudicate the merits of the
 claim.
 Malawi has no export processing zones or free trade zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor was widely practiced
 during colonial times. Although never formally outlawed, it is not practiced except
 for prison labor. Sentences which include a component of "hard labor" are routinely
 handed down upon conviction for criminal offenses. Hard labor has, however, gen-
 erally meant light gardening or road maintenance and can be waived for medcal
 considerations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Malawian law defines persons
 under the a  of 2 to be children and prohibits their employment. Persons between
 ages 12 and14 are eligible to do "light work in a family business. Enforcement by
 labor inspectors is not effective.
 In the large agriculture sector, children help out at a young age both on family
 farms and on smaller estates, where laborers are given a quota to meet and entire
 families work towards reaching it. Children are rarely employed in industrial jobs,
 which are few in number and pay better than does agricultural work.
 There is no law mandating compulsory education of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Mal awi's legislated minimum wage varies by
 location. Workers in the cities of Blantyre, Lilongwe and Mzuzu receive a minimum
 of $0.70 (Malawian kwacha 3.00) per day; workers in municipalities and townships
 are entitled to a minimum wage of $0.63 (ink 2.70) per day; rural workers are enti-
 tled to a minimum wage of $0.56 (ik 2.40) per day. As most Malawians earn their
 livelihood outside the formal wage sector, they are not affected by the prescribed
 minimums.
 Wages are primarily derived from the Government's prescribed minimum wage
 scales and by comparison to civil service wages. Industrial employees received the
 highest wages, with moat private commercial firms intentionally setting their wages
 higher than those for similarly experienced government employees. Agricultural
 workers tend to receive only the Government's prescribed minimum wage, with
 some additional benefits such as access to basic medical treatment and farm sup-
 plies on credit. Minimal Ministry of Labor enforcement of the decreed wage rates,
 and agricultural labor practices in which harvesting quotas are sometimes met by
 
 
 entire families rather than by a single worker have reduced some actual agricul-
 tural wages below the mandated minimum.
 In 1993 high inflation rates and shortages in basic consumer goods made the min-
 imum wage insufficient for the provision of basic needs. In practice, even those
 workers who received a wage tended to supplement their incomes through farming
 activities carried out through the extended family network. Effective September 1,
 legal minimum wages were increased by approximately 13 percent. The estimated
 rate of inflation in 1993 was approximately 23 percent.
 The standard legal workweek in Malawi is 48 hours with 1 day of rest, usually
 Sunday. Workers obliged to work on Sundays and official holidays must be paid
 overtime.
 Occupational safety standards are set by law. Their enforcement by Ministry of
 Labor inspectors is erratic, and workers-particularly those in industrial jobs-often
 work without basic safety clothing and equipment.
