 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 The military has played a preeminent role in the Yemen Arab
 Republic (North Yemen) since it came into being in 1962. The
 current leader is Colonel Ali Abdullah Salih, President of the
 Republic, who assumed office in 1978 following the
 assassination of his two immediate predecessors, both of whom
 also came from the senior ranks of the military.
 Until the Revolution of 1962, North Yemen was a theocracy
 isolated from much of the outside world. The bloody civil war
 that followed the revolution did not end until 1978.
 Portrayed as the legitimate heir of the Revolution, the
 present Government has relied heavily on military and security
 forces to bolster its position in the unstable political
 environment. Civilians serving as cabinet ministers or
 members of the Constituent Assembly play key roles in advising
 the President. The Government has not been able, however, to
 extend its authority into many regions still isolated by the
 rugged mountainous terrain. Tribal traditions, poorly
 developed public institutions, and widespread poverty also
 impede efforts to form a more cohesive society.
 The state of human rights is greatly influenced by tribal and
 Islamic traditions. Most males bear arms and will use them to
 defend tne integrity of their person and family. The state
 has a limited capability to govern and does not have a monoply
 on the use of force.
 No currently serving government official has been elected to
 his office. However, nationwide elections to the People's
 General Congress (PGC) were held on a non partisan basis in
 1982. This Congress was assembled to discuss and then endorse
 the *National Charter' which outlines the personal and
 democratic freedoms the Yemeni people should enjoy. (The
 Charter was drafted by a small circle of government officials
 and circulated in the country for comment.) The Congress
 assembled again in August 1984 to endorse government policies.
 Human rights practices were strongly affected in recent years
 by the activities of the National Democratic Front (NDF), a
 foreign supported, Marxist oriented rural insurgency movement
 operating in the central and southern regions of the country.
 Fighting between government forces and the insurgents was at
 times heavy. Basic human rights of the population living in
 the affected areas were often violated in the wake of NDF
 terrorism and frequently repressive and indiscriminate
 anti-terrorist campaigns by government forces. The sharp
 reduction in NDF military activity since the summer of 1982
 has led the Government to reduce its repressive practices.
 Anti-terrorist campaigns by the Government have abated, and
 travel restrictions have been lifted.
 North Yemen is a poor country with an extremely limited
 industrial infrastructure. Petroleum deposits were discovered
 in 1984, but the quantity of reserves has not yet been
 determined. It has a free market economy in which freedom to
 hold private property and pursue private interests is
 virtually unlimited.
 Overall, there was little change in the state of human rights
 in 1984. Gradual extension of the Government's authority
 since the subduing of the NDF, however, has increased the
 impact of arbitrary and sometimes oppressive practices of

 national security officials, whose effective jurisdiction was
 previously confined to the major urban centers.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no indication that government forces have been guilty
 of political killings in 1984. The Government's success in
 fighting the insurgents has resulted in a dramatic reduction
 of reported terrorist attacks against the civilian population
 or government forces in the past two years. There have been
 unconfirmed reports of occasional executions of suspected
 members of the NDF by villagers living in the areas where the
 insurgency was once active. Sporadic tribal warfare, either
 between tribes or, occasionally, between tribes and the
 Government, has also claimed victims.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been credible reports that the national security
 organization occasionally resorts to secret arrest and
 clandestine detention. If the security forces suspect
 involvement in activity hostile to the Government, early
 release may be difficult to secure. However, family and
 friends are usually able to verify the whereabouts of the
 detainee within a few days. In rural areas, both the security
 forces and tribal militias occasionally take hostages to apply
 pressure on their adversaries.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The "National Charter* as well as several statutes proscribe
 the use of torture. There are a number of credible reports,
 however, that the police use force and intimidation to extract
 confessions from individuals suspected of both common and
 political crimes.
 The legal code is based on Islamic Shari'a Law which
 prescribes such forms of punishment as amputation and stoning.
 Official figures on the application of such punishments are
 lacking; according to press reports, these penalties were
 applied only rarely in 1984. The implementation of these
 penalties is often waived in favor of monetary payment to the
 aggrieved party.
 Some prisoners receive food, clothing, and medicine from their
 families to ameliorate the harsh conditions in most jails.
 Other prisoners must subsist on the limited diet and health
 care provided by the state. Those detained outside the major
 urban centers suffer more than others from the consequences of
 substandard care. Such procedures reflect the general poverty
 and poorly developed institutions as well as the attitude that
 the well being of prisoners is as much the responsibility of
 the family as of the state.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Constitutional provisions limit the time police may hold
 suspects without explicit judicial authorization and establish
 
 
 1425
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 procedures through which detainees may contact their families
 and lawyers. However, the legal safeguards have been ignored
 when special security forces have detained persons suspected
 of subversion.
 Prominent public figures whose opposition to government
 policies falls short of outright subversion are rarely
 detained. Instead, they are sometimes forced to withdraw from
 public life and stay at home where their activities are
 closely monitored by the authorities. Usually, such figures
 are not subject to formal house arrest, but are simply told
 not to work for a time.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are several types of courts, including traditional
 Shari'a (Islamic) courts, commercial courts, and special
 security courts. The Shari'a courts have jurisdiction in all
 cases that do not fall into the latter two categories,
 although there is overlapping jurisdiction in some commercial
 law cases. The Shari'a courts appear to be fair and impartial
 within the context of the Islamic tradition. The judge plays
 an active role in questioning the witnesses, seeking to
 establish guilt or innocence. Attorneys may counsel their
 clients, but do not address the court or examine witnesses.
 If the defendant is to be brought to trial, he is informed of
 the charges against him at the conclusion of the police
 investigation.
 There is some possibility of appeal to political authorities
 outside the traditional Shari'a system. Anyone who can will
 seek to bring the influence of prominent people or government
 officials to bear in a case; however, the ability to do this
 varies according to the status of the defendant involved. In
 the commercial court, litigants can also expect a fair and
 open trial with legal counsel. The Shari'a and commercial
 courts in Yemen remain largely independent of the executive,
 though all decisions are subject to review and confirmation by
 the President.
 Those formally charged with anti-regime activities are tried
 in special security courts convened at the direction of the
 President to handle specific cases. Rights normally afforded
 the accused may be suspended in security cases. All decisions
 made by the security court are subject to review and
 confirmation by the President. It is generally acknowledged
 that there are some political prisoners Rough estimates
 indicate several hundred may be held.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 National Security Forces operate under an open mandate to
 search homes, monitor telephone conversations, read personal
 correspondence, or otherwise intrude into private lives when
 they believe that the security of the state is jeopardized.
 The substantial amount of weaponry held by private citizens
 and the isolation of many villages from major urban centers
 militate against wanton invasion of privacy by the police in
 many rural areas.
 
 
 1426
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 A number of limits on free speech exist but their effect is
 limited to the urban, literate population by the Government's
 incomplete control over the country. The Information Ministry
 oversees the management of radio, television, and all
 newspapers and periodicals enjoying wide circulation. The
 limited number of privately owned publications occasionally
 criticize malfeasance by public officials or address economic
 issues, but generally avoid expressing opinions at variance
 with those of the Government. The Government has on several
 occasions removed articles before they could be published. It
 has also suspended publishing rights for extended periods to
 punish attempts at printing objectionable material. Editors
 of independent newspapers have been tried for libel against
 public officials. Foreign magazines and newspapers are sold
 in the major cities, but are subject to periodic censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no legal political parties. Political
 demonstrations, although not illegal, are rare and did not
 occur in 1984. The Government occasionally organizes rallies
 in support of its policies.
 Labor unions and professional organizations play a very
 limited role in this predominantly rural and preindustrial
 society. Legislation outlaws strikes and prohibits
 independent labor unions.
 Association of citizens with foreigners is closely monitored.
 The names of those visiting embassies or attending social
 functions hosted by foreigners are routinely monitored, and
 access is sometimes denied. Security officials have on
 occasion detained citizens for investigations of their
 possible links with foreigners.
 There are organizations which provide alternative channels for
 political expression for Yemenis living outside the few urban
 centers. Large segments of the population in local
 communities play a role in selecting the leadership of so
 called 'Local Development Associations' and influence their
 policies. These organizations use a mixture of local and
 national funding for economic and social infrastructure
 development. In any areas where the effective presence of the
 central Government is minimal, tribal leaders make key
 decisions in consultation with other prominent members of
 their community. Gradually, however, the authority of the
 National Security Organization has slowly penetrated
 previously autonomous local communities.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the state religion and that of the vast majority of
 Yemenis. Members of the Zaydi (Shi'a) sect have historically
 enjoyed greater political influence than those of the Shafei
 (Sunni) sect, but these distinctions have often been as much
 oased on geographic and tribal considerations as on purely
 religious grounds. For the most part, the two major Islamic
 communities coexist without friction and seek to minimize the
 significance of doctrinal differences. Muslim associations
 with ties to pan-Islamic or foreign organizations enjoy some
 
 
 1427
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 degree of freedom, including the right to operate schools
 largely independent of the national education system.
 Although almost all of the once substantial Jewish population
 has emigrated to Israel, the small number of remaining Jews
 lives in peace with the Muslim majority. They practice their
 religion freely, suffer no unusual economic hardships, and
 maintain some very limited contact with Jews from outside
 Yemen. Communications between Jews and their coreligionists
 and relatives in Israel are proscribed. There is no
 indigenous Christian population. Foreign resident Christians
 are allowed to conduct private services, though they have no
 churches. Foreign clergy are not permitted into the country
 if their purpose is to preach religion; however, there is at
 least one Catholic priest working in social services. Public
 celebration of nonIslamic religious holidays is discouraged.
 Proselytizing is forbidden by law. Christian missionaries
 have operated hospitals for many years, but have experienced
 harassment from local authorities and the press for alleged
 missionary activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Throughout history many Yemenis have sought temporary or
 permanent employment abroad. The Government has not
 restricted this emigration in view of the importance
 remittances from abroad play in the national economy.
 Procedures for obtaining passports and compulsory exit permits
 are sometimes onerous, however, particularly for males who
 have not fulfilled their military service requirements.
 Political dissidents have frequently chosen self imposed
 foreign exile or have accepted official appointments abroad
 rather than face possible difficulties at home stemming from
 their political views. There are no restrictions on internal
 travel despite the presence of numerous security checkpoints
 on all major roads.
 Several refugee groups have sought asylum in North Yemen.
 Approximately 2,700 armed members of the Palestine Liberation
 Organization sought refuge in the fall of 1982-1983, following
 their evacuation from Lebanon. Many moved on to other
 destinations in 1984. Perhaps as many as 250,000 South
 Yemenis have integrated themselves into North Yemen's economic
 life and society to escape political persecution. Refugee
 groups from the Horn of Africa have frequently sought
 residence in North Yemen, though often for economic rather
 than political reasons. The authorities have taken measures
 to restrict the flow of these national groups. For example,
 Somalis and Ethiopians without claim to Yemeni citizenship or
 clear demonstration of being political refugees find it
 difficult to obtain work permits and visa extensions.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The President makes key political decisions in the areas
 controlled by the Government. There is no mechanism for the
 people to choose or elect an alternative chief executive
 through free elections.
 The People's Constituent Assembly reviews and ratifies
 legislation proposed by the President and the cabinet
 ministers he appoints. The Assembly has never disapproved the
 
 
 1428
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 President's policies. Members of this body were appointed by
 presidential decree in 1978. Once scheduled for 1983,
 parliamentary elections have not taken place and their timing
 is now uncertain.
 Since its estaolishment by the Government in 1982, the
 People's General Congress (PGC) has functioned as a single
 mechanism for popular political expression. Seventy percent
 of the delegates to the 1,000 member Congress were selected in
 competitive elections. The delegates represent most segments
 of society; women, wno have the right to vote, hold a few
 seats. Standing committees of the Congress meet at both the
 national and regional levels to give the 'National Charter' a
 wide public audience, the principal task assigned to the
 Congress. The People's General Congress held its second
 national convention in August.
 There are no legal opposition parties. Debate at times has
 reportedly been vigorous in the PGC, but the President and his
 advisors control the agenda. No attempt has been made to
 expand the scope of popular political discussions beyond the
 efforts made by members of the PGC to popularize the principles
 of the National Charter.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 As far as is known, no major international or non-government
 organization has asked to conduct a survey in North Yemen.
 Amnesty International did not include North Yemen in its 1984
 report. Freedom House rates it 'not free.' There are no
 active human rights organizations in North Yemen.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 North Yemen is among the poorest countries in the world.
 Standards of health and education are particularly low. Life
 expectancy at birth is estimated at 44 years and the rate of
 infant mortality is 149 per 1,000 live births. The latest
 statistics for access to safe drinking water (1976) were
 2 percent in rural area and 30 percent in urban areas.
 The per capita gross national product, estimated at $497 in
 1982, is indicative of widespread poverty but this statistic
 provides a possibly misleading description of the society
 since as many as 1.5 million North Yemenis work abroad,
 principally in the wealthier countries of the Arabian
 Peninsula. The hard currency remittances of these workers and
 tne numoer of consumer goods they bring back are key elements
 sustaining the national economy. Little of this wealth is
 available for investment in national development projects,
 however, as the Government has been unable to divert any
 significant proportion of it from private hands. Thus, many
 families enjoy relatively comfortable financial status at the
 same time the country as a whole lacks funds to finance
 development of basic infrastructure.
 Ambitious plans were drafted to reconstruct villages
 devastated by a major earthquake in December 1982, but only
 preliminary construction activity had been started by the end
 of 1984.
 The World Bank put adult literacy at 8.6 percent in 1980.
 
 
 1429
 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 Educational opportunities have been expanded, but by 1980 the
 primary schuol enrollment ratio was only 38 percent of primary
 school age children. Boys attend school in far greater number
 than do girls.
 Living in a conservative Islamic society which remained
 largely isolated from the modern world prior to 1962, few
 Yemeni women are employed outside the home or play an active
 role in public life. Education for women in significant
 numbers began only at the end of the Civil War in 1970. The
 Government has done nothing to restrict women's access to
 employment, however, and has promoted expansion of educational
 opportunities for girls and women. Women are now present in
 the middle levels of several ministries, such as the central
 planning organization, and one woman is in the constituent
 assembly. Prevailing social norms frequently dictate,
 however, that women defer to the guidance of their male
 colleagues and accept close supervision of their activities by
 male relatives. Women seeking exit permits for travel outside
 the country are frequently asked to provide evidence that male
 relatives have no objection.
 Economic wealth is distributed on a relatively equal basis.
 Although often poor, many farmers own their land. Most
 citizens encounter no institutional barriers against pursuing
 their primary economic interests in the free market economy.
 Yemenis from nonArab ethnic groups or children of ethnically
 mixed marriages frequently encounter discriminatory treatment
 from public officials and are less successful in finding good
 jobs than other citizens. For example, the former slaves of
 African origin (*Akhdam') are often relegated to menial jobs
 such as street sweeping and trash collecting.   However, this
 has not resulted in social unrest, given the many chances for
 migration available to Yemenis seeking more lucrative
 employment elsewhere.
