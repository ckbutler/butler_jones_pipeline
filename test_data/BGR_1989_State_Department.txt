 BULGARIA
 After 35 years as leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party
 (BCP), Todor Zhivkov, who was also Chief of State, was ousted
 on November 10 by a group of Politburo colleagues headed by
 Foreign Minister Petur Mladenov. Under the new leadership of
 Mladenov, the BCP renounced its leading role in the State
 guaranteed by the Constitution and opened the door to
 political pluralism and democratic elections. The Government,
 with Prime Minister Georgi Atanasov still in charge, agreed to
 hold talks with the opposition on the country's future.
 While the Ministry of the Interior maintained strict domestic
 control through the militia, state security officers, internal
 security troops, border guards, special purpose forces, and
 informants, one of the new leadership's first acts was to
 disband the Ministry's department which monitored the
 political activities of citizens. It is not yet clear,
 however, whether its functions have actually been abolished or
 merely transferred to other institutions.
 Mladenov and his colleagues have espoused economic
 restructuring and have pledged that the country will adopt a
 free market economy. At year's end, however, they continued
 to rely on a centrally planned economy in which almost all
 production and commercial facilities are state owned. State
 controls continue to hamper the limited sector of small-scale
 private agricultural plots and small businesses.
 Under Zhivkov's rule, the human rights situation continued to
 be characterized by harsh repression. The exercise of such
 basic human rights as freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and
 religion in a manner the Communist Party deemed unacceptable
 was prohibited and punished. The authorities pursued their
 forcible assimilation campaign directed at the ethnic Turkish
 minority (about 10 percent of the population), which began in
 1984. Hunger strikes and demonstrations by ethnic Turks in
 dozens of communities in May and again by Pomaks (Bulgarian
 Muslims) in September led to clashes with security forces and
 resulted in a number of deaths. The regime used a new
 passport law adopted in May 1989 to expel several thousands of
 ethnic Turkish activists. Other ethnic Turks began to stream
 across the border in an exodus which reached 310,000 by
 mid-August, when the Turkish Government reinstituted a strict
 visa regime. Meanwhile, Bulgarian dissidents and Pomaks were
 usually denied the right to travel.
 After November 10, the new leadership took tentative steps to
 redress many human rights abuses. Bulgarians began to enjoy
 the freedoms of speech, assembly, and association. Many
 dissidents received passports and permission to travel
 abroad. In a major decision, the Government on December 29
 condemned the forced assimilation policy and pledged to take
 measures to guarantee the freedom of citizens to follow their
 religious and traditional customs and to reassume their Muslim
 names, forcibly changed at the beginning of the assimilation
 campaign. If implemented fully, this decision should
 effectively end the assimilation policies directed against
 ethnic Turks and Pomaks.
 In addition, the National Assembly amended the penal code,
 deleting many political offenses and amnestying those
 convicted of those offenses. It also promised liberal laws on
 assembly and association. The media, although still
 controlled by the Government, began to report objectively on
 opposition views.

 BDLGARIA
 The following report primarily describes the human rights
 situation as it existed before the ouster of Zhivkov on
 November 16. Some of the institutions and practices that led
 to widespread human rights abuses apparently were being
 changed at year's end, and the next annual report is likely to
 include a significantly different assessment of human rights
 practices.
 RESPECT FOR HUMSAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings, but a
 number of peaceful demonstrators were killed by internal
 security troops in May and September (see Section l.g.).
 There were reports of prison deaths caused by torture and
 beatings.
 b.- Disappearance
 Despite reports that many people were missing for periods of a
 month ormore following May and July demonstrations by ethnic
 Turks and Pomaks,,there were no known permanent disappearances
 at the hands of security forces.
 c. 'Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although torture does not appear to be practiced
 systematically in-Bulgaria, many ethnic Turks who fled to
 Turkey recounted tales of beatings and torture during the May
 1989 demonstrations. Most people reported beatings by members
 of the police and security forces who used their fists and
 chairs and kicked people, causing broken ribs and other
 injuries. Beatings with a wooden truncheon covered with
 rubber were reportedly frequent both in Razvigor, a pretrial
 detention center in Sofia run by the state security service,
 and-regular prisons. Prisoners were thereafter immersed in a
 trough of cold-water to minimize marks from the beatings.
 Some persons recounted-tales of-drugs in their food,
 psychological torture, electric shocks, cigarette burns, and
 attacks by dogs. Some state they were beaten repeatedly; a
 few reportedly died from their beatings.
 Since 1977, prisons have been under the jurisdiction of the
 Ministry of Internal Affairs. Conditions are Spartan. During
 Zhivkov's regime, political prisoners in many cases were
 quartered with common criminals, at whose hands they suffered
 abuse.. Other reports indicated that guards routinely beat
 prisoners or arbitrarily punished them with solitary
 confinement.- NikoIa Chamurliski, who was sentenced to 20
 years in 1974 for "economic espionage," reportedly refused to
 work and thus suffered regular beatings and received little
 food;..he is said to be extremely ill in Pleven prison. One
 ethnic-Turk recounted spending 3 months at Belene prison in
 1984 in cells with no heat at temperatures of -30f degrees C.
 Prisoners were allowed little daily exercise; family visits
 were infrequent and depended on the "strictness" of the prison
 regime.to which the prisoner had been sentenced. In Razvigor
 detention center, cells are reportedly 2.5 by 1.5 meters,
 without any windows. Lights are kept burning continuously.
 People are held individually and are not permitted to speak to
 
 
 1046
 of even see-other detainees. Toilet facilities consist of a
 bucket in the corner; bathing is permitted-once a week, and
 detainees are shaved by a guard twice a week.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although Bulgarian law provides for a judicial determination
 of the legality of a person's detention, the judiciary under
 Zhivkov was not independent of executive power and was unable
 to provide any effective check on executive actions. Persons
 were detained arbitrarily, without public notice, although the
 public prosecutor had to be informed within 24 hours of such
 detention. Human rights activists Dr. Konstantin Trenchev,
 Anton Zapryanov, Todor Gagalov, Nikolai Kolev, Khristofor
 Subev, and Anton Nikolov were detained in May; their friends
 and families learned of their whereabouts only after several
 days, when they inquired of the authorities. Newly appointed
 leader Mladenov promised a "rule of law" but at year's end
 extensive reform of the legal system had not yet been
 announced.
 Preliminary detention is limited theoretically to 10 days.
 Under Zhivkov's rule, the preliminary investigation could take
 2 months, during which time detainees could be held in custody
 if "major state interests impose it." Bulgarian law permits
 detention for up to 6 months following arraignment and prior
 to an indictment. Dr. Trenchev and other activists were
 detained incommunicado and without charges for more than 3
 months. They were allowed access to a lawyer only after 2
 months, when the preliminary investigation had been completed.
 They were ultimately released on bail of about $105 each,
 under obligation to appear at a.hearing when called. Under
 the criminal code, the accused must be informed of the charges
 against him, but this requirement was not always observed.
 During Zhivkov's rule, persons could also be subjected to a
 system of administrative control short of imprisonment,
 whereby they were detained at their place of residence and
 required to appear frequently at the local police station.
 Under the law, the militia is authorizes to place under
 administrative control or house arrest not only those who have
 engaged in criminal activities, but also those who have
 protested "against organs of power" or shown "antisocial
 manifestations." Poet Petur Manolov, then secretary of the
 Independent Society for the Protection of Human Rights in
 Bulgaria, was confined to Plovdiv in early 1989 on these
 grounds.
 Another form of punishment and control is compulsory domicile
 or internal exile. During Zhivkov's rule, this was a
 frequently used tool to isolate political activists from their
 friends and prevent their being in touch with Western media or
 foreign embassy representatives. If such persons left despite
 these prohibitions, they faced possible imprisonment. Ethnic
 Turk Dzhemil Mekhmedov, arrested in 1985 after protesting the
 then compulsory name-change campaign, was taken from his
 family and home village of Ezerovo and placed under compulsory
 domicile in ethnically Bulgarian villages in the northeast.
 In June he was allowed to leave for Turkey with his family.
 Activist Nikolai Ganchev Kolev, accused of not performing
 "socially useful labor," was detained in March, appeared
 before a local magistrate, and was sent, without any trial or
 access to a lawyer, to Bobov Dol for compulsory domicile and
 labor for a year and a half. Kolev was allowed to return to
 
 
 1047
 BULGARIA
 Stara Zagora in April following hunger strikes in his defense
 and was detained again in May.
 Exile or expulsion was utilized as a means of political
 control from late 1988 until Zhivkov's ouster. Independent
 Society member Eduard Genov and his family were the first to
 be expelled in October 1988. Ekaterina Markova and Kristo
 Svatovski. followed him in November, along with Grigor Simov
 Bozhilov who was turned back at the Austrian border. Tseko,
 Tsekov left Bulgaria in December. Dimitur and Diana
 Boyadzhiev, of the independent trade union "Podkrepa"
 (Supp6rt), .reached Vienna in March 1989, as did Orthodox
 priest Blagoy Topuzliev. Rumen Tsankov Dimitrov of the "Green
 Mass" left Bulgaria in April; the group's chairman, Stefan
 Cholakov, left in May. Petur Manolov, despite his strong
 desire to remain in Bulgaria, was expelled in May following
 months of sustained, intensive pressure and harassment,
 including threatening telephone calls, physical intimidation,
 isolation, and other forms of abuse. Independent Society
 activist Vladimir Krustev was expelled in August.
 It is not possible to estimate reliably the number of persons
 subject to arbitrary arrests, other forms of detention, or
 summary exile up to November 10, 1989. The exact number of
 Turkish detainees who may still be incarcerated or in internal
 exile as a result of the 1984-1985 name-change campaign is
 unknown, although some were expelled and/or allowed to leave
 the country between June and August 1989, and others were
 released from prison after the change of leadership in
 November and the subsequent amnesties.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e.' Denial 9f Fair Public Trial
 Bulgarian law and general practice provide for public trial in
 criminal cases. .Defendants are entitled to legal counsel, but
 only after the preliminary investigation and indictment.
 During Zhivkovls regime, when defense attorneys, were provided,
 they often cooperated with the prosecution. As a result, one
 human rights activist in 1989 refused to retain an attorney
 and chose tq defend himself. Lawyer Angel Sokolarsky, who had
 been disbarred for his overly energetic defense-of a client
 prosecuted for political reasons in 1987, was reportedly
 reinstated in April 1989. Some defense attorneys enjoy
 reputations for. courage and.honesty, despite pressures by the
 security apparatus.                   .
 Special court procedures appl  in cases involving state
 security. Article 262 of the penal procedural code declares
 that a closed trial ma   e held when necessary "for the
 preservation of a s.e secret or of socialist morality."
 There is also a system of military courts and a military
 division of h 6Supreme Court, in which crimes committed by
 military personnel and employees of the Ministry of Internal
 Affair are tried.
 During Zhivkov's regime, the judicial system generally sought
 to appear to be observing legal norms, but the courts
 sometimes applied statutes retroactively or extended them to
 cases of dubious applicability. The penal laws were codified
 and published, but their circulation was severely
 circumscribed. Many Bulgarians are unaware of the provisions
 of their Constitution, which was among the documents
 confiscated from Petur Manolov in January and dissident priest
 
 
 1048
 BULGARIA
 Blagoy Topuzliev when he left Bulgaria in March. There age
 also separate and sometimes unpublished laws affecting, for
 example, the military, the people's militia, religious sects,
 and telephone communications. In addition, thereAreo
 extensive ministry regulations and generally "understood"
 administrative measures that remain unpublishfed. Under
 Zhivkov, such regulations were frequently invoked in judicial
 proceedings, and the defendant had little opportunity to
 question their validity or applicability. Defendants have the
 right to produce "proofs," as well as the right to appeal a
 sentence, within 7 days. Of the 21,956 persons sentenced in
 1988, however, only 301 were subsequently acquitted.
 Political prisoners in Bulgaria include those captured while
 trying to escape across the bordersand ethnic Turks detained
 for opposition to the name-change campaign begun in 1984. The
 number of such detainees is unknown. Credible reports,
 including those documented by Amnesty International (AI) and
 Helsinki Watch, indicate that many ethnic Turks remained in-
 prison or exile during 1989. Bulgarian human rights activists
 noted that there were approximately 250 political prisoners in
 1989 prior to Zhivkov's overthrow. The amnesties announced in
 November and December 1989 are believed to have led to the
 release of many, perhaps most, of these prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Before November, the authorities interfered in the private
 lives of citizens in many ways. In November, however, the
 Government announced that the arm of the internal security
 forces which monitored the "ideological" activities of
 citizens had been abolished. No announcement has yet been
 made about the other functions of the security forces, which
 have directed an elaborate system of informers in virtually
 all workplaces, residential areas, and social organizations to
 monitor the daily lives of Bulgarians for signs of dissent.
 The Constitution charges parents with the "obligation" of
 attending to their children's Communist education, which was
 also considered the purview of the State alone. In Kurdzhali
 in 1988, Turkish children aged 3 to 6 were reportedly required
 to live in nursery schools during the week and go home only on
 weekends as part of an official effort to "Bulgarianize"
 them. The Islamic rite of male circumcision was effectively
 banned during most of 1989, although the announced end to the
 campaign to assimilate the Turkish minority should lead to the
 lifting of that ban. Citizens who did not become members of
 Communist-dominated mass organizations were denied advancement
 at work and other benefits.
 The monitoring of private telephone conversations and/or
 correspondence was also common. When one dissident protested
 to state authorities about the monitoring and cutting off of
 his telephone conversations, he was told in a letter of reply
 that his line was "in order" and his complaints were "illegal
 and unfounded," and he was warned that such violations of the
 law would be punished. Four of the five human rights
 activists invited to the Paris Conference on the Human
 Dimension in May did not receive their invitations because of
 Bulgarian postal interference.
 Sanctity of the home is nominally safeguarded by law, and
 police .ay not legally search property without prior
 permission from a court or prosecutor. However, searches may
 
 
 1049
 BULGARIA
 be undertaken in situations the police deem urgent before
 judicial permission is given. Dissident Petur Manolov's home
 was searched in January 1989, no warrant was presented,.and
 many documents, including his personal telephone directory and
 a Bulgarian translation of the 1948 Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights, were confiscated. Following a lengthy hunger
 strike and resultant international publicity, all of his
 documents were returned. The homes of Dr. Konstantin Trenchev
 and his parents were searched on May 27,.and he was given a
 lengthy itemized receipt for the documents that were taken.
 To date none of Dr. Trenchev's papers have been released by
 the, authorities.
 Bulgaria ceased jamming Radio Free Europe broadcasts in
 Decebber 1988.,' The British Broadcasting Corporation's. World
 Service, Deutsche Welle, and Voice of America broadcasts are
 also heard without inierference. -The availability of Western
 publications Xemains tightly controlled; only Western
 Comn inist party newspapers, such as L'Unita and the Morning
 Star, are regulily sold at newsstands.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Numerous reports indicated that Bulgarian security forces-
 utilized excessivej.orce in putting down mass demonstrations
 by ethnic Turks in May, just as they had in 1984-1985.
 Apparently prompted by independent human rights groups,
 Bulgaria's signing of the Vienna Concluding Document of the
 Conference on'Security 4nd Cooperation in Europe, the Paris
 Conference 6n the Human Dimension, and the passage of the new
 assport'law (all widely reported on'Western radio stations),
 hundreds of ethnic Turks began hunger strikes in May to demand
 the restoration of their Turkish names and their human
 rights: freedom to speak their language, practice their
 religi6n, and maintain their cultural traditions. The hunger
 stkikeVWere followed by nonviolent marches and demonstrations.
 Up to 5,000 internial security .troops using tanks and
 hel icopters wer' called in to-quell the demonstrations which
 took place- in many northeastern and southern towns and
 villages. Although the Government acknowledged that 7 had
 been killed and 28 wounded, outside conservative estimates run
 to approximately 30 people killed and 100 wounded.
 In a televised speech in May, then chairman Todor Zhivkov
 declared tJiat every Bulgarian citizen could exercise his right
 to travel and called upon Turkey to open its frontier to all
 Bulgarian Muslims. The Government organized mass public
 demonstrations in May and June denouncing Turkey.
 Following the initial expulsion of perhaps 3,000 ethnic
 Turkish 'actiyipts, some of whom were suddenly taken from
 prison. 6r internal exile, thousands of ethnic Turks began to
 apply for their passports under'the new passport law (see
 Section'2.d.), remove their savings from the banks, and pack
 up all they could qaxry. From June through August, until the
 Turkish Government reinstituted a strict visa regime to.
 control.the massive flow of immigrants, more than 310,000
 Bulgarian Turks streamed across the border in cars, pulling
 hand carts, and on foot. (Over 70,000 of these subsequently
 returned to Bulgaria.) InSeptember Pomaks (ethnic Bulgarian
 Muslims) in many villages peacefully demonstrated for similar
 reasons, including the right to travel. Again, Bulgarian
 authorities used force to end the demonstrations, killing up
 
 
 1050
 BULGARIA
 to 10 persons and injuring scores.  In December the new regime
 responded to a peaceful demonstration by Muslims in Sofia by
 agreeing to repudiate the assimilation policy.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 press, other laws provide severe punishment for the voicing of
 any belief or conviction which is contrary to official policy
 or critical of the State. Under Zhivkov's rule, Bulgarians
 were detained, tried, imprisoned, and exiled for criticism and
 actions which were political in nature. The penal code
 prcvides punishment for "crimes against the People's
 Republic," "antistate agitation and propaganda," slander
 against the State, spreading untrue allegations about the
 Government, and committing acts that create distrust toward
 the Government. In November the National Assembly repealed
 some of these articles and released those who had been
 convicted under them.
 The unauthorized disclosure of information, particularly
 unpublished economic or demographic statistics, is illegal.
 Reportedly, a law specifying what constitutes an official
 secret is being drafted, and a new press law is being
 considered. Many press articles before November endorsed the
 practice of "responsible" glasnost (openness), i.e., freedom
 of speech with self-imposed limits for the good of society.
 After the removal of Zhivkov, the press became much more open,
 even reporting objectively on some of the actions of dissident
 groups.
 Bulgaria's radio, television, and press remain state owned and
 state controlled. Although censorship officially did not
 exist, the media, as well as writers, artists, and those in
 academic life, operated within implicit party and government
 guidelines and practiced self-censorship. Before November,
 forbidden topics typically included unauthorized criticism of
 party and state leaders, of Communist ideology, and of other
 Communist countries. Ordinary citizens could express
 criticism and send complaints to newspapers as well as to
 National Assembly deputies, but only those on approved topics,
 such as inadequate service by public agencies and housing
 shortages, were publicized.  Authorized criticism rarely
 extended beyond specific shortcomings or failures of lower
 level administrative officials. When television commentator
 Kevork Kevorkian, moderator of the popular show "Every
 Sunday," questioned a visiting Soviet official on the
 continuing need for such slogans as "Proletarians of the
 World, Unite!," he was temporarily removed from the air.
 Following his further public complaints in July that he was
 not being allowed to broadcast what he wished, the show was
 canceled. The show was brought back in November, allegedly
 after Mladenov's personal intervention.
 .Bulgaria began to move toward Soviet-style glasnost late in
 1989, but the country's record was generally checkered. In
 January the official press viciously attacked the country's
 first independent human rights organization while ignoring the
 arrest of its members. An article criticizing the National
 Assembly as a "rubber stamp" was published in July, as was
 increased criticism on the lack of glasnost in various
 government branches and enterprises.
 
 
 1051
 BULGARIA
 Until Mladenov's ascendancy, there was no unofficial
 publ'ishing in-Bulgaria. One Bulgarian produced an independent
 newsletter, "The Alternative," in July on a computer; the
 first issue included the text of the Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights, an editorial on the paper's intent and function
 in a "totalitarian Communist system," the Intellectual Club's
 May'declaration on glasnost, and Blaga Dimitrova's hitherto
 unpublished speech at the March Congress of Writers on the
 misuse of language in Bulgarian society.
 Dissatisfied intellectuals had formed a group in late 1988
 calling for increased glasnost and more rapid perestroika
 (restructuring). Several members of. this "Independent
 Discussion Club in Support of Glasnost and Preustroistvo" were
 subsbquently expelled from the BCP as a result of their
 activities. In May they circulated an appeal to the National
 Assembly for greater glasnost, including the right of citizens
 to express their opinions and to receive and circulate all
 kinds of.information. Although this appeal was broadcast on
 Radio Free Europe, it was never acknowledged or officially
 published in Bulgaria.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association, but in practice during the Zhivkov regime only
 public demonstrations of support for the Government or party
 were allowed, and the party decided which social and political
 organizatiohs could exist. New, more liberal legislation
 governing assembly and association was being considered by the.
 National Assembly at year's end.
 Under Zhivkov, all authorized associations were government
 controlled, and the law provided punishment for anyone
 foundinq an illegal organization. Seven Bulgarians founded
 the country's first independent human rights organization, the
 "Inaependiet Society f-or the Protection of Human Rights in
 Bulgaria,".in Januaiy i988. In June of that year, the
 Government founded a "Committee for Human Rights," which has
 refused to assist members of independent organizations on the
 grounds they were not legal.  Independent groups have
 proliferated since that time: in November 1988, the
 Independent Discussion.Club for the Support of Glasnost and
 Preustroistvo" (intellectuals), the "Democratic League for the
 Defense of Human Rights" (p primarily ethnic Turkish group),
 and the "Party of the Green Masses" (an alternative political
 party); in January 1989 the "Association to Support Vienna
 '89" (another ethnic Turkish group); in February the
 independent trade union for scientific, technical, cultural,
 and educational professionals "Podkrepa" (Support); in March
 the "Committee for Religious Rights, Freedom of Conscience,
 and.Spiritual Values"; in April the "Moslem Initiative Group"
 and "Eco-glasnost" (an environmental group); in the spring the
 "Citizens' Initiative" (an autonomous branch of the
 "Independent Society" in Ruse); and in July "Committee 273,"
 to supp6rt all those detained under Article 273 of the
 Constitution for antigovernment propaganda.
 Most of these groups applied for registration in order to
 receive the status of a juridical person, which is the only
 way to haye a bank account amd own property. The Government
 refused registration to all and deemed all of them illegal,
 until, in December, a Sofia court ordered that Eco-glasnost be
 permitted to register. The Government also refused to allow
 any of the independent groups the use of restaurants or public
 
 
 1052
 BU1LGARIA
 halls for their meetings. It prevented the party conference
 of the Green Masses in both April and June and broke up an
 outdoor assembly of Eco-glasnost in July. Members of
 ECo-glasnost were beaten by police and forcibly removed from
 one Sofia park to another while they were collecting
 signatures for a petition during the October meeting of the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe on the
 environment. In December the National Assembly passed a
 resolution condemning the police action and calling for an
 investigation and compensation for the victims.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The new leadership has not yet addressed church-state
 relations. Although the Constitution provides for freedom of
 worship, the authorities under the old regime espoused atheism
 and discouraged religion. Openly expressed religious
 conviction was incompatible with party membership or
 attainment of responsible government or other positions.
 Church-state relations are regulated by a division of the
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Before November, it reviewed all
 clerical appointments and had imposed clergy on local
 congregations over the opposition of parishioners. No church
 buildings could be constructed without official permission,
 and the committee determined whether or not existing numbers
 of churches for various denominations were adequate.
 Religious and prayer groups could be organized and services
 conducted privately, according to officials. No religious
 groups could engage in open proselytizing, and foreign
 missionary activity wss banned. Authorities confiscated
 imported religious materials. No parochial schools could
 -exist.
 A number of faiths are recognized or tolerated. The Bulgarian
 Orthodox Church, which was the established church before the
 Communists took power, is the largest, with a reported
 following of 6 million nominal adherents out of a population
 of 9 million. Functioning as a quasi-official church, it
 receives government financial support and echoes government
 propaganda. The church is allowed to print a newspaper,
 although the last Bulgarian-language Bible, only 2;000 copies
 of which were published, appeared in 1982; no Bibles may be
 imported. In 1989, for the first time since 1946, the
 Patriarch was permitted to present Christmas greetings on
 televison and radio. The Orthodox Church is allowed to
 distill and market some alcoholic beverages and sell some
 religious articles, such as candles and small jewelry
 crosses. There is a seminary for Orthodox priests whose
 curriculum is approved by the State.
 The independent "Committee for Religious Rights, Freedom of
 Conscience, and Spiritual Values," founded by Orthodox priest
 Father Khristofor Subev, was repudiated and denounced by the
 official Orthodox church hierarchy. Father Subev was sent
 into internal exile in January after having led illegal
 processions of believers, carrying icons, through the streets
 of Veliko Turnovo. His group called for an end to political
 interference in church affairs and religious life, for freedom
 of conscience, freedom of religious information, legalization
 of religious charitable work, and religious tolerance. In
 December his group demonstrated in Sofia without repercussions.
 Approximately 60,000 Roman Catholics are divided between
 followers of the Latin and Uniate rites. Bulgaria reportedly
 
 
 1053
 BULGARIA
 has only 32 Catholic priests now, as opposed to about 200 when
 the Communists took power. Importation of the French
 newspaper La Croix has been forbidden, but selected priests
 have been able to travel to Rome and to receive the Vatican's-
 official paper-, L'Osservatore Romano. The Government in 1988
 made grants to the three Catholic dioceses of Sofia, Plovdiv,
 and Ruse.
 Other religious denominations in Bulgaria have few adherents.
 There are 10 Armenian churches in the country, and the
 Armenian community publishes a biweekly newspaper. Various
 Protestant groups, including Baptists, Pentecostalists,
 Methodists, and Seventh-Day Adventists, reportedly suffer
 continving problems with the authorities. In February
 govdrnmentofficials characterized Pavel Ignatov and his
 Church of God congregation as schismatics and dismissed
 allegations qf-repressive measures against the group. In May
 a member of ,Ignatov's congregation reported that, following
 the Easter visit of an American pastor, Timothy Kornet, the
 man who had interpreted for Kornet was thrown out into the
 street with his pregnant wife, and pastor Ignatov lost his
 job. In April a group of evangelical Protestants primarily
 from Denmark called "Pilgrims of Jerusalem" traveled around
 Bulgaria holding religious services. The Government expelled
 thei 8fter 2 months.
 Alt-bough some reports indicated that the Dunovist sect, an
 indigenous movement which flourished in pre-Communist
 Bulgaria, is outlawed, government officials claimed that
 Dunoyists.are-legal. The Ba'hai -faith -is outlawed.
 The Jewish minority numbers approximately 3,000 people. It
 receives some financial support from the Government and
 publishes a biweekly paper stressing Communist themes. A
 Jewish socihl, cultural, and educational organization exists,
 but'it-is atheistic and political in orientation. Visits
 between-the Bulgarian-Jewish community and Israeli Jews of
 Bulgarian origin.are-frequent, although subject to government.
 control.- The cantor, of Sofia's synagogue went to New York in
 1988-and 1989 for cantorial training. No 'kosher meat is
 available, but Jews -are -p.ermitted to-bake-and distribute
 matzoh without hindrance.
 EthnicTurks (approximately 1 million) comprise the majority
 of Bulgaria's Muslims, the remainder being Slavic Pomaks
 (about .200,000) and Gypsies. On December 29, the Government
 announced that it condemned the actions taken since 1984 to
 assimilate the minority and pledged to take measures to ensure
 that true freedom of faith, voluntary choice of name, and the
 right to speak languages other than Bulgarian in everyday
 communications would be guaranteed. There has been some
 popular opposition to this announcement, and some local
 officials reportedly have refused to comply. The effects of
 this assimilation policy were far-reaching: most mosques were
 closed, and many were used for storerooms or nursery schools.
 Those that remained open usually operated only for Friday noon
 prayers .rather than the-mandatory five .times a day. Chief
 Mufti Nedyo Gendzhev, elected in November 1988, reportedly
 instructed local imams to keep people undero60 years of age
 out of those mosques that remain functioning.
 As part of the Government's campaign to eradicate the cultural
 identity of the Turkish community, many Muslim rites were
 forbidden. Muslim wedding ceremonies were not permitted, and
 Turkish weddings could not take place in the streets, as is
 
 
 1054
 BULGARIA
 the tradition; they had to be conducted in closed halls, and
 the singing and playing of Turkish songs-was forbidden. Many
 Muslim cemeteries were destroyed or defil    and separate
 Muslim cemeteries were reportedly abolished.  Muslim funerals
 were generally not permitted, although there were credible
 reports that Muslim funerals, or at least burials in
 non-Christian places, were again permitted beginning in
 September. Sermons had to be delivered in Bulgarian, and the
 Chief Mufti's office records had to be kept in Bulgarian.
 Public use of the Turkish language was forbidden, as was the
 wearing of traditional forms of dress. Violators were subject
 to substantial fines. Circumcision, which some newspaper
 articles have derided as "unhygienic," is hypothetically
 permitted only in hospitals, without the religious ceremony
 which accompanies it. In practice, it was forbidden.
 In defense of its treatment of the Muslim minority, the
 Government prominently publicized the amount of money spent to
 restore Shumen's Tombul mosques, and there were claims that
 three more mosques are to be restored and two new ones built.
 After years of refusing permission, the Government allowed six
 Bulgarian students studying at the Higher Islamic Institute in
 Tashkent to make the hajj in 1988. Five Bulgarians made the
 hajj in 1989; one, the Imam of Kurdzhali, later sought'asylum
 in the Turkish Consulate in Jeddah. A school for imams has
 operated in Sofia since 1986, although its 6-month course
 includes heavy political content. Copies of the Koran cannot
 be found in Bulgarian bookstores. In February the Chief Mufti
 claimed work was in progress on a third Bulgarian translation
 of the Koran, but by year's end there was no indication when,
 or if, it would be published.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government controls where people live, work, and travel.
 Citizens are required at all times to carry with them personal
 identity cards stating their legal place of residence and
 work. Without this card they cannot register at a hotel,
 purchase domestic airline tickets, or seek any kind of social
 service such as medical assistance. Changing one's place of
 residence or work is a complicated process unless it is at the
 Government's initiative or convenience. Moves to Sofia and
 other major cities from smaller settlements are especially
 difficult, and in some cases'prohibited, because of the
 authorities' desire to control urban growth. This concern
 gave rise to-the practice of "zhitelstyo,* or the right of
 residency. A newspaper article in 1989 criticized existing
 restrictions, and quoted an advisor to the Council of
 Ministers as saying that limitations on residence "run counter
 to the legally established human rights and to the
 Constitution."
 Bulgarians may travel within the country without restriction
 except in border zones, which are heavily patrolled by armed
 guards where the country adjoins Greece and Turkey. In August
 1988, the Government announced a 75-percent reduction in the
 permanently restricted area, encompassing regions closed to
 foreigners. Although some of the newly opened areas included
 those with large ethnic Turkish populations, a significant
 area along the Turkish and Greek borders remains closed.
 During and subsequent to the demonstrations in May, diplomatic
 travellers were turned away from areas clearly within the
 unrestricted zone.
 
 
 1055
 BULGARIA
 A Bulgarian citizen needs both a passport for external travel
 and an exit visa specifying the destination for each trip. In
 May the-Nationa'l Assembly passed thelong-promised passport
 law mandating the issuance of 5-year passports for all
 citizens. Although according to the law passport applications
 may be refused only in specific circumstances, these include
 "the protection of national security," which is susceptible to
 broad interpretation. Since November, many dissidents and
 members of independent groups have been given passports and
 permission to travel. At year's end, however, many Pomaks had
 stilalnotbeen issued the passports they had requested.
 Exit visas, which under Zhivkov's rule were still required for
 all hon-Communist countries, could also be refused for a
 varfety-of reasons. According to other legal changes,
 Bulgarians who traveled abroad and did not return by the time
 specified were no longer subject to criminal penalties and
 possible imprisonment but only to administrative measures and.
 fines.($210 for overstaying 1 month and upwards). Those who
 overstayed abroad prior to September 1, 1989, were not subject
 to the fines or criminal penalties.
 The Government also substantially reduced the number of
 unsettled divided family cases involving the United States and
 Western Europe:' Thousands of divided family cases remain
 between Bulgariatand Turkey, however. This already'severe
 problem was exacerbated in 1989 when the Government decided
 selectively to apply the new passport law before it went into
 effect officially on September 1. Between June and August,
 more thah 310,000 Bulgarian Turks crossed the border into
 Turkey. In-most of these-cases, however, family members were
 left behind--persons required for the harvest, young mdn of
 militaxy-age; or others kept behind for arbitrary reasons.
 In theory, all Bulgarians now have the right to leave theit
 country and to return.' Changes in the citizenship law passed
 in May ensured that a Bulgarian could only be stripped of his
 citizenship while abroad, and then only for committing "a
 severe crime" against Bulgaria. The law now allows dual
 citizenship as well.
 Those who return to Bulgaria'are said to retain all their
 rights., Some reports, however, indicated that returning
 ethnic Turks may not return to their home villages but are
 resettled and dispersed throughout the country.
 It-is Bulgarian policy to return to their home countries
 potential refugees from other Warsaw Pact states who try to
 cross the Bulgarian border into Turkey, Yugoslavia, or
 Greece. A Romanian who sought political asylum from the U.S.
 Embassy in Sofia and who was then caught trying to cross the
 Bulgarian border to Yugoslavia was forcibly returned to
 Romania, where he faced imprisonment. In September 1988, 13
 Magyar Romanians'sought refuge in the Hungarian Embassy in
 Sofia; that situation was resolved-iif February 1989 when they
 were petmitted, through the auspices of the International Red
 Cross, to'leave Bulgaria for a third country, from which they
 then traveled to Hungary.
 Section 3  Respect for Political Rights, The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In December the BCP proposed that the guarantee of its leading
 role in the State be removed from the Constitution. The
 National Assembly voted in support of this change and will
 
 
 1056
 BULGARIA
 take the formal vote to amend the Constitution in January
 1990. The Assembly also called for a new election law leading
 to "free, democratic elections" by May 1990. Meanwhile, the
 BCP leadership effectively governs Bulgaria, although the
 National Assembly has begun to exert some influence.
 Political pluralism and free participation in the political
 process did not exist under Zhivkov's regime. In November
 1988, two Bulgarians, Stefan Cholakov and Rumen Tsankov-
 Dimitrov, founded the Party of the Green Masses, a social
 democratic organization. They applied for registration and
 legalization; Cholakov was detained on January 6, 1989, and
 Tsankov-Dimitrov on December 26, 1988. Both men were held
 without charges for 2 months. In an announcement on April 2,
 the two founders noted that up to that time they had received
 no answer" other than our detention." Both subsequently left
 Bulgaria.
 The former regime pretended to a form of pluralism through the
 participation of a second political party, the Bulgarian
 National Agrarian Union, in the Government and National
 Assembly. However, the Agrarian Union professed no
 differences of view with the BCP on any issue. Since
 November, there has been a change in the leadership of the
 Agrarian Union, and some members of the Union have called for
 it to assume a more independent position. Still, Agrarian
 Union officials have not strayed far from the BCP on any'
 issues yet. The Communist and Agrarian Parties, together with
 labor, youth, and other groups, comprise a mass organization
 known as the Fatherland Front, which is wholly controlled by
 the BCP. The Fatherland Front has been the only organization
 permitted to present candidates for election. Following
 constitutional changes in 1987, so-called multicandidate
 elections were held on the local level in February 1988. Less
 than 20 percent of these elections involved more than one
 candidate; all candidates were prescreened by election
 commissions and all supported the BCP. There have been no
 elections since that time.
 Through most of 1989, the National Assembly functioned as a
 rubber stamp, approving party policies and proposals. A
 newspaper article in July criticized the legislative body for
 its invariable unanimity. While the Assembly, since November,
 has begun to assert its right to function as a genuine
 legislature, it has not so far opposed any measure proposed by
 the new leadership. It took the initiative, however, to call
 for an investigation into the October 20 police action against
 members of Eco-glasnost.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Under Zhivkov's regime, the Government dismissed any criticism
 of its human rights record as part of an "anti-Bulgarian
 campaign" and/or interference in its internal affairs.
 Bulgaria signed the Vienna Concluding Document of the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe but did not
 change its traditional response to charges of human rights
 abuses. Bulgarian officials noted that, although they were
 obliged to respond to requests for information, no specific
 time period was spelled out. In some individual cases,
 however, in which Western government or private groups have
 pressed for a response, the Government has provided
 information. The Government responded to a March U.S.
 
 
 1057
 BULGARIA
 demarche on Iliya Minev, chairman of the Independent Society,
 who was then on a hunger strike. Western publicity and
 criticism on the eve of the London Information Forum led to
 the xelease in April of Nikolai Ganchev Kolev, who had been
 sent int6 intdrnal-exile. Authorities did not respond to an
 August demarche on Dr. Trenchev and the other five activists
 detainea along with him. The six detainees were released on
 Seplember 4, presumably in response to intense outside
 interest. The new leadership has repeatedly emphasized its
 determination to bring Bulgarian law and practice into line
 with its commitments to the Conference on Security and
 Cooperation in Europe and has taken some initial steps in this
 direction.
 In darch a Bulgarian official unsuccessfully tried to prevent
 condemhtion by the Organization of the Islamic Conference
 (OIC) of*Bulgari'a's treatment of its ethnic Turkish minority.
 Hereiterated the standard government line that there are no
 Turks in Bulgaria and that the OIC's accusations were
 interference in Bulgarian internal affairs.
 Bulgaria's treatment of its ethnic Turkish minority prompted
 many international inquiries in 1989. A Council of Europe
 delegation visited Bulgaria in July to analyze the situation.
 The United States Congress passed a resolution, also in July,
 condemning Bulgaria's "expulsion" of thousands of ethnic
 Turks. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization in August
 issued a statement critical of Bulgaria's policy. The
 Government allowed a visit by a World Health Organization
 (WhO) team in August to investigate Turkish allegations of
 harmful Vaccinations given to Bulgarian ethnic Turkish
 emigres.' The WHO reported that its commission found that no
 injections containing harmful substances had been administered
 to the Turkish-speaking population.
 In September 1988, AI representatives visited Bulgaria (having
 sought permission since 1985) and met with Bulgarian officials
 responsible for human rights matters. They also met with
 Konstantin Tellalov, chairman of the government-sponsored
 Committee for Human Rights. Members of Helsinki Watch visited
 Bulgaria in October and spoke to both, government officials and
 private citizens. Bulgaria is a member of the United Nations
 Human Ritghts Commission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on these
 criteria. In recent years, the Government under Zhivkov
 denied the existence of any minority ethnic groups and hence
 even the possibility of discrimination. Census reports, which
 in thte early 1960's noted the existence of significant numbers
 of Gypsies,.Macedonians, and ethnic Turks, more recently
 reported'analmost totally homogeneous Bulgarian populace.
 The Zhivkbv regime admitted the existence of differing
 religiofs groups, such as "Bulgarian Muslims," but rejected
 the possibility of any religious intolerance or discrimination
 against them. It did not publicly distinguish between those
 Muslims who are of ethnic Turkish origin and those who are
 ethnically Bulgarian (Pomaks), although credible reports
 indicated that the latter are still not being permitted to
 emigrate to Turkey.
 During Zhivkov's rule, ethnic Turks, comprising at least 10
 percent of the population, were subject to severe restrictions
 
 
 1058
 BULGARIA
 and discrimination in a systematic effort to destroy their
 cultural identity (see Section 2.c.). During the forced
 assimilation campaign of 1984-85, all Turks were assigned new
 Bulgarian given and family names. Only these names appeared
 on their new identity cards, issued from January to March 1985.
 Because no adult Bulgarians received new identity cards during
 this period, the date of issuance effectively functioned as a
 code, signaling to the authorities that its bearer is an ethnic
 Turk. Pomak names were "Bulgarianized" in 1974; one Pomak
 claimed his name was changed three times: in 1972, 1974, and
 1975. Gypsies* names were changed to Bulgarian names in the
 19701s.
 In the army, Gypsies, ethnic Turks, and soldiers imprisoned
 for various crimes, who must complete their military service
 after completing their sentences, are reportedly assigned only
 to "black" work in labor brigades in the interior of Bulgaria;
 they are not allowed to bear arms.
 There is pervasive social discrimination against the small
 Gypsy population, which generally lives in shantytowns and
 occupies the lowest rung of the socioeconomic ladder. There
 are no reliable estimates as to their numbers; some officials
 have claimed as few as 40,000, and some dissidents have
 claimed as many as 1 million.
 The Constitution declares that "women and men enjoy equal
 rights," and there does not appear to be overt discrimination
 as regards educational and professional opportunities. There
 is no evidence of systematic violence against women or of
 widespread wife beating. According to the Ministry of the
 Interior, of the more than 68,000 crimes committed in Bulgaria
 in 1988, less than 2 percent were "violent" or "premeditated,"
 including murder and rape.
 Section 6 Worker rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Communist Party organizes and totally controls all trade
 unions, which are grouped together in the Central Council of
 Bulgarian Trade Unions (CCTU). The unions' role is to promote
 government and party objectives. Workers have not been
 permitted to organize outside the official union structure,
 nor allowed to strike. In November the CCTU declared that it
 was now completely independent of the BCP and the state
 organs, and that it would devote itself to promoting the
 rights and economic interests of workers.
 The country's first independent trade union was founded in
 February. Dr. Konstantin Trenchev founded an "independent
 association of the scientific-technical, humanitarian, and
 creative-artistic intelligentsia in Bulgaria." Called
 "Podkrepa" (Support), the union has gathered significant
 support, especially in November and December; it now
 reportedly has 70,000 members. Although the group has no
 official recognition as a trade union, the Bulgarian media
 after November reported objectively on its activities.
 Podkrepa has engaged in dialog with the official unions on
 several occasions.
 The CCTU is affiliated with the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions.
 
 
 1059
 BULGARIA
 In its 1989 report, the ILO's Committee of Experts again
 criticized the mQnopoly on organizing workers that Bulgarian
 law grants to the official unions, as well as the subservience
 of the official unions to the BCP. The Committee called on
 the Government to indicate measures taken or contemplated
 which would recognize the right of workers to organize
 independent unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There 's no collective bargaining in Bulgaria. A new labor
 code, in force since January 1987, and a "restructuring" of
 unions in the spring of 1987 were intended to shift the focus.
 of union decisionmaking from the apex to its base. Despite
 the 'much heralded arrival of "self-management," there is no
 indication, thus far, that the role of the official unions has
 changed substantially.
 Bulgaria has one functioning duty-free zone in Ruse, and plans
 to establish three more in the future. Workers in these zones
 are subject to the same laws and regulations as other workers
 in Bulgaria.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution declares that "every able-bodied citizen is
 obliged to do socially useful work." Those who do not work
 may be charged with "vagrancy" or social parasitism; Article
 39 of the Statutes of the People's Militia authorizes the
 imposition of "administrative measures," such as house arrest,
 on "people who lead nomad lives or beg as opposed to doing
 ocial labor." Compulsory labor may be required of prisoners
 or those in internal exile. Political detainees in 1989
 reported that they had worked in various capacities while in
 detention and that those who refused to work were beaten and
 given less food. Human rights activist Eduard Genov, interned
 in the village of Mikhalkovo prior to being exiled, reportedly
 worked in a mine. During Zhivkov's regime, the Government
 also abused compulsory military service obligations by
 utilizing ethnic Turks, Gypsies, former prisoners, and others
 who were not fully trusted in labor brigades.
 As a result of the exodus of thousands of ethnic Turks which
 caused serious dislocations in the Bulgarian economy, the
 Government in July enacted a labor mobilization'decree which
 authorized the State to send people wherever their labor was
 needed. Students were sent to factories to fill the vacancies
 left by ethnic Turks, in addition to performing the usual
 harvest work assigned them in the late summer and fall.
 d. Minimum Wage for Employment of Children
 The Labor Code adopted in 1986 stipulated 16 years as the
 minimum age for all but certain light work. Persons from 16
 to 18 years of age may not be assigned work designated as
 heavy, harmful, or dangerous; their workweek is either five
 7-hour days or six 6-hour days. These restrictions are
 effectively enforced. Seven years of compulsory education for
 children begin either at age 6 or 7.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage, as of September 1, 1988, was $82 per month
 at the official commercial exchange rate. The average monthly
 wage is the local currency equivalent of $140 at the
 
 
 1060
 BULGARIA
 commercial rate of exchange. The minimum wage is not
 sufficient for a single wage earner to provide a decent
 standard of living for a family. In families with two working
 spouses, the average wage provides, at best, a modest standard
 of living.
 The workweek for adults is 42.5 hours (5 days of 8.5 hours) in
 most professions and occupations. The civil mobiLization
 decree of July 1989, however, provided for compulsory 6-day
 workweeks and 9-hour days in many professions. Paid vacations
 range from 14 workdays annually for those who have worked less
 than 10 years to 18 workdays annually for those who have
 worked more than 15 years. Additional paid vacation is
 granted those in certain difficult or dangerous occupations.
 Bulgarian practice appears generally to conform to these
 guidelines, although participation in unpaid supplementary
 "brigades" can lengthen working hours on various occasions
 during the year.
 Bulgaria has a national labor safety program, and the official
 trade unions are assigned a role in promoting job safety.
 Standards of enforcement vary greatly, however, and questions
 of worker health and safety are not satisfactorily resolved.
