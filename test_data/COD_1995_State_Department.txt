 ZAIRE
 After 30 years of authoritarian rule, President Mobutu Sese Seko remains firmly
 in control of Zairian politics, despite his 5-year-old promise of democratic reform. Al-
 though a National Conference was convened in 1992, Mobutu later withdrew his
 support for its chosen Prime Minister, Etienne Tshisekedi wa Mulumba, and ap-
 pointed a former Tshisekedi ally, Faustin Birindwa, to lead the Government. Refus-
 ing to accept Mobutu's authority to remove him, Tshisekedi presided over a parallel
 government until June 1993 when both the Birindwa and Tshisekedi governments
 ceased to function. In mid-1994, Mobutu allies and opposition leaders negotiated an
 end to the political stalemate by combining elements of the two governments to cre-
 ate a transitional constitution (the Transitional Act) and a combined transitional
 parliament (the HCR-PT). In turn, the HCR-PT elected Kengo wa Dondo as its
 Prime Minister, although some elements of the opposition contest the legality of the
 election. With the opposition divided, the HCR-PT postponed national elections and
 voted itself a 24-month extension of the transition, which is now scheduled to con-
 clude before July 1997.
 The President's authority continues to rest importantly on his control of key secu-
 rity forces, and the Kengo Government has little control over these forces. The Civil
 Guard and the 15,000-strong Special Presidential Division (DSP) forces remain
 under the tutelage of Mobutu loyalists generals Baramoto Kpama Kpata and
 Nzimbi Ngable, respectively. Both divisions are better disciplined and paid with
 more frequency than the regular armed forces and the gendarmerie. The Civil
 Guard, a police force trained to use police measures as well as methods to combat
 terrorism, to prevent fraud in customs collections, and to maintain order, is inde-
 pendent in structure but has been integrated into the armed forces. Nonetheless,
 members of all the security forces often prey on civilians, generally without official
 rebuke. Undisciplined soldiers continued to commit many criminal infractions, in-
 cluding robbery, extortion, and looting on a daily basis. Members of the security
 forces also committed numerous serious human rights abuses. Despite initial skep-
 ticism, there has been high praise for the performance of close to 1,500 DSP troops
 policing the Rwandan refugee camps for most of 1995.
 The modern sector of the economy has collapsed since 1991, and many parts of
 the country have returned to barter systems in lieu of monetary exchanges. Civil
 servants and military have gone without pay for periods of many months. Subsist-
 ence agriculture is the mainstay of the economy and permits the country to survive
 the lengthy crisis. Industry remains largely crippled. Lack of new investment, poor
 roads and other facilities, and corruption-which affects all segments of the econ-
 omy-have contributed to the decline, especially in the once highly profitable mining
 and minerals sector. Diamonds and offshore oil revenues constitute the country's
 major source of foreign currency. The Kengo Government made some headway in
 
 
 288
 restructuring the financial sector-including halting the massive importation of ille-
 gally produced Zairian currency, which was a major impetus to wild inflation and
 currency depreciation in 1994-and slowing the decline in the value of the national
 currency in 1995. Also the Government succeeded in presenting a national budget
 in December 1994 for the first time in 3 years.
 Amid a general atmosphere of economic and personal insecurity, the Government
 continued to tolerate and commit serious human rights abuses. Large scale military
 pillaging abated as the Government occasionally met military payrolls; however,
 with the President in ultimate control, the security forces continued to commit nu-
 merous human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and arbitrary
 detention. In general, the authorities permitted such acts with impunity. Prison con-
 ditions remain life threatening. Citizens have never been able to vote to change
 their government in multiparty elections. While there was some increase in freedom
 of expression, including a proliferation of independent newspapers, pro-Mobutu
 forces sought to limit freedom of speech and the press, and military and civilian se-
 curity forces regularly detained or arrested journalists, editors, and even newspaper
 vendors. The authorities permitted some political demonstrations to proceed
 unhindered, but in many others the police intervened with threats, bullets, deten-
 tions, and, in one instance, with lethal force. The judicial system is not independent
 and continued to be plagued by corruption, lack of due process, and many other
 problems; it remained ineffective as a deterrent or corrective force to human rights
 abuses. Security forces continued to violate citizens' right to privacy. Ethnic conflict
 in eastern Zaire, exacerbated by the refugee influx from Rwanda and Burundi, re-
 sulted in many civilian deaths.
 RESPErT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Security forces, including police,
 committed many killings during the year. However, given the administrative and
 security breakdown throughout the country and the often anecdotal nature of the
 accounts of these killings, it was often difficult to determine whether political, mone-
 tary, personal, or law enforcement objectives motivated these security force killings.
 Reports often linked killings to random acts of robbery or extortion. For example,
 the local press in Kisangani reported that gendarmes killed as many as 50 people
 during armed robberies in 1 month. Only rarely did the authorities make inquiries
 into such incidents. In the east, ethnic conflict led to many deaths (see Section 1.g.).
 In July, in the most egregious example of extrajudicial killng, Civil Guards used
 lethal force to put down an unauthorized demonstration by the Unified Lumumbast
 Party (PALU) in Kinshasa. Human rights monitors, press reports, and the Keng
 Government state that 4 protesters and 1 soldier died and that 54 others were seri-
 ously wounded. There were clear political objectives involved in the aftermath of the
 demonstration, when the military attacked the home of PALU leader Antoine
 Gizenga and raped and killed a member of his family. The military and the Govern-
 ment launched official inquiries into these incidents but failed to report any results
 by year's end.
 In January government troops used excessive force in repressing striking railroad
 workers, killing one person and wounding several others (see Section 6.a.). No one
 has been named responsible for the killing.
 In Shaba security forces also committed political and extrajudicial killings. Con-
 tinuing a longstanding pattern of conflict between local military leaders and the
 Shaba-based party, the Union of Independent Republicans (UFERI), in March the
 Civil Guard targeted UFERI members and its youth wing on two separate occasions,
 killing three persons. In May uniformed forces disrupted a UFERI party rally, kill-
 ing one protester and wounding four others by gunfire. The military acted on the
 orders of General Mosala and not of anyone in the civilian government in Shaba
 or in the Kengo Government. Both the then Shaba governor, Gabriel Kyungu, and
 General Mosaa were subsequently removed from office in Shaba. In December
 Kyungu was briefly detained in Lubumbashi after a march by his party, UFERI,
 was banned by the acting governor.
 In several cases, notably in the country's interior, citizens responded to military
 aggression in kind, sometimes killing soldiers. In Kitwit, for example, residents
 lynched a soldier who had moments earlier murdered a civilian. In one instance,
 PALU activists murdered a soldier who was trying to block their demonstration.
 b. Disappearance.-There were several reports of disappearances; however, some
 of these instances may have been criminal, rather than political, in nature. Security
 forces regularly hold alleged suspects in secret detention for varying periods of time
 before acknowledging that they are actually in custody. The most frequent accounts
 
 
 289
 of disappearances are those perpetrated by unidentified assailants who abduct,
 threaten, and often beat their victims before releasing them. Journalists and opposi-
 tion party members claim that they are targets for such actions. Patrick Shotsha
 On'Oto, a youth leader who had been periodically harassed by uniformed personnel
 since participating in the 1992 Christian students' march, disappeared in April after
 giving a lecture on the role young people should play in elections. His whereabouts
 remained unknown at year's end.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law forbids torture, security forces and prison officials regularly dis-
 regard this prohibition. They often beat prisoners in the process of arresting or in-
 terrogating them. Several released prisoners claim to have been struck, kicked,
 whipped, and suspended upside down for long periods of time. After being beaten
 while in military custody, a prisoner from Kinshasa's Camp Tshatshi was hospital-
 ized for abdominal hemorrhaging In April four of General Bosembo's security
 a  rehended Dr. Muema-*goy Toka, a member of the Democratic Social
 Christian  arty(PDSC), and bat him severely before the general authorized his re-
 lease. The au  orities including the judiciary, rarely investigate claims of torture,
 despite their prevalence.
 Conditions in most of Zaire's known 220 prisons and places of detention remain
 life threatening. The central Government does not assume responsibility for furnish-
 ing prisons with food or medical supplies. Prison facilities are grossly inadequate;
 living conditions are harsh and unsanitary, and prisoners are poorly treated. The
 system is marked by severe shortages of funds, medical facilities, food, and trained
 personnel. Overcrowding and corruption are widespread. Reports of prisoners being
 tortured, beaten to death, deprived of food and water, or dying of starvation are
 common. Many prisoners are wholly dependent on family and frends for their sur-
 vival.
 Inmates at Makala Central Prison in Kinshasa sleep on the floor without bedding
 and have no access to sanitation, potable water, or adequate health care. Even in
 Makala's best-equipped ward, 114 white collar criminals share one latrine. Tuber-
 culosis, red diarrhea, and other infectious diseases are rampant. Although authori-
 ties have not targeted women for abuse, rape does occur. Of the 45 women in
 Makaia Prison in July, 6 were accompanied by children under the age of 5 years.
 Political prisoners are held in a separate ward and  allowed little, if any, contact
 with prison visitors.
 On December 27, the Minister of Justice issued an order prohibiting government
 officials and soldiers from imprisoning peaple in 25 of the 73 detention centers in
 the region of Kinshasa. The decision was based on a judicial commission's report
 that these 25 faciities were in 'an advanced state of unhealthiness incompatible
 with human dignity." Makala Central Prison was not listed among the 25 prisons
 which should no longer be used
 The International Committee of the Red Crss (ICRC), religious organizations,
 and a handful f local hum anihts oranizations report that they have regular ac-
 cess to prisons nationwide. In some cases, however, the Government's unpublicized
 creation of unofficial detention sites circumvents their access.
 d Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the law, serious offenses, punish-
 able by more than 6 months' imprisonment, do not require a warrant for a suspect's
 arrest. Only a law enforcement officer with ajudicial police officer" status is empow-
 ered to authorize arrest. This status is also vested in senior officers of each of the
 security services. The law instructs security forces to bring detainees to the police
 within 24 hours. The law also prvids that detainees must be charged within 24
 hours and be brought within 48 hours before a magistrate, who may authorize pro-
 visional detention or varying renewable periods.
 In practice, these provisions are rarely followed. Gndarmes and Civil Guards
 cemmony detain civilians without any legal authority, and the security forces--es-
 peciaily those carrying out the Presidents directives or those of any other official
 with authority-use arbitrary arrests to intimidate outspoken opponents and jour-
 nalists. The military and security are controlled by the President. Charges are rare-
 ly filed, obscuring the precise motive for political arrests. When the authorities actu-
 ally do press charges, the claims are often trumped up or dredged out of the ar-
 chives of colonial regulations.
 In February DSP forces arrested Bab ye Mweni on questionable charges of dia-
 mond embezzlement. Credible reports indicate that the warrant for his arrest was
 signed by President Mobutu's son, Manda, who is not vested with such authority.
 In March DSP agents arrested Bobo's arents and sisters and held the family for
 several months. In the case of PAL   leader Antoine Gizenga, the Government
 charged him with violating a 1959 colonial ordinance banning political demonstra-
 tions without a permit. In another highly publicized case, the authorities arrested
 
 
 290
 two union leaders, Okitalombo Pena Ngongo and Mbelu Tshimanga, on spurious
 charges of defamation and denied them a preliminary hearing, they were held with-
 out trial for almost 2 months, and then released without charge.
 Political detainees are typically held incommunicado, with irregular or no access
 to legal counsel sometimes held in unofficial detention sites. Opposition newspaper
 journalist Essolomwa Nkoy's detention of several days at the Tshatshi military
 cam p for an article accusing top generals of corruption was characteristic of this
 kind of detention. In another politically motivated incident, police assaulted and de-
 tained acting UFERI party regional head Astrid Tshikung and others for several
 hours in June.
 Corrupt local officials often use detention as a means of extortion, arresting people
 on fabricated charges, releasing them only after payment of a "fine." In July civilian
 intelligence officers in Lubumbashi illegally detained an American human rights ac-
 tivist and a British citizen. The American was released 1 day later, but the British
 citizen spent 5 days in custody, while the officers attempted to extort $5,000 for his
 release.
 Of the 920 detainees accounted for in Makala Prison in July, more than 70 per-
 cent had yet to come before a judge, although many of them had spent as long as
 2 years behind prison walls.
 The Transitional Act specifically forbids exile, and there were no known cases.
 e. Denial of Fair Public 7a.--Despite constitutional provisions, the judiciary is
 not independent of the executive branch, and the latter often manipulates it.
 Zaire's Civil and Criminal Codes are based on Belgian and customary law. The
 legal system includes lower courts, appellate courts, the Supreme Court, and the
 Court of State Security. There is a system of separate military tribunals with an
 appeals structure that parallels that of civilian courts. Decisions from the military
 tribunals may be appealed to the Supreme Court. Charges of misconduct against
 senior government officials must be filed directly with the Supreme Court.
 The Transitional Act provides for the right to a speedy public trial, the presump-
 tion of innocence, and legal counsel at all stages of proceedings. Defendants have
 the right to appeal in all cases except those involving national security, armed rob-
 bery, and smuggling, which are adjudicated by the Court of State Security. The law
 provides for court-appointed counsel at state expense in capital cases, in all proceed-
 ings before the Supreme Court, and in other cases when requested by the court.
 Ipractice, the authorities frequently ignore these protections. Adherence to es-
 tablished legal procedures varies considerably, and fir public trial is rare, espe-
 cially for critics of the Mobutu forces as in the case of the two Le Point editors (see
 Section 2.a.). Corruption is pervasive, particularly among magistrates who are poor-
 ly paid and poorly trained, and the entire judicial system is further hobbled by
 soes of personnel, essential supplies, and infrastructure. Many defendants
 never meet their counsel or do so only after months of detention and interrogation.
 Most cases are heard only when the defendant or plaintiff pay all court costs, in-
 cluding salaries, a situation which encourages corruption.
 Judicial officials sent to remote areas in the country in some cases either refused
 to assume their posts or fled from them in ethnic purification campaigns, particu-
 lariy in Maniema and Shaba. As a result, local authorities usurped judicial proceed-
 ingsin some parts of the country.
 Tere are no reliable statistics on the number of political pisners in Zaire, but
 the trend of incarcerating people for their political views in 1995 was definitely
 downward compared to past years. On Decenmber 26, the authorities released Kabila
 Kakule, a translator at the National Library, who had been jailed for translating
 National Conference documents into national languages.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.--Security
 forces routinely ignore the Transitional Act's prvision for the inviolability of the
 home and of private correspondence. They ignore h   requirement for a search war-
 rant, entering and searching homes at will. In March gendarmes in Lilangi per-
 petrated a villagwide house-by-house pillage while detaining homeowners in the
 local prison. In Apr approximately 60 Civil Guards besieged the home of the sus-
 pended head of the national customs office in Kinshasa where they stle money and
 personal belongings. Security forces looted Antoine Gizenga's home following
 PALU's July 29 demonstration (see Section l.a.).
 The threat of rape, sometimes perpetrated by uniformed persons, restricts the
 freedom of movement at night for women in some neighborhoods. Groups of citizens
 have implemented neighborhood watch programs, but women in many parts of
 Kinshaa do not leave their homes at night.
 The DSP has also been used to intimidate private businesses for the commercial
 gain of individuals. For example, the DSP intervened in a private commercial dis-
 pute between a foreign-owned company and a local competitor firm owned by one
 
 
 291
 of Mobutu's closest associates. The Kengo Government strongly supports the con-
 tractual riots of foreign investors and has sought, unsuccessfully in most cases, to
 curtail arbitrar interference by elements of the military, as in this case. Uniformed
 personnel routinely interfere with daily economic activities, especially those that
 take place outside formal channels. Currency vendors are particularly at risk and
 remain subject to repeated robberies by uniformed assailants. In June soldiers in
 Kinshasa looted a makeshift market before burning it down and chasing sellers
 from the area.
 Citizens are free to join or refrain from participatingin any political party. How-
 ever, opposition party members often complain that they are followed or harassed
 by troops loyal to the President. Citizens widely assume that the Government mon-
 itors mail and telephone communications.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 fiicts.-Etnic clashes, notably in the Masisi area of eastern Zaire, led to many
 human rights abuses, despite the June deployment of Zairian troops to the region.
 In early July, 85 people were killed when fighting again erupted between the
 Banyarwanda, immigrants of Rwandan origin, and indigenous ethnic groups. The
 1994 influx of refugees and former Rwandan soldiers aggravated the longstanding
 conflict between these Zairian groups. Also, ambiguities in Banyarwanda legal sta-
 tus, caused by conflicting laws that bestow and then revoke citizenship, further in-
 flamed tensions, especially with the prospect of multiparty elections.
 In contrast, the situation improved in Shaba province when Governor Gabriel
 Kyungu wa Kumwanza's overt campaign against Kasains living in Shaba ended; he
 was suspended from office indefinitely in May. By July nongovernmental organiza-
 tions (NGO's) and other donor agencies had resettled the last groups of displaced
 Kasains who had been forced to flee Shaba.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Transitional Act provides for freedom of ex-
 pression as a fundamental civil right. While the press and the public are able more
 openly to exercise freedom of expression than before the transition began in 1990,
 in practice the Government-notably those elements loyal to the President---contin-
 ues arbitrarily to intimidate, harass, and detain journalists and other media officials
 for publishing controversial pieces. Newspaper publishers are required to deposit
 copies of each issue with the Ministry of Information prior to publication. In Decem-
 ber the Parliament passed a new press law after consultations with media rep-
 resentatives, but the President had not signed it by the end of the year, and' it ap-
 peared he would send it back to Parliament for reconsideration. While the proposed
 law deals mainly with media administrative issues, it would also codify the law in
 libel cases and require journalists to reveal sources "when required by the law."
 In April the Attorney General ordered the arrest of two Le Point editors,
 Belmonde Magloire Missinhou and Mazangu Mbuilu, for publishing an article criti-
 cal of the judiciary. They were held in preventive detention for 2 months and then
 sentenced to an additional 7 months in prison. They were released in December.
 Also in April, the authorities arrested a Kin-Matin journalist for his article denounc-
 ing the introduction of new currency denominations of 1,000 and 5,000 New Zaire
 notes. In some cases, government and military authorities target media reporters
 and officials for extortion purposes.
 The principal means of communication with the public are radio and television,
 both of which remain under presidential control. The Ministry of Information sus-
 pended four television reporters for refusing to broadcast a message for Mobutu's
 political party, the Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR).
 In principle, academic freedom is provided for in the Transitional Act. However,
 in the past when teachers have organized to protest their salaries and working con-
 ditions, they have sometimes been met with repression.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Transitional Act upholds
 the right to assemble but subsumes the full exercise of this right to the maintenance
 of 'public order." The Government requires all organizers to apply for permits which
 are granted or rejected at its discretion. In some cases, the Government uses the
 issuance of permits to discriminate against political opponents and has revived a
 1959 colonial ordinance to justify banning public meetings. However, the Govern-
 ment did allow several groups, including the radical opposition, to hold several large
 gatherings, the last one on August 6, and on that occasion security forces displayed
 discipline.
 Nevertheless, in other instances security forces repressed unauthorized political
 and other demonstrations, sometimes violently (see Section L.a.). In March, for ex-
 ample, when civil servants marched to protest 8 to 12 months of salary arrears, se-
 curity forces arrested 34 protesters, detaining them for 7 days. While several reports
 
 
 292
 of the July 29 killing of 14 PALU demonstrators by Civil Guard forces maintain that
 the PALU supporters were violent, throwing stones and killing a soldier, the mili-
 tary demonstrated again its inability to effect crowd control consistently without re-
 sort to excessive use of force.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Transitional Act provides for freedom of religion, and
 the Government respects this provision in practice, with the reservation that the ex-
 pression of this right neither disturb public order nor contradict commonly held
 morals, There is no legally established or favored church or religion. A 1971 law reg-
 ulating religious organizations grants civil servants the power to establish or dis-
 solve religious groups. Although this law restricts the process for official recognition,
 officially recognized religions are free to establish places of worship and to train
 clergy. Most recognized churches have external ties, and foreign nationals are al-
 lowed to proselytize. The Government generally does not interfere with foreign mis-
 sionaries.
 There has been no further known persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses, who have
 been permitted to construct a headquarters in Kinshasa.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Transitional Act allows for freedom of movement, but the Govern-
 ment, and in particular the security forces acting independently, restrict this free-
 dom. All citizens, refugees and permanent residents must carry identity cards. Secu-
 rity forces erect checkpoints on major roads to inspect vehicle papers, usually to ex-
 tort money from travelers at airports, ferry ports, and roadblocks. In November
 Prime Minister Kengo dismissed 100 gendarmes accused of harassing motorists, al-
 though his efforts did little to curb the security forces' widespread extortion. Pass-
 ports and exit permits are available in principle to all citizens but often at exorbi-
 tant cost from corrupt officials. Women must have the permission of their husbands
 to apply for a passport (see Section 5).
 Zaire continues to house some 750,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees along its densely
 populated eastern border. It cperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR) who estimates that there are approximately 120,000 Burundi Huts
 refugees located in the same area. Extreme regional insecurity prompted the United
 Nations and donor nations to request a neutral military presence in the camps.
 With no international response forthcoming, they authorized in December 1994 a
 ontingent of Zairian specl forces to take on the task. At yearis end, the second
 contingent of 1,500 Zairian Camp Security Contingent troops from the Special Presi-
 dentia Division continued to perform their duty well, and, according to the UNHCR
 and other U.!. agencies, the security situation has improved, although serious ob-
 stacles remained. Cross-border violence has rendered the overall refugee security
 situation even more unstable, and refugees are subject to extortion, robbery, and
 sexual abuse. There have been abuses by both the former Rwandan military and
 civilian refugees in the camps. The Kengo Government agreed to remove intimida-
 tors in the refugee camps in late December.
 In a July visit to the region, Prime Minister Kengo announced that the refugees
 in the Kivu provinces must return home. On August 19, the Zairian army started
 forced repatriation of Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees declaring that Zaire
 was bearing the weight of the presence of these refugees on its territory and that
 the Government of Rwanda had done nothing to create conditions inside Rwanda
 to allow the refugees to return to their homes. Following a commitment from the
 UNHCR to reinvigorate organized voluntary repatriation, the Government sus-
 pended forced repatriation on August 24 but stated that Zaire retains the right to
 resume forced expulsions if the UNHCR fails to make sufficient progress through
 voluntary repatriation. More than 14,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees had
 been forcibly repatriated prior to the August suspension. In November, after again
 threatening to expel refugees by December 31, the Government agreed to allow refu-
 gees to remain, provided regional efforts were made to facilitate their return.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Transitional Act mandates the right of citizens to change their government,
 but Zairians have never been able to exercise this right and vote in multiparty elec-
 tions. President Mobutu continued to impede democratic progress by exercising con-
 trol over key parts of the state apparatus, especially the military, and by coopting
 factions of the political opposition, often with spurious promises.  the process, the
 President exacerbated party maneuvering and political posturing in the Transitional
 Parliament (HCR-PT) and stimulated Tshisekedi's and the radical opposition's in-
 transigence in Parliament. Already by July the divided HCR-PT had extended its
 own mandate and postponed elections for 2 more years.
 
 
 Despite these impediments, the Parliament passed implementing legislation es-
 tablishing a National Electoral Commission (NEC) to conduct a nationwide census,
 register voters, publish a list of candidates, and supervise eventual elections. On
 January 1, 1996, the HCR-PT broke the deadlock over the question of the NEC
 membership.
 Initially, the President refused to sign legislation aimed at decentralizing govern-
 ment and reorganizing provincial civil affairs. The HCR-PT sent another version of
 the legislation to the President in late November, and he signed it on December 20.
 There is no official discrimination against the participation of women or minori-
 ties in politics. However, there are few women in senior positions in the Government
 or in political parties. At the Fourth World Conference on Women, the Minister of
 Health and Family, Mrs. Florentine Fwani Eyenga, cited the low level of political
 participation of women in Zaire as a major problem. Only a few women are in the
 728-member Transitional Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While the Government rarely responds to human rights accusations, it permits a
 number of effective nongovernmental human rights organizations to operate, includ-
 ing the Zairian Association for the Defense of Human Rights (AZADHO) and the
 Voice of the Voiceless (VSV). Both organizations investigate and publish their find-
 ings on human rights cases, largely without government restriction. The Govern-
 ment acknowledged AZADHO's 1994 report of human rights abuses, although it
 quibbled with the group's figures. However, the security forces continued occasion-
 ally to harass and intimidate human rights monitors. In April military security
 forces apprehended and intimidated one of AZADHO's secretaries. In July, in two
 separate incidents, security agents harassed members of another Kinshasa-based
 human rights group. The Government permits international organizations to visit
 and discuss abuses; the ICRC is allowed to visit prisons on a regular basis.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Transitional Act forbids discrimination based on ethnicity, sex, or religious
 affiliation, but the Government has made little headway in advancing these provi-
 sions. Societal discrimination remains an obstacle to the advancement of certain
 groups, particularly women and the Pygmy (Batwa) ethnic group.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women, including rape, is believed to be com-
 mon, but, there are no known government or NGO statistics on the extent of this
 violence. Rape is a crime in Zaire, but the press rarely prints articles about 'a rape"
 or violence toward women or children. When the press reports on a rape, it is gen-
 erally as a consequence of some other crime, but rarely because of the act of rape
 itself. Rarely, are the police involved in domestic disputes, and local NGO's dealing
 with women's issues state that they have not heard of any court cases in 1995 in
 Kinshasa involving rape or spousal abuse.
 Despite constitutional provisions, women are relegated to a secondary role in soci-
 ety. They remain the primary agicultural laborers, small-scale traders, and vendors
 and are exclusively responsible for childrearing. In the nontraditional sector, women
 commonly receive less pay for comparable work. Only rarely do they occupy posi-
 tions of authority or high responsibility. They also tend to receive less education
 than men. Women are required by law to obtain their spouse's permission before
 engaging in routine legal transactions, such as selling or renting real estate, open-
 ini a bank account, accepting employment, or applying for a passport (see Section
 A 1987 revision of the Family Code permits a widow to inherit her husband's
 property, to control her own property, and to receive a property settlement in the
 event of divorce. In practice, women are repeatedly denied these rights. Widows are
 commonly stripped of all possessions-as well as their dependent children-by the
 deceased husband's family. Human rights groups and church organizations are
 working to combat this custom, but there is generally no government intervention
 or legaI recourse. Women also are denied custody of their children in divorce cases,
 but they retain the right to visit them. Polygyny is practiced although it is illegal.
 Children resulting from polygynous unions are legally recognized, but only the first
 wife is legally recognized as a spouse.
 Children.-Government spending on children's programs is nearly nonexistent.
 Most schools, for example, only function in areas where parents have formed co-
 operatives to pay teachers' salaries.
 There are no documented cases in which security forces or others target children
 for specific abuse, although children suffer from the same conditions of generalized
 
 
 294
 social disorder and widespread disregard for human rigits that affect society as a
 whole. These conditions sometimes render parents unable to meet their children's
 basic human needs.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is not widespread, but
 it is practiced on young girls among isolated groups in the north.
 People With Disabilhties.-The law does not mandate accessibility to buildings or
 government services for the disabled. Special schools, many with missionary staff,
 use private funds and limited public support to provide education and vocational
 training to blind and physically disabled students.
 Indigenous People. Societal discrimination ontinues against Zaire's Pygmy
 (Batwa) population of between 6,000 and 10,000. Although citizens, Pygmies living
 in remote areas take no part in the political process.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Zaire's population of abut 40 million in-
 cludes over 200 separate ethnic gups. Four i  genous languages have national
 status. French is the language o-government, ommerce, and education. Members
 of President Mobutu's Ngbandi ethnic group are disproportionately represented at
 the highest levels of the military and intelligence services.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Transitional Act and other legislation permit all
 workers except magistrates and military personnel to form and join trade unions.
 Before 1990, the law required all trade unions to affiliate with the National Union
 of Zairian Workers (UNTZA) the singl e legally recognized labor confederation which
 formed part of Mobutu's MkR party. When political pluralism was permitted in
 April 1990, the UNTZA disaffiliated itself from the MPR and reorganized under new
 leadership chosen through elections deemed fair by outside observers. Although the
 UNTZA remains the largest union organization, almost 100 other independent labor
 unions are now registered with the Labor Ministry. Some of these are affiliated with
 political parties or associated with a single industry or geographic area.
 The Government recognizes the right to strike; however, legal strikes rarely occur
 since the law requires prior resort to lengthy mandatory arbitration and appeal pro-
 cedures. Labor unions have not been able to defend effectively the rights of workers
 in the deteriorating economic environment. In January government troops repressed
 striking railroad workers, killing one and wounding several others (see Section L.a.).
 In March the authorities arrested and detained for 7 days 31 civil servants and 3
 organizers during a demonstration in protest of months of salary arrears. Many civil
 servants have remained on strike since then. General strikes, often called by politi-
 cal parties and not necessarily organized by unions, do occur despite their illegality.
 The law prohibits employers or the Government from retaliating against strikers,
 but it is rarely enforced.
 In November the International Labor Organization Committee on Freedom of As-
 sociation (CFA) cited Zaire for serious violations of the principles of freedom of asso-
 ciation on the basis of complaintsasing from events between mid-1993 and March
 1995. The CFA expressed deep. concern about "arrests, detentions, and torture of
 trade unionists, acts of repression against demonstrators, the hampering of trade
 union activities, and acts of antiunion discrimination, inc uding the disissal of offi-
 cials, prohibition of union meetings in the health services, refusal to register trade
 unions, creation of trade unions by the authorities, and the Government's refusal
 to negotiate with representative trade unions." The CFA regretted the Government's
 failure to respond to these allegations and called on it to make restitution where
 possible and to desist from such actions in the future.
 Unions may affiliate with international bodies. The UNTZA participates in the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity, and the Central Union of Zaire is affili-
 ated with the World Confederation of Labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to bargain collectively, and an agreement between the UNTZA and the employers
 association provided for wages and prices to be negotiated jointly each year under
 minimal government supervision. This system, which functioned until 1991, broke
 down as a result of the rapid depreciation of the currency. While collective bargain-
 ing still exists in theory, continuing hyperinflation has encouraged a return to pay
 rates individually arranged between employers and employees.
 The collapse of the formal economy has also resulted in a decline in the influence
 of unions, a tendency to ignore existing labor regulations, and a buyer's market for
 labor. The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, although this regulation
 is not strongly enforced by the Ministry of Labor. The law also requires employers
 to reinstate workers fired for union activities. In the public sector, the Government
 sets wages by decree; public sector unions act only in an informal advisory capacity.

 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and such labor is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 18 years. Employers may legally hire minors 14 years of age and older
 with the consent of a parent or guardian, but those under 16 years may work a
 maximum of 4 hours per day; youth between 16 and 18 years may work up to 8
 hours. Employment of children of all ages is common in the informal economic sec-
 tor and in subsistence agriculture. Neither the Ministry of Labor, which is respon-
 sible for enforcement, nor the labor unions make an effort to enforce child labor
 laws. Larger enterprises do not commonly exploit child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Most citizens are engaged in subsistence agri-
 culture or commerce outside the formal wage sector. The minimum wage, last ad-
 justed by government decree in 1990, is irrelevant due to rapid inflation. Most work-
 ers rely on the extended family and informal economic activity to survive.
 The maximum legal workweek (excluding voluntary overtime) is 48 hours. One
 24-hour rest period is required every 7 days. The Labor Code specifies health and
 safety standards, and, while the Ministry of Labor is officially charged with enforc-
 ing these standards, its efforts to do so remained insufficient. There are no provi-
 sions in the Labor Code permitting workers to remove themselves from dangerous
 work situations without penalty.
