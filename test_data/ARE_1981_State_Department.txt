 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven
 small traditional Arab Shaykhdoms formed in 1971 when
 Great Britain relinquished its 150-year-old special treaty
 relationship with their rulers. The emirates are unequal
 in size, population, natural resources, and economic
 development. Abu Dhabi, the largest and wealthiest, plays
 a predominant role in the federation. under Abu Dhabi's
 ruler, Shaykh Zayid, who also is president of the UAE,
 there has been considerable progress toward formation of a
 centralized and effective federal government. Neverthe-
 less, individual emirates continue to exercise extensive
 authority over their own economic resources and
 development planning, police, security forces, law courts,
 and social welfare policies.
 The UAE's Islamic and tribal traditions have shaped its
 outlook on political organization and its attitude toward
 human rights. The provisional federal constitution,
 adopted initially for five years and since extended to
 December 1986, contains numerous guarantees of the
 integrity of the person and civil liberties, while
 preserving effective political control in the hands of the
 hereditary ruling families in each emirate. The seven
 rulers (or their deputies) comprise the supreme council,
 which is the UAE's highest executive and legislative
 body. Its chairman, the UAE chief of state, appoints the
 prime minister (currently Shaykh Rashid, vice president of
 the UAE and ruler of Dubai) and his cabinet.
 The UAE is a country of approximately 200,000 citizens
 playing host to 800,000 guest workers and their families.
 Expatriates recruited from other Arab countries, South
 Asia, Western Europe, and the United States make up most
 of the work force, many occupying key managerial,
 professional and technical posts in the public and oil
 sectors. UAE nationals enjoy certain benefits and
 privileges denied to foreign workers, few of whom are
 offered UAE citizenship. This large and diverse foreign
 population is tolerated, however, because its skills and
 labor are essential to the country. Aliens deemed
 security threats or troublemakers are deported swiftly.
 Most foreign workers find high wages and employment
 opportunities which often are unavailable in their
 homelands. Harsh or arbitrary security measures have
 rarely been employed to maintain stability and order in
 the UAE.
 I. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 26 of the provisional constitution prohibits
 torture, and no instances of torture have been reported.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The provisional constitution prohibits cruel or degrading
 treatment. Some emirates, notably Abu Dhabi, apply
 traditional Islamic procedures and penalties in criminal
 cases which are tried in sharia (religious) courts. Other
 emirates have a criminal court system based on European
 models. Some crimes, such as rape and theft, have been
 punished by public flogging, as well as fines and, in the
 case of foreigners, deportation after service of jail
 sentences. Due to an increase in the crime rate, courts
 (1118)
 
 
 1119
 -are handing down stricter sentences. For the first time
 in the federation's history, three expatriate men were
 publicly executed by firing squads in 1981 after being
 found guilty of murder and rape. Death sentences were
 handed down for a man convicted of armed robbery and an
 expatriate couple accused of adultery. The sentences were
 not carried out, and the couple was allowed to leave the
 country. All sentences involving capital punishment must
 be approved by the ruler of the emirate. Theoretically,
 the amputation of a hand for theft can be imposed by the
 sharia courts, but in practice such sentences have been
 commuted to imprisonment and/or deportation. Muslims may
 be lashed for transgression of Islamic laws against
 drinking alcohol and violating the Ramadan fast. In
 addition, during the 1981 Ramadan observance, expatriates
 were cautioned-against drinking or eating in public during
 fasting hours, and were warned that they would face
 penalties or fines, and/or imprisonment, for such
 violations.
 Prison conditions, while not comfortable (due to crowding
 and lack of air conditioning), are tolerable. Prison diet
 and medical care are adequate. Prisoners are allowed
 visits from family members, lawyers and, if foreigners,
 consular representatives. However, some foreign consular
 officials have experienced occasional difficulty in
 receiving permission to visit their citizens detained in
 prison. There are no reports that the authorities condone
 ill-treatment of prisoners or that ill-treatment is common
 either in detention or after transfer to prison.
 c. Disappearances
 No disappearances have been reported in 1980 or 1981.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 UAE law prohibits arrest without warrant, and prolonged
 detention without trial is rare. No instances of arrest
 without warrant or prolonged detention were reported in
 1981.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The UAE courts provide fair and public trials before
 experienced civil or religious judges, drawn mainly from
 other Arab countries. There are no jury trials. The
 accused may be represented by counsel of his choice, but
 no public defender system exists. Crimes and punishments
 are defined by law, and the accused is presumed innocent
 until found guilty. Public access to trials involving
 sensitive security or political issues may be restricted.
 Special labor courts have been established to handle
 disputes between workers and employers.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The provisional constitution guarantees freedom from
 arbitrary search, and presentation of a search warrant
 usually is required before police officals can enter a
 home. In extraordinary circumstances, however, police
 have been known to conduct searches without warrants,
 especially when the government considered that state
 security was involved.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 
 
 1120
 UAE citizens are constitutionally guaranteed freedom of
 speech, communication, religion, and. assembly "within the
 limits of the law." Individual citizens feel free to
 express their views on a wide range of public issues
 without fear of official harassment. Radio and television
 are controlled by the ministry of information and culture
 or by individual emirate governments; and there are also
 several privately-owned newspapers and periodicals. Mild
 criticism of government actions or policies appear in the
 printed media, even in the official press, but
 "irresponsible" opposition to the government is
 discouraged. Newspapers occasionally are suspended if
 they deviate too much from government policy. Visits by
 foreign journalists require ministry of information
 approval. Books, films, and periodicals are subject to
 censorship of material considered pornographic, derogatory
 of the Arabs or of Islam, favorable to Israel, or
 politically subversive. Because of the UAE's loose
 federal structure, material banned from publication or
 distribution in one emirate sometimes appears in another.
 A new press law codifies the powers of censorship, media
 closure, and control of reporting previously held
 informally by the government. There is little indication
 the law has significantly changed government practice,
 which has traditionally influenced media editorial
 decision by quiet guidance rather than forceful edict.
 The one. exception to this occurred in the spring of 1981,
 when the government suspended publication, for one week,
 of two newspapers which had reported extensively on a
 brief, but illegal, strike in the northern emirates.
 The provisional constitution establishes Islam as the
 religion of the state. Non-Muslims, virtually all of whom
 are aliens, may practice their faiths so long as this
 "does not conflict with public policy or violate public
 morals." Although Christian churches and schools are
 officially tolerated and have in the past occasionally
 received financial support from the federation, stricter
 controls are being placed on both. Churches are requested
 to maintain a lower profile than in past years. There are
 restrictions on proselytzing by non-Muslims, and
 conversion from Islam to another religion is forbidden.
 Responding to Islamic fundamentalism, the ministry of
 education has issued a decree which would require greater
 segregation of the sexes and more emphasis on Islamic
 studies in both public and private schools.
 Clubs and other organizations must be licensed by the
 federal or emirate governments. By refusing to issue
 permits, individual emirates have been able to prevent
 gatherings they consider prejudicial to public order.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restraints on freedom of movement within the
 country, although visits to certain areas, e.g., oil
 installations, require prior permission from security
 authorities. Foreign travel and emigration for all
 citizens are unrestricted. The right of return is
 extended to all citizens.
 Though the UAE does not have formalized procedures for
 handling refugees or application for political asylum, it
 has traditionally provided a haven for many people of the
 area who have left their own countries for economic or
 political reasons. During the past year, there has been a
 
 
 1121
 sharp increase in the number of Iranians attempting to
 settle in the UAE, and illegal entry figures have risen
 dramatically as a result.
 The UAE has in the past extended assistance to specific
 groups of refugees on an ad hoc basis and it contributes
 to the UN Relief and Works Agency and the UN High
 Commissioner for Refugees.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are no political parties or movements in the UAE,
 and no provision for their organization in the provisional
 constitution. The federal and local governments are
 founded on tribal traditions of direct access to
 leadership, and consensus decision-making. In one
 emirate--Abu Dhabi--this tradition has now assumed an
 official character through creation of an appointed
 consultative council. At the federal level, there is a
 consultative assembly of forty members selected by the
 rulers of-the seven emirates. It must be consulted on all
 matters of federal legislation presented by the council of
 ministers to the rulers for approval. Sentiment is
 growing in the UAE that some of these representatives
 should be popularly elected.
 Expatriates are expected to refrain from political
 activity that in any way would affect or involve the UAE.
 Most of the labor force is foreign, and labor is not
 permitted to organize. There are no legal provisions for
 the right to strike or to engage in collective
 bargaining. However, when the government announced a.
 1981-82 budget without funds for a civil service pay
 increase, federal workers of national origin in three of
 the northern emirates staged a brief protest strike.
 There was no police action and the strikes ended
 amicably. The federal government later made provision to
 increase the allowance of UAE nationals working for the
 government.
 Foreign workers dare not strike lest they be deported.
 Individual laborers can bring grievances to a conciliation
 committee at the ministry of labor and can expect a fair
 ruling. Due, however, to language barriers and lack of
 knowledge about conciliation/arbitration procedures, many
 laborers do not utilize this facility. The government
 continues to indicate particular concern over the number
 of foreign workers and the conditions of their
 employment. Aware that many laborers from the Asian
 sub-continent have been attracted to the UAE by promises
 of higher wages, and knowing that many have been misled by
 unscrupulous labor agents, the government has tightened up
 considerably on visa procedures. The government has also
 brought up to date a labor law, covering conditions of
 employment, compensation, inspection, and enforcement
 procedures. Thus, while some economic abuse of foreign
 labor continues, it is contrary to government policy,
 which seeks to establish a fair and codified system of
 employment.
 3. Governmental Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged violations of Human Rights
 Sensitive to foreign criticism of its handling of guest
 workers, the UAE government has sought to control the
 inflow of foreign laborers and the conditions under which
 they are employed. No international human rights groups
 have asked to visit the UAE in 1981.

 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 With oil revenues of about $23 billion in 1981, the UAE
 has ample funds for economic and social development. At
 $25,000 a year, the UAE has one of the highest per capita
 incomes in the world and an extensive development
 program. In 1981, inflation was about 21 percent and the
 annual growth rate was above'8 percent.
 The UAE has made a major effort to meet the basic needs of
 its citizens for food, shelter, health care, and
 education. The benefits of such programs are distributed
 unevenly among the emirates, with the wealthier
 oil-exporting emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai generally
 able to provide more and better social services than the
 other five emirates. Education and, increasingly, health
 care and shelter are provided the less wealthy emirates
 through federal government projects, funded principally by
 Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Medical treatment is free to all,
 citizen and foreigner alike. Within the last decade, life
 expectancy for UAE citizens has been increased from 55.4
 years to 62.4 years, due to better health care and
 improved sanitary conditions.
 The rate of population growth has been astounding, from
 10. 8% in 1970 to 12.7% in 1976; most of this increase is
 from the influx of temporary foreign workers. Programs to
 expand the number of low-cost housing units are being
 undertaken by both federal and emirate governments. In
 some emirates, e.g., Abu Dhabi and Dubai, water and
 electricity are also provided residential users at
 subsidized prices. With only limited arable land and
 sparse water resources, the UAE must import most of its
 food and use desalinated water. Citizens, and in some
 cases foreigners, are allowed to buy basic commodities at
 subsidized prices.
 Education is free for all academically qualified children
 -- both citizen and non-citizen -- and compulsory for UAE
 nationals from the ages of six to twelve. Within the last
 two years, there has been an expansion of teacher training
 programs and a massive building program for new schools.
 Over 140 new schools have been completed or are presently
 under construction, bringing the total number of schools
 to 283. Presently, there are 125,000 students, national
 and expatriate, in the United Arab Emirates. Adult
 literacy has increased from 21% in 1968 to 56.3% in 1975.
 The role of women is slowly changing in the UAE, although
 family conservatism and the stil1accepted practice of
 girls marrying in their early teens have prevented many
 women from continuing their education beyond the primary
 level. This, in turn, has limited the role such women can
 play in the economic and cultural life of the country.
 Nevertheless, the government is encouraging young women to
 pursue their education, and women are beginning to find
 jobs in the news media and government offices, as well as
 in health and education.
 The largest economic enterprises are state-owned or
 combine state ownership with private equity
 participation. Otherwise, commerce in the UAE is private
 and free, although subject to laws which ensure that UAE
 nationals share in the country's economic expansion.
 Citizen and non-citizen rights to private property are
 protected.under both sharia and civil law. In accordance
 with both Islamic law and local custom, the right to real
 property is vested in the rulers who, in turn, sell or
 make liberal gifts of the use of land to UAE citizens.
 Citizens also are usually given preferences in the
 issuance of business licenses or the sale of shares in
 public enterprises.
