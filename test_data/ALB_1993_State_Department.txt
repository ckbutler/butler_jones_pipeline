 ALBANIA
 Albania continued to make progress toward establishing a multiparty democra'y
 with legal guarantees of human rights. It installed its first non-Communist Govern-
 ment in free and fair elections in 1992 after 47 years of Communist rule. Parliament
 in 1992 elected Sali Berisha as President for a 5-year term, and Prime Minister
 Aleksander Meksi heads a coalition Government dominated by members of the
 Democratic Party. Pending the adoption of a new constitution, the Law on Major
 Constitutional Provisions continued to serve as a substitute.
 Local police detachments are under the direction of the Ministry of Public Order.
 Instances of police abuse occurred, including the deaths of four persons while in po-
 lice custody. The Rapid Deployment Force (RDF), created in 1992 and also un er
 the Ministry of Public Order, has the authority to use force against public disorder
 terrorist activities, and vandalism, to search homes, businesses and vehicles, and
 to arrest suspects under certain circumstances. The National Intelligence Service
 (ShIK) is the successor to the Sigurimi secret police.
 The Government made substantial progress in moving from a centrally planned
 economy to a market-oriented system. With 97 percent of the land restored to pri-
 vate ownership, crop yields increased by more than 20 percent. The privatization
 of services andtrade expanded greatly, and a liberal investment law was passed to
 encourage foreign investment. inflation was reduced from 200 percent in 1992 to
 about 40 prcnt in 1993. Although 100,000 new jobs were created,unemployment
 still ranged near 35 percent. Industrial production, declining at the beginning of the
 year, began to increase by year's end.
 Parliament in March passed a human rights law which incorporates the basic pro-
 visions of the first articles of the draft constitution providing for the freedom of
 speech, press, assembly, association, and religion. Nonetheless, significant human
 rights problems remained. Incidents of police violence occurred, involving use of ex-
 cessive force (including shootings and beatings) against peaceful protesters and de-
 tainees, and resulting in four eaths. The Government appears not to have pros-
 ecuted those responsible in all cases. The Government restricted freedom of speech
 and press, trying Albanian journalists for defaming public officials and harassing
 foreign journalists for allegedly criticizing Albanian authorities. Freedom of assem-
 bl an    association remained significantly restricted. Ethnic tensions increased
 when Albanian authorities expelled a Greek Orthodoxpriest accused of publicly en-
 dorsing the union of southern Albania with Greece, and Greek authorities retaliated
 by expelling over 25,000 Albanians working legally and illegally in Greece. The eth-
 nic Greek community has complained of discrimination in education and religious
 matters in particular.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of targeted
 political killings in 1993, but in several instances police used excessive force, caus-
 ing death. On May 15, police in Korca shot Romeo Gace while he was attempting
 to evade arrest for suspected theft. He later died. The responsible police officer was
 arrested, charged with willful murder, convicted, and sentenced to 8 years in prison.
 On June 21, police in Fier beat to death a suspect attempting to elude arrest.
 Local and national police authorities released no details of the death and made no
 explanations. On August 15, police in Lushnje reportedly shot and killed a suspect
 while in the process of apprehending him. Authorities have not indicated whether
 investigations or prosecutions of those responsible have been initiated in these
 cases.

 On August 14, 31-year-old David Leka died in Lac after police arrested him and
 beat him fatally for allegedly having injured a police officer with a knife by first
 cutting his nose and then stabbing him in the back. Three police officers were ar-
 rested in connection with his death, although two have since been released. The in-
 vestigation was continuing at year's end. The Albanian Helsinki Committee pro-
 tested these examples of the use of excessive force by police and criticized the Gov-
 ernment for perpetrating an atmosphere that condones the abuse of force. President
 Berisha vowed that police who exceed their authority or violate citizens' rights
 would be held responsible before the law.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported disappearances in 1993.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code prohibits the use of physical or psychological force during criminal
 proceedings andprovides penalties or those found guilty of abuse. Nonetheless,
 there were severa credible reports that police beat suspects while in official custody.
 In a series of incidents, police used excessive force in controlling or detaining dem-
 onstrators. On June 12, police in Tirana and Shkoder entered buildings where mem-
 bers of the Society of Former Owners were engaging in a hunger strike. When the
 strikers refused to leave or accept medical attention, police re ortedly beat many
 of them, including elderly persons, while evicting them. The Helsinki Committee
 protested this use of force.
 On July 30, the Socialist Party held a rally in Tirana which turned into a march
 (not authorized by the original permit) to the main square where they were met by
 regular police units, riot police, and plainclothes officers. While the regular police
 in general acted professionally, some riot police and plainclothes officers allegedly
 mistreated demonstrators after taking them into custody. The Minister of Public
 Order vowed to investigate these charges and take action against those responsible.
 Serious concerns remain about Albanian prisons which became more crowded in
 1993. Of particular concern was the incarceration of minor suspects and convicts
 (under the age of 18) with older inmates and allegations of sexual abuse of minors
 by older prisoners. There are no statutes which define the rights or obligations of
 prisoners or the rules governin  prisoners' behavior. Prisoners have the right to ap-
 eal disciplinary decisions ma e y the guards to the prison director. The Helsinki
 .ttee, which monitors prison conditions and reports on them to its parent or-
 ganization, believes these conditions were not life threatening.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-During the July 30 demonstration in
 Tirana (see Section 1.c.), police made a number of arrests, allegedly singling out
 those shouting antigovernment slogans and not arresting the (equally unauthorized)
 progovernment counterdemonstrators.
 According to the Penal Code, a prosecutor or police officer may order a suspect
 into "custody." Those "in custody" may only leave their residences with the approval
 of the prosecutor. The accused must be informed of the charges against them at the
 time of detention and have the right to legal counsel, which will be appointed free
 of charge if they are unable to afford a private attorney.
 Bail, in the form of money or property, may be required if it is believed the ac-
 cused may not appear for the court hearing. If the prosecutor fears that the accused
 may leave Albania prior to trial or is a danger to society, an arrest is ordered. Many
 suspects remain in jail until their trial date, which, due to the backlog of cases and
 shortage of attorneys, may be up to 3 months.
 Within 24 hours o? the arrest, the police must send a report to the prosecutor on
 the evidence linking the suspect to the crime. The prosecuting attorney has 48 hours
 within which to decide to go to trial or to order the person's release.
 Either the defendant or counsel has the right to appeal the arrest ordered by the
 prosecutor in the court of first instance. The hearing must be held within 7 days
 of the arrest in the presence of the prosecutor, the defendant, and the defense coun-
 sel. There is no appeal of the decision of the court on this matter. The court system
 attempts to follow these procedures as closely as possible, but a severe shortage of
 trained, experienced legal professionals slows down the process considerably.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system comprises the courts of first
 instance (also known as district courts), the court of appeals, and the Court of Cas-
 sation. Each of these courts is divided into three jurisdictions: criminal, civil and
 military. A separate Constitutional Court (also known as the High Court or Su-
 preme Court) can take jurisdiction of any case giving rise to a question of constitu-
 tional interpretation. The Court of Cassation hears appeals from the court of ap-
 peals, while the Constitutional Court reviews only those cases which require inter-
 pretation of the Constitution.
 Parliament has the authority to appoint and dismiss judges on the Constitutional
 Court (nine members) and the Court of Cassation (seven members). The Supreme
 Judicial Council appoints and dismisses all other judges. Judges have a lifetime ap-
 
 
 771
 pointment and may only be relieved of their duties by Parliament (in the case of
 the Constitutional Court and the Court of Cassation) or the Supreme Judicial Coun-
 cil (in the case of other courts) on conviction for a serious crime.
 In 1993 the Supreme Judicial Council continued the process begun in 1992 of re-
 moving Communist-era judges from the bench. For example, in the Tirana court sys-
 tem, only 2 of 26 sitting justices remain from the former Communist regime. Na-
 tionwide, some 70 percent of judges have been replaced since 1991.
 Prosecutors also serve at the pleasure of the Supreme Judicial Council. Many who
 held ranking positions under the previous regme were removed during 1993. Be-
 cause of the rapid turnover of prosecutors and judges and their insufficient experi-
 ence and training, the rule of law and the principle of an independent judiciary are
 not yet firmly established.
 Examinations have been instituted for admission to the faculty of law which pre-
 viously had been based on political influence. However, a legal training course for
 the children of former politicql prisoners has aroused the concern of the Helsinki
 Committee, which argued that the program would not adequately prepare persons
 to work in the judicial system.
 In January a Fier judge was reportedly reprimanded because President Berisha
 disagreed with the judgs decision to dismiss charges of labor agitation against two
 Socialist Party activists. In June Parliament passed a law that would have dis-
 barred 92 lawers who practiced under the Communist regime. The Constitutional
 Court declared it unconstitutional, and the lawyers were reinstated.
 In September the General Prosecutor's office replaced 14 attorneys. Some reports
 claimed they had been fired for political reasons, but most appear to have resigned
 to make more money in lucrative private practice.
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions provides that a trial must be held
 in public, unless it might divulge national security information. If convicted, the ac-
 cused has the right to appeal the decision within 5 days to the court of appeals, and
 again to the Court of Cessation which renders the final verdict.
 The Association of Former Political Prisoners, formed in 1991, seeks redress from
 the Government in the form of assistance with housing and schooling for prisoners'
 children or grandchildren. In January the Parliament pardoned all former political
 prisoners who were not covered under the October 1991 parliamentary decrees over-
 turning the convictions of most political prisoners. In June Parliament approved
 measures designed to move former political prisoners and their families to the to
 of waiting lists for housing and admission to institutions of higher education in Al-
 bania. Former political prisoners will also be eligible for pensions to compensate
 them for the time they spent in prison. According the Helsi Committee, those
 convicted and still serving sentences under pre-March 1992 penal procdures still
 do not yet have the right to appeal their convictions, even though they were con-
 victed without the right to a deense lawyer or the right of subsequent appeal.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Hom, or Corresporndence.-The
 Law on Major Constitutional Provisions does not address these issues, although it
 states that Albania guarantees 'the human rights and fundamental freedoms as ac-
 cepted in international documents." The draft constituticz 3tates that searches may
 only be conducted with court-ordered warrants, and that correspondence may not
 be interfered with, except on grounds of national security. However, a law allowing
 police to enter homes without a warrant in search of illegal weapons remains in ef-
 fect, which the Helsinki Committee has protested. There is no evidence of abuse of
 this law.
 The Communist-dominated parliament, in offie prior to March 1992, approved
 the establishment of the Rapid Deployment Force (RDF), which is authorized to use
 force against a breakdown in order, terrorist activities, vandalism, and arson. At-
 tached to the Ministry of Public Order and also at the disposition of the Council
 of Ministers, the RDF in times of emergency comes  erecommand of the local
 chief of police and the local executive committee chairman (mayor). It has the right,
 among other things, to search residences and businesses, to set up roadblocks, and
 to search vehicles. It is not known to have abused its authority in 1993.
 Plans to open and examine the files of the Sigurimi (the former secret police of
 the Communist regime) were still being considered at year's end. In the meantime,
 these documents remain under the control of the National Intelligence Service
 (ShIK). However, senior government officials have indicated that not all files are in-
 tact and some may have been tampered with in the final days of the Communist
 regime. The drft constitution states that 'no information may be collected on citi-
 zens without their knowledge except on grounds of national security. All citizens
 have the right to examine government files pertaining to them and their activities."
 
 
 772
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law on basic human rights approved by
 a two-thirds majority of Parliament in March, provides for the freedom of speech
 and press, although other laws are used to restrict criticism of the Government. The
 draft constitution prohibits any restrictions on the freedom of speech and press.
 In October Parliament passed a press law which, in its attempt to legislate great-
 er press responsibility, could severely restrict press freedom. The law sets outiarge
 fines for publishing material considered secret or sensitive by the Government, per-
 mits confiscation of printed matter or property by judicial order, and allows for
 criminal punishment under certain circumstances. These circumstances will be de-
 fined in future modifications of the Penal Code. The media and the Albanian Hel-
 sinki Committee denounced the law. Electronic media are to be dealt with in a sepa-
 rate law.
 Opposition parties (with the exception of the Communist party which is banned
 and prohibited from publishing), independent trade unions, and various societies
 and groups publish their own newspapers. Approximately 250 newspapers and mag-
 azines appea' on a regular basis. Liko Vima and Zeri iOmonias, two newspapers
 in the Greek language, are published in southern Albania.
 In practice, freedom of speech, including freedom to criticize the Government and
 government officials, was sometimes restricted. The Government took legal action
 against three Albanian journalists in 1993. Nikola Lesi, editor of the opposition
 newspaper Koha Jone, was tried on charges that he libeled the Chairman of the
 State Control Commission, was found guilty, and fined. Aleksander Frangaj, also at
 the time with Koha Jone, was charged with endangering national security for his
 report on alleged military maneuvers. After a court battle, the Government with-
 drew its allegations. Koha Jone frequently criticized the Government and claimed
 that as a result it was a target of official persecution.
 Idajet Beqiri, Chairman of the National Unity Party and editor of its newspaper
 Kombi, was charged under a 1990 law with "defamation of the office of the Presi-
 dent" for having authored an article calling President Berisha "the killer of Alba-
 nia." On July 12, Beqiri was found guilty and sentenced to 6 months in prison but
 is appealing. Journalists were also allegedly arrested in the course of covering dem-
 onstrations and charged with participating in illegal demonstrations. At least one
 journalist was reportedly beaten while in custody. The Government has also report-
 edly increased the number of financial inspections of opposition newspapers.
 Foreign journalists also encountered difficulties in Albania in 1993. Police de-
 tained an Italian journalist with the newspaper Corriere de Ia Serra in August,
 without filing charges. He had written articles for his newspaper critical of Presi-
 dent Berisha. Only after agreeing to leave the country was he released. The Italian
 Government protested this as improper interference with journalistic freedom. A re-
 porter for Agence France Presse and a Greek journalist and film maker were also
 reportedly harassed by police for "anti-Albaniant or "antigovernment" activities.
 Radio and television remained state monopolies. Albania has one television sta-
 tion, while each major city has its own radio station. Since November 1991, Par-
 liament has exercised direct control over television, delegating some oversight duties
 to an Executive Committee of Radio and Television, which it appoints. The Execu-
 tive Committee, comprised of 11 members from outside Parliament meets occasion-
 ally to review programming and the content of news broadcasts. 6ppositior, critics
 of the Government alleged that television serves the interests of the ruling Demo-
 cratic Party. Some controversial interviews and programs were said not to have
 been aired, reportedly at the request of political and governmental leaders. Local
 radio in southern Albania broadcasts Greek-language programning.
 The Ministry of Education sets a standard course outline for all levels of edu-
 cation. Professors may substitute texts and teach their courscs in whatever manner
 they see fit, within the general guidelines set in Tirana. A Greek studies program
 at the University of Gjirokaster, long a demand of the ethnic Greek cultura organi-
 zation Omonia, began functioning for the 1993-94 academic year.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There are. significant restric-
 tions on the freedom of peaceful assembly and association. Both the Law on Major
 Constitutional Provisions and the draft constitution state that political parties must
 be fully independent from state institutions, including military and security forces,
 but they may not be formed on an ethnic or religious basis. Parties with representa-
 tives in Parliament are eligible for modest government funding.
 In order to hold a public rally, an organization must apply for  permit from local
 authorities and provide copies of all speeches to be delivered and slogans to be used
 in the course of the meeting. Requests for meetings were usually granted, although
 police sometimes required a change of date or venue. When such meetings expanded
 into marches to other (unauthorized) locations, however, they were then deemed ille-
 
 
 773
 tgl. Some public meetings of the opposition Socialist Party were not permitted for
 e sites or times requested. At least 14 men were imprisoned on charges of having
 taken part in unauthorized demonstrations in July and August.
 In July 1992, Parliament passed a law banning all "Fascist racist, antinational,
 Marxist-Leninist, Enverist (followers of former dictator Enver Hoxha) and Stalinist"
 parties, including the Communist party. The Constitutional Court upheld the prohi-
 bition of the Communist party, and the draft constitution continues this ban.
 An organization, including a political party, must apply to the Ministry of Justice
 to be officially certified. It must declare an aim or purpose that is not
 anticonstitutional or contrary to law. It must describe its organizational structure
 and account for all public and private funds it receives. The Constitutional Court
 has upheld prohibitions on organizations which failed to get the necessary govern-
 ment authorization. An anti-Communist group called Vendetta was denied registra-
 tion, allegedly because it favors a violent approach towards retribution against
 former Communists who are now Socialists.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion has been established both in theory
 and practice. The Government legalized the private and public practice of religion
 in 1990. The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions declares Albania to be "a secu-
 lar state" which "respects the freedom of religious faith and creates conditions to
 exercise it." The human rights law passed by Parliament in March also guarantees
 full religious freedom.
 Controversy over a proposed law on religion erupted in early 1993. The law, which
 went through several revisions before being dropped entirely, would have required
 the leaders of the four main religious communities-Muslim, Bektashi, Roman
 Catholic, and Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox-to be Albanian citizens from birth,
 thus necessitating the removal of, inter alia, the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox
 Archbishop, Anastas Janullatos, a Greek citizen.
 Foreign clergy, including Muslim clerics and Christian missionaries, freely carry
 out religious activities. Albanian Muslim clerics are being training in Egypt. A semi-
 nary training priests for the Albanian Autocephalous Church will graduate its first
 class in 1994. Orthodox priests from Greece serve Greek-speaking congregations,
 primarily in southern Albania.
 In June a Greek priest, Archimandrite Chrystostomos, who had been working in
 ethnic Greek areas of southern Albania for aimost a year, was expelled from Albania
 for allegedly engaging in anti-Albanian activities, including publicly calling for the
 union o   a   of southern Albania with Greece. In retaliation, the Greek Govern-
 ment expelled over 25,000 documented and undocumented Albanian workers.
 A secretariat of religions within the Ministry of Culture oversees the activities of
 the religious commumties. Some questions concerning property confiscated by the
 Communist regime from religious organizations have yet to be resolved. In some in-
 stances, the restitution of property would displace thousands of residents from their
 present-day homes located on the religious communities' lands.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no longer any restrictions on freedom of movement within
 the country, and regulations on foreign travel and emigration have been revised.
 Passports are availa le to all citizens, and the practice of limiting them to specific
 countries of destination was abandoned in 1991. Albanian-bern citizens of all foreign
 countries are eligible to apply for dual citizenship.
 As in 1992, thousands of ecnomic emigrants fled Albania, principally overland to
 Greece but also by sea to Italy. The Tirana office of the United Nations High Com-
 missioner for Refugees (UNHR) and the International Organization for Migration
 (IOM) jointly run a program to inform the public of opportunities for legal migration
 to other countries. Responsibility for emigration was assigned in 1993 to a commit-
 tee which works with foreign governments to establish agreements for the legal em-
 ployment of Albanians abroad.
 Although until now there has been no significant influx of refugees into Albania,
 some government officials are concerned about the potential flood of ethnic Albanian
 refugees from Kosovo in Serbia if widespread violence were to break out there. Some
 ethnic Albanians, most of whom fled Kosovo to avoid the draft, came to Albania,
 though exact numbers are not known. Albania also agreed to shelter up to 5,000
 Bosnfan Musims who are in Croatian refugee camps. Some Bosnians did come in
 1993 but then relocated to Turkey.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions and the draft constitution provide
 citizens with the right to change their government "by free, general, equal, direct,
 and secret ballot." International observers judged the national elections in March
 
 
 774
 1992 to have been free and fair. The Democratic Party holds 86 of 140 parliamen.
 tary seats to 38 for the Socialist (former Communist) Party, 7 for the Social Demo-
 cratic Party, 6 for the Democratic Alliance Party, 2 for the Unity for Human Rights
 (ethnic Greek) Party, and 1 for the Republican Party. The next elections are not re.
 quired before 1996. Opposition parties had good access to radio and television and
 were unhindered in publishing their newspapers.
 The law on political parties, passed in early 1992, and the draft constitution bar
 the formation of parties on an ethnic basis. During the campaign for parliamentary
 elections in 1991, Omonia, the national political and cultural organization of the
 ethnic Greek minority, constituting approximately 3 percent of the population, was
 permitted to field candidates. Since that time Omonia leaders have founded the
 Unity for Human Rights Party, which has run candidates in both national and local
 elections. Ethnic Greek candidates in southern Albania won a majority of elected po-
 sitions in parts of three districts (Gjirokaster, Delvine, and Saranda) and manage
 many ethnic Greek communities. There are six ethnic Greek Members of Par-
 liament, two of whom represent the Unity for Human Rights Party.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation of women in politics or gov.
 ernment, although to date few women have competed for elected office, and only
 eight women serve in Parliament, a reflection of the male-dominated society.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Albanian Helsinki Committee, the major human rights watchdog organiza-
 tion, took a very active and public role in defending human rights and remained
 independent of the Democratic Party-led Government. During 1993 it initiated and
 carried out investijgations and issued statements and reports which were critical of
 the Government. The main areas of its focus are the rehabilitation of former politi-
 cal prisoners and the independence of the judiciary and the mass media. The inde-
 pendent Albanian group, the Society for Free Elections and Democratic Culture,
 founded in 1992, shited its interest from elections to democratic institution-building
 and civic education.
 Delegations from the International Helsinki Commission, the Council of Europe,
 and the Office of the High Commissioner for National Minorities of the Conference
 on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) made several visits to Albania in
 1993, during which they conferred with political officials and representatives of the
 ethnic Greek minority and visited prisons, hospitals, and other state facilities. Alba-
 nian government cooperation with the U.N. Human Rights Center continued during
 1993. There were no allegations that the Government penalized or repressed any
 human rights observers or their contacts for their work in Albania.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions does not address women's
 rights. The draft con;titution, however, prohibits any discrimination on the basis of
 sex. Women are not restricted, either in law or in practice, from any occupations,
 although they do not typically rise to the top of their professions. No data are avail-
 able on whether women receive equal pay for equal work. Although women have
 equal access to higher education, they are not accorded full, equa' opportunity and
 treatment with men in their careers, due to the persistence of traditional (male-
 dominated) values. Domestic violence undoubtedly exists, but no statistics are kept.
 Police are seldom called to intervene in cases of family abuse, and women almost
 never bring charges against spouses. "Refleksione," Albania's first nonpolitical wom-
 en's group founded in 1993, worked to raise funds and planned for Albania's first
 shelter and counseling service for abused and battered women. It is also dedicated
 to the strengthening of women's participation in society and to the expansion of
 their legal rights.
 Children.-The Government's commitment to children's rights and welfare is
 based on domestic law and international agreement. The Government makes edu-
 cation mandatory through age 14. Employment of children under this age is legally
 prohibited, although it is clear that, in many rural areas, children under 14 are ac-
 tively involved in agriculture. Special programs of the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Welfare are planned but not yet implemented for disabled children.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-While no recent official statistics exist re-
 garding the size of various ethnic communities in Albania, ethnic Greeks are the
 most organized and receive the most attention and assistance from abroad. Albania
 has a population of approximately 3.3 million. Ethnic Greek leaders believe there
 are about 70,000-80,000 ethnic Greeks in Albania. Vlach (Romanian speaking) lead-
 
 
 ere claim their community numbers close to 300,000, although this is unlikely.
 Small ethnic Macedonian villages exist in the northeast part of the country.
 Two distinct groups of Roma (Gypsies), the Jevg and the Arrixhi (Gabel), reside
 in Albania. The Jevg are more likely to be settled in urban areas and are more inte-
 grated into the Albanian economy than the Arrixhi. The two groups seldom inter-
 many or have any significant contact. Both groups encounter societal discrimina.
 tion, but no specific violence is known to have been directed against them during
 1993.
 CSCE High Commissioner for Minorities Max Van der Stoel visited Albania twice
 in 1993 to investigate the situation of the ethnic Greek minority. In his trip report
 Van der Stoel called Albania's commitment to provide full CSCE rights to ethnic
 Greeks 'real" and stated that the minority does in reality enjoy those rights. How-
 ever, he recommended the creation in the Government of a special office for minor-
 ity questions.
 Greek-language education was the single most important concern of the ethnic
 Greek community in southern Albania. In 1993 the Government met the commu-
 nity's longstanding demands for state-funded, Greek-language education. Seventy-
 three elementary schools (grades one through eight) are open in the areas where
 most ethnic Greeks reside (three southern districts of Gjirkaster, Delvine, and
 Saranda) which now serve more than 4,500 students. A Greek-language high school
 was opened in Gjirokaster and the "Eqerem Cabej" University of Gjirokaster now
 has a department of Greek studies which opened for the 1993-94 academic year.
 The curriculum in these schools is the Albanian state program translated into Greek
 and taught by ethnic Greek Albanian instructors. Ethnic Greeks complained, how-
 ever, that there is no legislation permitting the establishment of private schools.
 Although they have no legal basis, the Government continued to use the term "mi-
 nority zones" to describe the three southern districts in which villages have majori-
 ties of ethnic Greeks. It has had practical application in the area of education. Given
 the Government's severe budgetary problems and the overcrowded and poor condi-
 tions of most Albanian schools, the State has funded Greek-language education only
 in minority zonesb.
 After Albania expelled a Greek priest in June for alleged anti-Albanian activities
 and the Greek Government retaliated by deporting over 25,000 documented and un-
 documented Albanian workers, tensions between ethnic Greeks and Albanians rose
 in southern Albania. The Government ordered the deployment of extra RDF plice
 in ethnic Greek areas to prevent any anti-Greek violence. Occasional reports of beat-
 ing of illegal Albanian workers by Greek military personnel also fueled emotions
 from time to time throughout 1993. In one incident, an ethnic Greek policeman was
 wounded by other policemen. Some ethnic Greeks alleged that ethnic Greek army
 officers were forced to resign under pressure of transfers to the northern part of the
 country, but there was no evidence to support allegations of discriminatory trans-
 fers.
 Viachs continued to demand government-funded education in their language, al-
 though they were less vocal about their demands than in 1992. They also continued
 to seek funds to restore several early 18th-century churches and monasteries that
 have deteriorated over the years. In accordance with an agreement signed in 1992,
 the Macedonian Government funds Macedonian-language education in several vil-
 lags on the Albanian side of the Albanian/Macedonian border.
 Peofle with Disabilites.-In 1993 Parliament approved a law to assist disabled
 World War II veterans. Due to thepaucity and poor quality of medical care under
 the Communist regime, there is a dispreportionately high number of disabled per-
 sons in Albania. Disabled persons are eligible for various forms of public assistance,
 but the level of that assistance is me r. The public care section of the Ministry
 of Labor and Social Welfare is to establish local offices for the treatment and reha-
 biltation of the disabled. The Government has not yet legislated or otherwise man-
 dated accessibility for the disabled due to the relative poverty of the State and the
 population in general.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Rith,1 of Association.-Workers obtained the right to create independent
 trade unions in 1991. The Independent Confederation of Trade Unions of Albania
 (BSPSH) was formed as the umbrella organization for a number of smaller unions.
 A separate, rival federation continued to operate in close cooperation with the So-
 cialist Party. The latter federation-the Confederation of Unions-is a continuation
 of the "official" federation of the Communist period. In 1993 municipal employees
 and workers in such fields as communications and bakeries founded their own inde-
 pendent associations.
 
 
 More than 100,000 Albanians are now employed in the private sector, mostly in
 small shops, enterprises, and restaurants, but they have formed no unions to rep-
 resent them. Some unions have organized to represent workers in Greek- and Ital-
 ian-owned shoe and textile factories.
 According to the Law on Major Constitutional Provisions, all workers, with the
 exception of employees of military enterprises, have the right to strike. The draft
 constitution also fully guarantees the right to strike for economic, safety, or health
 reasons. Strikes that are either openly declared to be political or so judged by the
 courts are forbidden.
 In the depressed economic climate of 1993, labor disputes flared. Early in Janu-
 ary, chromium miners in Bulqize ended a bitter strike demanding that their wages
 be raised to the level of West European miners. After the strike ended, the Govern-
 ment reportedly did not allow 27 miners, including 8 members of the strike commit-
 tee, to return to work. The Albanian Helsinki Committee protested this decision.
 On May 20, the BSPSH staged a 1-hour general strike, which was observed,
 though not uniformly, throughout the country. In response, the Government agreed
 to increase unemployment compensation and wages for some workers. A court de-
 clared a strike planned by oil workers for August 3 illegal because they failed to
 adhere to the legally required 2-week "cooling off period" between calling their
 strike and subsequently walking out. Teachers, who are at the bottom of the "wage
 pyramid' and earn approximately $1 per day, staged a 1-day strike on September
 15, the first day of the new school year. In response, the Government agreed to an
 immediate increase of 10 percent in their wages.
 The BSPSH has observers with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions in Brussels and working ties with the American Federation of Labor-Con-
 gress of Industrial Organizations. Its closest ties at present are with the Italian
 labor unions. Individual Albanian trade unions have ties with their corresponding
 trade secretariats in Brussels and elsewhere.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-All citizens in all fields of em-
 ployment have the right to organize and bargain collectively, except members of the
 armed forces, civilian personnel employed by the armed forces, and employees of
 certain state administrative organs. In practice unions negotiate directly with the
 Government, since very little privatization has occurred outside of the retail and ag-
 ricultural sectors.
 Wages for all state employees are defined by the wage pyramid, legislated in
 1992, which comprises 22 wage levels organized by trade.
 Most large enterprises remain state owned. BSPSH leaders were disappointed
 with the 1993 law on collective agreements and bargaining. They had hoped that
 it would declare their union the lead union at enterprises where more than one
 union is active. President Berisha has called for some revisions to the law to effect
 "improvements pursuant to international acts."
 Export processing zones do not exist in Albania.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Law on Major Constitutional
 Provisions prohibits forced labor, as does the draft constitution. There were no cases
 of forced labor reported in 1993.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Law on Major Constitutional
 Provisions sets the minimum age for employment at 14 years. Persons between the
 ages of 14 and 16 may work only 5 hours per day. Working conditions for those over
 16 are not legislated. Although the law mandates education through the eighth
 grade and prohibits work by those younger that 14, there are no enforcement mech-
 anisms to curb either truancy or child labor. In rural areas, children are often called
 on to assist families with farm work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage in the private sec-
 tor. Current law and the draft constitution guarantee social assistance (income sup-
 port) and unemployment compensation. The average monthly wage for all Albanian
 workers is approximately $30.
 In June Parliament approved shortening the workweek in state-owned enterprises
 to 40 hours. The workweek includes a 24-hour rest period, usually Sunday. The
 Ministry of Labor enforces this law.
 The Government sets occupational health and safety standards but has no funds
 to make improvements in state-owned industry. In a February report, the Albanian
 Helsinki Committee criticized working conditions in the chromium mines at Bulqize.
 The Government called the Bulqize miners' strike "politically motivated" but ac-
 knowledged the need to improve their poor health conditions. In those enterprises
 which are functioning, health and safety conditions are generally very poor.
