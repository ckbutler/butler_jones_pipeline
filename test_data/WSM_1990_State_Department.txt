 WESTERN SAMOA
 Western Samoa is a small Pacific island country located 1,600
 miles northeast of New Zealand. The Constitution adopted at
 independence proclaimed the nation an independent and
 sovereign state based on "Christian principles and Samoan
 customs and tradition," and established a parliamentary
 democracy on the Westminster model but with certain
 concessions to Samoan cultural practices. It provides for a
 Samoan head of state, a unicameral legislature of matai
 (family heads) elected by universal suffrage, an independent
 judiciary, protection of Samoan land and'traditional titles,
 and guarantees of fundamental rights and freedoms. Executive
 authority is vested in the Head of State, with the Government
 administered by a Cabinet, consisting of the Prime Minister
 and eight ministers chosen by the Prime Minister. All
 legislation passed by the Legislative Assembly needs the
 approval of the Head of State before it becomes law. The
 present Head of State, Malietoa Tanumafili II, holds the
 position for life. His successors will be elected by the
 Legislative Assembly for 5-year terms.
 The culture of Western Samoa is essentially Polynesian but
 uniquely Samoan. Traditional authority is vested in the matai
 who is appointed by a consensus of the aiga (extended family)
 or by decision of the fono (council of matai). Ownership of
 land is legally vested in the matai whose responsibility is to
 direct the economic, social, and political affairs of the
 aiga. There are 362 villages in Western Samoa with a total of
 over 25,000 matai (Samoa's population is approximately
 160,000). Each village is governed by a fono, which can fine
 or otherwise punish offenses against village rules. Western
 Samoa does not have any defense force. The small national
 police force is firmly'under the control of the Government but
 has little impact beyond the capital city.
 The economy is primarily agricultural, with limited potential
 for development. It is susceptible to shifts in world prices
 for its export commodities, such as coconut oil. Western
 Samoa is heavily dependent on foreign aid and on remittances
 sent to family members by the approximately 300,000 Samoans
 living abroad in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.
 Western Samoan society is based on a collective value system
 in which obligations and reponsibilities to the aiga are often
 given precedence over individual rights. The rule of law is
 tenuous outside the capital, Apia, and most disagreements are
 settled by decision of the fono (which can include corporal
 punishment, banishment, and destruction of houses).
 Principal human rights concerns arise out of discrimination
 and violence against women; restrictions on fair trial and
 freedom of the press are at least potential problems. The
 Government established a public defender's office and an
 ombudsman's office to help Samoans in their dealings with the
 courts and the Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including

 WESTERN SAMOA
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no instances of politically motivated
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are prohibited by law, and there have been no
 reports of such practices by police or other government
 authorities. However, villages are- controlled by customary
 law, and beatings, stonings, the burning of houses, and other
 traditional punishments are meted out by the fonos on occasion.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile-
 The law contains safeguards against arbitrary arrest and
 preventive detention, and these are observed. At least one
 person was exiled from the country by'a previous prime
 minister.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Western Samoan law assures the right to a fair public trial,
 which is honored by the official court system that is modeled
 on the British system. However, many civil and criminal
 matters'are not handled by the-Western-style courts, but by
 village fonos. The 362 village fonos each have their own
 procedures handed down by oral tradition, and they differ
 considerably both in theje decisionmaking style and in the
 number of matai involved in the decisions. The Village Fono
 Law of 1990 gave legal recognition to the decisions of the
 fono but gave recourse of appeal to the Lands and Titles
 Courts. The Supreme Court has yet to review the law to
 determine whether appeals on constitutional grounds will be
 permitted.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy-, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Samoan laii provides for protection from invasion of the home
 or seizure of property without substantive and procedural
 safeguards, including search warrants. Practically, however,
 there is little or no privacy in the village. Village
 officials by law may not enter homes without permission, but
 there-can be substantial social pressure to grant such
 permission.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Includinq:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press are fundamental parts of
 the Constitution; however, a recent finding of contempt
 against the two major privately owned newspapers may impinge
 on this traditional freedom. The newspapers had alleged a
 conflict of interest by the acting Chief Justice in his
 handling of a case in 1990. The acting Chief Justice reacted
 by fining the two editors involved and jailing one of them.
 The decision was overturned on appeal, and the Government was
 severely chastised by the Appellate Court. In addition to two
 newspapers, the Government recently permitttd a private radio
 station that produces its own news to compete with the
 Government's station.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of peaceful assembly
 and the right to form associations. There are no significant
 restrictions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution, along
 with freedom of thought and conscience. There is no
 government-favored religion. Nearly 100 percent of the
 population is Christian. While the Constitution grants each
 person the right to change religion or belief and to worship
 or teach religion alone or with others, in practice the matai
 often chooses the religious denomination of the aiga. There
 is strong societal pressure to support church leaders and
 projects financially with contributions often totaling more
 than 30 percent of income. Younger Samoans have begun to
 resist these enforced payments.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides for freedom of internal movement and
 resettlement in Western Samoa, but in reality some citizens
 are or have been banished either from village activities or
 completely from the village. Tbis is one of the harshest
 forms of punishment in this collective society. Emigration is
 actively supported by the, Government as a social "safety
 valve" which allows the departure of disenfranchised,
 frustrated, and potentially rebellious youths and because it
 increases foreign income through remittances. Foreign travel
 is generally unrestricted, but there is an exit permit
 requirement which can be denied only because of pending court
 cases or outstanding debts to the Government. The right to
 return is guaranteed.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Samoan citizens have the right to change their government
 through direct, multiparty elections. On October 29, Western
 Samoans voted by a narrow margin to extend universal suffrage
 to all citizens over the age of 21; however, the right to hold
 office is still restricted to matai. Western Samoa is
 governed by a Prime Minister and the Legislative Assembly,
 which are elected every 3 years. Forty-five legislators are
 drawn from the approximately 25,000 matai (virtually all of
 whom are men), and the other 2 seats are filled by citizens
 not of Samoan heritage. While all Samoans may now vote, matai
 continue to control local government through the village
 fono. The matai system is conservative but does allow for
 change. While Samoans must show respect and obedience to
 their matai in family anT communal affairs, the matai have
 well-defined responsibilities which, if not met, can result in
 removal of the matai.
 Western Samoa has only rudimentary political parties. The
 first one, founded in 1982, was the Human Rights Protection
 Party (HRPP); its leader, Tofilau Eti, is currently Prime
 Minister. Although a second party, the Samoan National
 Development Party (SNDP), was formed during 1988, replacing
 the previous Christian Democratic Party founded in 1985, the
 political process in Western Samoa is very much a function of
 personality rather than party. As a result, several previous
 
 
 1079
 WESTERN SAMOA
 governments fell before the end of their prescribed 3-year
 terms when supporters defected to the opposition.
 Section 4 "Governmental.Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no reports of any international or nongovernmental
 investigations of alleged violations of human rights. There
 are no official or private human rights organizations in
 Western Samoa.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Samoa is a homogeneous society with no significant ethnic
 minorities. 'Samoan politics and culture are the product of a
 heritage of chiefly privilege and power, and persons of good
 family have some advantages. There is clear discrimination
 based on social status and sex, with women traditionally
 occupying a subordinate role. The passage of universal
 suffrage and the establishment of a Women's Affairs Ministry
 provide substantial new political rights for women; however,
 their subordinate social position is expected to change only
 gradually.
 Abuse of women,-including wife beating, is believed to be a
 problem, but no reliable data about the extent of it are
 available. As noted above, traditional punishments sometimes
 involve beatingsp this is generally directed more at men than
 women. While abuse of women is prohibited by law, it does
 occur'and is often unreported or ignored. Some view wife
 beating as a'Male prerogative. There are many cases of rape
 that go unreported. The'few convictions generally result in
 light punishment.
 The Constitution makes special provision to preserve the
 political rights of non-Samoans. Persons'of mixed ancestry
 who are culturally Samoan are fulIy accepted and can attain
 positions of considerable wealth and influence. Thirty
 percent"of the members-of Parliament are of mixed ancestry.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Western Samoan workers have complete and unrestricted rights
 to establish and join organizations of their own choosing.
 While trade- unions have not emerged in the private sector, the
 Government does not restrict efforts to develop them. The
 Public Service Association representing government workers, an
 increasingly important sector of the work force, does exist.
 The Supreme Court has upheld the right of government workers
 to strike, subject to certain restrictions imposed principally
 for reasons of public safety. The Public Service Association
 freely maintains relations with international bodies and
 participates in bilateral exchanges. Western Samoa does not
 belong to the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 While workers have the right to engage in collective
 bargaining, there is little practice of this right because of
 the absence of unions in the private sector. However, the
 Public Service Association engages in collective bargaining on
 
 
 1080
 
 WESTERN SAMOA
 behalf of government workers. Arbitration and mediation
 procedures are in place to resolve labor disputes, although
 these rarely arise. Labor law and practice in the one export
 processing zone are the same as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While the Government does not demand compulsory labor and it
 is prohibited by law, in this collective society people are
 frequently called upon to work for their villages. Most
 people do so willingly. If they do not, the matai compel them
 to do the work anyway.
 d. Minimum Age of Employment of Children
 Under the terms of the Labor and Employment Act of 1972 and
 Regulations of 1973, it is illegal to employ children under 15
 years of age except in "safe and light work." The Director of
 Labor refers complaints about illegal child labor to the
 Attorney General for enforcement-. The law does not apply to
 service rendered to the matai, some of whom require children
 to work at what might be considered child labor, primarily on
 village farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of- Work
 The Labor and Employment Act of 1972 and Regulations of 1973
 established for the private sector a 40-hour workweek and a
 minimum wage of $0.35 an hour. This low minimum wage suffices
 for a minimum standard of living when supplemented by the
 subsistence farming and fishing in which most families
 engage. The law also establishes certain rudimentary safety
 and health standards which the Attorney General is responsible
 for enforcing. Independent observers report, however, that
 the safety laws are not strictly enforced except when
 accidents highlight noncompliance. In addition, many
 agricultural workers, among others, are inadequately protected
 from pesticides and other dangerous conditions because of
 limited employer awareness of the hazards. Government
 education. programs are addressing these concerns. The law
 does not apply to service rendered to the matai. Government
 employees are covered under different, more stringent
 regulations, which are adequately enforced.
