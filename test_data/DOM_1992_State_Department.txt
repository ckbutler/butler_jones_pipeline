 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy with a popularly elected
 President and a bicameral Congress. In practice, the system heavily favors the exec-
 utive branch. The Supreme Court heads a nominally independent judiciary whose
 members are appointed by the Senate. Political parties representing the ideological
 spectrum from left to right freely participate in elections. President Joaquin
 Balaguer was inaugurated for a new 4-year term in August 1990.
 The National Police (PN), the National Department of Investigations (DNI), the
 National Drug Control Directorate (DNCD), and the military (Army, Air Force, and
 Navy) form the security services. According to the U.. Arms Control and Disar-
 mament Agency, total military expenditures for 1989 were $52 million. There are
 no plans to reduce these expenditures in the near future. The PN has general inves-
 tigative and principal arrest authority. The military services have investigative and
 general arrest authority for armed forces personnel and can arrest suspects appre-
 hended by military patrols. The armed forces may also intervene in cases involving
 threats to public order or security. The DNI is the principal national investigative
 body for national security concerns and does not have arrest authority. The DNCD,
 a narcotics law enforcement agency formed in 1988, brings under a single authority
 elements of the PN and military services. All security services are under control of
 the Government and are generally responsive to civilian authority, but some mem-
 bers of these organizations were responsible for human rights abuses.
 
 
 Once heavily dependent on sugr, the Dominican economy has grown mom di-
 verse; tourism and export procesmng zones (EPZ's) are now mjor sources of income
 and employment. In 1992 the economy .howed the beneft, of reforms initiated in
 1990: inflation was reduced and a floating exchange rate system eliminated short-
 ages. State-owned firma audh as the State Sugar Council (CEA), the Consortium of
 State Enterprises (CORDE), and the Dominican Electriciy Corporation (CDE) con-
 tinue to be heavily involved in the economy and inefficiencies in the CDE are a
 major impediment to progress. The country h   a $4.5 billion foreign debt, but a
 significant portion of this debt has been reshdued since November 1991, after a
 successful multilateral negotiation with creditors.
 Principal human rights problems in 1992 included incidents of illegal detention
 and beatings (sometimes fatal) of civilian suspects by the Dominican security serv-
 ices, antiunion discrimination in the EPZ's, and abuses of Haitian migrant workers.
 The year 1992 saw no real change in problems with abuse of detainees. However
 there was noticeable improvement in the situation of Haitian migrant workers, and
 a significant step forward in wbrker rights with the passage of a new Labor Code.
 RESPECr FOR MUM RIGIIFS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrqjudicial Killing.-There were no known cases of politi-
 cal killings in 1992.
 During 1992 there were several incidents of nonpolitical extrajudicial killings by
 the police. National Police personnel were discharged and subjected to the civilian
 st ice  s stm  in  connect io  w ith  egtspr eicd ns oalegedly  unjustified
 rez in Barahona in February and the death of attorney Rafael Ortiz in Santo Do-
 ming in September, beth killed by indiscriminate police fire during protest dem-
 onstrations. At least another eight persons may have been killed without provo-
 cation by National Police personnel and a ninth kllng may have resulted from ex-
 cessive force. In all of these cases, the discharged police personnel are reportedly
 awaiting trial, a process likely to take years.
 In Febru, an ex-PN patrolman was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the
 shooting death of a night watchman in September 1989. Human rights groups have
 charged the National Police with "death squad" killings of repeat offenders in ex-
 changes of gunfire. These groups have not provided conclusive evidence to substan-
 tiate the charges. In one March incident eyewitnesses reported that armed persons
 (later identified as undercover police agents) executed a suspect as he lay wounded
 on the ground. Police investigation of this incident concluded that an execution-style
 killing did not take place, but an inquiry into the case continues.
 b. Disappearance.--There were no known cases of politically motivated disappear-
 ances in 1992.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Credible sources report that security services personnel habitually beat detainees
 and prisoners from marginal or lower income backgroundF to extract leads or confes-
 sions. During 1992 three detainees died from beatings suffered while in custody, and
 several others were hospitalized. Although the National Police leadership has stated
 its intent to change police behavior, the institution continues to be marked by low
 salaries, inadequate training, a tradition of relying on confessions rather than sci-
 entific methods to investigate cases, and an unwieldy organizational structure. Simi.
 lar, albeit less publicizedcomplaint have been made about DNCD treatment of
 drug suspects. In March a National Police lieutenant colonel was relieved of his du-
 ties and now faces charges in police court of torturing detainees. Other police per-
 sonnel involved in the above-mentioned deaths and other instances of abuse have
 been discharged and remanded to the civilian court system. To date, there have
 been no reported convictions of security services personnel for physical abuse. After
 complaints of abuse by two detainees in January, the entire DNCD detachment in
 San Francisco de Maoris was tr-ansferred to posts in other p arts of the country.
 Prisons are overcrowded, and health and-sanitary conditions are substandard.
 There are reports of orruption in the prvisioning of food for prisoners, and most
 prisoners fnd it necessary to rely on raives or their own finances in order to be
 fed adequately. Medical care suffers from a lack of supplies. In some instances, mi-
 nors have been incarerated with adults in the general prison population.
 d. Arbita  Arrest, Detention, or Exi.e.-The Constitution stipulates that suspects
 may be detained for a maximum of 48 hours for investigation before arraignment,
 after which they must be charged or released. However, in special circumstances,
 suspects may be detained for longer periods with the approval of the prosecutor's
 office. In 1992 security services officials continued to detain suspects routinely for
 
 
 385
 investigatiou" or "nterrgation" beyond the prescribed 48-hour limit. Indiscrimi-
 nate roundups of people in poorer nei hoods, aimed at fighting crime, contin-
 ued. Although some prres occurred m obtaiing the release from custody of pris-
 oners and detainees who were the subjects of judicial relem orders, the National
 Police and DNCD continued to refluse to release some prisoners and detainees.
 These included 4Ils Lizard Cabrera, the subject of three separate judicial release
 orders since his detention as a suspect in the 1989 bombing of a US.-Dominican
 Binational Center which killed a 1-year-old girl.
 There were no reports of exile of citizens.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The court system includes a Supreme Court, ap-
 pellate court, and courts of the first instance. Judges at all levels are appointed by
 the Senate. Their terms of office correspond roughly to those of the President and
 other elected officials. A newly elected Senate can either replace the judges or recon-
 firm them  and they are subject to removal or transfer by a majority vote in the
 Senate. Although nominally independent of the executive branch, there is concern
 about undue executive branch influence, and that underfunding the courts is a
 means of lessening their autonomy. There continued to be crdible charges that
 some judges and prosecutors accepted bribes to manipulate the outcome of cases.
 The Constitution provides for public trial, and court-appointed lawyers normally
 are provided at *lc expense to indigents in felony criminal cases, but rarely in
 criminal misdemeanor cases. Th~ere are chronic delays in the judicial process. Of the
 approximately 11,000 persons detained in the penal system, only about 10 percent
 have been convicted. Although the right to judicial determination of the legality of
 detention exists, preventive detention of those awaiting trial is legal and commonly
 employed, and many of those accused remain in prison for lengthy periods awaiting
 trial. This practice, coupled with a lack of administrative and/financial support for
 the system, has created a major backlog of cases. Additionally, law enforcement au-
 thorities criticize the judiciary for its allegediy widespread corruption, incompetence,
 and leniency. In turn, members of the judiciary have criticized prosecutors and law
 enforcement personnel for allegedy being corrupt and incompetent.
 There are no special courts for political or national security cases, and civilians
 may not be tried by, a military court. Members of the armed forces and police are
 under the jurisdiction of military or police courts but are frequently remanded to
 the civilian court system after review b y a military/polic board.
 There are no known political prisoners in the Dominican Republic.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspond ence.-There
 were no credible reports of arbitrary governmental interference with the private
 lives of persons or families with one exception pertaining to surveillance noted
 below. Constitutional safeguard against invasion of the home are observed. A resi-
 dence may not be searched except in the presence of a prosecutor or an assistant
 prosecutor, excluding cases of "hot pursuit" or instances where there is probable
 cause to believe that a crime is in progress. A few leaders of groups which engage
 in protest activities and strikes--sometimes violent--have charged that they are
 under surveillance by Dominican security services.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These lierties are provided for by law and are
 respected in practice. Dominicans of all political persuasions enjoy freedom of speech
 and regularily exercise it. The numerous privately owned radio and television sta-
 tions air all political points of view. The Government controls one television station
 and no major newspapers. Dominican newspapers freely reflect independent and op-
 position points of view. Although journalists operate in a relatively tolerant environ-
 ment, reporting and editorializing by some journalists occasionally reflect a certain
 amount of self-censorship. This self-censrs hip results from two factors: the first is
 the small, closed nature of Dominican society where it is difficult to criticize promi-
 nent persons because of the interpersonal relationships that develop; the second is
 the legacy of dictator Rafael Trujillo, whose brutal repression of society and absolute
 control of the media for 30 years rendered sectors of the media circumspect, if not
 at times subservient to the power structure, whoever may be President.
 In February, citing a law prohibiting broadcasts in languages other than Spanish,
 the Dominican Government ordered the cessation of Creole broadcasts by a church-
 run radio station on the Haitian border. The Government justified its action by cit-
 ing fears that the station's activities could be considered an intervention into the
 internal affairs of neighboring Haiti because the broadcasts were aimed at that
 country.
 Public and private universities enjoy brad academic freedom. The main public
 university, the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo, with approximately
 35,000 students, has no restrictions on enrollment and maintains a policy of non-
 
 
 intervention (other than curriculum development) in classroom affairs. Private uni-
 versities are also free from any government control except for the preservation of
 standards, and teachers are free to espouse their own theories without government
 oversight.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Aasodatio-7hese freedoms are provided
 for by the Constitution and are commonly respected in practice. Outdoor public
 marches and meetings require government permits, which are usually granted.
 However, during the 6O0th-anniveraay celebrations of the discovery of America, the
 Government, in the wake of violent protests and faced with the threat of more vio-
 lence, deviated from its usual practice of liberally granting permits and denied sev-
 eral requests aimed at protesting the discovery as well as disturbing the govern-
 ment commemorations of the event. Professional organizations of lawyers, doctors,
 teachers, and others function freely and can maintain relations with counterpart
 international bodies of diverse political philosophies.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Discriminatmn on religious grounds is prohibited by the
 Constitution. There are no religious requirements to lold public office, no restric-
 tions on the practice of religious faiths, and no social discrimination based on reli-
 gion. The Dominican population is predominantly Roman Catholic; several non-
 Catholic faiths have well-established churches in the country. There have been no
 reports of government interference with the free practice of religion.
 d. Freedm of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emisration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no unusual legal restrictions on travel within or outside the
 country for Dominican citizens. In 1992 there were no orders for the forcible repatri-
 ation or expulsion of Haitians, as had occurred in 1991. Charges of forced recruit-
 ment and detention of Haitians to work on sugar plantations have diminished sig-
 nificantly compared to earlier years (see Section 6.c).
 The Dominican Re    blic has a tradition of jgranting asylum to people who fear
 pglitical persecution leturned to their countries. Since the 1991 coup in Haiti, the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has granted refugee sta-
 tus to 242 Haitians who fled to the Dominican Republic after the coup. The Domini-
 can Government cooperated with the UNHCR and respected the status of Haitians
 recognized as refugees by the UNHCR. The Dominican Government is also process-
 ing petitions for Dominican recognition of the refugee status of the UNHCR wards;
 20 Haitians have gained Dominican recognition of their refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy. The President, all 150
 members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, and the mayors and city council-
 men of over 100 municipalities are freely elected every 4 years by secret ballot and
 universal suffrage (except for active duty military and police, who may not vote).
 The President appoints the governors of the 29 provinces. The nation enjoys a func-
 tioning multiparty system. opposition groups of the left, right, and center operate
 openy.
 In practice, the President dominates public policy formulation and implementa-
 tion, exercising his authority through use of the veto, discretion to act by decree
 and influence as the lender of his party. The Congress traditionally has had limited
 powers and seldom disapproves actions by the executive branch, but it does provide
 an open forum for the free exchange of views and debate. The governing party holds
 a majority in the Senate (16 of 30 seats) and has a pluraity (42 of 120 seats) in
 the Chamber of Deputies. There are no legal or practical impediments to women
 and minorities participating in politics.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental human rights organizations operate freely without government
 interference. They include the Domincan Human Rights Committee, the Dominican
 Union for the Defense of Human Rights, the National Committee of Human and
 Labor Rights, various church and labor groups, and others. The Dominican Republic
 has been slow to acknowledge requests and criticism from some international
 human rights organizations. The current Secretary of Labor has paid greater atten-
 tion to relations with the International Labor Organization (ILO).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on race and sex is prohibited by law. For deeply felt histori-
 cal reasons and because of sharp cultural differences, there exists in Dominican soci-
 ety a strong prejudice against Haitians, many of whom are illegal immigrants, and
 who constitute a significant percentage of the unskilled manual labor force in the
 Dominican Republic. This often translates into de facto discrimination against those
 
 
 387
 with darker skin (Le., who appear Haitian). Dark-skinned Dominicans, including
 some of Haitian descent, have, however, been successful in a variety of fields, in-
 cluding elected poitic. office. Many Haitians born in the Dominican Republic are
 unable to in recognition as Dominican citizens because of the undocumented sta-
 tus of theirparens.- Lack of documentation also sometimes hinders the ability of
 chldren of Haitian descent to attend school; some parents fail to seek documenta-
 tion for fear of themselves being deported.
 Women traditiony have not shared equal social and economic status or oppor-
 tunity with men, and men hold the overwhelming majority of leadership positions
 in all sctor.. Women have, however, begn to make vsible inroads in employment
 rolls and to hold high and more public leadership positions. Eight of the country's
 29 governors and 15 of the 120 Congressional Doputies are female. Divorce is easily
 obtainable by either spouse, and women can hold property in their own names apart
 from their husbands. In February various women s organizations submitted propos-
 als to be considered by the lower house of the Dominican Congress which would
 modify the Civil and Penal Codes with the aim of strengthening women's rights. The
 proposals remain under study by the Congress. A major regIonal women a rights
 conference was held in Santo Doig in October.
 Women's group contue efforts to .publicize the problem of violence against
 women although no statistic exit on this problem. Nor has there been a systematic
 study of the extent of sexual harassment, an issue especially relevant to the EPZ's,
 which have a predominantly female work force.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the freedom to orga-
 nize labor unions and also for the rights of workers to strike and private sector em-
 ployers to lock out. All workers, except military and police, are free to organize and
 al sectors exercise this right. A new Labor Code enacted in May significantly
 strengthened the right of freedom of association. The new Code removes some re-
 strictions on the right to strike by narrowing the definition of essential services to
 exclude transportation, food services, and fuel services. The Code also eliminates
 previous prohibitions against political and sympathy strikes. The only reported
 strikes in 1992 occurred in the public sector in which public employees, especially
 doctors and nurses, staged periodic strikes and walkouts. The Labor Code specifies
 in detail the steps legally required to establish a union, federation, and confed-
 eration. The Code calls for automatic recognition of a union if the Government has
 not acted on its application within a specific time. In practice the Government has
 readily facilitated recognition of labor organizations. Organized labor in the Domini-
 can Republic represents about 12 percent of the work force and is divided among
 three large confederations, three minor confederations, and a number of independ-
 ent unions. Unions are independent of the Government and political parties, al-
 though sympathizers of various political parties are found in most union organiza-
 tions. Labor unions can and do freely affiliate reionally and internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectwely.-Collective bargaining is law-
 ful and normally takes place in firms which have union representation. A union may
 represent the workers in collective bargaining when it has received the support of
 an absolute majority of the workers of a firm.
 The Labor Code expressly stipulates that workers cannot be dismissed because of
 their trade union memberip or activities. The new Labor Code modified previous
 provisions allowing arbitrary termination of a worker so long as severance pay is
 provided, by exempting from dismissal specific numbers of union organizers and offi-
 cials. The number of union organizers or officials given protection from layoffs can
 total up to 20 members of a union in formation, and between 5 to 10 members of
 a union executive council, depending on the size of the work force.
 The Dominican Republic has 26 established export processing zones with over 400
 companies and about 150,000 employees. Some EPZ companiesnave a history of dis-
 charging workers who attempt to organize unions. This practice continued despite
 the passage of the new Labor Code, and the Labor Secretariat fied complaints
 against five EPZ companies for violating the Code by illegally wiing workers. Union
 groups charged that at least 12 EPZ companies violated the new Labor Code in ad-
 dition toother instanes of illegal firing which occurred before the new Code went
 into effect in June. Unions exist in only a few EPZ companies, and no EPZ company
 has concluded a collective bargaining agreement with a union.
 On September 26, the six Dominican labor confederations and the Free Trade
 Zone Industry Association (ADOZONA) signed a tentative pact in which the unions
 renounced the right to seek economic adjustments for 6 months and the right to
 strike for 30 months, in return for a commitment by EPZ employers to respet the
 Labor Code and the right of freedom of association. ADOZONA members rejected
 
 
 388
 ratification of the pact, and the association subsequently submitted a counter pro-
 posal, which the labor confederations rejected; negotiations remained stalled at
 year's end.
 In May a U.. company fired the entire leadership of a union which had gained
 legal recognition. The firm stated the workers were fired for refusing to accept a
 transfer to a new Dominican-incorporated company. The fired workers hiad asked for
 24 hours to enable a union legal advisor to study the new contract. The Labor Sec-
 retariat filed a legal action against the firm for violation of the Labor Code. In Octo-
 ber the fired workers accepted a financial settlement in return for dropping all
 claims against the company.
 During a 1990 strike, the administrator of the state-owned Dominican Electric
 Corporation (CDE) charged the CDE union (SITRACODE) with sabotage, feather-
 bedding, and corruption, and began massive firings of SITRACODE leaders and ac-
 tivists which generated a complaint against the Dominican Republic in the ILO. In
 December 1991, the Dominican Government agreed to a settlement calling for the
 pensioning of 75 percent of the fired workers and the rehiring of 25 percent. How-
 ever, the Government refused to rehire SITRACODE leaders, an understanding
 which the union thought had been part of the agreement. As of the end of 1992,
 no agreement had been reached to resolve the dispute, and the case remained before
 the ILO, which requested that the trade union leaders be reinstated.
 c. Prohibition of-Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law. During previous years, the Government and the State Sugar Council
 (CEA) forcibly recruited Haitian seasonal agricultural workers and then restricted
 them to work on specific sugar plantations. During the 1991-1992 harvest season,
 these abuses continued, although at a significantly reduced level. There was one
 confirmed instance of the continued use of military and police to round up Haitians
 residing in the Dominican Republic to compel them to work in the cane fields; a
 CEA sugar mill administrator was fired when this incident was discovered. Human
 rights groups reported instances of Haitians who crossed the border being detained
 and transported to CEA plantations and, in some instances, compelled to work. CEA
 denies the use of paid recruiters inside Haiti to obtain sugar cane workers; no credi-
 ble evidence exists that this practice occurred to any sigificant degree in 1992.
 Talks between the Haitian and Dominican Governments aimed at reaching a con-
 tractual agreement covering such workers were suspended after the September 1991
 overthrow of the constitutional Government in Haiti.
 In 1992 restrictions on the freedom of movement for itinerant Haitian sugar cane
 workers apparently continued to occur, but at a lower level than in the past. These
 restrictions included the presence of armed gards in and around various sugar
 plantations and the sequestering of workers' belongings in order to impede their
 movement to other CEA plantations or other types of employment.
 To alleviate freedom of movement problems faced by itinerant Haitian workers,
 CEA and the Dominican Office of Immigration initiated a program in late 1991 of
 issuing 1-year temporary work permits to Haitian sugar cane workers. The Office
 of Immigration reportedthat as of November 24, 32,211 temporary work permits
 had been issued to Haitians under this program. Over half of recipients were em-
 ployed in private cane plantations or noncane cutting activities; 12,717 permits were
 issued to Haitians employed on CEA plantations. Dominican Immigration continues
 to issue these permits to Haitian workers. (Estimates on the total number of Hai-
 tian migrant workers in the Dominican sugar industry vary widely. In cooperation
 with the U.N. Development Program, CEA was working to produce a census of
 sugar workers. The results have not yet been published.)
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code prohibits employ-
 ment of youth under 14 years of age and places various restrictions on the employ-
 ment of youth under age 16. These restrictions include a limitation of no more than
 6 hours of daily work, no employment in dangerous occupations or jobs involving
 the provision o int icating beverages, and limitations on nighttime work.
 The high level of unemployment and the lack of a social safety net create pres-
 sures on families to allow children to earn supplemental income. Young people, in-
 cluding minors under 14 years of age and some that are abandoned, engage in a
 variety of work which violates labor regulations, including selling newspapers,
 washing car windows, and shining shoes. In practice, many of the child la or re-
 strictions in the Labor Code are ignored. During the past few years, the Labor Sec-
 retariat made some effort to enforce the law in cases where companies employed un-
 derage workers in violation of the law, but penalties were largely limited to small
 fines. Some young workers obtained work permits and continued their employment;
 those unable to obtain permits were dismissed.
 Instances of child labor in CEA sugar plantations have diminished greatly, and
 most observers concede that such practices are no longer a serious problem. Past
 
 
 389
 abuses reportedly included the use of unaccompanied minors recruited from inside
 Haiti without parental knowledge. CEA took steps to discourage child labor, and
 during 1992 there were only isolated instances of children accompanying their fa-
 thers into the fields.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution gives the Government legal
 authority to set minimum wage levels, and the Labor Code assigns this task to a
 national salary committee. Congress may also enact minimum wage legislation. Real
 wages, especially in the public sector, still suffered from serious erosion caused by
 an unprecedented 1990 inflation rate of 101 percent. Minimum wage hikes since
 1990 have not compensated for the loss of purchasing power. With the exception of
 merit bonuses for teachers and a delayed 1991 wage hike for EPZ and tourism sec-
 tor workers, there were no wage hikes in 1992. The vast majority of workers receive
 only the minimum wage. The current minimum wage is not sufficient to maintain
 a small family at a minimally acceptable standard of living. As a result, many peo-
 ple hold more than one job.
 The Labor Code establishes a standard work period of 8 hours per day and 44
 hours per week. The Code also states that all workers are entitled to 36 hours of
 uninterrupted rest each week. In practice, a typical workweek is Monday through
 Friday plus a half day on Saturday, but longer hours are not unusual. Workers are
 entitledto a 35-percent wage differential for work over 44 and up to 68 hours per
 week and a 100-percent differential for any hours above 68 per week.
 Workplace safety and health conditions do not always meet legal standards.
 Health standards for workers are set by the Dominican Social Security Institute.
 Non-health safety standards are coveredby the Labor Code. Both the Social Secu-
 rity Institute andthe Labor Secretariat have small corps of inspectors charged with
 enforcing standards. However, these posts are filled throuh political patronage, and
 some inspectors have earned a reputation for corruption. The existing social security
 system does not apply to all workers and is underfunded. As a result, benefits are
 low, payments often delayed, and medical care is limited and available only in the
 major cities. Laws on working conditions and their enforcement in the EPZ's de not
 differ significantly from those in the country at large. Some companies in private
 EPZ's practice much higher worker safety and health standards.
 Conditions among agricultural workers are in general much worse, especially in
 the sugar cane industry. Sugar cane cutters on CEA plantations are paid by weight
 of cut cane rather than hours worked and thus are usually required to work signifi-
 cantly longer than the standard 48 hour week in order to earn a wage appro i
 workers in other industries. Cane cutters have been paid in vouchers rather than
 cash, a process open to manipulation by CEA employees. The new Labor Code pro-
 hibits the payment of wages in vouchers and other noncash forms; CEA is studying
 opvtions that will permit compliance with the Code during the 199211993 harvest.
 Cane cutters also face widespread cheating problems during the weighing of their
 cut cane. CEA and the Labor Secretariat signed an agreement with labor unions to
 allow union officials to assist the Labor Secretariat in the inspection and monitoring
 of CEA weigh stations.
 Problems found in many Haitian worker villages, such as disease and a lack of
 schooling, medical facilities, running water, and sewage systems, also exist in other
 parts of the country and are not suffered uniquely by Haitians. CEA has signed
 agreements with international organizations, labor unions and nongovernmental or-
 ganizations to allow joint projects to improve living conditions on the plantations.
