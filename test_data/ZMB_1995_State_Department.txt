 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a republic governed by a president, a unicameral national assembly,
 and a constitutionally independent judiciary. After two decades of one-party rule,
 free and fair multiparty elections in October 1991 resulted in the victory of the
 Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) and the election of President Frederick
 J.T. Chiluba, a former trade unionist. In addition to the former ruling party, the
 United National Independence Party (UNIP), approximately 40 opposition parties
 were active to varying degrees.
 The police, divided into regular and paramilitary units, operating under the Min-
 istry of Home Affairs, have primary responsibility for maintaining law and order.
 The Zambia Intelligence Security Service, under the office of the president, is re-
 sponsible for intelligence and internal security. The police continued to commit nu-
 merous serious abuses.
 During 1995 the Chiluba Government continued its free market economic reform
 program. However, changes in economic policy early in the year led to reversals on
 inflation, currency stabilization, and real interest rates. New taxes were required to
 get back on track. Allegations of high-level corruption in the Government continued.
 Poor rains during the 1994-95 growing season resulted in a reduced harvest of
 maize, the staple food, and renewed appeals to donors. Although the key copper in-
 dstry benefitted from increased world p ,production ontinued to fall, resulting
 in a significant loss of income. Successful privatization in other industries has cre-
 ated some jobs.
 The Government continued to take steps to address one of the most serious
 human rights problems, police brutality. Throughout the year the government-ap-
 pnted Human .Rights Commssion aggressively pursued allegations of past and
 present human rights abuses and kept public attention focused on incidents of police
 wrongdoing. Nevertheless, by year's end much remained to be done to restore pro-
 fessionalism and discipline to the police force. Despite reform efforts begun in 1994,
 including human rights training and punishment of some offenders, the police con-
 tinued to commit abuses, including beatings and extrajudicial killing of criminal
 suspects and detainees.
 The Government generally respected Zambians' civil liberties but as the year
 ended, a number of actions raised doubts about its commitment to an open and fair
 electoral process in the period before the October 1996 national elections. These ac-
 tions included acceptance of clauses in the draft constitution, presented to President
 Chiluba in June, that would bar former President Kenneth Kaunda from running
 for president, public statements by Government leaders threatening Kaunda with
 deportation, and delays in updating voter registration rolls. The delays led to the
 indefinite postponment of nationwide local government elections originally sched-
 uled for November. In addition, although the press publishes freely, the Government
 has persisted in attempts to limit freedom of the press. Prison conditions deterio-
 rated further, posing an increased threat to the health and lives of inmates, and
 
 
 women continued to experience discrimination in both law and fact. Wife beating
 and rape remained widespread.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings during the year, but police continued to use excessive force that often re-
 sulted in extrajudicial killings. According to reliable press reports, almost all based
 on statements by police spokesmen, police killed approximately 17 criminal suspects
 during the year. Most of these killings allegedly occurred when police attempted to
 apprehend suspects during the commission of crimes.
 In December army recruits at a training facility north of Kapiri Mposhi attacked
 several villages in retaliation for the death of one of their fellow recruits at the
 hands of three villagers. They killed 2 civilians and left 1,000 temporarily homeless.
 The Government provided some financial compensation and the Ministry of Defense
 promised to investigate and take appropriate action. At year's end, however, no ac-
 tion had been taken against the soldiers who attacked the villages.
 Throughout the year, government officials, nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's), and the press closely scrutinized police involvement in human rights
 abuses, criminal activity, and corruption. Francis Ndhlovu, Inspector General of Po-
 lice, continued to exercise his mandate to reform the force. Ndhlovu instituted a va-
 riety of measures designed to restore discipline, professionalism, and respect for
 human rights, including police training in respect for human rights. Ndhlovu co-
 operated with the Human Rights Commission by making police officers available to
 testify. He also undertook investigations of instances of police use of excessive force,
 disciplining officers who committed human rights abuses. According to statistics
 made available by Inspector General Ndhlovu, at least 15 police officers were the
 subjects of internal investigations or prosecutions between January and September.
 Further, according to press reports, the authorities arrested at least 10 police offi-
 cers between January 1 and September 15 on such criminal charges as robbery and
 possession of illegal narcotics. One officer has been convicted for an assault on a
 Member of Parliament.
 The Human Rights Commission, chaired by prominent attorney Bruce Munyama,
 aggressively examinedpolice human rights abuses in public hearings held in the
 first half of the year. These hearings not only brought to light numerous abuses,
 but they also forced police officers to account for their behavior in sworn testimony.
 In September the Commission submitted its final report to the President, including
 recommendations to improve the human rights performance of the police. The report
 is expected to be published in the near future.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the 1991 Constitution prohibits torture, police regularly used excessive
 force when apprehending, interrogating, and detaining criminal suspects or illegal
 aliens. In most such instances, detaining officers beat suspects. During the year, the
 Human Rights Commission heard testimony from numerous credible witnesses who
 said that police had assaulted and beaten them. The Government took no action to
 discipline police officers for past incidents of abuse or torture.
 Deteriorating prison conditions posed an increasing threat to prisoners' lives. Ac-
 cording to official statistics, prisons designed to hold 6,500 prisoners held over
 12,000. This severe overcrowding, combined with poor sanitation, inadequate medi-
 cal facilities, meager food supplies, and lack of potable water resulted in serious out-
 breaks of dysentery and other diseases at various prisons throughout the year. The
 press reported that on numerous occasions, prisons ran out of food and prisoners
 were fed only coarse hominy and salt.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Criminal suspects are often arrested on
 the basis of flimsy evidence or an uncorroborated accusation. In these and other
 criminal cases, the law requires that a detainee be charged and brought before a
 magistrate within 24 hours. Pretrial detainees are allowed access by attorneys and
 family members. In practice, the authorities hold most detainees for more than 1
 month from the time of arrest to first appearance before a magistrate. In many
 cases, an additional period of 6 months ela ses   fore the magistrate commits the
 defendant to the High Court for trial. Following committal, preparation of the mag-
 istrate court record for transmittal to the High Court takes months-in some cases
 as long as a year. Once a case reaches the High Court for trial, court proceedings
 last an average of 6 months.
 Approximately 3,000 of the 12,000 prisoners are awaiting trial on criminal
 charges. In a few cases, defendants have been awaiting trial for 10 years. These
 
 
 297
 
 long delays are the result of inadequate resources, inefficiency, lack of trained per-
 sonnel, and broad rules of procedure that give wide latitude to prosecutors and de-
 fense attorneys to request adjournments. Although there is a functioning bail sys-
 tem, overcrowded prisons reflect the large number of detainees who have committed
 serious offenses for which bail is not granted. These include murder, aggravated
 robbery, and since 1993, violations of the narcotics laws. Also, poor or indigent de-
 tainees rarely have the financial means to post bail. The government legal aid office
 is responsible for providing legal representation to poor or indigent detainees and
 defendants in criminal or civil cases. In practice, few receive assistance. In 1995 the
 office had 15 attorneys to cover the entire country and a budget of $110,000.
 According to well-informed sources, police stations frequently become "debt collec-
 tion centers," where police officers, acting upon an unofficial complaint, will detain
 a debtor without charge indefinitely until he or she pays the complainant. In return,
 the police receive a percentage of the payment. This situation is commonplace
 among police stations in Copperbelt province.
 The authorities held approximately 550 foreigners, principally from neighboring
 countries, as illegal aliens until they could deport them. At times, these detentions
 last months or years. In the past the Government has not used exile for political
 purposes. In October, however, government leaders publicly questioned the citizen-
 ship of former President Kaunda and said that he could be liable to deportation.
 The Government backpedalled when a police summons to Kaunda to appear for
 questioning sparked disturbances in Lusaka. At year's end, the Government had not
 again brached the question of Kaunda's nationality. However, the case surrounding
 the 1994 deportation of John Chinula, a member ot the Central Committee of UNIP,
 continued in the courts. Minister of Home Affairs Chitalu Sampa said that Chinula
 had been determined by the Government to have been a "prohibited immigrant" who
 entered Zambia illegally from Malawi, where the Government alleged he was born.
 Legal and human rights groups continued to prtest the deportation, asserting-
 along with Chinula-that Chinula had been born in Zambia and that his deporta-
 tion was a denial of due process. In September the Lusaka High Court refused to
 grant habeas corpus to Chinula, stating that he was in fact a citizen of Malawi, and
 therefore had no right to bring a case in a Zambian court following his deportation
 to his native country. Chinula's Iongtanding ties to Zambia and his prominence as
 a politician raised questions about the Government's motives in deporting him
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects the independence of the judiciary in practice.
 The President nominates and the National Assembly confirms the Chief Justice and
 the other eight members of the Supreme Court. The Court has appellate jurisdiction
 for all legal and constitutional disputes. Several high courts have authority to hear
 criminal and civil cases and appeals from lower courts. Magistrate courts have origi-
 nal jurisdiction in some criminal and civil cases, while local, or customary, courts
 handle most civil cases at the local level.
 Local courts employ the principles of customary law, which vary widely through-
 out the country. Lawyers are barred from participating, and there are few formal
 rules of procedure. Presiding judges, who are usually prominent local citizens, have
 great power to invoke customary law in rendering judgments regarding weddings,
 divorces, inheritances, other civil proceedings, and minor criminal matters. Judg-
 ments are often not in accordance with the Penal Code; for example, they tend to
 discriminate against women in matters of inheritance (see Section 5).
 Trials in magistrate courts are public, and defendants have the opportunity to
 confront accusers and present witnesses.
 Proceedings against all but two of the UNIP members detained in connection with
 the 1993 state of emergency have been concluded, and none of the detainees are cur-
 rently in custody. Regarding the two outstanding cases, Bwendo Muaengela was
 found guilty of conspiring againt th stesta and sentenced to a short prison term.
 He is free on bond pending the outcome of his appeal. Kenneth Kuanda's son Wezi
 was released on bnd pending a final ruling in his case.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for respect for privacy andthe inviolability of the home, and
 the authorities generally respected these rights in practice.
 Except during a state of emergency, the law requires a warrant before police may
 enter a home. Roundups of suspected illegal aliens in the home ororykplace ontin-
 ued. According to the government Commissioner for Refugees, immigration officials
 are empowered under the law to conduct these roundups without a warrant.
 
 
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While the Constitution provides for freedom of
 expression and of the press, the Penal Code lists various prohibited activities that
 may be broadly interpreted and in effect restrict freedom of expression and the
 press. By year's end, no action had been taken on media reform proposals to revise
 many of these archaic penal code provisions. The Government generally respected
 freedom of expression, but invoked these restrictive laws--for example, prohibiting
 defamation of the President-in selected cases. The Government or its appointed of-
 ficials filed numerous libel and defamation suits against the independent biweekly
 newspaper, The Post, in response to a series of headlines and articles focusing on
 issues of corruption and controversial government policies. In June the Government
 attempted to use extralegal means to deny The Post access to a parastatal printing
 facility, but quickly abandoned its effort under public pressure.
 Zambian law includes provisions for investigative tribunals to call as witnesses
 journalists and media managers who print allegations of parliamentary misconduct.
 Failure to cooperate with the tribunal may result in charges of contempt punishable
 by up to 6 months. This is seen by the media as a clear infringement on press free-
 dom and a means for parliamentarians to bypass the clogged court system in deal-
 ing with libel suits against the media. The Press Association of Zambia has its own
 media ethics code and a voluntary industry ethics board.
 The Government owns the two most widely circulated newspapers, as well as the
 sole television station, ZNBC. In addition to the Government-controlled radio sta-
 tion, one Christian missionary affiliated station operated in Zambia. A number of
 independent newspapers actively question government actions and policies and cir-
 culate without government interference. In August ZNBC, and MNET, a South Afri-
 can company, together launched a subscriber television service. It rebroadcasts the
 British Broadcasting Corporation's World News but provides no local news report-
 ing. The Government exercises considerable influence over the government-owned
 media, which to an increasing degree have followed the government line on impor-
 tant issues.
 The Government took no action to restrain academic freedom during the year.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association. In practice, the Government generally
 respected these provisions, but as the year unfolded it demonstrated increased read-
 iness to use the Public Order Act of 1955 to prohibit selected political assemblies.
 Under this Act, persons or organizations wishing to hold an assembly, public meet-
 ing, or procession must first apply for a permit. The Government routinely granted
 these permits to political parties and nonpolitical organizations, but it twice denied
 permits to former President Kaunda, arresting him in both cases for illegal assem-
 bly. Court proceedings in these cases had not concluded by year's end. In October
 the Government revoked permission for NGO's and church leaders to march in pro-
 test of the Government's rejection of several recommendations of the Constitutional
 Review Commission, and a number of NGO and church leaders were briefly de-
 tained. All organizations must apply formally for registration to the Registrar of So-
 cieties. In most cases the authorities routinely approved these applications.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution.
 The Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides citizens with the right to move freely
 throughout Zambia, to reside in any part of the country, and to depart and return
 to the country without restriction. The authorities generally respected these rights,
 but police roadblocks to control criminal activity continued, and police sometimes ex-
 torted money and goods from motorists.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that
 there were approximately 113,000 refugees, mainly Angolans, in Zambia in 1995.
 The Government cooperated with the UNHCR in processing applications for refugee
 status.
 A steady trickle of Zairians continued to cross into Zambia during the year. In
 response to alleged criminal activities of many Zairians in the border region, the
 Government rounded up, arrested, and deported many Zairians and other illegal
 aliens throughout the year. The deportation of illegal aliens is lawful, but Zairians
 and others who had been accorded refugee status by the UNHCR were sometimes
 detained and held for varying lengths of time before being released. In several cases,
 the Government deported refugees who were registered with the UNHCR.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised the right to change their government in free and fair
 multiparty elections in 1991, following years of one-party rule by UNIP. Elections
 for President and the National Assembly are scheduled for 1996. The ruling MMD
 controls the National Assembly.
 Under the 1991 Constitution the President wields broad authority. Although the
 National Assembly ratifies major appointments and has other powers, in practice
 it continued during 1995 to provide only a limited check on executive authority.
 The pace of constitutional reform increased during the year as the 24-member
 Constitutional Review Commission completed its work and delivered a draft con-
 stitution to the President in June. The draft contained controversial clauses that
 would bar former President Kaunda from running for the presidency in 1996. One
 clause required a candidate's parents to have been born in Zambia- Kaunda's par-
 ents were born during the colonial era in what would later become Malawi. In Sep-
 tember the Government issued a White Paper that approved this recommendation.
 The White Papr also proposed that the amendments to the constitution be ap-
 proved by the National Assembly, in which the ruling MMD enjoyed a large major-
 ity, rather than by a constituent assembly or by referendum. Amidthe public debate
 that ensued, opposition parties strongly criticized both recommendations.
 Although the MMD continued to b the dominant political force, UNIP showed
 strength in a number of by-elections following the return of former President
 Kaunda to its leadership. The National Party, formed in 1993, struggled to remain
 a viable party, but experienced serious setbacks including defections to the ruling
 MMD of some of its leading members. The opposition accused the MMD of using
 political intimidation and economic reprisals in an effort to create a de facto one-
 party state.
 During the year, there were approximately 40 political parties in operation. Sev-
 eral contested national assembly by-elections. These elections generally featured a
 low turnout of registered voters, and while the MMD's use of government re-
 sources-including the state-owned media-during campaigns probably did not af-
 fect their outcomes, their fairness was put into question. The urgent need for up-
 dated voter registration rolls (last done in 1987) and the Government's failure to im-
 plement a transparent effective registration project raised doubts about the Govern-
 ment's willingness to have an open electoral process. Lack of a new voter register
 led the Government to postpone indefinitely nationwide local government elections
 scheduled for November.
 The number of women in politics and government is increasing, but the total re-
 mains small. Some women now serve as cabinet ministers, deputy ministers, mem-
 bers of the National Assembly and ministerial permanent secretaries. Women are
 also represented among elected local government officials and leaders of nongovern-
 mental organizations in greater number.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights and civic organizations operated without government
 hindrance. These include the Law Association of Zambia, the Foundation for Demo-
 cratic Process, and the Zambia Civic Education Association (ZCEA). Other groups
 were active in promoting women's civil and political rights. The government-ap-
 pointed Human Rights Commission operated throughout the year and, as previously
 noted, was a vigorous human rights advocate. In general, the Government continued
 to be receptive to criticism from human rights and civic organizations, but on occa-
 sion, government officials, including the Home Affairs Minister, accused human
 rights monitors of abetting crime and thwarting the work of the police through their
 focus on the victims of police brutality.
 Although a dispute over course content had disrupted human rights training in
 1994, the ZCEA and police agreed to resume the training in early 1995 at the police
 training academy. Police officers regularly appeared before the Human Rights Com-
 mission. The Government was receptive to inquiries and visits by international
 human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, tribe, sex, place of origin,
 marital status, political opinion, color, or creed; however, the Government does not
 effectively enforce the prohibition against discrimination based on sex.
 Women.-Violence against women remained a serious problem. Wife beating and
 rape were commonplace. According to official statistics, over 2,500 rape cases were
 
 
 300
 
 reported to the police between 1990 and 1995. Of these, approximately 30 percent
 resulted in conviction and 5 percent in acquittal. The remainder were either dis-
 missed or remain unresolved. Defendants convicted of rape normally were sentenced
 to prison at hard labor. Since many rapes are not reported to the police, the actual
 number is considered much higher. Domestic assault is a criminal offense, but in
 practice police are often reluctant to pursue reports of wife beating, preferring to
 broker a reconciliation. The Government and NGO's expressed increasing concern
 about violence against women, and the media devoted considerable publicity to it
 during the year.
 Both the Constitution and law entitle women to full equality with men in most
 areas. In practice, however, women are severely disadvantaged compared to men in
 formal employment and education. Married women who are employed often suffer
 from discriminatory conditions of service. For example, allowances for housing and
 children and tax rebates to which they as employees are entitled often accrue to
 their husbands. Similarly, women have little indepndnt access to credit facilities;
 in most cases, they remain dependent on husbands, who are required to sign for
 loans. As a result, few women own their own homes.
 Customary law and practice also place women in subordinate status with respect
 to property, inheritance, and marriage, despite various constitutional and legislative
 prvisions. Under traditional customs prevalent in most ethnic groups, all rights to
 inherit property rest with the deceased man's family. The 1989 Intestate Succession
 Act is designedto guarantee women a share of the joint estate. Under this Act, the
 children of a deceased man share equally 50 percent; the widow receives 20 percent;
 the parents, 20 percent; and relatives, 10 percent. In practice, "property grabbing"
 by the relatives of the deceased man continues to be rampant, particularly when
 local customary courts have jurisdiction. These courts often use a different law, the
 Local Courts Act, to distribute inheritances without reference to the percentages
 mandated in the Succession Act. As a result, many widows receive little or nothing
 from the estate. Fines mandated by the Succession Act for property grabbing are
 extraordinarily low. The Ministry of Legal Affairs and NGO s promised to amend
 the law to safeguard the rights of women more effectively and to increase the pen-
 alties for violations. By year's end, however, an amended Succession Act had not yet
 been introduced in the National Assembly.
 Children.-The Government seeks to improve the welfare of children, but scarce
 resources and ineffective implementation of social programs adversely affected the
 welfare of children and adults alike. Due to harsh economic conditions, both rural
 and urban children often must work in the informal sector to help families make
 ends meet (see Section 6.d.). There was no pattern of discrimination or societal
 abuse against children.
 People With Disabilities.-Persons with disabilities face significant societal dis-
 crimination in employment and education. The Government took steps to ameliorate
 their hardship, including the establishment of a national trust fund to provide loans
 to the disabled to help them start businesses. The Government has not legislated
 or otherwise mandated accessibility to public buildings and services for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of citizens
 to form trade unions and approximately 60 percent of the 300,000 formal sector
 workers are unionized. Most of the county's national unions, organized by industry
 or profession, are affiliated with the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU). The
 ZCTU is democratically operated and, like its constituent unions, is independent of
 any political party and the Government. By a majority vote of its members, a union
 may decide on affiliation with the ZCTU or with trade unions or organizations out-
 side Zambia. The ZCTU is a member of the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions. Labor leaders travel without restriction to international conferences
 and to visit counterparts abroad. The Mine Workers Union of Zambia and a number
 of other ZCTU constituent unions broke from the ZCTU and established a rival um-
 brella organization.
 The 1993 Industrial and Labor Relations Act (ILRA) reestablished the "one indus-
 try, one union" principle, but in April Labor Minister Newstead Zimba announced
 that the Government had ratified International Labor Organization (ILO) Conven-
 tions 87 and 98 on freedom of association, requiring the abolition of the one indus-
 try one union principle and paving the way for the free registration of trade unions
 in kambia. By year's end, however, the National Assembly had not yet passed the
 required implementing amendments to the ILRA. As a result, the legal status of the
 new labor umbrella organization and a number of new unions remained uncertain.
 All workers have the right to strike, except those engaged in essential services,
 the Zambia Defense Force, the judiciary, the police, the prison service, and the intel-
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 301
 1igence security service. The ILRA defines essential services as power, medical,
 water, sewerage, firegting, and certain mining occupations essential to safety. It
 permits strikes only after al other legal recourse has been exhausted, and in prac-
 tice all work stoppages during the year were illegal. The ILRA prohibits employers
 from retribution against employees engaged in legal trade union activities. Workers
 engaged in iegal strikes do not enjoy this protection, and there were at least two
 instances in 1994 when employers fired workers engaged in ilegal strikes.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to bargain collec-
 tively is esfablished by legislation and is contained in the ILRA. Employers and
 unions in each industry negotiate collective bargaining agreements through joint
 councils in which there is no government involvement. In practice, the industry joint
 councils function effectively as collective bargaining units. Civil servants and teach-
 ers, as public officials, negotiate directly with the Government. Collective disputes
 are first referred to a conciliator or a board of conciliation. If conciliation fails to
 resolve the dispute, the parties may refer the case to the Industrial Relations Court
 or, in the case of employees, vote to strike. In practice, legal strikes under the ILRA
 are rare. The ILRA prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union
 members and orpanizers. An employee who believes he or she has been penalized
 for union activities may, after exhausting any existing administrative channels for
 relief, file a complaint with the Industrial Relations Court. This Court has the
 power to order appropriate redress for the aggrieved worker. The complainant may
 appeal a judgment o-the Industrial Relations Court to the Supreme Court. In prac-
 tice, the Court often orders employers to reinstate workers found to have been the
 victims of discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits slavery
 and involuntary servitude, but it authorizes citizens to be called upon to perform
 labor in specific instances, for example, during national emergencies or disasters.
 Moreover, a citizen can be required to perform labor that is associated with tradi-
 tional civic or communal obligations, as when all members of a village are called
 upon to assist in preparing for a visit by a traditional leader or other dignitary.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment ofeChildren.-By legislation, the minimum age
 for employment of children is 16 years. The Labor Commissioner effectively enforces
 this law in the industrial sector, in which because of the high demand for employ-
 ment by adults, there are no jobs available to children. The law is not enforced,
 however, for those who work in the subsistence agricultural, domestic service, and
 informal sectors, where persons under age 16 are often employed. In urban areas
 children commonly engage in street vending.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage for nonunionized workers
 is set at $0.08 (70.30 kwacha) per hour. The minimum wage applies to nonunionized
 workers in categories such as general workers, cleaners, office orderlies, and watch-
 men. The minimum wage is insufficient to provide an adequate standard of living
 and most minimum wage earners must supplement their incomes through second
 jobs, subsistence farming, or reliance on the extended family.
 With respect to unionized workers, each industry sets its own wage scales and
 maximum workweek limits through collective bargaining. In practice, almost all
 unionized workers receive salaries considerably higher than the nonunion minimum
 wage. The minimum workweek for full-time employment is 40 hours and is, in prac-
 tice, the normal workweek. The law requires 2 days of annual leave per month of
 service.
 The law also regulates minimum health and safety standards in industry, and the
 Department of Mines is responsible for enforcement. Factory safety is handled by
 the Inspector of Factories under the Minister of Labor, but staffing problems chron-
 ically limit enforcement effectiveness. There are no legislative provisions to protect
 a worker who refuses to work on safety grounds.
