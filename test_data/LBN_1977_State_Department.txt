 LEBANON
 Lebanon is slowly emerging from more than 19 months of
 civil strife that was ended in most of the country by
 the deployment in late 1976 of a predominantly Syrian
 peacekeeping force. The Lebanese Government has been
 unable thus far to reassert its authority throughout
 the country. Private Lebanese forbes and Palestinians
 continue to do battle in the south. The current govern-
 ment is attempting to overcome the problems caused by
 the serious erosion during the civil conflict of public
 institutions such-as the security forces, police, and
 court and prison systems. This disintegration contrib-
 uted to a decline in the human rights standards observed
 during the fighting. The government has determined that
 one of its most important objectives is the creation of
 security and stability. In-pursuing this objective, the
 government has imposed some press censorship and restric-
 tions on the right of assembly; the government intends
 these restrictions to be temporary.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture-
 No charges of torture of prisoners have been brought
 against Lebanese police and security authorities since
 the present government of President Elias Sarkis took
 office in September 1976. The private militias and
 gangs which flourished during the factional fighting of
 1975-76 and which continue to operate in some areas not
 subject to government control have tortured political
 opponents.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Beatings have sometimes occurred in police interrogations
 in Lebanon, but not as a systematic or officially condoned
 practice. Some charges of brutality have been made
 against the largely Syrian Arab peacekeeping forces in
 Lebanon. We know of one confirmed incident, after which
 the Syrian authorities promised punishment for those
 guilty. The major problem in this area is the central
 government's inability to control the private militias
 and gangs in the country.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Articles 8 and 13 of the Lebanese constitution guarantee
 freedom from arbitrary arrest. During the factional
 fighting many innocent civilians were made hostages and
 prisoners of various of the factions, and there are still
 occasional kidnappings and taking of hostages, which the
 government is so far virtually powerless to prevent.
 Amnesty International, in its 1977 report, says it had
 received reports of persons arrested by the peacekeeping
 forces and imprisoned in Syria because of their supposed
 opposition to the Syrian Government, citing the Lebanese
 branch of the Iraqi Ba'ath Party as a target of such ar-
 rests. The Iraqi Ba'ath Party in Lebanon is a political
 organization with an armed militia, which has opposed by
 arms efforts by the peacekeeping forces to establish se-
 curity as well as the authority of the Lebanese Govern-
 ment. The Lebanese Government has sanctioned measures
 taken by the peacekeeping forces against those trying to
 re-ignite civil conflict or to exploit the lawlessness.
 Hundreds of people have been arrested and detained under
 that mandate.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under the Lebanese legal system, which the government is
 working to restore to full application through the coun-
 try, a judicial hcaring must be held shortly after arrest
 and the accused brought to public trial. An arrested
 person can be held a maximum of 24 hours without being
 charged. The accused enjoys the right to counsel and pro-
 tection from self-incrimination. Under the present un-
 settled security conditions, it has been difficult for
 the government to exercise police power effectively. When
 trials are held, however, we believe they have been fair
 to the accused. Certain influential groups through pres-
 sure and intimidation are able to prevent some criminals
 from being brought to justice.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Article 15 and 16 of the Lebanese constitution specify
 that dwellings are inviolable, except as prescribed by law.
 In practice, this means that Lebanese authorities must
 acquire the equivalent of a U.S. warrant to enter homes
 and arrest individuals. Although many Lebanese were driven
 
 
 383
 from their homes by armed factions during the fighting
 of 1975-76, there have been no allegations that govern-
 ment authorities have been guilty of these-abuses.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Before the civil war Lebanon's economic system was based
 almost totally on the laissez-faire concept of private
 enterprise. This approach brought the Lebanese a remark-
 able degree of prosperity,-but was unable to respond to
 the needs and rising expectations of the poorest class--
 one factor (not by any means the only one) that contrib-
 uted to the deterioration of the political and social
 fabric of the country prior to the outbreak of civil
 conflict in 1975. The present government leaders are
 aware of the need for economic and social reform. The
 government is now making available low-cost loans to
 poorer Lebanese to repair damaged housing, for example.
 On the other hand, it is also clear that there is still
 an influential body of opinion in Lebanon which believes
 that government action to relieve the needs of the very
 poor is likely to be ineffective and even counterproduc-
 tive.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 Lebanon's Constitution guarantees freedoms of speech,
 press, assembly, and association "within the limits
 established by law." Prior to the recent civil conflict,
 there were virtually no restrictions of any kind on free
 expression. Although as a consequence of the security
 situation, Lebanon's press is now subject to censorship,
 the main impediment to freedom of thought and expres-
 sion arises not from government action but from the
 climate of intimidation which private armed groups bring
 to bear against holders of opinions with which they
 disagree. This intimidation has sometimes threatened
 to prevent the distribution of newspapers in some areas,
 
 
 384
 and has a chilling effect on the traditionally lively
 intellectual life of Lebanon. Freedom of assembly is
 also circumscribed under present conditions. Using
 emergency powers granted to it by parliament, the
 government has banned "unlicensed" public demonstrations
 for fear that they might touch off violent reactions.
 Articles 9 and 10 of the Lebanese Constitution guarantee
 freedom of conscience and education, but religious dis-
 tinctions are sharply drawn and are embodied in the
 unwritten constitutional arrangements which allocate
 the highest offices in the state as well as parliamentary
 seats on the basis of religious affiliation. The right
 to worship freely, however, is assured in law and in
 practice.
 Workers are free to organize, except those engaged in
 agriculture and domestic service or those employed by
 the civil services. Trade union formation must be
 authorized by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs,
 however, and the Labor Code prohibits trade unions from
 engaging in political activities.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no legal or administrative hindrances to
 freedom of movement and the right to emigrate and travel
 abroad. Present security conditions inhibit freedom of
 movement within Lebanon.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 As indicated by the proliferation of Lebanese political
 parties and pressure groups, Lebanese continue to be free
 to organize themselves for political participation.
 Parliamentary debate can be suspended under the emergency
 powers granted the government by Parliament itself. The
 Parliament has met only a few times in the past year to
 debate governmental policies.
 As in other Arab countries, but to a lesser degree than
 in most, cultural traditions influence many women to
 refrain from participating in the political process.
 Women have the same legal rights as men to political
 participation.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No independent investigations have been carried out in
 Lebanon into alleged violations of human rights since the
 present government took office. Amnesty International,
 in its 1977 report, confirms that no normal initiatives
 by the organization have been possible since the begin-
 ning of civil strife in the country in 1975. Lebanese
 authorities received Amnesty International's Secretary
 General in February of 1977. They probably would not
 object to investigations once the security situation
 improves.
