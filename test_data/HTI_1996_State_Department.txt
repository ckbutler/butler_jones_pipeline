 HAM
 Haiti's second democratically elected President, Rene Preval, took office on Feb-
 ruary 7, continuing the significant progress in the transition to democracy that
 began with the restoration of deposed former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide in
 October 1994. The parliamentary democracy provided for in the 1987 Constitution
 was put into effect with the installation in 1995 of the bicameral, 110-member Na-
 tional Assembly. This body, for the first time, took up its responsibilities to direct
 government spending and serve as a counterweight to executive authority. Mayors
 and local councils, also elected in 1995, reflected broad, popular participation in
 democratic local government. Elections for some complementary local government
 bodies called for in the Constitution had not been organized by year's end. The judi-
 cial system-while theoretically independent-remained weak and corrupt after dec-
 ades of government interference and corruaption.
 Then-president Aristide revoked the commissions of the majority of members of
 the former Haitian armed forces in January 1995, and he also asked parliament to
 take up a constitutional amendment to abolish the armed forces. The legislature will
 be constitutionally able to do so at the end of its term, in 1999. The newly deployed
 civilian Haitian National Police (HNP) is the first police force that meets constitu-
 tional provisions. The 5,200-officer force assumed full responsibilities on December
 6, 1995, when then-President Aristide dissolved the interim police force and inte-
 grated its 1,598 members-699 former soldiers and 899 former migrants-into the
 
 
 475
 
 HNP. Other elements of the post-crisis security forces-the Presidential Security
 Unit, National Palace Residential Guard, and the Ministerial Security Corps-were
 gradually integrated into the national police structure. Over the course of the year,
 the HNP leadership, in cooperation with the international community, undertook a
 serious training and development effort to improve officers' skills, increase account-
 ability, and bring the force into compliance with international standards. The Unit-
 ed Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) has about 1,300 peacekeeping
 troops and 300 civilian police responsible for assisting the Government to maintain
 a secure and stable environment. Several mayors have created quasi-official forces
 to serve as municipal police. These groups lack legal standing, authority to carry
 weapons, or legitimate powers of arrest. The Port-au-Prince quasi-official foree num-
 bers about 60 men; that of Delmas, an adjoining suburb, about 30. The mayors of
 several other towns have much smaller corps. Some members of local government
 councils (CASEC's) have assumed arrest authority in defiance of the law. Members
 of the HNP, the other security forces, and the informal municipal polce committed
 some serious human rights abuses.
 Haiti is an extremely poor country, with a per capita income of about $260. It has
 a market-based economy with state enterprises controlling such sectors as tele-
 communications and utilities. The majority of the population works in subsistence
 agriculture, earns less than the average income, and lives in extreme poverty. A
 small, traditional elite controls much of the country's wealth. A small part of the
 urban labor force works in the industrial and assembly sectors. Assembled goods-
 textiles, leather goods, handicrafts, and electronics-are a major source of export
 revenue. Other important exports are mangoes, coffee, and sisal.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, continuing
 the overall improvement in the human rights climate since the end of the military
 regime. However, a significant number of serious abuses occurred, and cases of
 abuse remained steady in frequency and severity during the course of the year. Per-
 sons linked to palace security forces killed 2 opposition politicians, and the police
 killed at least 19 persons. Police officers shot and killed 16 persons while making
 arrests or controlling demonstrations and wounded more than 30 others in these sit-
 uations. Police were also responsible for more than 86 cases of mistreatment of de-
 tainees, including repeated, severe beatings and psychological pressure during inter-
 rogations. The HNP Director General, following the recommendations of his Inspec-
 tor General, fired at least 15 officers and placed 12 in detention pending prosecution
 for human rights abuses; he disciplined others for misconduct. The Inspector Gen-
 eral however, was slow in tackling politically sensitive cases. The police leadership
 made some progress in addressing management weaknesses which limit account-
 ability for police misconduct, but many senior and midlevel positions remained un-
 filled.
 hough independent in theory, in practice the judiciary is weak and corrupt. The
 Government plans sweeping judicial reforms, but Parliament had not passed a pro-
 posed reform law by year's end. The weak judicial system remained incapable of
 processing detainees in accordance with the law, and a large proportion of crimes,
 including some that may have had poitical motivations, remain unsolved. The au-
 thorities on occasion restricted freedom of assembly and illegally detained more
 than 30 persons who were members of the political opposition. Other arbitrary ar-
 rests, the clogged judicial docket, lengthy pretrial detention, poor prison conditions,
 illegal searches, and vigilante activity-including killings-also contributed to wide-
 spread human rights violations. Societal discrimination against women and abuse
 of children remain problems, particularly the widespread practice of rural families
 sending young children to the larger cities to work as unpaid domestics (restaveks).
 The Government's limited effort to redress the legacy of human rights abuse from
 the 199 1-94 period met largely with failure. The _pubic prosecutor mishandled the
 trial of those suspeted of killig former Justie Minister Guy Malary, and a jur
 acquitted the two suspects. Other important cases such as tose from te Apri
 1994 Raboteau killings, languished in the courts. Judicia officials failed to bein
 processing many other complaints, although a few convictions were obtained. he
 Justice Ministry did not widely disseminate the report of the National Truth and
 Justice Commission and did not implement its recommendations, including that of
 compensation for victims.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-Political and extrajudicial killings by
 the authorities increased slightly in 1996 compared with 1995 while remaining far
 fewer in number than during the 1991-94 period, according to UNSMIH reports, the
 
 
 HNP Inspector General, and other sources. In August persons linked to palace secu-
 rity forces killed two opposition politicians, Jacques Fleurival and pastor Antoine
 Leroy, apparently in the course of an illegal arrest. Separately, a member of the pal-
 ace guard was reportedly linked to the June murder of the mayor of Chansolme,
 a small town in the northwest.
 HNP members killed at least 19 persons. Police officers and ministerial security
  ards killed five persons in a chaotic police operation against armed gangs in Cite
 leil on March 6; they killed two other suspects who fired upon the police. In one
 June incident, police detained four suspects, drove them to a remote area, shot
 them and left them for dead, two survived. In another incident in June, police at
 the Croix-de-Bouquets station shot two detainees, deposited one corpse in the la-
 trine, and beat two other detainees to death. Police were also responsible for 16 ad-
 ditional deaths when officers used excessive force in making arrests or controlling
 demonstrations. Among them were five men shot when police caught them in a pick-
 up truck filled with arms and ammunition in Delmas on November 5; one body ex-
 arnined later in the morgue had handcuffs on one wrist.
 The quasi-official security force attached to the Port-au-Prince mayor's office prob-
 ably was responsible for the summary execution of three persons suspected of theft
 in August.
 Unknown perpetrators killed 11 police officers, including several cases in which
 political motives cannot be excluded. Estimates of the number of former soldiers
 killed by unknown persons in August and September-possibly in retaliation for the
 ex-soldiers' perceived role in antigovernment activity-range from 2 to 30. Instances
 of mob killings of suspected criminals continued to exceed 100. In one case in March
 in Morne Cabrit, a crowd stoned to death three suspected bandits, tortured a fourth,
 killed him with machetes, and hung the corpse upside down from a tree by the road-
 side. Except in the Morne Cabrit incident, the authorities rarely took action in these
 cases.
 The public prosecutor (the Port-au-Prince Commissaire du Gouvernement) had
 the responsibility to investigate the deaths of Leroy and Fleurival. The Government
 suspended the chief of palace security, his deputy, and seven Presidential Security
 Umt guards allegedly at the scene and dismissed the member of the palace guard
 linked to the Chansolme mayor's death. The police Inspector General completed re-
 prts on several cases of summary execution or excessive force, and the Director
 eneral subsequently took disciplinary action-including 15 dismissals as well as
 suspensions and letters of reprimand. Due to weak or nonexistent mid-level super-
 visory leadership, however, some officers dismissed for misconduct returned to duty
 or continued to draw pay. The Government brought to trial two suspects in the 1993
 political killing of Justice Minister Guy Malary. -In part because of poor preparation
 bythe prosecutor, the jury acitted both suspects. As a result, the authorities post-
 poned planned trials or other serious human rights abusers, including those sus-
 pected of the April 1994 killings at Raboteau.
 There was no progress in resolving past killings such as those of Mireille
 Durocher Bertin, Jean Marie Vincent, and ClaudyMusseau. The National Police's
 Special Investigative Unit continued to investigate notorious human rights abuses
 from previous years--including high-profle killings committed following then-Presi-
 dent Atide's return in 1994--but only the Malary case was brought to trial.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no credible reports of politically motivated dis-
 appearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1987 Constitution prohibits the use of unnecessary force or restraint, psycho-
 logical pressure, or brutality by the security forces. However, training of police in
 human rights provisions of the Constitution is still limited, and members of the se-
 curity forces frequently violated these provisions. Police officers used excessive-and
 often deadly-force in making arrests or controlling demonstrations and wounded
 more than 30 in such situations. The police also continued to beat demonstrators
 in a few instances.
 The National Police tortured suspects in isolated incidents. In one particularly se-
 rious case, police chained several detainees suspected of drug trafficking to a tree
 and beat them over a period of 3 days. One victim was pregnant and shortly after-
 ward miscarried. The U.N. mission noted unconfirmed reports that police in two sta-
 tions used electricity to torture detainees.
 Cases in which the National Police mistreated detainees-sometimes severely-
 increased dramatically in 1996. The UN/OAS International Civilian Mission (ICM)
 documented 86 instances of mistreatment in the first 5 months of 1996, and such
 violations of human rights continued throughout the year. Most often, police beat
 suspected members of armed gangs during the course of interrogation, sometimes
 with objects such as weapons or plastic pipe. Reported measures of psychological
 
 
 477
 
 pressure during interrogations include blindfolding or using hoods on suspects, issu-
 ng death threats, and holding detainees under running water. Other victims had
 their heads shaved. The HNP is investigating the majority of cases documented in
 the ICM report.
 Other abuses of police authority also resulted in cruel treatment of citizens. In
 July a police officer shot a female acquaintance in the vagina following a dispute.
 Police on leave were likely responsible for wounding seven persons during a public
 festival the same month. In sporadic cases, off-duty officers also used their weapons
 in disputes with taxi drivers or in nightclubs.
 The quasi-official forces connected, respectively, to the Port-au-Prince and Delmas
 mayoralties on several occasions beat female vendors who allegedly were violating
 market rules.
 Prison conditions remained poor. Prisoners and detainees, held in overcrowded
 and inadequate facilities, continued to suffer from inadequate basic hygiene, 24-
 qhour confinement to cells, and poor quality health care. Overcrowding in certain
 regional facilities worsened dramatically. In Gonaives, for example, the prisoner
 population increased fivefold, exacerbating already overcrowded conditions and pos-
 ing a threat to the health and life of prisoners there. Prison observers noted that,
 on occasion, prisoners claimed that guards beat their charges.
 The Government, with the help of the international community, made some
 progress in improving prison conditions. Prisoners nationwide generally received
 two adequate meals per day-a substantial improvement over 1995, when seven
 persons in the national penitentiary died of a vitamin deficiency. The International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) funded the installation of rudimentary clinics
 in the country's prisons. The Government failed, however, to keep these facilities
 adequately stocked with medicines and other health care supplies. It also failed to
 develop and enforce consistent standards of overall prisoner care.
 Persons detained in politically sensitive cases were often kept in police station
 holding cells, rather than in regular prison facilities. These and other holding cell
 detainees depended largely on their families for food and medicine; the Government
 made no provision for their care. In some cases, police officers used their personal
 funds to buy food for such persons.
 The authorities freely permit the ICRC, the Haitian Red Cross, the ICM, and
 other human rights groups to enter prisons and police stations, monitor conditions,
 and assist prisoners with medical care, food, and legal aid.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution stipulates that a person
 may be arrested only if apprehended during the co mmission of a crime or if a judi-
 cial warrant has been issued. The authorities must bring the detainee before a judge
 within 48 hours of arrest. However, the authorities frequently ignored these provi-
 sions in practice.
 Arbitrary arrests increased significantly. The ICM estimated that, at the end of
 September, 57 persons were awaiting trial on charges of threatening state security.
 In July and August, the Government arrested some 30 persons-members of the po-
 litical opposition or former soldiers-on poorly substantiated charges of threatening
 state security. In two cases, police arrested family members-instead of the person
 sought-for antigovernment activity, despite the constitutional prohibition ag'ainst
 arresting any person in place of another. Judicial officials or police subsequently re-
 leased the family members. In another case, the brother of a former police chief con-
 tinued to be kept in a police holding cell for "his own protection," according to the
 police officer in charge. Arbitrary arrests by those lacking arrest powers-some ele-
 ments of the security forces, quasi-official forces, and local government councils
 (CASEC's)--occurred sporadically. The police also made arrests based on flawed
 warrants or in the presence of a justice of the peace, which is legally insufficient.
 A jury acquitted two suspects in the killing of former Justice Minister Malary, but
 the authorities illegally kept the pair in detention while developing new charges
 against them for other murders.
 Detainees who had never seen a judge or whose cases stagnated in the judicial
 system continued to crowd the prisons nationwide. An overburdened and inadequate
 judicial system frequently detained suspects well beyond the 48 hours permitted for
 arraignment, although respect for the 48-hour rule increased. Cases bound over to
 higher courts also languished. More than 80 percent of the inmates in the prison
 system were awaiting trial.
 The Constitution prohibits involuntary exile of citizens. While some left the coun-
 try for personal or political reasons, the Government did not make use of exile as
 punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but the judiciary is not independent in practice. Years of rampant corruption
 and governmental neglect have left the judicial system poorly organized and vir-
 
 
 tually moribund. The judicial apparatus follows a civil law system based on the Na-
 poleonic Code; the Criminal Code dates from 1832.
 At the first level, the justices of the peace issue warrants, adjudicate minor infrac-
 tions, take depositions, and refer cases to higher judicial officials. Investigating mag-
 istrates and public prosecutors cooperate in the development of more serious cases,
 which are tried by the judges of the first instance courts. Appeals courts judges hear
 cases referred from the first instance courts, and the Supreme Court deals with
 questions of procedure and constitutionality.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair public trial, but this right was
 widely abridged. Unaddressed systemic weaknesses continued to contribute to a
 huge backlog of criminal cases, with some detainees waiting years in pretrial deten-
 tion for a court date. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, responsibility to inves-
 tigate crimes is unclear, and authority to pursue cases is divided among police, pros-
 ecutors, and investigating magistrates. The code further stipulates two criminal
 court sessions per year, each lasting 2 weeks, to try all major crimes requiring a
 jury trial. Although the court system held more such sessions in more locations, the
 backlog continued to increase. Moreover, if an accused is ultimately tried and found
 innocent, he has no recourse against the Government for time served.
 The Constitution expressly denies police and judicial authorities the right to inter-
 rogate persons charged with a crime unless the suspect has legal counsel present
 or waives this right. Nevertheless, most accused cannot afford legal counsel and the
 law does not require that the Government provide legal representation. Thus, de-
 spite the efforts of local human rights groups and the international community to
 provide legal aid, many interrogations without counsel continued to occur.
 The Government devoted some effort to the task of reforming the judicial system.
 The Justice Ministry cooperated with international donors in providing training to
 sitting magistrates, improving the administration of the public prosecutors offices,
 strengthening judicial supervision, and establishing prison registries. In September
 the Government submitted to the National Assembly a draft law setting out sweep-
 ing judicial reforms, but the parliament had taken no action on the proposal by
 year's end.
 There were no reports of political prisoners, although the Government detained
 some political opponents on charges of threatening state security (see Section 1.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 Police and other security force elements did, however, conduct illegal warrantless
 searches, particularly in connection with a high-profile kidnaping case and with al-
 leged destabilizing activities in August and September. Members of quasi-official
 forces also conducted illegal searches and seizures of property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government generally respects these- rights; however, there
 were some exceptions. The press energetically exercised this freedom. Print media
 from opposite ends of the political spectrum often criticized the Government.
 With an illiteracy rate of approximately 80 percent, broadcast media, especially
 Creole-language radio, have an unusual importance, and some 32 radio stations op-
 erate in the capital alone. Broadcast media tended to criticize the Government less
 than the press but freely expressed various political viewpoints. There were no re-
 ports of censorship, nor did tie media appear to practice self-censorship. The gov-
 ernment-sponsored daily newspaper remained closed following a 1995 dispute be-
 tween the former information minister and the paper's editor.
 Foreign journalists generally worked without hindrance, although the police did
 arrest one foreign reporter for photographing a corpse in the street. Police also
 clashed with domestic journalists at east four times, seizing cassettes and other
 journalistic records. Several journalists reported experiencing rough treatment at
 the hands of the police during these confrontations. Unknown armed individuals at-
 tacked two regional, privately owned radio stations in May, destroying transmitting
 equipment. Others shot at the government-owned national television headquarters
 in August.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The authorities generally re-
 spected the constitutional rights of freedom of assembly and association. Political
 parties across the spectrum were able to meet and recruit members. New political
 organizations, including several dedicated to the rights of former soldiers, formed.
 In some instances, however, unrelated law enforcement actions may have restricted
 these rights. Late in the year, the authorities began to release some political detain-
 ees when investigations revealed no evidence of wrongdoing.
 
 
 479
 In August police arrested 15 former soldiers, 2 party activists, and 2 other persons
 meeting at the Port-au-Prince headquarters of an opposition political party, the Mo-
 bilization for National Development (MDN); in February, police had harassed MDN
 mbers outside the capital The authorities later charged those arrested in
 gus      threatening state security. Over the next 2 months, police arrested sev-
 ers] other MDN members and former soldiers on similar charges and issued a war-
 rant for the arrest of the party's secretry general, Hubert de Ronceray. In Septem-
 ber poice also arrested a less well-known ouposition political figure, Carmen
 Christphe, a former mayor of Port-au-Prince. The leader of the opposition political
 party Creddo, former military ruler Prosper Avril, likewise faced a warrant for his
 arrest on similar charges. The authorities also conducted illegal searches with the
 apparent intent of harassing opposition political figure Duly Brutus and members
 of i family.
 c. Freedom of Religion.The Constitution provides for the right to practice all re-
 ligions and faiths, provided that practice does not disturb law and order, and the
 Government respected this right. The Government did not restrict missionary activi-
 ties, affiliation with overseas coreligionists, or religious instruction or publishing.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and  Re-
 patriation.-There are no legal restrictions on the movement of citizens within the
 country. An unknown number of undocumented migrants put to sea seeking better
 economic opportunities in other countries.
 The Government operated a national migration office to assist citizens repatriated
 from other countries, notably the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic.
 The Government has no policy regarding foreign nationals seeking refuige or asy-
 lum from third countries; no such cases were reported. The issue of provision of first
 asylum did not arise.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for regular elections for local and parliamentary offices
 and for the presidency. Voters elected officials to the national and local governments
 in a series of free and fair elections in 1995, although administrative incompetence
 marred the early rounds of the legislative and local elections. Elections for the Sen-
 ate, where one-third of the seats were due to become vacant at year's end, and for
 some complementary local government bodies called for in the Constitution were
 months behind schedule. The Government constituted a new Provisional Electoral
 Council in November, and it scheduled Senate and local elections for March 1997.
 No legal impediments to women's participation in politics or government exist.
 The generally lower status of women, however, limits their participation in these
 fields. Of the 83 members of the Chamber of Deputies, 3 are women. The 27-mem-
 ber Senate has none. President Preval named a few women to prominent positions
 in his Government, including the Women's Affairs Minister, the Secretaries of State
 for Tourism and Justice, and the Presidential spokesperson. The President also
 placed some female advisers on his palace staff.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operated without government restriction,
 commenting on human rights cases. The Government tolerated their views but was
 rarely responsive to their recommendations. About a dozen local human rights
 groups monitored conditions in the country, with some working on civic education
 and legal aid as well.
 In August the Government requested and received an extension of the UN/oAS
 International Civilian Mission's mandate to December. The 1CM investigated all re-
 ports of human rights violations, issued periodic reports and press releases, con-
 Sucted civic education, and trained local human rights groups. The CM also worked
 with the Government in a variety of ways to develop its institutional capacity to
 prevent and provide redress for human rights abuses.
 The National Coalition for Haitian Rights (formerly the National Coalition for
 Haitian  Refugees) was the   ly ony  ther international human rights organization to
 maintain a permanent presence. Representatives of other internat ional human
 rights organizations visited freely from time to time. The ICRC was active through-
 out the year, particularly inprison renovation and assistance to prisoners.
 The National Truth and Justice Commission, chartered by President Aristide in
 1994 to document the abuses of the previous regime, presented its report to the Gov-
 ernment in late January. The Justice Ministry did not disseminate the reort wide-
 ly, however, and the Commissiona recommendations for redress and judicial reform
 remained unimplemented at year's end.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1987 Constitution does not specifically prohibit discrimination on the grounds
 of race, sex, religion, disability, language, or social status. It does provide for equal
 working conditions regardless of sex, beliefs, or marital status. However, there is
 no effective governmental mechanism to administer or enforce these provisions.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women and rape occur, but most victims and
 witnesses do not report these crimes to the police. The Haitian Center for Research
 and Action for the romotion of Women published a preliminary report of a 1995
 survey of 1,705 Haitian women. Of that group, 37 percent stated that they or some-
 one they knew had been raped or otherwise sexually abused; in 42 percent of these
 cases, the assailant had no familial or other close connection with the victim. Of
 those interviewed, 33 percent reported that they or someone they knew had been
 the victim of other types of physical violence. Nearly two-thirds of the victims had
 never reported the abuse, most for fear of public shame or of retribution from their
 assailants, but some because they felt judicial penalties were insufficient. The law
 provides penalties for these crimes, but the authorities do not enforce these provi-
 sions adequately.
 The Ministry of Women's Affairs is charged with promoting and defending the
 rights of women and ensuring that they attain an equal status in society, but it did
 little in this regard. In December Parliament proposed elimination of the Ministry.
 Women do not enjoy the same social and economic status as men. In some social
 strata, tradition limits women's roles. Peasant women, often the breadwinner for
 their family, remain largely in the traditional occupations of farming, marketing,
 and domestic labor. Very poor urban women, who head their families and serve as
 its economic supprt, also often find their employment opportunities limited to tra-
 ditional roles in domestic labor and marketing. Laws governing child support recog-
 nize the widespread practice of multiple-father families but are rarely enforced.
 Well-educated women have, however, occupied prominent positions in both the pri-
 vate and public sector in recent years.
 Children.-The Government's programs do not promote or defend children's
 rights. Government health care and education programs for children are inadequate
 or nonexistent. Poorer families sometimes ration education money to pay school fees
 for male children only.
 Rural families continued to send young children to serve as unpaid domestic labor
 for more affluent city dwellers, a practice cited by a 1991 U.N. study as an example
 of slavery in the 20th century. One international organization estimated in 1996
 that 240,000 to 300,000 children are victims of this practice, called "restavek"
 (which means "lives with" in Creole). It is not limited to the wealthy class, as middle
 and lower class families also use restavek children. Employers compel the children
 to work long hours, provide them little nourishment, and frequently beat and abuse
 them. The Ministry of Social Affairs believes that many restavek children are mis-
 treated.
 Local human rights groups do not report on the plight of restavek children as an
 abuse or seek to improve their situation. The Ministry of Social Affairs believes that
 it can do little to stop this practice, regarding it as economically motivated; the Min-
 istry assigned three monitors to oversee the welfare of restavek children. Society
 holds such children in little regard, and the poor state of the economy worsened
 their situation. Port-au-Prince's large population of street children includes many
 runaway restaveks.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides that disabled persons shall
 have the means to ensure their autonomy, education, and independence. However,
 there is no legislation to implement these constitutional provisions or to mandate
 provision of access for people with disabilities. Although they do not face overt ill-
 treatment, given the severe poverty in which most Haitians live, those with disabil-
 ities face a particularly harsh existence.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.--Some 99 percent of Haitians are descend-
 ants, in whole or in part, of African slaves who won their war of independence from
 France in 1804. The remaining population is of European, Middle Eastern, North
 American, or Latin American origin. The law makes no distinction based on race.
 Longstanding social and political animosities are often tied to cultural identification,
 skin color, and overlapping issues of class, in this starkly inegalitarian society. Some
 of these animosities date back to before Haiti's revolutionary period.
 The Government recognizes two official languages: Creole, which is spoken by vir-
 tually all Haitians; and French, which is spoken by about 20 percent of the popu-
 lation, including the economic elite. The inability to communicate in French has
 long limited the political and economic opportunities available to the majority of the
 population. The Government prepared most documents only in French, and, despite
 
 
 the Justice Minister's order to use Creole in the courts, judges conducted most legal
 proceedings exclusively in French. Creole was, however, the language chosen for
 parliamentary debate in the lower house.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assciation.-The Constitution and the Labor Code provide for the
 right of association and provide workers, including those in the public sector, the
 right to form and join unions without prior government authorization. The law pro-
 tects union activities and prohibits a closed shop. The law also requires a union,
 which must have a minimum of 10 members, to register with the Social Affairs Min-
 istry within 60 days of its formation.
 Six principal labor federations represented about 5 percent of the total labor force,
 including about 2 to 3 percent of labor in the industrial sector. Each maintained
 some fraternal relations with various international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Cllectiely.-The Lbor Code protects
 trade union organizing activities and stipulates fines for those who interfere with
 this right. Unions were generally free to pursue their goals, although the Govern-
 ment made little effort to enforce the law. Organized labor activity was concentrated
 in the Port-au-Prince area, in state enterprises, the civil service, and the assembly
 sector. The high unemployment rate and antiunion sentiment among some factory
 workers limited the success of union organizing efforts.
 Collective bargaining continued to be nonexistent, and employers set wages uni-
 laterally. The Labor Code does not distinguish between industries producing for the
 local market and those producing for export. Employees in the export-oriented as-
 sembly sector enjoyed better-than-average wages and benefits.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. The Government failed to enforce thii law, however, and chil-
 dren continued to be subjected to forced domestic labor (see Section 5).
 d. Minimum Age of Employment for Children.-The minimum employment age in
 all sectors is 15 years. Fierce adult competition for jobs ensured that child labor is
 not a factor in the industrial sector. Children under the age of 15 commonly worked
 at informal sector jobs to supplement family income. The International Labor Orga-
 nization criticized the Ministry of Social Affairs' enforcement of child labor laws as
 inadequate.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum daily wage is about $2.40
 (36 gourdes). Annually, a minimum wage worker would earn about $800, an income
 considerably above the national average but sufficient only to permit a worker and
 family to live in very poor conditions. The majority of Haitians work in subsistence
 agriculture, a sector where minimum wage legislation does not apply.
 The Labor Code governs individual employment contracts. It sets the standard
 workday at 8 hours, and the workweek at 48 hours, with 24 hours of rest on Sun-
 day. The code also establishes minimum health and safety regulations. The indus-
 trial and assembly sectors largely observed these guidelines. The Ministry of Social
 Affairs did not however, enforce workhours or health and safety regulations.
