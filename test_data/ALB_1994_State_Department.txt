 ALBANIA
 Albania continued to struggle in its efforts to establish a democratic society. A
 new draft constitution was defeated in a referendum in November with little hope
 that another version could be approved before year's end. Pending a new constitu-
 tion, the Law on Major Constitutional Provisions supplemented by the Law on Fun-
 damental Freedoms and Human Rights serves in its place. President Sali Berisha,
 elected by Parliament in 1992, continued his 5-year term presiding over a coalition
 government dominated by the Democratic Party. Parliament adopted a new civil
 procedures code and began consideration of draft penal and penal procedures codes.
 The Court of Cassation in June overturned the Minister of Justice's refusal to reg-
 ister the Democratic Party of the Right, thus providing for registration of a newly
 formed party of sharply differing views.
 Local police detachments reporting to the Ministry of Interior (the Ministry of
 Public Order prior to December 1994) are responsible for internal security. Police
 effectiveness in combating violent crime increased, but instances of police abuse con-
 tinued. The National Intelligence Service (SHIK) has both domestic and external in-
 telligene gathering and counterintelligence functions. There are rumors, but no evi-
 dence, that SHIK exceeded its mandate.
 Albania is a poor country with a largely agricultural economy. Remittances from
 Albanians working abroad are the principal source of foreign exchange. The econ-
 omy, in transition from a centrally planned to a market-oriented system, continued
 to improve as gross domestic product grew by over 8 percent. Privatization of small
 and medium enterprises continued at a slower pace than in 1993, but privatization
 of large enterprises continued to be hampered by a shortage of interested investors.
 Inflation dropped to an annual rate of around 18 percent, and unemployment re-
 mained at around 25 percent.
 Significant human rights abuses remain. Police continue to beat detainees, some-
 times causing deaths. Five police officers arrested for a fatal beating in 1993 were
 found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment (see Section 1.a.), but in several in-
 stances alleged abuses occurred without the perpetrators being punished. Ethnic
 tensions were exacerbated by the arrest of five members of the ethnic Greek politi-
 cal organization Omonia on charges of treason and illegal weapons possession and
 their sentencing to 6- to 8-year terms, which were subsequently reduced on appeal.
 Substantial procedural shortcomings marred their arrest, the search of their homes
 and offices, their detention, and their trial. The Government restricted freedom of
 the press by trying Albanian journalists for defaming public officials and for reveal-
 ing alleged state secrets. The President later pardoned those journalists. Some re-
 strictions remain on freedom of assembly and association. The ethnic Greek commu-
 nity continued to complain of discrimination, particularly in education and religious
 matters.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political or Other Extrajddicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings. In January Irfan Nano of Saranda died after police reportedly beat him
 while in custody. The Albanian Helsinki Committee (AHC) protested his death. Ar-
 rest warrants were issued for two police officers believed responsible, and the inves-
 tigation was continuing at year's end. On November 23, Enrik Islami of Vlora died
 in police custody. Islami had reportedly been in prison for 17 months pending trial
 for murder. The Vlora prosecution opened an investigation into Islami s death, but
 no arrests have been made. Five police officers, accused of fatally beating David
 Leka while in custody in August 1993, were found guilty and sentenced to from 1
 to 11 years in prison.

 722
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code prohibits the use of physical or psychological force during criminal
 proceedings and provides penalties for those found guilty of abuse. During Septem-
 ber, the ARC investigated complaints of mistreatment while in custody of Jam Ste-
 fan Magllara in Saranda and Osman Curciali in Tirana. The Minister of Public
 Order claimed that, in both cases, the police sought to detain them in connection
 with specific crimes. When they forcibly resisted detention, police used force against
 them. Curciali filed a complaint of police brutality and the prosecutor opened an
 investigation, which was continui  at the end of the year. Ainnesty International,
 Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, an others protested the October 14 and 15 beatings
 of three members of the Gay Albania Society. The three were detained for allegedly
 engaging in homosexual acts a practice which is punishable by up to 10 years in
 prison under the Penal Code. One of the three detainees was beaten severely
 enough to require hospitalization. The Interior Ministry stated that no complaints
 of mistreatment were filed m this case and therefore it initiated no investigation.
 On October 20 the AHC protested the mistreatment of six members of the Keci
 family, three o? them women, in police custody in the town of Fushe-Kruja on Octo-
 ber 17. One of the men was reportedly beaten severely enough to require hos-
 pitalization. The Interior Ministry reported that no complaints of mistreatment were
 received and it undertook no investigation.
 Four of the five ethnic Greek members of Omonia stated that, during their deten-
 tion before their trial for treason, authorities subjected them to physical and psycho-
 logical pressure, including beatings, sleep deprivation, hate speech, and threats of
 torture. The Government rejected their claims (see Section i.e.).
 Albanian prison conditions do not meet internationally accepted standards. Of
 particular concern is the incarceration of minor suspects and convicts (under the age
 of 18) with older inmates and resulting allegations of sexual abuse of minors by
 older prisoners. There are no statutes which define the rights or obligations of pris-
 oners or the rules governing prisoners' behavior. The AHC, which monitors prison
 conditions and reports on them to its parent organization, also noted that hygienic
 conditions in the prisons are extremely poor and prisoners often experience difficul-
 ties receiving visitors, mail, and newspapers. The AHC deemed none of these prob-
 lems life-threatening.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-According to the Penal Code, a prosecu-
 tor or police officer may order a suspect into "custody." Those in custody may leave
 their residences only with the approval of the prosecutor. All accused persons must
 be informed of the charges against them at the time of detention and have the right
 to legal counsel, which will be provided free of charge if they are unable to afford
 a private attorney.
 Bail, in the form of money or property, may be required if it is believed the ac-
 cused may not appear for the court hearing. If the prosecutor fears that the accused
 may leave Albania prior to trial or is a danger to society, he may order an arrest.
 Many suspects remain in jail until their trial date, which, due to the backlog of
 cases and shortage of attorneys, is often longer than 3 months.
 Within 24 hours of arrest, the police must send a report to the prosecutor on the
 evidence linking the suspect to the crime. The prosecuting attorney has 48 hours
 within which to decide whether to go to trial or to order the person's release. Either
 the defendant or counsel has the right to appeal the arrest ordered by the prosecu-
 tor in the court of first instance. The hearing must be held within 7 days of the
 arrest in the presence of the prosecutor, the defendant, and the defense counsel.
 There is no appeal of the court's decision in this matter.
 In practice, the above procedures are often not followed. Detainees in criminal
 cases are often denied contact with their families during the investigative phase,
 which, due to a heavy caseload and the lack of trained investigators, may last sev-
 eral months. The five ethnic Greeks arrested and tried for treason all complained
 of lack of access to their families for the first 3 months of the 4-month investigation.
 The serious procedural effects noticed in the Omonia case may well reflect a pattern
 of judicial weakness which also affects ethnic Albanians. The AHC also investigated
 complaints that some prisoners continued to be held virtually incommunicado even
 after they were convicted in court and that the courts often failed to respect the
 right of those arrested to appeal their arrest and receive a hearing within 7 days
 of the arrest.
 The Albanian system of justice does not employ exile as a form of punishment or
 political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The lack of a new penal code and constitution re-
 sulted in continued reliance on a patchwork of changes to Communist-era laws, in
 uneven application of the laws, and, together with procedural irregularities, some-
 
 
 723
 times in denial of fair trial. The judicial system comprises the courts of first in-
 stance (also known as district courts), the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Cassa-
 tion. Each of these courts is divided into three jurisdictions: criminal, civil, and mili-
 tary. The Court of Cassation (also known as the High Court or Supreme Court)
 hears appeals from the Court of Appeals, while the Constitutional Court reviews
 those cases requiring interpretation of constitutional legislation.
 Parliament has the authority to appoint or dismiss judges of the Constitutional
 Court (nine members) and the Court of Cassation (seven members). The Supreme
 Judicial Council, which is headed by the President of the Republic, appoints and dis-
 misses all other judges. Judges have lifetime appointments and may be relieved of
 their duties only upon conviction for a serious crime.
 Prosecutors also serve at the pleasure of the Supreme Judicial Council. Many
 judges and prosecutors who held ranking positions during the previous regime have
 been removed.
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions provides that a trial must be held
 in public, unless it might divulge national security information, disrupt public order,
 or prejudice the "best interests of minors, private parties, and justice." If convicted,
 the accused has the right to appeal the decision within 5 days to the Court of Ap-
 peals and again to the Court of Cassation, which renders the final verdict. The law
 does not specify any time period within which the Court of Appeals or the Court
 of Cassation must hear appeals.
 The arrest, investigation, and trial of the five ethnic Greek members of Omonia
 did not conform to internationally accepted standards. It is not clear that Ministry
 of Public Order officials had proper warrants authorizing the searches of the homes
 and offices of the Omonia members incident to their detention on April 18. None
 of the arrestees had access to legal counsel during their initial detention. Once ar-
 rested, only one of the arrestees had immediate access to a lawyer during the subse-
 quent investigative phase. The Government claims to have written waivers of the
 right to counsel from the other arrestees. In fact, the four other arrestees were not
 represented by counsel during the ma or part of the investigation, and one was not
 represented until immediately before the trial.
 During the trial, defendants and their lawyers were required to testify before any
 other witnesses were called. Although this is permissible under Albanian law, it
 may have prejudiced the defendants' right to a presumption of innocence and avoid-
 ance of self-incrimination. The court admitted the written testimony of several wit-
 nesses who, despite the requests of defense lawyers, did not appear in court, thus
 denying the defendants the opportunity to confront them. The Government denied
 assertions made by several of the defendants at their trial that their statements
 during the investigation had been coerced by torture or the threat of torture. To dis-
 credit defense claims of coercion, the prosecution introduced videotapes of the de-
 fendants secretly made during the investigation. The judges, defendants, defense at-
 torneys, prosecutors, and selected Albanian journalists were the only ones permitted
 to view them. Neither the Government nor the prosecution made any firther at-
 tempt to investigate allegations of mistreatment. At the end of 1994, the AHC pub-
 lished a declaration critical of procedural irregularities in the trial. Despite charges
 of ethnic discrimination in the case of the ethnic Greek Omonia members, the legal
 system does not discriminate systematically against minorities or women. The seri-
 ous procedural defects noticed in the Omonia case may well reflect a pattern of judi-
 cial weakness which affects ethnic Albanians as well. The AHC also noted proce-
 dural irregularities in the trial of former Prime Minister Fates Nano.
 The AHC does not claim that the Government holds any political prisoners. Some
 members of the former Communist regime, convicted on charges of enriching them-
 selves at public expense, corruption in the performance of their duties, or ordering
 border forces to kill Albanians attempting to flee the countr, are serving prison
 sentences. The opposition Socialist Party claims that former Prime Minister Fates
 Nano, convicted of corruption in handling humanitarian assistance from Italy, is a
 political prisoner. They base this claim on procedural irregularities which occurred
 during the investigation and trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Law on Major Constitutional Provisions states that Albania guarantees "the human
 rights and fundamental freedoms as accepted in international documents." The Law
 on Fundamental Freedoms and Human Rights addresses protections associated with
 privacy, family, home, and correspondence.
 Although Article 16 provides for protection of the home from arbitrary entry or
 search, the Penal Code permits warrantless searches for weapons. Article 17 calls
 for privacy of correspondence except "for a judgment in the interest of criminal pro-
 ceedings or by the approval of a competent government body, assigned by law, in
 
 
 724
 cases where it (encroachment) is considered indispensable for reasons of national se-
 curity."
 The Government is considering plans to open and examine the files of the
 Sigurimi (the former secret police of the Commonist regime), but no legislation has
 been passed, and the files remain under the control of the SHIK. Senior government
 officials have indicated that not all files are intact and some may have been tam-
 pered with in the final days of the Communist regime. The AHC is concerned that
 information from the files may have been used for political purposes and protested
 the lack of legislation on their disposition.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Pres&-The 1993 Law on Fundamental Freedoms and
 Human Rights provides for freedom of speech and press, but laws on slander, insult,
 and protection of state secrets were used to prosecute persons for criticism of the
 Government. In practice, freedom of speech, including freedom to criticize the Gov-
 ernment and government officials, was sometimes restricted.
 A 1993 press law sets out large fines for publishing material that the Government
 considers secret or sensitive, permits confiscation of printed matter or property by
 judicial order, and allows for criminal punishment under certain circumstances yet
 to be defined by the Penal Code. The media and the AHC continue to denounce this
 law. While several Albanian journalists were arrested and tried under slander and
 libel laws, none was prosecuted under the 1993 press law. No law governs electronic
 media.
 The Government took legal action against four journalists in 1994. Martin Leka
 and Aleksander Frangaj, reporter and editor respectively of the opposition news-
 paper Koha Jone, were arrested in January arKoha Jone published a classified
 order prohibiting military officers from carrying their sidearms while off-duty. Leka
 and Frangaj were prosecuted under the penal code article onerning protection of
 state secrets. The court sentenced Leka to 18 months in prison, while Frangaj was
 found not guilty; the prosecution appealed, and Frangaj was subsequently sentenced
 to 5 months in prison. In addition, two other ournalists from opposition papers,
 illyrian Zhupa from Populli Po and Shyayri Meka from Aleanca, were arrested for
 libeL President Berisha pardoned all four on May 3. An appeals court later declared
 Frangaj and Leka not guilty.
 Opposition parties, independent trade unions, and various societies and groups
 publish their own newspapers. Some 250 newspapers and magazines appear on a
 regular basis. Three newspapers in the Greek language are published in southern
 Albania.
 Foreign journalists encountered difficulties in Albania in 1994. Several Greek and
 Cypriot journalists covering the trial of the five members of Omonia in August were
 expelled from Albania for "improper documentation," having entered Albania as
 tourists, not journalists. Plainclothes police subjected other Greek journalists to
 petty harassment, and Greek television journalists were not permitted to film the
 Omonia trial sessions, while Albanian television taped the entire trial.
 state-run radio and television provide domestic programming, but many mu-
 nicipalties offer locally fed international programs via satelite.
 Since November 1991, Parliament has exercised direct control over television, del-
 egating some oversight duties to an Executive Committee of Radio and Television,
 which it appoints. The Executive Committee, comprised of 11 members from outside
 Parliament, meets occasionally to review programming and the content of news
 broadcasts. Opposition critics of the Government continued to allege that television
 serves the interest of the ruling Democratic Party. State television's portrayal of the
 events outside the courthouse during the Omonia trial, including police use of force
 against Greek journalists and lawyers was misleading since it created the false im-
 pression that the police were violently provoked. Opposition parties claimed that
 some controversial interviews and programs, including rebroadcast segments of the
 Voice of America were not aired, reportedly at the re  est of political and govern-
 mental leaders. Local radio in southern Arbania broaiasts some Greek-language
 programming, with its content translated directly from Albanian-language report-
 ing. The AHC continued to express concern over the lack of legislation covering elec-
 tronic media ownership and broadcasting.
 The Government did not infringe academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-While the Government gen-
 erally respected the rights of freedom of peaceful assembly and association, in some
 instances local officials denied these rights, particularly to members of the ethnic
 Greek minority. Police sometimes used excessive force in breaking up protests.
 In order to hold a public rally, an organization must apply for a permit from local
 authorities and provide copies of all speeches to be delivered and slogans to be used
 
 
 725
 in the course of the meeting. The authorities generally grant requests for meetings,
 although police sometimes require a change of date or venue. There were no reports
 of arrests of persons attending authorized meetings in 1994, but several ex-members
 of the security services were detained and fined Tor an unauthorized demonstration
 outside the Court of Cassation.
 The Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church requested permission to hold a re-
 ligious procession near the center of Tirana on the feast of Good Friday during Or-
 thodox Easter. The Ministry of Public Order initially denied the request, claiming
 that it could not ensure security for such a procession and that the proecession's pro-
 posed route would disrupt a major traffic artery. Following protests by the Orthodox
 Church and the Government of Greece, the Ministry approved a later procession for
 Easter Sunday. A request by ethnic Greeks in the southern Albanian town of
 Gjirokaster to assemble to celebrate the Greek national day holiday on March 25
 was refused by local public order officials. The Ministry later replaced the chief of
 police for Gjirokaster, reportedly in part for his refusal to permit the meeting.
 In two incidents, police reportedly used force to control or detain demonstrators.
 In August police forcily removed several members of the Association of Former Po-
 litical Prisoners and Formerly Persecuted Persons from the premises of commercial
 establishments in Durres where they were conducting a hunger strike, causing sev-
 eral injuries. The AHC protested the use of excessive force to remove the hunger
 strikers but did not contest the court order that declared the hunger strike illegal.
 On August 15, police broke up a demonstration by a group of about 100 Greek law-
 yers, journalists, and ethnic Greek citizens of Albania outside the courthouse in
 which five ethnic Greeks were being tried on treason charges and detained 20 law-
 yers and journalists. During this action, independent human rights observers wit-
 nessed police severely beating at least one person who was offering no resistance.
 Any organization, including a political party, must apply to the Ministry of Justice
 for official certification; it must declare  an  aim  or purpose that is not
 anticonstitutional or contrary to law; and it must describe its organizational struc-
 ture and account for all public and private funds it receives. The Ministry of Justice
 denied certification to the Democratic Party of the Right and the Social Justice
 Party in 1994, claiming that their positions on the complete return of property to
 former landowners was anticonstitutional. In both cases, the Constitutional Court
 reversed the Justice Ministry's decision and permitted certification of those parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion has been established both in theory
 and practice.
 The majority of Albanians are secular in orientation, after 40 years of rigidly en-
 forced atheism. The largest religious group are Muslims, who follow a moderate
 form of Sunni Islam. The Roman Catholic and Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox
 Churches are the other large denominations. The Albanian Orthodox split from the
 Greek Orthodox earlier in the century. Priests from Greece augment the indigenous
 clergy of the Albanian Orthodox Church to serve Greek-speaking congregations, pri-
 marily in southern Albania. A seminary training priests for the Albanian Orthodox
 Church graduated 30 new priests in 1994. Foreign clergy, including Muslim clerics
 and Christian missionaries, freely carry out religious activities.
 A Secretariat of Religions within the Ministry of Culture oversees the activities
 of the religious communities. Some questions concerning property confiscated by the
 Communist regime from religious organizations have yet to be resolved. Most reli-
 gious buildings and many religious objects have been restored to the religious com-
 munities which formerly owned them. In some instances, however, the full restitu-
 tion of real property would displace thousands of residents from their present-day
 homes located on lands formerly belonging to religious organizations. Pending legis-
 lation on religious property, the Government treats all religious communities the
 same as other former owners of large properties, who, according to the 1991 law on
 property, are not guaranteed full restitution of lands. In addition, a number of reli-
 gious objects and icons have not been returned to religious communities, especially
 the Albanian Orthodox Church, and remain in state hands. The Government indi-
 cated its willingness to return these objects once the religious communities can as-
 sure their security as cultural objects of value to the entire nation. The Albanian
 Orthodox Church claimed that it already had the means to protect these objects bet-
 ter than the Government and continued to demand their return.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no longer any restrictions on freedom of movement within
 the country. Albanian-born citizens of all foreign countries are eligible to apply for
 dual citizenship.
 Since the downfall of the Communist regime hundreds of thousands of economic
 migrants have left Albania. Albanians who fled the country during the Communist
 dictatorship have been welcomed back, and their citizenship has been rectored.
 
 
 726
 There was no significant influx of refugees in 1994. A small number of ethnic Al-
 banians from Kosovo, Serbia, fled to Albania to avoid the draft.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights. The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions states that citizens have the right
 to change their government "by free, general, equal, direct, and secret ballot." Inter-
 national observers judged the national elections in March 1992 to have been free
 and fair. The next elections are not required before 1996. Independent observers of
 local elections in June in several towns noted some irregularities in the composition
 of election committees and the registration of voters. They also cited several exam-
 ples of improper behavior at polling places by ruling and opposition party members
 but did not call the election results into question.
 The 1992 Law on Political Parties bars the formation of parties on an ethnic or
 religious basis. The Unity for Human Rights Party, founded by ethnic Greeks, won
 a majority of elected positions in parts of three southern Albanian districts
 (Saranda, Gjirokaster, and Delvina). There are six ethnic Greek members of Par-
 liament, two of whom represent the Unity for Human Rights Party.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation of women in politics or gov-
 ernment, although to date few women have competed for elective office, and only
 eight women serve in Parliament, reflecting the traditional male-dominated society.
 In the Government, 2 Deputy Ministers and 7 of the 140 members of Parliament
 are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Albanian Helsinki Committee (AHC), the major human rights watchdog orga-
 nization, took an active role in defending human rights in certain areas, particularly
 the rehabilitation of former political prisoners, support for freedom of the press, and
 protests against police abuses. It was criticized, however, by the International Hlel-
 sinki Federation and individual Helsinki representatives from other countries for a
 lack of aggressiveness and perceived close association with the ruling Democratic
 Party. In October the AHC replaced key officers in scheduled elections. In response
 to a specific criticism, it began investigating the human rights situation of the eth-
 nic Greek minority in Albania. In 1994, it also addressed the issues of former
 Sigurimi (secret police) files, judicial protection for citizens, and prison conditions.
 The AHC's work was impeded by a lack of basic equipment, including computers,
 copiers, and especially, usable vehicles. An independent Albanian group, Society for
 Democratic Culture, monitored local elections and the constitutional referendum
 and continued its efforts in civic education and women's issues.
 Delegations from the International Helsinki Commission, the Council of Europe,
 and the Office of the High Commissioner for National Minorities of the Conference
 on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) made several visits to Albania in
 1994, during which they conferred with political officials and representatives of the
 ethnic Greek minority and visited prisons, hospitals, and other state facilities. The
 High Commissioner was permitted unmonitored access to five ethnic Greek mem-
 bers of Omonia in prison prior to their trial on treason and weapons charges. Ob-
 servers from several human rights organizations were permitted to monitor that
 trial in August and September. The Government did not penalize or repress human
 rights observers or their contacts for their work in Albania.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions does not address women's
 rights. Women are not restricted, either by law or practice, from any occupations
 but do not typically rise to the top of their fields. While no data are available on
 whether women receive equal pay for equal work, public sector wage scales are
 based on rank and duties, not sex. Women's groups did not complain of wage dis-
 crimination in the large public sector. According to government statistics, 21 percent
 of judges and 22 percent of medical personnel in Albania are women. Although
 women have equal access to higher education, they are not accorded full, equal op-
 portunity and treatment with men in their careers, due to the persistence of tradi-
 tional male-dominated values.
 Domestic violence undoubtedly exists, but no statistics are kept. Women's organi-
 zations believe that domestic violence against women is common, particularly in
 poor, rural families and in poorly educated urban families. Police are seldom called
 to intervene in cases of family abuse, and women almost never bring charges
 against spouses. The major political parties have women's organizations. Two inde-
 pendent women's rights organizations operate freely and are Zedicated to educating
 
 
 727
 Albanian women about their rights, providing counseling services, and monitoring
 draft legislation.
 Ch'dren.-The Government's commitment to children's rights and welfare is
 based on domestic law and international agreements. Governmental and nongovern-
 mental organizations have not identified child abuse as a problem.
 Nationai/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-While no recent official statistics exist re-
 garding the size of various ethnic communities in Albania, ethnic Greeks are the
 most organized and receive the most attention and assistance from abroad. The size
 of the ethnic Greek minority is in dispute- some estimate that there around 80,000
 ethnic Greeks residing in Albania, out of a total population of about 3.4 million.
 Vlach (Romanian-speaking) leaders claim their community numbers close to
 300,000, although this is unlikely. Small ethnic Macedonian villages exist in the
 northeast part of the country. The number of Roma in Albania is estimated at
 around 100,000.
 The CSCE High Commissioner for National Minorities visited Albania four times
 in 1994, traveling to the areas of greatest ethnic Greek minority concentration three
 times. In response to his 1993 recommendation, the Government in January created
 a special Office for Minority Affairs in the Office of the Prime Minister. The Special
 Advisor for Minority Affairs coordinated legislation affecting minorities, including a
 new directive on education published in August.
 Greek-language education remained the single most important concern of the eth-
 nic Greek minority. In the summer of 1994, the Government published a new direc-
 tive that mother-tongue education be integrated in bilingual schools in areas where
 a significant percentage of the population belongs to a minority. It also calls for sup-
 plementary instruction in the mother tongue in other areas where a smaller number
 of minority students are found. Parents may request establishment of new classes
 taught in the mother tongue, but the Ministry of Education must give its approval.
 Forty-six primary schools and the same number of 8-year schools in the districts
 of Gjirokaster, Delvina, and Saranda provide bilingual education to approximately
 4,500 ethnic Greek students. In addition, bilingual education is provided to approxi-
 mately 500 students in ethnic Macedonian villa es. A Greek-language high school
 operates in Gjirokaster, and the Eqerem Cabej University of Gjirokaster has had a
 department of Greek studies since 1993, with a total of 30 avail able places in 1994.
 The curriculum in Greek-language classes is the Albanian state program translated
 into Greek, taught by ethnic Greek instructors, and using Albanian textbooks trans-
 lated into Greek and published in Greece.
 Roma were subject to particularly harsh official persecution during the Com-
 munist dictatorship. Their leaders state that the situation of the community greatly
 improved with the advent of democratic government. They had no complaints of ei-
 ther official or societal discrimination. The community publishes a monthly news-
 gaper in both the Albanian and Roma languages. No specific violence is known to
 ave been directed against them in 1994.
 People With Disailities.-Widespread poverty and the poor quality of medical
 care account for a high number of disabled persons. Disabled persons are eligible
 for various forms of public assistance, but budgetary constraints limit the amount
 of assistance. The public care section of the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare,
 established in 1993, has set up a network of social service administrators through-
 out the country with a goal to improve the quality of services to disabled persons
 and promote social integration rather than institutionalization. There is no law
 mandating accessibility to public buildings.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers obtained the right to create independent
 trade unions in 1991. The Independent Confederation of Trade Unions of Albania
 (BSPSH) acts as the umbrella organization for a number of smaller unions. A sepa-
 rate, rival federation continued to operate in close cooperation with the Socia ist
 Party. There are also some independent unions not affiliated with either federation.
 The private sector employs more than 650,000 Albanians, mostly in agriculture,
 small shops, enterprises, and restaurants, but very few have formed unions to rep-
 resent themselves.
 According to the Law on Major Constitutional Provisions, all workers, with the
 exception of uniformed military, police, and some court employees, have the right
 to strike. The law forbids strikes that are openly declared to be political, or so
 judged by the courts. Several local strikes took place in 1994. All were deemed legal,
 and-none resulted in violence or police action.
 Labor federations are free to maintain ties with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.--Citizens in all fields of em-
 ployment, except uniformed members of the armed forces, police officers, and some
 
 
 court employees, have the right to organize and bargain collectively. In practice,
 unions negotiate directly with the Government, since little privatization has oc-
 curred outside of the retail and agricultural sectors.
 Wages for all state employees are defined by the wage pyramid, legislated in
 1992, which comprises 22 wage levels organized by trade.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Law on Major Constitutional
 Provisions prohibits forced labor, and there were no cases of forced labor reported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Law on Major Constitutional
 Provisions sets the minimum age for employment at 14 years, and persons between
 the ages of 14 and 16 may work only 5 hours per day. Working conditions for those
 over 16 are not currently legislated but are covered in the draft labor code. The Min-
 istry of Labor, Social Welfare, and Formerly Persecuted Persons enforces the mini-
 mum age requirement through the courts. In rural areas, children continue to be
 called on to assist families with farm work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage for all workers over age
 16 is approximately $27 (2,400 lek) per month, which is not sufficient to sustain a
 family with one or more children. Most workers must find second part-time jobs to
 supplement their incomes. Current law guarantees social assistance (income sup-
 port) and unemployment compensation. The average monthly wage for Albanian
 workers in the public sector is about $50 (4,500 lek). No data are available for pri-
 vate sector wages, but the average wage is thought to be higher in the private sector
 than in the public sector.
 The workweek in state-owned enterprises is 40 hours. Other workers are limited
 by law to a 40- to 48-hour workweek, and the Council of Ministers must approve
 exceptions. The Ministry of Labor enforces this law.
 The Government sets occupational health and safety standards but has no funds
 to make improvements in state-owned industries. In those enterprises which are
 functioning, health and safety conditions are generally very poor.
