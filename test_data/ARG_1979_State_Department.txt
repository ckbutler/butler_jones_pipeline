 ARGENTINA
 Over the past twenty-five years Argentina has passed
 through several cycles of alternating civilian and
 military rule; since 1955, there have been six military
 and six civilian presidents. Beginning in 1969, violence
 mounted progressively from the left and the right
 as groups with widely different political objectives
 and conceptions struggled for power. As a result,
 both civilian and military governments have maintained
 a "state of siege" for some nine of the past ten years.
 At the height of this violence in 1975-1976, terrorism
 had taken on broad dimensions: bombings, robberies,
 kidnappings and assassinations for political reasons
 were common occurrences. Organized terrorist groups
 on both sides of the political spectrum numbered some
 5,000-6,000 persons, with sympathizers estimated at
 an additional 15,000.
 By 1976 the situation in.Argentina had deteriorated sharply.
 Courts and political leaders were being intimidated;
 inflation approached 800 per cent; and many essential
 public services had been disrupted. At this point,
 the Armed Forces again took control of the state,
 with the avowed goals of promoting economic recovery
 and ending terrorism and corruption. They promised
 that democracy would ultimately be restored. The
 Armed Forces maintained the state of siege imposed
 in 1974 by President Maria Estela Peron, closed Congress,
 deposed the President, and replaced all members of
 the Supreme Court. Elected state and local governmental
 officials were replaced by military officers, and
 political party activities, including the right of
 assembly, were prohibited. Most trade unions were
 intervened and all strikes were banned.
 The security forces embarked on a widespread counter-
 campaign of violence aimed at terrorists as well as
 elements of the society they considered subversive;
 many known or suspected terrorists, as well as many
 persons with no subversive record, disappeared. Many
 others were detained by the Executive without any
 specific charge under the "state of siege" powers
 of the Constitution.
 The most carefully recorded and documented list of
 unexplained disappearances, compiled by the Permanent
 Assembly for Human Rights in Buenos Aires, contains
 about 6,500 cases for the period 1976 to 1979. Some
 estimates, however, run considerably higher. The
 Mission of the New York City Bar Association, which
 visited Argentina in 1979, considers a figure of 10,000
 as more accurate, while Amnesty International asserts
 that 15-20,000 persons have disappeared. There is
 substantial evidence that most of these persons were
 abducted by the security forces and interrogated under
 torture; as most have not reappeared, many observers
 believe that they were summarily executed. There
 have been reports, difficult to verify, that some
 missing persons have been seen alive in detention
 centers.
 As regards use of the Argentine Executive's "state-
 of-siege" detention powers, some 8,200 persons have
 been arrested under these provisions since 1974, both
 by the present Government and its predecessor. While
 many of those so detained have been released, others
 have been held without trial for years.  in the view
 
 
 240
 of the Executive, the Argentine constitution places
 no specific time limit on detention under the "state
 of siege". Several courts (first-instance and appellate)
 held that such prolonged detention is in essence an
 imposition of punishment without due process, and
 hence unconstitutional. The Supreme Court, however,
 has overruled these lower court decisions and upheld
 the Executive's position.
 Conditions of detention were often cruel, and serious
 problems of mistreatment, overcrowding, and insufficient
 medical care often existed. Although the Government
 asserts that torture was never authorized, there is
 extensive evidence that torture was routinely used
 during interrogation by the security forces.
 Beginning in early 1978, Government spokesmen declared
 the war on terrorism to have been won. Conceding
 that excesses had been committed, the national authorities,
 through a variety of directives and personnel transfers,
 have sought to tighten control over the operations
 of the security forces. At the invitation of the
 Argentine Government, the Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission visited Argentina in September 1979 to
 investigate human rights abuses. The Commission interviewed
 many government, human rights, religious, political
 and labor officials, and had access to several prisons and
 detention centers. A mission of the New York City
 Bar Association was also permitted to visit Argentina
 in 1979.
 Since late 1978, the incidence of disappearances has
 declined significantly. They numbered many thousands
 in both 1976 and 1977, and over 500 in 1978; since
 then such occurrences have been sharply reduced.
 In 1979 there were 44 known disappearances, most of
 which occurred in the first half of the year. There
 are indications that the Government has committed
 itself to end this practice.
 The number of prisoners held without charge under
 the Executive's "state-of-siege" has been reduced
 substantially; about 1,300 remained in late 1979.
 The Government has released large numbers of these
 detainees. An estimated 1,000 others have been tried
 and convicted and are still serving prison terms.
 About 500 more are currently on trial. A review board
 is working actively on cases of the remaining prisoners.
 A presidential decree in April regularizing prison
 rules led to significant improvements in many prison
 facilities.
 Terrorist activities in Argentina have largely ceased.
 There are reports that small numbers of terrorists
 are being trained in third countries and are returning
 to Argentina. In three separate instances, terrorists
 attempted to murder high officials in late 1979.
 The GOA has declared that the incidents of the past
 year are isolated events which do not signal a major
 resurgence of terrorism.
 Political party activity continues to be prohibited
 and labor unions remain narrowly circumscribed; Government
 guidelines limit freedom of expression. The Government
 has promulgated new trade union legislation which
 sets forth guidelines for future labor union activity
 and lays a basis for lifting the present restrictions.
 
 
 241
 The law has been criticized by Argentine and international
 labor organizations as a Government attempt to curtail
 organized labor's political and economic power.
 In late 1979, the Government promulgated a "political
 plan" containing broad guidelines for an eventual
 return to civilian rule and a promise to develop specific
 proposals in 1980, following a dialogue between military
 leaders and diverse civilian groups.
 Argentine human rights groups are active and well
 organized, although their leadership has been subject
 to severe harassment and arrest.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is extensive evidence, primarily the statements
 of former detainees, that torture has been routinely
 used by the security forces. It has been most frequent
 during the first days of interrogation and, according
 to numerous reports, has taken such forms as the use
 of electric shock, immersion of the head in water,
 mock executions, and other types of severe physical
 and psychological abuse. There are also credible
 allegations that buch practices continued in 1979,
 with new detainees. The national Government has publicly
 stated that it has never authorized the use of torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 There is an extensive body of evidence indicating
 that summary execution was a common practice during
 the years when large numbers of people were being
 detained by the security forces.
 Before early 1979, conditions of imprisonment were
 poor, and medical services rudimentary. In April
 1979, the government decreed uniform prison regulations
 which have led to a general improvement in prison
 conditions. There are some reports of continued abuse,
 but in general over-crowding has been reduced, medical
 care is better, and visits by family and legal counsel
 assured, as is the receipt of educational and writing
 material. The International Committee of the Red
 Cross maintains a regular program of prison visits.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Argentine Constitution, in Article 23, establishes
 the power of the Executive Branch to detain and hold
 prisoners under a "state of siege" (which has been
 in effect since 1974). The constitutional provisions
 are referred to as the National Executive Power ("PEN"
 for the Spanish words Poder Ejecutivo Nacional).
 The Executive has interpreted the Constitution, which
 places no explicit time limit on the duration of the
 PEN detention, as meaning it can hold prisoners under
 the PEN powers indefinitely. The Supreme Court,
 overruling a number of lower court decisions, has
 upheld this view, accepting broad and unsubstantiated
 charges of association with subversion as sufficient
 grounds for detention. Some PEN prisoners have been
 in jail without charge for several years -- including
 
 
 242
 
 a significant number detained before 1976.
 Since January 1, 1979, 44 persons, who have not since
 been located, have disappeared under circumstances
 suggesting that they were taken by security forces;
 most of these disappearances occurred in the first
 half of the year. There have also been charges that
 persons are being held clandestinely by the security
 forces. While there is no evidence that large numbers
 of persons are thus being held, hopes have been nourished
 by the experience of some prisoners who "disappeared",
 were presumed to be dead, and later -- in some cases
 months or years later -- reappeared as officially
 acknowledged prisoners held under the "PEN". Reports
 of the existence of clandestine camps have diminished
 in the last several months.
 In September 1979 the Government approved a law shortening
 the period required for a court finding of presumptive
 death; it gives the Government as well as relatives
 the right to initiate proceedings. The law has alleviated
 some personal hardships in legal and financial matters;
 however, it has drawn sharp criticism from Argentine
 human rights organizations, relatives, and the European
 Parliament because they feared the Government would
 use the law to arbitrarily close the cases of the
 disappeared.
 In 1979 the.Government reduced the number of prisoners
 being held under the "PEN" from 3,400 to about 1,300,
 freeing some, bringing some to trial, expelling others
 and allowing still others to leave the country. Perhaps
 another 1,000 are serving sentences after trial and
 conviction on charges of terrorism, or "subversive"
 political activity or associations. About 500 more
 are still in trial status.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The trial of those accused of subversion or terrorism
 may be held in civilian or military court. Civilian
 courts follow the customary legal provisions regarding
 open and fair trials. Argentine law, however, requires
 written rather than oral testimony, so that "open"
 has a different meaning and different consequences
 from those in other legal systems. The law provides
 that the civilian courts are independent, but the
 pressures accompanying trials involving subversion
 and terrorism make it difficult for the courts to
 maintain independence. Military tribunals, before
 which civilians may be tried, conduct their proceedings
 in secret. The defendants have access only to a military
 defense counsel who is usually not a lawyer. Defendants
 legally may be kept unaware of the evidence against
 them, in both military and civilian proceedings.
 An adequate defense in cases of terrorism or subversion
 is also difficult to ensure because many attorneys
 are reluctant to assume cases of this nature for fear
 of harassment and reprisals. The New York City Bar
 Association, in its report on the visit of its mission
 of lawyers to Argentina, concludes that some lawyers
 disappeared or were detained as the result of defending
 clients and causes unpopular with the Government,
 resulting in the intimidation of other lawyers.
 While the courts are constitutionally independent,
 in 1976 the Junta replaced all members of the Supreme
 
 
 243
 Court; it also removed a number of judges in lower
 courts, though most judges were retained. The courts
 have often upheld Executive interpretations of laws
 and the Constitution. However, there have been instances,
 when the courts challenged Government actions and
 interpretations of its powers. The most celebrated
 of these cases revolved around detained newpaper publisher
 Jacobo Timerman -- who was ordered released by the
 Supreme Court in an opinion the Junta upheld despite
 the reported objection of some members of the military.
 The Bar Association's report also highlights other
 problems associated with the lack of due process,
 but does state that "the ingredients for progress
 are present" in Argentina. In its report the Association
 cited the decline in abductions, the Government's
 commitment to expand procedural safeguards, and certain
 Supreme Court efforts to exert pressure in the direction
 of due process. The report recommends the removal
 of all detainees from executive detention, new trials
 for those convicted in military courts, an accounting
 for the disappeared, the termination of restrictions
 on the exercise of the right of option (see Section
 3b) and the reestablishment of the rule of law and
 constitutional guarantees.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home has traditionally been protected
 by Argentine law, custom and practice. The security
 forces, however, have often violated such sanctity
 during their anti-terrorist and anti-subversive operations.
 Though the number of intrusions dropped off during
 1979, information available suggests that violations
 of the home's sanctity in the form of raids and unauthorized
 searches remains a practice of these forces.
 2. Government Policies Toward the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education:
 Argentina is one of the most advanced of the newly
 industrialized nations. Indices of Argentina's
 standard of living are high. In 1978 per capita income
 in current dollars was $2,331 and Argentine governments
 have -- within the economic constraints of recent
 years -- sought to confront social needs.
 Unemployment in Argentina was only 1.8 percent in
 1978; the distribution of income has become less equal
 in recent years, in part as a result of government
 policies designed to reduce inflation and revitalize
 the country's productive sector. Toward that end,
 the Government has made an effort to open the economy
 to external competition by lowering tariff protection,
 reducing subsidies, and limiting state involvement
 in the economy. Inflation, however, is still high,
 running at about 160 percent for the year.
 The tax system is progressive and tax collections
 are increasingly effective, though compliance remains
 a problem.
 Education has been free and is widely available, although
 the Government is now moving to require tuition for
 university-level education. Illiteracy is virtually
 non-existent. Health care programs account for a
 major share of the Government's budget. Government,
 
 
 244
 private, and trade union medical care programs
 make treatment available and affordable to most of
 the population.
 There is a serious housing deficit in Argentina, much
 of it attributable to now defunct legislation that
 sustained rent control guidelines. Corruption in
 the public sector has declined significantly under
 the current government.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Religion, and Assembly
 The Argentine Constitution provides for these freedoms,
 but under both civilian and military governments they
 have been circumscribed since the imposition of the
 "state of siege" in November 1974. The climate of
 violence and repression in Argentina in recent years
 has made many Argentines fearful of exercising freedom
 of speech.
 Since 1976 the Government has intervened or confiscated
 a number of newspapers, notably La 0 inion, edited
 by Jacobo Timerman. Journalists avebeen among the
 Argentines who "disappeared". Although the press
 is not subject to prior official censorship, Government-
 imposed guidelines result in self-censorship. Newspapers
 have, however, actively criticized the Government
 on economic policy and have discussed political issues
 including, especially in recent months, human rights.
 Most foreign publications enter Argentina without
 censorship although occasionally some issues are censored
 for political and sexual content.
 The Argentine Constitution requires that the President
 be a member of the Catholic Church, and the majority
 of Argentines profess this faith. Other religions
 are required to register with the Government; all
 but one are permitted to function, and there are substantial
 minority religious groups, including a 450,000 member
 Jewish community. There are credible reports of anti-
 Semitic attitudes and behaviour in the security forces,
 but the Government publicy condemns religious prejudice
 and maintains officially correct relations with the
 organized Jewish community. The Government has refused
 to permit the legal registration of the Jehovah's
 Witnesses who number approximately 30,000 in Argentina.
 Their properties and meeting places have been closed,
 and Witness children have been expelled from provincial
 school systems for refusing to salute the flag and
 sing the national anthem. Although the Supreme Court
 has now ruled in one case that primary school children
 should be allowed to return to school, the Witnesses
 still report instances at the local level where children
 are expelled from school for failure to respect national
 symbols.
 Several human rights organizations, uniting activists
 and relatives of the disappeared, have played a significant
 role in Argentina over the past several years. Some
 leaders of these groups were harassed and threatened
 during 1979, and a police raid on the headquarters
 of three of the organizations in August raised questions
 about the future. The police action was ordered by
 a federal judge. The files of the organizations seized
 during the raids had not been returned to them by
 
 
 245
 December, when this report was prepared. The "Mothers
 of the Plaza de Mayo" -- relatives of disappeared
 persons -- who used to assemble in front of the Ministry
 of the Interior in the Plaza de Mayo, were forcibly
 prevented from using the Plaza late in 1978 and early
 1979 and were not permitted to return in 1979. Some
 of the "Mothers" themselves disappeared, including
 at least one during 1979.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Argentines are free to travel without restriction
 within the country and to leave without restriction.
 They are free to emigrate. The Argentine Constitution
 permits persons held under executive detention (PEN)
 to choose self-exile. Exercise of this "right of
 option" was denied by the current government until
 1978 and is still restricted through the use of an
 extensive screening process for all applicants. Many
 applications were denied during 1979, even though
 the applicants held documents authorizing them to
 enter other countries.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 After the March 1976 coup d'etat, the Government restricted
 or suspended most elements of the democratic political
 process. It has expressed its intention of moving
 the country back toward normal constitutional, democratic
 processes but has not established a timetable for
 reaching this goal. In December 1979, the Government
 promulgated a "political plan" containing broad guidelines
 and a commitment for an eventual return to civilian
 government. The plan promises implementing legislation
 in the second half of 1980 following a dialogue between
 military leaders and diverse civilian groups.
 The right of assembly for political groups has been
 suspended since March of 1976, but the Government
 has tolerated a low level of organized political activity
 by established political parties. Party leaders meet,
 spokesmen criticize a variety of government policies
 and actions, and proclamations are issued in the names
 of specific parties. Some informal meetings of party
 leaders have, however, been disrupted by the police,
 and the leaders detained for brief periods.
 Argentine women enjoy equal juridical status with
 men. Women's rights are not a contentious issue in
 Argentina, as jobs and educational opportunities,
 along with support systems that facilitate the simultaneous
 handling of job and family, are readily available.
 Sex discrimination is prohibited in education, politics
 and employment. Tradition and social customs still
 dictate that a woman's primary responsibility is to
 husband and home and limits women's participation
 in the work force.
 The government has intervened major trade unions,
 replacing high level union officials with military
 personnel, and strikes have been prohibited. In 1976,
 and again in mid-1979, the Government detained a number
 of important labor leaders (almost all have since
 been released). Strikes for wage increases have nevertheless
 occurred and nearly all have been settled without
 violence. On November 15, after more than three years
 of study, the Government issued a new Trade Union
 
 
 246
 law which sets the guidelines for Trade Union organization
 and lays the groundwork for lifting the suspension
 of union activities which has been in effect since
 the Armed Forces took power in 1976. It is not clear
 when the Government will lift the suspension of the
 right to strike and to bargain collectively. From
 the Government's point of view, the new law is designed
 to introduce more grass roots democracy and freedom
 of association for the workers than existed in the
 past; labor leaders, on the other hand, see it as
 an emasculation of union power, as it proscribes all
 political activity and greatly restricts control over
 social funds. The procedural steps for the implemention
 of the new law will not be clarified until the Ministry
 of Labor issues detailed regulations, which may take
 up to another 120 days to be drafted. The ICFTU has
 condemned the law as a violation of union rights.
 In September 1979, two major groups of union leaders
 merged to form the United Leadership of Argentine
 Workers (CUTA), a provisional committee which purports
 to speak in the name of the organized Argentine trade
 union movement in the absence of an officially functioning
 national central body. Although enjoying no official
 standing or recognition by the Government, CUTA is
 active in making its views known. For example, CUTA
 opposes the recent trade union law on grounds that
 it restricts freedom of association and the right
 to organize as defined in conventions 87 and 98 of
 the International Labor Organization as ratified by
 the Argentine Government. It also opposes the new
 law's prohibition against political action by trade
 unions.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 In late 1978, the Argentine Government invited the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission to visit Argentina.
 That visit took place from September 6 to 20, 1979.
 The Commission met with President Videla and other
 high-level government, human rights; religious, political,
 and labor officials, took testimony from family members
 of disappeared persons and from former prisoners,
 and visited several prisons and detention centers.
 The Commission will submit its formal report to the
 OAS in 1980. Argentina has not signed the American
 Convention on Human Rights.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 maintains an active program in Argentina, with government
 approval, on behalf of imprisoned persons. The ICRC
 also monitors prison conditions. The Government has
 usually received and facilitated the efforts of various
 groups and individuals seeking to investigate allegations
 of human rights abuse.
