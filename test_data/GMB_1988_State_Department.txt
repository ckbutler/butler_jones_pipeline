 THE GAMBIA
 The Gambia, a small country on the West African Coast, is a
 parliamentary democracy with an elected president and
 legislature. Until a bloody coup attempt in July 1981, The
 Gambia had a history of political stability under the
 leadership of its only President since independence in 1965,
 Sir Dawda Jawara. His ruling People's Progressive Party (PPP)
 has dominated the Parliament, but several opposition parties
 participate in the political process, including tT.o new
 political parties formed in 1986. In the parliamentary and
 presidential elections held in March 1987, President Jawara"
 was reelected by a large margin, and PPP candidates won an
 overwhelming majority in the Parliament. While there were
 some allegations of fraud, none was substantiated, and the
 elections were judged by most observers to be free and fair.
 Discussions on the process of confederation with Senegal have
 slowed in recent years and in 1988 focused on defense and
 economic issues. The Gambia has a small army with an attached
 naval unit organized and trained by British officers. One
 company of the Gambian army has been integrated with
 Senegalese troops into a confederal battalion led by a
 Senegalese officer. The Gambia also has a gendarmerie of
 about 600 members, headed by a Senegalese.
 The Gambia's estimated population of 784,000 consists largely
 of subsistence farmers growing rice and groundnuts (peanuts),
 the country's primary export crop. The Gambia continued in
 1988 a stringent program of economic reform which met the
 targets agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund, the
 World Bank, and other donors. The program has allowed The
 Gambia to reschedule its debt and receive critical new loans.
 The Gambia continued its good human rights record during
 1988. A treason trial held from January to May against four
 persons accused of plotting to overthrow the Government was
 marked by extensive efforts by the judge to assure a fair
 trial, including medical testimony to evaluate torture
 allegations and vigorous cross-examination by the defense of
 all prosecution witnesses. Two of the accused received
 20-year sentences, one received a 5-year sentence, and the
 fourth was acquitted.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no instances of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman,
 and degrading punishment. However, during the widely
 publicized 1988 treason trial, allegations of torture were
 made by two of the accused. The prosecution admitted that the
 defendants had been denied access to all outside contacts from
 
 
 128
 THE GAMBIA
 the time of their arrest until their interrogation was
 completed. But after an investigation by the court, including
 medical examinations and testimony by a reputable doctor, the
 torture allegations were dismissed. Nonetheless, arresting
 officers are sometimes reported to be rough in their treatment
 of suspects during questioning.
 Prison conditions are severe, and there have been occasional
 reports of mistreatment of prisoners. The Government
 expressly disapproves of such practices. The recent deaths of
 several inmates due to an inadequate diet at one prison led to
 a presidential visit and the creation of a commission to study
 prison conditions. The Commission had not completed its
 report by the end of 1988. The Government allows prison
 visits by representatives of the local Red Cross and by close
 family members.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Based on British legal practice, well-developed constitutional
 and legal procedures govern the arrest, detention, and trial
 of persons accused of crimes. Under these procedures, a
 detained person must be brought to trial within 1 week of
 arrest. This-waiting period, however, can be extended twice,
 making 21 days the maximum period of detention before trial.
 Amnesty International's 1988 report notes that the Goverment
 in 1987 detained several suspected members of the Movement for
 Justice in Africa, which was banned by the Government in
 1980. These suspects were later released and were never
 charged. There are some self-exiled opposition elements who
 would be arrested for suspected involvement in the 1981 coup
 attempt if they returned to the Gambia.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Three kinds of law operate in The Gambia: general, Shari'a,
 and customary law. Shari'a, governing Muslims, is observed in
 marriage and divorce proceedings. Customary law covers
 marriage and divorce for non-Muslims, inheritance, land tenure
 and utilization, local tribal government, and all other
 traditional civil and social relations. General law, based on
 English statutes and modified to suit the Gambian context,
 governs criminal cases and trials and most organized business
 practices. If there were a conflict between general law and
 Sharila, general law would prevail.
 The Constitution provides criminal defendants with the
 traditional rights of the English legal system, such as
 presumption of innocence, the right of the accused to be
 informed promptly of the charges, and the right to a public
 trial. If released on bail, an accused person may face
 charges indefinitely, since there apparently is no maximum
 time limit for completing the investigation and bringing the
 case to trial. Appeals normally proceed from the Supreme
 (trial) Court to the Court of Appeals, the country's highest
 tribunal.
 While the judiciary operates independently and is free of
 government interference, judges are appointed by the
 Government. Because of the shortage of legal professionals in
 The Gambia, the legal system is staffed in part by judges and
 
 
 129
 THE GAMBIA
 prosecuting and defense attorneys from other English-speaking
 countries having the same basic legal system as The Gambia.
 Authorities arrested 20 persons in January for allegedly
 plotting to overthrow the Government. Most were soon released
 on bail. Subsequently, four persons were accused of treason
 and tried. The defense was vigorous, and included the
 cross-examination of prosecution witnesses, the presentation
 of defense testimony and evidence, and a challenge to the
 admission of statements given by the defendants tb the
 police. The latter challenge was based on allegations that
 the statements had been coerced by the use of torture. Both
 sides presented evidence concerning these allegations, and the
 judge ruled that torture had not been proven. After over 3
 months of testimony, the trial judge found three of the
 defendants guilty and one not guilty. Two of those convicted
 were sentenced to 20 years, the third to 5 years.
 Currently there are no known political prisoners in The
 Gambia, and no prisoners are awaiting death sentences.
 Fifty-nine persons, serving sentences for crimes committed in
 connection with the 1981 coup attempt, remain in prison. All
 of those sentenced to death after that coup attempt have had
 their sentences commuted to life imprisonment.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides guarantees, which are respected in
 practice, against arbitrary search of person and property.
 The Constitution permits searches to which a suspect submits
 voluntarily or a mandatory search- if it is reasonably required
 in the interest of-national defense or public welfare. Under
 the criminal code, search warrants based on probable cause are
 issued by magistrates upon application by the police. There
 are a few police and military checkpoints in and around
 Banjul, which periodically stop drivers and search vehicles.
 The rights of family are of extreme importance in The Gambia's
 conservative Muslim society. Marriage, the raising of
 children, and religious instruction are regulated by a
 combination of personal preference and ethnic and religious
 tradition. The Government does not normally intrude in family
 matters. Family planning is encouraged but not enforced.
 There is no effort to censor or control personal correspondence
 or communications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press.
 The opposition parties have not been particularly active since
 the 1987 elections, but members freely express their opinions
 about the Government and ruling party.
 The Government does not attempt to censor published materials,
 whether they originate within or outside the country. In
 practical terms, The Gambia, with its small, mainly rural,
 largely illiterate, multilingual population, does not support
 an active press. There are no daily newspapers. The
 Government and the People's Progressive Party have newspapers
 which are published on a biweekly or monthly basis. There are
 several independent, intermittently published, mimeographed
 newssheets   Both the opposition and the independent press are
 
 
 130
 THE GAMBIA
 openly critical of the Government. A biweekly mimeographed
 paper, sponsored by a legal Socialist party, has been
 particularly vocal in condemning the governing party.
 There is, however, some degree of self-censorship in the
 government-owned media, which exercises restraint in reporting
 criticism of the Government. There is no television in The
 Gambia, although Senegalese broadcasts can'be received. The
 Government dominates the media through Radio Gambia. There
 have been no reported instances of government interference
 with the one commercial radio station, which mainly broadcasts
 music. Foreign magazines and newspapers are available in the
 capital. There is no university in The Gambia.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In general, there is no interference with the freedom of
 association and assembly, which is provided for in the
 Constitution. The Government almost always grants permits for
 meetings but requires that these meetings be open to the
 public. However, the Movement for Justice in Africa, which
 was implicated in the 1981 coup attempt, is banned. For a
 discussion of freedom of association as it applies to labor
 unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The constitutional provisions of freedom of conscience,
 thought, and religion are observed in practice. The State is
 secular, although Muslims constitute over 90 percent of the
 population. The schools provide instruction in the Koran for
 Muslim students. Christians, both Catholic and Protestant,
 freely practice their religion. There is a small Baha'i
 community in Banjul. Missionaries are permitted to carry on
 their various mission-related activities openly and freely.
 There is no evidence of discrimination in employment,
 education, or in other areas of Gambian life on religious
 grounds.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides for freedom of movement, subject to
 conditions protecting public safety, health, and morals.
 There is no restriction on freedom of emigration or freedom of
 return. Internally, police and military checkpoints exist in
 and around Banjul, but there is no evidence that police harass
 travelers. Because of historic and ethnic ties with the
 inhabitants of Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Sierra Leone, and
 Mauritania, people tend to move freely across borders, which
 are poorly marked and difficult to police. Under the
 Confederation Treaty of 1981, neither Gambians nor Senegalese
 need passports or visas to travel to or reside in the other
 country. The Gambia also recognizes the Economic Community of
 West African States' (ECOWAS) protocol which allows entry of
 ECOWAS country citizens up to 90 days without visas.
 Refugees fleeing persecution or unrest in other countries are
 not numerous in The Gambia, but the Government and people have
 a reputation for tolerance. There have been no reported cases
 of refugees being forcibly deported.

 THE GAMBIA
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The President and the Members of Parliament are popularly
 elected, as are the district councils and the chiefs, who
 exercise traditional authority in the villages and compounds.
 Presidential and parliamentary elections are held every 5
 years. Citizens must be at least 18 years of age to vote.
 Balloting is secret, and measures are employed to-assure that
 illiterate voters understand the choices and voting
 procedure. A functioning multiparty system exists in The
 Gambia even though the People's Progressive Party under the
 leadership of President Jawara has been in power since
 independence. The principal opposition party, the National
 Convention Party (NCP), contests both national and district
 elections. Two newly formed opposition parties, The Gambia
 People's Party (GPP) and the People's Democratic Organization
 for Independence and Socialism (PDOIS), contested for office
 in the March 1987 presidential and parliamentary elections.
 Campaigning was vigorous, active, and open to all parties.
 The ruling PPP won by an overwhelming majority and now holds
 31 of 36 elective seats in the Parliament. The NCP was the
 only opposition party to win seats. The opposition charged
 that the election was manipulated by the Government but did
 not provide evidence to support its allegations. The
 opposition also charged, with some justification, that the PPP
 benefited from its control of Radio Gambia and access to
 government vehicles for campaigning.
 Women participate actively in party and electoral politics.
 However, only one woman is an elected member of Parliament
 while three others, including the Minister of Health, were
 appointed by the President. The parliamentary secretary in
 the Presidentts Office is a woman. In addition,. there are
 women in prominent positions in the civil service as
 department heads and undersecretaries. There is a women's
 bureau in the Office of the President which actively promotes
 debate on women's issues.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is responsive to charges of human rights
 violations and permits visits of international human rights
 organizations to observe the conditions of detainees and the
 trial process. There were no reported requests by such"
 organizations for investigation of alleged human rights abuses
 in The Gambia during 1988. The Gambia is an active member of
 the United Nations Human Rights Commission and of the
 Organization of African Unity's (OAU) Commission on Human and
 Peoples' Rights. It took the initiative in persuading the OAU
 to locate the Commission in Banjul. The Government has also
 proposed the creation of a quasi-governmental African Center
 for Democracy and Human Rights Studies to be located in Banjul.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Gambian population is overwhelmingly Muslim and rural,
 with 85 percent living in villages. While personal initiative
 and choice are valued, there is considerable emphasis on the
 collective aspects of rights and privileges. Traditional
 views, especially about the role of women in society, are
 changing, but very slowly. Marriages are still often
 
 
 132
 THE GAMBIA
 arranged, and Muslim tradition allows for polygamy. In
 villages the women continue to perform work in the field and
 provide for the majority of local food production. Women also
 play an important role in the small, modern wage sector of the
 economy. Most are in semiskilled jobs (e.g., assembly work,
 handicraft shops, bus conductors), very few are in skilled
 trades (e.g., carpentry, auto repair), and a small but growing
 number are in midlevel supervisory positions (e.g., civil
 service, tourist hotels, and banks). There is no wage or
 benefits discrimination for jobs that are performed both by
 men and women. Females comprise over one-third of the
 students in primary school, and, with growing educational
 opportunities, women participate increasingly in the
 professions and in political life.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Labor Administration Act specifies that workers are free
 to form associations. However, less than 20 percent of the
 work force is engaged in the modern wage sector of the
 economy, where unions normally are active. The Labor
 Administration Act authorizes strikes. However, because of a
 required 14-day cooling off period (21 days in essential
 services), government conciliation efforts, and the poor
 bargaining strength of the unions, few strikes actually occur.
 The Gambian Workers' Confederation (GWC) and the Gambian
 Workers Union (GWU), the two main independent and competing
 umbrella organizations, are both recognized by the Government,
 with which they have a good working relationship. As a result
 of an incomplete merger effort, both organizations claim
 affiliation to the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU); however, the ICFTU continues to recognize the
 GWU as its affiliate. Both unions are affiliated with the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity. In addition, there
 are two other Gambian labor confederations, The Gambian Labor
 Confederation, which is affiliated with the World Federation
 of Trade Unions, and the Gambian Trade Union Congress, which
 is affiliated with the World Confederation of Labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Labor Administration Act also provides for collective
 bargaining. However, trade unions are small and fragmented
 and are a minor element in Gambian economic and political
 life. Over the last 2 years, for example, there has been no
 reported bargaining activity.
 Trade union rights are protected in law and practice. There
 is no export processing zone in The Gambia. Labor laws are
 applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no evidence of forced or compulsory labor in The
 Gambia.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Because of the paucity of secondary school opportunities, most
 children complete their formal education by age 14 and
 informally enter the work force. In the small industrial
 sector of the economy, labor cards authorizing employment of
 
 
 133
 THE GAMBIA
 youth are generally not issued until they reach the age of 16
 and never below the age of 14. This control of child labor
 does not apply to customary chores on family farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages and hours of work are determined by the Joint
 Industrial Council, pursuant to the Labor Administration Act,
 which has representation from employees, employers, and
 government. These minimum wages do not provide for a decent
 standard of living. But most Gambians, because of the
 extended family system, do not live on one worker's earnings.
 And the actual compensation paid is higher than the minimum
 wage. For example, the minimum wage for an ordinary unskilled
 laborer is approximately $1.50 per day for a 10-hour day, but
 in fact such workers now receive about $2.15 per day. Under
 the Factory Act, the Minister of Labor is given authority to
 regulate factory health and safety, accident prevention, and
 dangerous trades and to appoint inspectors to ensure
 compliance. However, this system is less than fully
 satisfactory, owing to the shortage of inspectors. The
 Government announced in 1987 that it would submit to
 Parliament a new labor code to replace obsolete labor laws;
 and a new industrial injuries compensation act to replace the
 existing Workmen's Compensation Act.
