 CONGO
 The People's Republic of the Congo declared itself Africa's
 first Marxist-Leninist state in 1969 following a coup d'etat
 by the late President Marien N'Gouabi. Power is ostensibly
 vested in the Congolese Labor Party, the sole political party
 allowed by the Constitution. However, operations between party
 congresses--held every five years--are controlled by the
 Central Committee, the Council of Ministers, and the Political
 Bureau, which is not mentioned in the Constitution. Many high
 party and government officials, including President Denis Sassou
 Nguesso, are military officers. Northern military officers in
 the last analysis, therefore, hold the key to power in the Congo.
 In practice, the Congo blends private enterprise and socialism
 on a base of African nationalism. Since N'Gouabi, coalition
 groups predominantly from the country's most sparsely populated
 northern region have wielded power over the densely populated
 southern region, although the present regime is making efforts
 to broaden its appeal and support outside the north.
 National, regional, and local assemblies are "elected" from
 single-party approved lists. While public policy decisions
 are usually made by the Central Committee and Political
 Bureau, assemblies at the local and regional levels may
 discuss issues before the decisions are made at the national
 level. Representatives of the assembly are chosen from all
 walks of life, including traditional leaders, peasants and
 workers, but selection is made by the party. The assembly
 has real impact on social and some economic issues. In general,
 however, its power to make decisions outside the will of the
 political leadership is restricted. Its decisions generally
 mirror the wishes of the Government.
 There was some improvement in the human rights situation in
 1983, especially as regards the right to religious worship and
 the circulation of ideas.  In addition, most of the political
 prisoners were released. Constraints on other individual liber-
 ties, however, continued.
 President Sassou used the occasion of the 20th anniversary
 of the Congolese revolution in 1983 to release two of the
 country's three known political prisoners. Only former
 President Joachim Yhomby-Opango remains under house arrest
 without trial. The Congo also reduced or voided sentences
 of a number of common criminals.
 Security check points and vehicle searches continue in many
 areas of Brazzaville. The security apparatus is patterned
 after those in eastern Europe but is less pervasive. The
 principal objective of the security service, which is under
 the direction of the Presidency, is to protect the state,
 e.g., to watch for any possible political dissident activity.
 Officially socialist, the Congo has a mixed economic system--
 state and private. With a per capita gross national product
 (GNP) of roughly $1,100, the Congo is relatively prosperous.
 The economy is based predominantly on petroleum, with about
 two-thirds of government receipts coming from oil revenues.
 One of the Government's priorities is to develop alternate
 sources of income. It continues to encourage private investment
 in an effort to improve economic conditions. The country has con-
 tinued to experience a real economic growth rate of some 8 percent
 per year since 1979. At 50 to 80 percent, the Congo has one of
 the highest literacy rates in Africa. Although technically all
 
 
 97
 land belongs to the state, individuals may own land if they
 build on it. They may engage in private business as long as
 those activities do not conflict with areas the Government has
 stamped for development by itself, e.g., exploitation of oil.
 RESPECT FOR UMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 During 1983 there were no reported instances of killing for
 political motives.
 b. Disappearance
 During 1983 there were no reported instances of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhumai, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The practice of beating suspects at police stations and the
 state security offices in the course of interrogations is
 not uncommon. Neither is it uncommon for the public and the
 police to beat thieves caught red-handed. The Congolese
 Information Agency bulletin reported the killing of one such
 thief in 1983. There continue to be cases of militiamen
 harassing both Congolese and foreigners. This harassment
 takes place in many instances to obtain money, cigarettes,
 and the like. At other times, it is to demonstrate authority.
 By the end of the year steps were under way to replace the
 militia at control points with trained policemen.
 Prison conditions in general are poor and there is a lack of
 adequate food, hygiene, and medical care. Prisoners generally
 have access to family, friends, attorneys, and others. In
 the past, political prisoners have been held incommunicado.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Whereas the Constitution guarantees protection against arbitrary
 indictment, arrest, and detention, in practice a warrant is not
 required to make arrests. There is a habeas corpus provision,
 but in cases involving the security of the state people arrested
 can be held without a court hearing. The Congo's only currently
 known political prisoner, former President Yhomby-Opango, who
 was accused of corruption and deviation from party directives,
 has been under detention without trial since March 1979. Two
 others detained at the same time were released in 1983 but
 restricted to their home districts. The Government reportedly
 is also holding two individuals on suspicion of involvement
 in two 1982 Brazzaville bombings. Individuals detained for
 non-political offenses are entitled to an attorney and are
 judged by a generally impartial judiciary. Given the slow
 pace of administrative processing, even though the Government
 has taken steps to increase the number of magistrates and to
 improve the processing of cases, persons awaiting trial are
 often detained for considerable periods, and sufficient funds
 for their upkeep have not been budgeted by the Government.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for a Supreme Court which is in
 practice an arm of the Government rather than an independent
 
 
 98
 body. By law, the right to a fair and public trial exists in
 all cases, but some prisoners have been held for months without
 trial. The legal system is not insulated from political inter-
 ference. Lawyers are permitted to argue circumstances surrounding
 the case. It is not uncommon to have a higher court reverse
 the verdict of a lower one in the event of irregularities.
 The Government also has a revolutionary court that handles the
 cases of state employees charged with corruption or deviation
 from party directives. There is scant information publicly
 available on how this court operates, or on the number of
 prisoners.
 The National Assembly passed a law in 1983 permitting, for
 the first time, the nomination of non-professional judges to
 any court below the Supreme Court. The stated purpose of this
 change was to "popularize' justice. According to the law,
 any Congolese citizen may now become a judge, but can decide
 cases only in collaboration with trained judges. Each nomination
 must be approved by the party.
 f. Arbitrary interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is little interference with privacy, family, hole, or
 correspondence by the Government. Individuals are not forced
 to participate in the party or its organs. There are only
 6,000 members in the party out of a population of 1.6 million.
 The Government is undertaking the voluntary regroupment of
 sparsely populated villages into large centers to enable it
 to provide more efficiently and more effectively essential
 services such as electricity. This plan has met with little
 or no objection from the population.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are restricted, despite guarantees
 by the Constitution. The ptate owns and controls the media
 (except for one church newspaper), and tends to follow a
 Karxist editorial policy. News reports in the government-owned
 media come from a variety of sources, including several
 foreign press agencies and French satellite feeds. The party
 is selective in the kinds of news and information it permits
 Congolese journalists to publish from foreign news sources.
 The public, however, has access to various outside sources of
 information. Television viewers, for instance, have access to
 Zairian media programs. Foreign journalists may enter the
 country in order to obtain appointments with officials. While
 the Government keeps control over the press, in practice foreign
 journalists can move freely about the country. Photography,
 however, is subject to security controls and permits must be ob-
 tained even for commonplace photos in the cities.. Although the
 Government allows some domestic criticism of policies and programs
 judged not to be politically sensitive, it does not allow its
 authority to be challenged. Journalists may raise issues
 and concerns only within the general guidelines of the party.
 There was an increase in local radio and television programs
 featuring dialogue between journalists and government officials
 in 1983.   While these discussions were relatively frank,
 they were limited to specific programs and policies already
 under scrutiny by the Government. The state censorship board
 reviews the content of nwspapers, movies, books, and records.
 Publications are subject to censorship if they contain articles
 
 
 9-
 which are critical, are contrary to the image the Government
 wishes to project either internally or externally, or judged
 to be contrary to social welfare. In practice considerable
 material which might normally be censored is allowed to
 circulate.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful assembly is limited by the state's
 perceived self-interest. Political meetings are limited to
 the party and its organizations. Government permission is
 not required for groups to assemble for religious and social
 purposes, but is required for use of official facilities.
 Government authorization is needed to start a formal club or
 organization. Given its past active political role, the labor
 movement is closely scrutinized and controlled by the Government
 and party. The Congolese Trade Union Confederation represents
 workers, but as an appendage of the state. It is prohibited
 from striking, although wildcat strikes occur with relative
 impunity. Unions have been effective to some extent, despite
 government controls, in expressing the desires of their member-
 ship. The Trade Union Confederation is represented in
 every ministry and state-owned enterprise and serves on
 mandatory boards which include a union representative along
 with a member of the administration and the party. Known as
 the *determinant trilogy", this structure is responsible for
 ensuring that the three major points of view are represented
 in the decision making process. The unions have been able to
 persuade the Government to provide workers with transportation,
 cafeteria facilities, increased medical benefits, vacation time
 with pay, travel, and housing. However, no group is allowed to
 form an independent, alternative union outside the party. Officers
 of the Confederation at the national level must be approved by the
 party. The Confederation is permitted to maintain relations with
 recognized international organizations such as the International
 Labor Organization (ILO).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by law. In practice, party
 members and adherents to the Jehovah's Witnesses are not allowed
 to exercise their right to worship. Beyond this, the party does
 not normally interfere in religious association. An example of
 official tolerance was the extensive celebration in 1983 of the
 hundredth anniversary of the evangelization of the Congo, at which
 government and party representatives were present and which was
 highly publicized in the official media. The Catholic Church, the
 largest congregation, maintains a seminary for the training of the
 clergy and has missions all over the country. Masses are held in
 the various local languages as well as French. The Catholic Church
 publishes the only independent newspaper, La Semaine Africaine.
 Missionaries are active in running private missions and clinics
 and other social services for the handicapped, etc. Some of these
 services are joint ventures between the church and the Government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government exercises limited control over the internal
 movement of its citizens, through identification card checks.
 Control points also are manned in Brazzaville at night to
 check movement. Military personnel movements are restricted
 both internally and externally. Congolese citizens who wish
 to travel abroad require exit authorization from the Office
 
 
 100
 of State Security. Por the average citizen this is an easy
 process. However, those who may be suspected of political
 motives may encounter some difficulty. Government employees
 traveling abroad must obtain an 'ordre de mission" from the
 appropriate government office. Passports are required to be
 returned to the state security after the traveler's return.
 In practice, this is not always done.
 The Congo is the home of numerous exiles and refugees, mostly
 from surrounding central African states. Most refugees, including
 some Zairians, are permitted to travel to other countries for settle-
 ment under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees. The Government maintains close surveillance of re-
 fugees, particularly since the Congo does not wish to be accused
 by its neighbors of harboring dissidents or exporting its Marxist
 ideology. While usually refugees are safe in the Congo, one Ugandan
 refugee was quoted by a British magazine as saying that he was
 beaten by security personnel and was forced to flee the country as
 a stowaway on an airliner.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The Congo is governed by an elite group of party and cabinet
 officials. The people do not have the right to change their
 government through democratic processes. Military officers
 occupy key positions among the ruling group and help ensure its
 continuation in power. Opportunities for political involvement
 by Congolese citizens are limited to the Marxist-Leninist Congolese
 Labor Party, including the national, regional, and local assemblies
 and the "mass* organizations. No other political parties are per-
 mitted to operate. Party membership, which presently numbers
 approximately 6,000, is highly controlled on the basis of loyalty
 and performance. However, power is believed to be effectively
 wielded by the Central Committee and a 10-member Political Bureau.
 This body, chosen by the Central Committee, is not mentioned in
 the Constitution but is the center of political power. Its deci-
 sions are binding on state and party organizations. The party
 President is also President of the Republic, Chief of State, and
 President of the Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers,
 the highest executive organ of the state, consists of the
 President, the Prime Minister and other ministers. It oversees
 the day-to-day operations of the Government. In times of
 political crisis, the military has acted as the ultimate arbiter.
 Citizens may exercise influence on their government through personal
 contact with various officials and public disgruntlement over spe-
 cific issues, e.g., housing and the civil law code.
 The last "elections" were the 1979 elections for the Constitution
 and local, regional, and national assemblies, with candidates
 chosen from single-candidate party approved lists. Opposition
 groups are illegal and not known to exist within the Congo.
 Some elements of opposition to the Government reside in Europe.
 No women are ministers or members of the Political Bureau, one
 woman is a member of the Central Committee and one is a vice
 president of the National Assembly. Some women occupy senior
 government and party positions such as Counselor to the President.
 Under the Constitution, women have the same rights as men in the
 private, political and social domains, and for equal work they
 are entitled to the same social welfare rights. There is a dis-
 parity, however, between salaries for men and women, and women
 are relegated to a secondary role in society. There are 12 women
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 101
 relegated to a secondary role in society. There are 12 women
 holding high positions in the courts and one Congolese Embassy is
 headed by a woman ambassador. In secondary schools increasing
 numbers of young women are enrolled in technical courses, and
 university attendance among women continues to rise.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Government has demonstrated some willingness to respond to
 human rights inquiries on a case-by-case basis. Although letters
 from Amnesty International regarding the case of a Cabindan who
 had been arrested for an attack on the Congo's railroad in the
 late 1970's went unanswered by the Government, all Cabindans
 held by the Congolese have apparently been released. In 1983
 Amnesty International was concerned by the use of detention
 without trial, allegations of torture, and the death penalty.
 Freedom House rates the Congo "not free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 With a population of some 1.6 million and a per capita income of
 approximately $1,100 the Congo is one of Africa's more prosperous
 countries. The economy is based predominately on petroleum, which
 accounts for about 90 percent of export earnings and two-thirds of
 government receipts. In 1982 the Government inaugurated a five-
 year plan designed to rationalize investment and create a viable
 economy to sustain the country after the depletion of known petrol-
 eum reserves in the 1990's. The plan focuses on infrastructure,
 agriculture, forestry, and light productive industry. The Govern-
 ment encourages private investment and offers special incentives
 in areas of prime interest, such as forestry and agriculture.. The
 Congo has had a real economic growth rate of some eight percent per
 year since 1979, and major urban centers appear prosperous.
 There is a marked disparity between urban and rural standards of
 living, however, and resultant heavy migration from the country-
 side. This rural migration ia straining social services in the
 cities and depriving the rural areas of farmers. Approximately
 60 percent of the economy remains in the private sector.
 Recent economic growth has not been equally distributed among the
 population. It is estimated that the average per capita GNP of
 rural Congolese, constituting some 30 percent of the population,
 is less than one-twelfth that of their urban counterparts. Within
 the cities, however, there is a wide, if uneven distribution of
 the growing wealth, primarily through civil service salaries and
 the strong familial welfare system which embraces even distant
 relatives. While northern ethnic groups have the upper hand polit-
 ically, there is little evidence of systematic tribal, ethnic,
 racial, or other discrimination intended to disadvantage economic-
 ally a particular group.
 Improvements in 1983 irr-health and nutrition contributed to the
 average life expectancy of over 59 years. The fertility of the
 soil, abundance of indigenous fruits, vegetables and fish, and
 the reliabiity of water sources around the country have all
 fostered a naturally hospitable environment for a sparse popula-
 tion. Congolese diet emcompasses 99 percent of caloric require-
 ments, although in rural areas, where cassava is the major staple,
 protein intake is not always sufficient. Safe water is available
 to less than one half of urban Congolese and fewer than 10 percent
 of those in rural areas.
 
 
 102
 Despite an infant mortality rate of 114 per 1,000, the population
 is now growing at a rapid rate of three percent annually. The
 de livery of health services has been facilitated by the urban
 character of the population, although some rural health facilities
 still reflect the lower overall quality of life outside the cities.
 The most prevalent diseases are malaria and respiratory diseases.
 Many Congolese continue to rely on traditional as well as modern
 medicine.
 The Congolese have largely maintained the educational system left
 to them by the French after independence, and have an historically
 high literacy rate (variously estimated at between 50 and 80 per-
 cent for the adult population). The emphasis on education is high,
 and many children who do not finish school return as adults to
 continue their studies. Attendance is high among both male and
 female students. There are primary schools all over the country,
 and adjusted primary enrollment, including adult enrollment, was
 estimated at over 156 percent of the school age population in
 cities in 1982. The figure drops off in the countryside.
