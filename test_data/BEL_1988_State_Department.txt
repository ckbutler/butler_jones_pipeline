 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional
 monarch. In practice, the Council of Ministers (Cabinet), led
 by the Prime Minister, is responsible for government
 decisions. The Cabinet holds office as long as it retains the
 confidence of Parliament, which includes 11 political parties,
 generally split along linguistic and ideological lines. All
 governments since World War II have been coalitions of
 Christian Democrats and Socialists, or Christian Democrats and
 Liberals, with occasional participation by regional parties.
 Domestic security in Belgium is primarily the responsibility
 of the national paramilitary Gendarmerie, the judicial police,
 and a host of municipal police forces. The armed forces have
 no role in domestic law enforcement.
 The series of terrorist attacks and bombings by the Belgian
 Communist Combat Cells (C.C.C.) that plagued Belgium in 1984
 and 1985 ended with the-arrest of the C.C.C.'s reputed leaders
 in early 1986. On September 26, 1988 the C.C.C. members
 appeared in Belgian court to answer charges for 25 terrorist
 attacks in which 2 people were killed and 28 injured. They
 were found guilty and sentenced to prison.
 Respect for human rights is provided for in the Constitution
 and laws and is observed in practice. Belgium continues to
 contend with the social, economic, and racial pressures linked
 to the presence of a largely Turkish and North African
 immigrant population.
 RESPECT FOR HUJMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Neither the authorities nor officially sanctioned groups
 engage in killing for political motives. A British
 noncommissioned officer was killed in Ostend in August,
 reportedly by Provisional Irish Republican Army gunmen. The
 perpetrators have not been caught.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, or clandestine detentions did not
 occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Penal Code prohibits deliberate mistreatment or injury of
 another by public officials and private individuals. Belgian
 authorities vigorously investigate any charges of police
 brutality and take disciplinary action against the
 perpetrators.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is ensured by
 law. Arrested persons must be brought before a judge within
 24 hours or released. Belgian law provides for pretrial
 confinement only when a person is apprehended in the
 commission of a criminal act, there is a risk that the suspect
 
 
 986
 BELGIUM
 will prove a danger to the community or will flee the
 jurisdiction, or the case involves one of a number of serious
 offenses specified by law. The premise for such confinement
 is subject to monthly review by a panel of judges.
 In practice, there has been concern among local human rights
 groups and parliamentarians that pretrial detention is
 sometimes abused. The Government has announced draft
 legislation to limit pretrial detention and increase the
 possibilities of bail. This legislation was submitted to the
 Parliament in late 1987 and is still under consideration.
 Exile is not permitted by law. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial, including the right to counsel, is
 assured by law and honored in practice. A suspect is charged,
 if the evidence so warrants, when the preliminary judicial
 investigatory phase is completed. Charges are clearly and
 formally stated. No one is imprisoned because of political
 beliefs.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy by the State
 is specified by law and respected in practice. The
 Constitution specifically provides for the inviolability of
 the home, except in cases laid down and regulated by law. The
 law forbids searches of private homes at night, except in
 special circumstances. Warrants issued by a judge are
 required unless the inhabitants of the domicile agree to the
 search. The Penal Code provides penalties for all violations
 of the home by officials as well as by private persons.
 Monitoring of telephones and interference with mail also are
 strictly prohibited. The bill introduced in 1987 to allow law
 enforcement agencies to use court-approved wiretaps under
 certain circumstances lapsed when the previous government
 fell, and it was not reintroduced.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are assured by law and respected in practice.
 Varying political, religious, philosophical, and artistic
 views are permitted free public expression, and there is no
 political censorship of the media. There are, however,
 prohibitions on publications and productions deemed to
 undermine "public order" (e.g., explicit pornography and
 incitement to violence). There are laws against libel,
 provisions for a citizen's right of reply to media criticism,
 and restrictions on criticism of government policies by civil
 servants.
 Belgium has state-owned radio and television networks, but
 there is no direct government control of program content.
 Programs are supervised by boards of directors which represent
 the main political, linguistic, and opinion groups. The
 Government has a representative on the boards but no veto
 power.
 
 
 987
 BELGIUM
 Private radio stations, legalized in 1985, operate with
 government licenses. Private television was legalized in 1987
 legislation, and already exists in the Francophone community
 of Belgium. Private television in the Flemish community is
 planned for 1989. Most urban homes have access'by cable to
 television from other European countries.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political, civic, religious, artistic, social, and other
 special interest groups are permitted free public assembly,
 subject to regulations concerning public order. Groups
 protesting government policies or actions are free from
 harassment and persecution, although permits are required for
 open-air assemblies. For a discussion of freedom of
 association as it applies to labor unioos, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Belgium has a long tradition of religious tolerance. The
 Christian, Jewish, and Muslim religions are accorded a
 "recognized" status in law, which includes a government
 subsidy. Minority "non-recognized" religions enjoy full
 freedom to practice and- are not subject to harassment or
 persecution. Those claiming "no religious preference" have
 demanded official status and subsidies, which the Government
 plans to grant through legislation.
 In 1988 the Government reduced the length of time
 conscientious objectors'were required to perform community
 service in lieu of military service. However, this period
 remains longer than the time served by military draftees.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Belgian citizens enjoy freedom of travel within the country and
 internationally, including the right of voluntary repatriation.
 A law took effect in May 1985 that gave municipalities in the
 greater Brussels region the right to refuse to register new
 foreigners--defined as citizens of non-European Community
 countries--as residents. Such registration is required of all
 persons residing in Belgium, with some exceptions. Six
 municipalities took advantage of the new law, which in effect
 limits the freedom of foreigners to decide where they wish to
 reside in Belgium.
 In the past Belgium has welcomed refugees and granted political
 asylum to Applicants of many nationalities and races. In
 1987, however, Belgium modified its asylum policy. Previously,
 anyone claiming to be a political refugee was allowed in the
 country to pursue his or her claim with the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which adjudicated all
 such requests for the Government of Belgium. The process
 often took more than a year, during which time the asylum
 seeker was able to remain in Belgium and receive all Belgian
 social benefits. In 1987, 6,352 people took advantage of this
 system, of whom 2,733 ultimately received refugee status.
 A new asylum law, which went into effect in 1988, transferred
 the power of adjudication from the UNHCR to a government
 commission. The new law allows border police to refuse at the
 port of entry asylum seekers who use false documents or make
 clearly fraudulent applications, and provides for fining
 
 
 988
 BELGIUM
 carriers who transport improperly documented aliens. For the
 first 8 months of 1988, the number of asylum seekers dropped
 to 2,906 and the authorities believe that at the end of the
 year the total number will be about 20 percent under that of
 1987.
 The immigration issue was raised during the 1987 parliamentary
 elections and the 1988 municipal campaigns. Small rightwing
 parties, including the Flemish Bloc, advocated the
 repatriation of immigrants, but this position received no
 support from the major parties. A proposal by the Ecologist
 parties to extend voting rights to immigrants also was
 rejected by the major parties.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Participation in the political system is open to all citizens.
 Direct popular elections for parliamentary seats (excluding 77
 of the 183 Senate seats apportioned by other means) are held
 at least every 4 years under a system of universal, secret,
 and compulsory suffrage for all adults (age 18 and over).
 Unweighted voting (one person/one vote) has been in effect
 since 1919 for men, and since 1949 for women. Under law and
 practice, opposition parties are free to operate without
 constraints or repression.
 The problems of Dutch- and French-speaking regions pose
 significant challenges for the State. All major institutions,
 including political parties, are divided along linguistic
 lines. There are special provisions for Dutch-, French-, and
 German-speaking councils at the regional level. Regional and
 linguistic needs are taken into account in national political
 and economic decisions.
 The case involving the refusal of the elected mayor of a
 mainly French-speaking town to use its official language
 (Dutch) has deeply divided Belgium's two communities over the
 last 2 years. The situation resulted in the fall of the
 Government in October 1987. New elections were held in
 December of that year, and a new coalition government was
 finally installed in May 1988. The linguistic issue continues
 to be one of Belgium's major sociopolitical problems, causing
 recurring discord between the Dutch- and French-speaking
 communities.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No requests have been made for outside investigation of the
 human rights situation in Belgium. There are several active
 independent human rights groups, and they consider the
 Government open to discussion of any human rights question.
 The Government has been active in the United Nations and other
 international forums in promoting human rights. The Belgian
 delegate to the U.N. Human Rights Commission is a candidate
 for the presidency of the Commission in 1988.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Belgium is a culturally vibrant, pluralistic society in which
 individual differences are respected and linguistic rights are
 protected. Some 57 percent of Belgians are native Dutch
 
 
 989
 BELGIUM
 speakers living primarily in the northern provinces that
 constitute Flanders. The 42 percent of French speakers live
 mostly in the capital, Brussels, and the southern provinces
 called Wallonia. The small minority of German speakers lives
 along the eastern border. Language differences have been the
 subject of hundreds of laws over the last century, leading to
 a fairly rigid structure designed to protect each language
 group from cultural, economic, or political dominance by the
 others.
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 residents regardless of race, sex, religion, language, social
 status, or ethnic background. Some 25 percent of the residents
 of Brussels, the nation's largest city, are foreigners. Many
 of these are North African and Turkish immigrants. The
 immigrant population--generally poorer, less skilled, and less
 educated than average--is increasingly the focus of public
 debate concerning how to encourage greater assimilation into
 Belgian society. During the last two political campaigns in
 Belgium, charges of racism have been leveled at some minor
 parties because of their anti-immigrant positions.
 Belgium is a leading advocate of women's rights both within
 the country and in international meetings on the subject. A
 number of commissions have been established to ensure that
 women's rights are protected and particularly to oversee
 women's education and working conditions. Women's average
 wage rates in nonagricultural employment in 1986 amounted to
 74.3 percent of those of men. Several women serve as national
 secretaries of Belgium's two largest labor confederations.
 Women are represented in business and in political life.
 There are 32 female members of Parliament out of 395 members.
 Within the Parliament, all female members form a committee
 which advises the Government on women's issues. Five women
 hold Cabinet posts in the current Government. To show the
 importance attached to promoting women's rights
 internationally, a consultative commission for the condition
 of women has been made part of the Ministry of Foreign
 Affairs. This commission advises the Government on
 international women's issues.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely and to strike.
 With 75 percent of its labor force organized, Belgium is one
 of the most unionized countries in the world and has a long
 tradition of democratic trade union elections. Labor unions
 striking or protesting government policies or actions are free
 from harassment and persecution, although permits are required
 for open-air assemblies.
 Labor unions are strong and independent of the Government but
 have important informal links with and influence on many of
 the major political parties. Unions in Belgium are affiliated
 with the major international bodies representing labor, such
 an the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and
 the World Confederation of Labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to orgenize and bargain collectively is recognized
 and exercised freel , although government austerity measures
 sometimses limit or alter the results of collective bargaining.
 
 
 990
 BELGIUM
 Labor legislation and practice are uniform throughout Belgium.
 The right to due process and judicial review are guaranteed
 for all protected activity. In the first instance, the Labor
 Court reviews matters relating to collective bargaining.
 Parties then have the right of judicial review by the regular
 courts. Effective mechanisms exist for adjudicating disputes
 between labor and management.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not
 occur in Belgium.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment of children is 16; children may
 work and study part time from age 16 to 18. The Belgian Labor
 Court monitors compliance with national laws and standards.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Belgian working hours, mandated both by law and through
 collective bargaining agreements, are among the shortest in
 Europe, averaging about 38 hours a week. There are generous
 provisions for minimum wage, currently at $873 a month for
 full-time workers over the age of 21. This provides a decent
 standard of living for minimum wage workers. Generous
 vacation and unemployment benefits are also guaranteed.
 Adequate health and safety legislation exists, supplemented by
 collective bargaining agreements. Health and safety
 committees are mandated by law in companies with more than 50
 employees. Belgium continues to suffer from a large budget
 deficit, slow. economic growth, and high unemployment,
 currently at 11 percent. Governmental policies to promote
 employment and an extensive system of unemployment
 compensation and other social benefits have served to minimize
 serious individual financial hardship.
