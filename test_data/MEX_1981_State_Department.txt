 MEXICO
 The Mexican constitution provides separation of powers
 for the three branches of the federal government, as
 well as between the federal government and the state
 governments. In practice, it is a centralized system
 in which ultimate authority rests with the president,
 who cannot be re-elected after a six year term. The
 Mexican political process has been controlled by one
 governing party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party
 (PRI), since 1929.
 The PRI permits and sometimes encourages opposition par-
 ties, but there have been no opposition victories in
 gubernatorial or presidential elections. Victories by
 opposition parties at the local level are increasing.
 In some elections, however, it is alleged that the PRI
 candidates have been declared the winners, even though
 in reality they did not receive the most votes. The
 electoral reform initiated by President Lopez Portillo
 was implemented at the federal level in 1979 and has
 been adopted by almost all state governments. It guarantees
 minority parties representation based upon the number
 of votes they receive, including a minimum of 25 percent
 of the seats in the federal chamber of deputies. But
 even with the electoral reform, Mexico has been and continues
 to be virtually a one-party state.
 Over the past 40 years, Mexico has changed from a largely
 agricultural society into an urbanized industrial state.
 New petroleum resources discovered in the last decade
 place Mexico sixth among oil-producing countries and
 present unique possibilities and challenges for Mexico's
 future. Population expanded greatly over the past decade.
 The growth rate has declined to slightly less than three
 percent per annum, as government-sponsored family planning
 programs gain greater acceptance.
 The present administration has also formulated programs
 to distribute an increased portion of the nation's resources
 to a greater number of people, to increase agricultural
 and industrial productivity and to provide basic govern-
 ment and social services in order to meet the rising
 expectations of the people and to overcome badly skewed
 income distribution. Mexico's constitution and laws
 provide for social justice and equality, and organizations
 concerned with human rights violations are allowed to
 publicize their charges. According to human rights groups,
 the number of missing persons increased from 481 in 1980
 to 500 in 1981. Mexico has traditionally provided asylum
 for dissidents from other countries, especially Latin
 America. It also participates actively in multilateral
 human rights activities.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are persistent allegations of mistreatment by individual
 law enforcement officials during the arrest and interrogation
 stage. Those suspected of terrorism or drug-trafficking
 reportedly are more likely to be physically mistreated.
 The constit,tion prohibits torture, and the government
 has prosecuted some police officers who obtained evidence
 or confessions through torture or other unconstitutional means.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The government continues to upgrade, remodel and replace
 penal institutions. In many prisons, overcrowding, in-
 adequate sanitary facilities and unsatisfactory diet
 still exist. Prisoners are provided medical care, and
 those who have the means may purchase additional food
 and other items. Conjugal visits are allowed.
 There are credible reports of physical mistreatment of
 prisoners and of verbal threats by the police to the
 detainee or family members. There were 136 cases of
 confirmed or alleged mistreatment of American citizens
 from July 1, 1980, to August 31, 1981 -- an increase
 from the previous year's total of 81. In seven cases
 the allegations were confirmed. American prisoners are
 sometimes reluctant to report mistreatment and to request
 that consular officers lodge official protests with Mexican
 officials, for fear of reprisal. Reports indicate that
 mistreatment of Americans is most frequent in the Federal
 District and the border states of Baja California Norte,
 Tamaulipas and Chihuahua.
 There is no indication that the length of sentence or
 the severity of treatment varies due to race, nationality,
 sex or religion.
 c. Disappearances
 Human rights groups, opposition political parties and
 the press continue to report the disappearance of persons.
 The Defense Committee for Political Prisoners, the Perse-
 cuted, Disappeared and Political Exiles (DCPPPDPE) claims
 and presents documentation to show that 500 people (not
 a rounded figure) are now unaccounted for, or "disappeared"
 while in the hands of security forces over the past decade.
 The number claimed in 1980 was 481.
 These groups claim that the Mexican government has clan-
 destinely arrested and imprisoned political dissidents
 -- including those the government believes to be terrorists
 and guerrillas. They also claim that the government,
 in causing the "disappearances" either through murder
 or secret imprisonment, is using the armed forces as
 its instrument. There is no evidence that the armed
 forces have been so used in the period covered by this
 report.
 The government does not acknowledge the existence of
 disappeared persons. It claims that those who are unac-
 counted for were either killed in encounters with security
 forces, changed their names, went underground or sought
 voluntary exile. For those it claims were killed in
 encounters with security forces, government officials
 have not provided proof of death, such as death certifi-
 cates or grave sites.
 There have been few terrorist incidents in Mexico in
 the last few years, and there is presently no major guerrilla
 activity in the country, although Guatemalan insurgents
 have been entering the Mexican border states.
 The government denies that civilians have been imprisoned
 at military detention centers; however, many civilians
 have claimed that they have been imprisoned secretly
 and without due process at Military Camp No. 1.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The government claims it arrests persons only for crimes,
 such as robbery, kidnapping and assassination, although
 
 
 479
 it admits that some of these crimes may have been committed
 for political purposes. It is impossible to say how
 many are now imprisoned for politically-related crimes,
 but the number is thought to exceed 1,000. In the past
 several years, there have been no trials for the crimes
 of rebellion, sedition, mutiny, terrorism, sabotage or
 treason. A leader of the DCPPPDPE insists that there
 are about 40 persons being held by the government without
 formal charges.
 The constitution prohibits the detention of an individual
 for more than three days without formal charges. Despite
 this, individuals, including American citizens, have
 often been held longer than three days without charges.
 There have also been instances of arbitrary arrest for
 the purpose of extortion. According to statements from
 public officials, particularly in the Mexico City area,
 an unspecified number of offending police and security
 officers have been dismissed on grounds of corruption
 or extortion. Mexican law also permits the detention
 of those the authorities have reason to suspect of planning
 crimes, a form of preventive detention. There is no
 evidence that It is being used for political reasons.
 A non-governmental Mexican institute for the study of
 Samparo" (the writ of amparo" is similar but not identical
 to a writ of habeas corpus) was established in 1980 to
 make recommendations for improving procedures, as well
 as to point out corrupt practices.
 Since the 1910 Mexican revolution there have been many
 cases of illegal occupation of unused land in both urban
 and rural areas. Those who carry out the seizures do
 so in the hope that the government will transfer the
 land to them. In recent years the government has taken
 firm action against such trespassers.
 There have been several cases in the past year of detention
 of groups of peasants involved in illegal land takeovers.
 The length of time they were held, with or without charges,
 varied. There is no accurate estimate of the number
 detained for this activity.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The accused in Mexico is generally accorded a fair public
 trial. Trial procedures based upon Roman civil law in-
 volve a paper exchange from the defense and prosecution
 to the court, including witnesses' written statements
 and expert opinion. The law allows for oral testimony,
 but it is not common.  Jury trials are rare. It is alleged
 that signed confessions are sometimes exacted through
 torture, mistreatment and coercion. Evidence obtained
 illegally is not normally admissible in the courts unless
 substantiated by corroborating testimony.
 Defendants have the right to counsel, either by a private
 or a public defender. The few public defenders have
 large case loads; consequently counsel is not always
 able to give full attention to a client's case. Adequate
 legal counsel is, of course, available to those who can
 afford it.
 By law the Mexican judiciary is independent, but there
 have been occasional reports that the executive branch
 influenced judicial determinations. There are no known
 instances of civilians being tried by military courts.
 The constitution requires that trial and sentencing be
 completed within 12 months of arrest for crimes that
 carry a penalty of more than two years imprisonment.
 As of September 1981 there were 53 Americans in Mexican
 jails who had been held more than 12 months but who had
 not received final sentencing. In most of these instances,
 
 
 480
 as in cases involving Mexicans, the causes are delaying
 tactics by co-defendants, inefficient court procedures,
 insufficient judges and lawyers, and the prisoners' inability
 to raise the money which government officials have set
 as a condition for bringing the case to trial.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution prohibits entry of a home without warrant.
 Warrants may be issued by federal or state judges, depend-
 ing on the type of case. These safeguards are generally
 observed, except in cases of hot pursuit.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly are guar-
 anteed by law. The press openly criticizes cabinet secretaries
 and the PRI leadershp, but a sitting president is traditionally
 immune from direct press criticism. In early 1981 a
 book appeared which was critical of the president and
 his family. Subsequently, the author's column disappeared
 from the Mexico City daily in which it had been appearing,
 and he left the country. The book has continued to circulate
 and has become a best seller. Political and social commentary
 is common. The federal government retains indirect control
 over the print media through its monopoly of newsprint
 and its ability to direct government advertising. Political
 parties are required by law to publish journals, and
 this effort is, in part, subsidized by the government.
 Direct criticism of local government varies from state
 to state depending on the pressures exerted by the state
 governor and the inclinations of the owners of the principal
 state publications.
 Radio, television, publications and movies are subject
 to censorship on moral grounds. A presidential decree
 of July 1981 revised regulations concerning publication.
 Originally thought to be an intensification of the already
 existing censorship, its chief application to date has
 been to impose greater restrictions on sex-related publications.
 In September 1980 the government attempted to limit
 demonstrations to a specific downtown area of Mexico
 City. Municipal and federal authorities claimed the
 curbs were necessary to alleviate traffic congestion
 caused by numerous demonstrations. Political parties
 and special interest groups have so far ignored this
 government directive, and so far their demonstrations
 have been tolerated.
 Freedom of worship is protected by the constitution and
 observed. The constitution, however, denies the clergy
 participation in politics and prohibits them from criticiz-
 ing basic laws, public authorities or the government
 in general. When the Catholic Church and individual
 bishops broke their longstanding silence on political
 matters by making public statements criticizing what
 the churchmen saw as the government's lack of concern
 for social and economic justice, the government and
 the PRI reacted strongly but so far only verbally. Members
 of the clergy may not be elected to federal office.
 Religious organizations may not own real estate, and
 the number of clergy residing in a state may be regulated
 by the state legislature. The constitution limits clerical
 practice to persons who are Mexican by birth, and prohibits
 religious organizations from operating pre-university
 schools. Neither of the latter two prohibitions is strictly
 enforced. There is no evidence of governmental interference
 with academic inquiry in the natural or social sciences.
 
 
 481
 Organized labor both influences and is influenced by
 the government. PRI-affiliated unions include approxi-
 mately 95 percent of organized labor; this affiliation
 is voluntary, although individual union members whose
 unions are affiliated are consequently enrolled in the PRI
 whether they want to be or not. The government's only
 role in union elections is to certify the results. On
 occasion, the government has recognized PRI-affiliated
 unions over non-PRI unions in jurisdictional disputes.
 The right to strike is rarely impeded, but the government
 has a role in the resolution of major strikes. The govern-
 ment does not seem to have a bias toward either labor
 or management in settling strikes. PRI-affiliated unions
 regularly use the closed shop system to prevent dissident
 leaders from challenging their predominance. Expulsion
 of members and dissident leaders is seldom decided by
 majority vote. During 1981 the government refused to
 permit the registration of a communist-led National Union
 of University Workers (incorporating academics, researchers,
 administration and manual workers) and passed a new law
 restricting university unions to a single university,
 disallowing national representation. The new law estab-
 lishes collective bargaining and the right to strike
 for the university workers.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The constitution guarantees the right of Mexican citizens
 to travel anywhere and to emigrate freely. There is
 no significant violation of that right.
 Mexico has a long historical tradition of providing asylum
 to political refugees, both in Mexico and in its embassies
 abroad. Numerous refugees have been admitted, and there
 is a sizeable exile colony of Spaniards, Chileans, Cubans,
 Uruguayans and Venezuelans. With the turmoil in Central
 America, many Salvadorans and Guatemalans are now in
 Mexico. However, when Guatemalans in large numbers began
 to flee into Mexico in 1981, the Mexican government regarded
 them as undocumented economic migrants and has returned
 most of them to Guatemala. Mexico has allowed some Guatemalan
 political exiles to remain in the country. Many Mexicans
 viewed the expulsion of the Guatemalans as contrary to
 Mexico's tradition of providing safehaven; the commissioner
 of the government's refugee relief agency resigned because
 of his disagreement with the government's policy.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Mexico's political system permits, and to a degree encour-
 ages, the formation of opposition political parties.
 However, the political life of the country and its institu-
 tions are dominated by the PRI, which has governed since
 1929. Within the PRI and the government there are many
 ideologies. Internal debate about policy is permitted,
 and public opinion is considered when decisions are made.
 Two of the 14 parties that sought conditional registration
 in 1981 were registered, bringing to nine the number
 of political parties that can present candidates in elections.
 The government urges citizens to vote, but the control
 of the PRI over the political process has the opposite
 effect. Because the government has at times helped the
 PRI 'win' an election in which the PRI candidate did
 not receive the largest number of votes, political apathy
 is widespread.  In recent national elections more than
 50 percent of the eligible voters abstained.   A 90 percent
 abstention rate in local elections is not uncommon.
 In the recent gubernatorial election in the state of
 Yucatan, the head of the electoral commission admitted
 that there had been "irregularities."
 
 
 482
 Men and women are equal before the law. All citizens
 above the age of 18 with the exception of the clergy,
 are entitled to participate in the political process.
 A growing percentage of women engage In politics and
 work in government. Currently there are 29 women federal
 deputies, three senators, one governor, and one cabinet
 member. A few women hold important positions at the
 sub-cabinet level and at senior levels of the bureaucracy.
 Although women do not often have access to senior positions
 in private industry, women who are skilled, experienced
 and well-educated have a fair chance in the job market
 and account for more than 20 percent of the labor force.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The government generally has been cooperative with interna-
 tional human rights organizations. According to Amnesty
 International's 1981 report, human rights of political
 dissidents are violated in Mexico by irregular arrests,
 detentions and trial procedures, including the use of
 confessions obtained by torture as the only evidence
 for convictions. The report also notes there have been
 reports of deaths while in custody, sometimes from torture;
 the killing and disappearance of former prisoners after
 their release; the transfer from one prison to another
 or rearrest of prisoners reportedly released; and the
 repression of peasants and workers by regular security
 forces (including the 'white brigade", a clandestine
 military-civilian security task force whose existence
 the government has denied repeatedly) and by paramilitary
 units.
 The government allows domestic human rights groups to
 exist, but does curtail their activities on occasions
 when it perceives those activities to be undermining
 Mexico's image. Minority parties and other groups sometimes
 advocate particular human rights causes. Leaders of
 these groups meet from time to time with the president
 and senior government officials to present their positions.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Mexico's major economic and social problems are population
 growth, inflation, unemployment, poverty and uneven distri-
 bution of income. The 1980 census listed the population
 at 67.4 million. Growth is estimated at an average of
 two million annually during this decade. The birth rate
 declined from 3.2 percent in 1979 to 2.9 percent in 1980.
 Mexico's population is young; 43 percent are under the
 age of 14, and 65 percent are under the age of 24. Life
 expectancy at birth was 66.0 years in 1979, compared
 with 62.4 years in 1970. The infant mortality rate per
 1,000 live births was 60 in 1978, as compared with 78
 in 1960. In 1975, 62 percent of Mexicans had access
 to safe water, up from 54 percent in 1970. The population
 has also been urbanized: approximately 60 percent live
 in cities (a total of 25 percent in the Mexico City,
 Guadalajara and Monterrey urban areas alone). GNP per
 capita was $1,640 in 1979. Economic growth, according
 to the Mexican government, was 9.2 percent in 1979 and
 8.3 percent in 1980; Income, however, is unevenly distributed,
 and according to Mexican figures, becoming more so.
 Inflation, a major problem, was about 30 percent in 1980,
 and it is anticipated that it will be at least as high
 in 1981. The government has simplified an exceedingly
 complex minimum wage system and thereby substantially
 reduced the differences in minimum wages from one area
 to another. The government acknowledges that many --
 
 
 483
 including public employees -- do not yet receive the
 full minimum wage.
 Primary education is obligatory and free under the constitu-
 tion and free compulsory education has been extended
 to ten years of school. The adjusted primary school
 enrollment ratio was 116 in 1978, up from 80 in 1960.
 Government figures indicate that some 700,000 children
 could not attend school during 1979 for lack of classrooms.
 Nearly 300,000 Mexicans of school age do not speak Spanish.
 The government has built bilingual residential schools
 for them, but many more are needed. The adult literacy
 rate was 82 percent in 1976, up from 74.2 percent in
 1970. However, 40 percent of the population over 25
 years of age is illiterate.
 The government claims that 42 million persons are covered
 by social security programs, including medical assistance.
 Many, however, are only partially covered. Malnutrition
 afflicts an estimated 40 percent of the population.
 A government agency provides staple foods at subsidized
 prices, which partially alleviates this want. Supplying
 potable water, electricity and communications facilities
 to rural areas are priorities of the current administration,
 and the number of people receiving these services has
 increased substantially.
 The rights of property owners are reasonably well protected.
 Disputes over property have resulted in land seizures
 in rural areas in 1981, a number of them apparently pro-
 voked by opposition political parties. Government land
 redistribution programs begun during the 1910 revolution
 continue, but there is little land available for redistri-
 bution. The demand for land by poor rural dwellers and
 the need to upgrade Mexico's agricultural system continue.
 The constitution provides for the right of employment,
 but underemployment indicates the continuing inability
 of the economy to provide everyone with work. The govern-
 ment assertion that unemployment is less than five percent
 is considerably below non-governmental estimates. The
 combined unemployment and underemployment rate may be
 in excess of 40 percent.
 Job training, for the most part, is available only to
 those who can afford it, or who are fortunate enough
 to find work with employers who provide it. The government
 recently began to enforce employee health and safety
 standards, but acknowledges that it will be able to correct
 only the most dangerous and unhealthful conditions for
 some time to come. The improvement of workplace, health-
 and safety standards often conflicts with the need to
 create jobs.
 Mexico is a traditional society in which men and women
 are considered to have different roles exclusive to each
 sex. Thus, while there appears to be no wage discrimina-
 tion, there are certain occupations that are dominated
 by men, including most managerial and executive positions.
 Generally Mexicans do not consider the assignment of
 work on the basis of sex as discriminatory.
 The administration is implementing an anti-corruption
 campaign. More than 2,500 public employees have been
 prosecuted during the current administration and more
 than $130 million recovered. Still, corruption pervades
 the Mexican government, federal and local. The Mexican
 police are notoriously venal.
