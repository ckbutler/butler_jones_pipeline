 MONGOLIA
 Mongolia, long a highly centralized Communist state, installed
 its first freely elected government in 1990 as part of a
 transition toward multiparty democracy. Responding to demands
 of a growing opposition movement, the Mongolian People's
 Revolutionary Party (MPRP--the Communist Party) amended the
 Constitution to delete its leading role and created a
 presidential system and an additional, more representative
 legislative house. Political parties were legalized and an
 electoral law was passed, leading to general elections in July.
 Mongolia now has a president, a vice president, a prime
 minister, and two legislative houses known as the People's
 Great Hural (GPH) and the new Baga (small) Hural (BH). The
 Vice President also serves as president.of the smaller, more
 influential legislative house.
 Although the President serves as Chief of State with broad
 emergency and veto powers, the actual division of
 responsibilities between the President and Prime Minister
 remains unclear.  The GPH, which elects the President, is the
 major legislative body, but the BH becomes the highest organ of
 state power between infrequent GPH sessions.
 President Ochirbat and Prime Minister Byambasuren of the MPRP
 lead the new Government which includes a Vice President and
 Deputy Prime Ministers from opposition parties. During 1991 a
 commission.of government officials, parliamentarians, and other-
 experts drafted a new; democratic constitution which has
 provisions for a wide range of civil and political rights. At
 year's end, it. was being considered for adoption by the session
 of the GPH which began meeting in November.
 The role of the-security apparatus has diminished; it is now a
 department responsible to the Council of Ministers. Under
 legislation enacted in August, police'and security officers,
 along with a wide range of other officials, may no longer be
 members af pplitical parties. As a result, all security and
 police officials reportedly have resigned their party
 affiliations. Substantial reductions in the military budget
 and forces were announced.
 Despite increasing industrialization and urbanization, a large
 portion of the population is engaged in agriculture, with an
 emphasis on livestock raising and associated light industry.
 After decades of nearly total dependency on the Soviet Union,
 Mongolia is attempting to increase its foreign trade with
 non-Socialist countries and-to'make the difficult transition to
 a market economy. However, this effort has been handicapped by
 a severe foreign exchange shortage and a general economic
 slowdown. The new draft constitution, if adopted, would
 establish the right to private ownership of property.
 Major improvement in most human rights categories continued in
 1991, most dramatically in freedom of speech and press, freedom
 of assembly, freedom of religion, and the right of citizens to
 change their government.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There has been no evidence of such killings in recent years.
 The Government is investigating allegations of past instances
 of such killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of unresolved abductions or
 disappearances in recent years.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There have been no reports that torture or other cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment has been
 practiced in the recent past.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, and Exile
 There have been no confirmed reports of arbitrary arrest,
 detention, or exile in the past few years. The Government is
 investigating cases of such occurrences in the past and has
 rehabilitated many victims.
 Police may arrest those in the act of committing a crime and
 hold them for up to 72 hours without a warrant. For
 incarcerations of longer duration, or when the actual crime was
 not witnessed, a warrant must be issued by a prosecutor who is
 appointed by the State Prosecutor for a 5-year term and who
 functions as part of the Ministry of Justice. The State
 Prosecutor is appointed by the GPH for a 5-year term. Warrants
 must also be issued by a prosecutor before persons or premises
 may be searched. There is no statutory right for an accused in
 detention to see an attorney, and defense attorneys are
 routinely denied access to their clients prior to trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are three levels of courts in Mongolia. The People's
 Courts handle most routine criminal and civil cases such as
 assault, petty larceny, traffic accidents, and liability
 disputes. Provincial Courts hear serious cases such as murder,
 rape, grand larceny, official corruption, and security cases.
 The High Court serves as an appeals court for the People's and
 Provincial Courts. To date the High Court has rarely
 overturned the verdicts of the lower courts. High Court judges
 are appointed by the GPH for a 4-year term. Lower court judges
 are appointed by provincial Hurals, also for 4-year terms.
 Current civil and criminal codes stipulate the right of the
 accused to judicial process, a legal defense, and public trial
 1except as stipulated by law." Closed proceedings are
 permitted in the cases of crimes against the State, rape cases
 involving minors, and particularly brutal murders. Witnesses
 are usually required to appear-at trials, but written testimony
 is sometimes accepted instead. The accused must answer all
 questions put to him by the prosecutor.
 The courts have nominally been independent but in reality have
 been closely controlled by the MPRP. Since the 1990
 
 
 939
 MONGOLIA
 revolution, there has been a comprehensive review of the legal
 code and the structure of the judiciary in order to establish a
 legal system which will conform to international standards.
 There are no political prisoners.*
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy of person, home, and correspondence is
 provided for in the Constitution. Despite political reforms
 and cutbacks in the apparatus of government, the Government
 still retains the authority to exercise control over individual
 activity.
 The Department of State Security (DSS), despite internal
 reforms, still reserves the right to use special surveillance
 measures (e.g., wiretaps) "when necessary." No information is
 available on the extent of these practices, but the authority
 of the DSS seems significantly below what it was before the
 1990 democratic revolution.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for in the Constitution
 and is now widely respected in practice, although limits
 remain. There continued to be lively debate covering a broad
 range of political and social issues. Many newspapers freely
 publish and circulate, although the Government controls the
 allocation of newsprint, and opposition parties and other
 publishers continued to allege that limitations on the
 quantities of newsprint provided to opposition newspapers
 effectively prevented them from publishing as frequently as the
 MPRP newspaper. Although both the opposition and the
 Government at times criticize the coverage, the only television
 station, which is government owned, regularly broadcasts news
 about the views of opposition parties as well as those of the
 Government. Its news programs are generally considered to be
 balanced.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of demonstration and
 assembly. Demonstrations over various issues, including a
 large (political) demonstration against the ruling MPRP
 following the abortive Soviet coup, and protests against
 government economic policies, were held throughout the year
 without interference by the authorities. Although permits are
 required for demonstrations, this requirement is not enforced.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Mongolian law provides for freedom of religion; there is no
 state religion. Since the 1990 revolution, freedom of religion
 has been respected in practice. Throughout 1991, revival of
 the Buddhist faith and its institutions continued. In
 September, the Dalai Lama visited Mongolia on the invitation of
 the Buddhist community. Commenting on his visit, which evoked
 significant public interest, the Government emphasized that it
 no longer interferes in the conduct of religious affairs.
 The Government has given permission for a mosque to be built in
 the western Kazakh province of Bayan Olgiy (the first since
 1937) and for an Islamic center to be established in
 
 
 940
 MONGOLIA
 Ulaanbaatar (the capital). The importation of Korans was
 allowed to begin in 1990, and three Mongolians made the haji to
 Mecca in 1991. An association of Mongolian religious people
 was formed in 1990 and has functioned freely. A small group of
 foreign Baha'is is now residing in Ulaanbaatar. Christian
 missionaries began to appear in late 1990, and the Government
 does not interfere in their activities. The Government has
 stated that proselytizing would be permitted.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Mongolians may travel freely inside the country and, under a
 new emigration law passed in 1990, all Mongolians may leave the
 country and return to it. Over 47,000 people had traveled
 abroad in the first 10 months of 1991. Mongolia does not
 receive many refugees, but a few who have come from China's
 Province of Inner Mongolia have been accepted for resettlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution provides citizens the right to change their
 government through periodic, free elections with universal
 suffrage. In July 1990, Mongolian citizens exercised that
 right in the first multiparty elections for the GPH and local
 offices and in expressing their party preferences for the Baga
 Hural. The elections were generally judged by observers to be
 free and open.
 Although MPRP candidates captured over 80 percent of the 430
 GPH seats, only 13 percent of GPH deputies were reelected,
 bringing about wholesale changes within the MPRP. The
 Mongolian Democratic Party, the Party of National Progress, the
 Social Democratic Party, and some 39 independents won the
 remaining GPH seats. The MPRP won 62 percent of the votes for
 the Baga Hural, giving it 31 of 50 seats. The same three
 opposition parties won the remaining seats.
 In September 1990, the newly elected GPH elected P. Ochirbat of
 the MPRP and R. Gonchigdorg of the Social Democratic Party as
 President and Vice President, respectively. Prime Minister
 Byambasuren (MPRP) and two opposition Deputy Prime Ministers
 were also elected. The rest of the Council of Ministers is
 composed of MPRP members, but Byambasuren has worked to include
 all parties and ideologies in a collaborative effort to reform
 Mongolia's political, economic, and legal systems.
 In September, following months of intense national debate, the
 BH approved a new draft constitution establishing the citizen's
 right to form poltical parties and participate directly in
 political affairs. In November the GPH begap to consider its
 adoption. Since the draft constitution would replace the
 existing two legislative houses with a single, unicameral
 legislature, its adoption might require new legislative
 elections sooner than the 2-year period promised after the 1990
 elections.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation of women in
 government and politics, and women constitute about 30 percent
 of the MPRP membership. Nine women were elected to the GPH in
 July.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International .and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A local human rights group, the Mongolian Human Rights
 Committee, was formed in 1990. There are no known impediments
 to its ability to monitor and report on human rights
 developments. At the invitation of the Government, the
 U.S.-based International Human Rights Law Group sent an
 observer team to monitor the 1990 elections. The Government
 has cooperated with other international nongovernmental human
 rights organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There appears to be little discrimination in education on the
 basis of race, sex, or religion.
 According to'government statistics, the percentage of women in
 the work force was over 50 percent in 1991 and about half of
 trade union membership. Women also hold high professional
 positions in institutions such'as schools, research centers,
 and hospitals, but recent statistics indicate that unemployment
 among women appears marginally higher. Little is known about
 the extent to which violence against women, including domestic
 violence, occurs. It has not been discussed as a matter of
 public policy or in the media.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right to organize professional associations and trade
 unions is provided for in the Constitution. The charter of the
 Federation of Mongolian Trade Unions (FMTU) also provides for
 the unionization of police and military personnel.
 Approximately 75 percent of the total Mongolian work force,
 including agricultural as well as industrial workers, is
 unionized. Union officials are elected by secret ballot.
 There are no arbitrary restrictions on who may be a union
 official. Unions, other than civil servants and essential
 services, have the right to strike. In November and December,
 significant wildcat strikes occured in the transport and
 medical services sectors. These strikes, settled by mutual
 agreement between the striking unions and the Government acting
 as employer, resulted in wage increases.
 Most unions in Mongolia are currently affiliated with the FMTU,
 which formerly wag a part of the MPRP. The FMTU separated from
 the party during the 1990 revolution, and its charter now
 states that all unions have the right to leave'it should they
 so desire. The FMTU also maintains there is no requirement for
 new unions to register with it or with any government body.
 The FMTU is apparently no longer an instrument of government
 control. During 1990, a new union movement called "The
 Association of'Free Trade Unions" (AFTU) emerged. This new
 movement reportedly includes some 70 unions. In addition, a
 variety of new professional associations, including those of
 journalists and engineers; were created. Some of these
 associations appear to be independent of both the larger union
 groupings.
 The Constitution places no restrictions on the political
 activity of unions or union officials. Twenty members of the
 
 
 942
 MONGOLIA
 GPH are labor union officials, three of whom are members of the
 Central Council of the FMTU. In 1991 the FMTU, the AFTU, and
 individual unions all frequently and publicly criticized
 government economic policies and actions.
 There is no statutory prohibition against unions forming
 federations or joining international bodies. Mongolian unions,
 formerly affiliated exclusively with Communist organizations
 internationally, are broadening their contacts with Western
 labor movements.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Labor Law prohibits antiunion discrimination. According to
 the law, an employer must show work-related cause and must
 obtain the union's approval to fire a union official who is an
 employee. Should the union not approve, the employee may
 judicially appeal any firing. The courts have the right to
 order reinstatement. The FMTU says there were a few such cases
 this year, most of which resulted in the workers regaining
 their Jobs. The right to bargain collectively is protected in
 the Constitution. Because of changes in the labor law
 introduced in July 1991, no collective bargaining agreements
 were completed in 1991.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is specifically prohibited by law
 and in practice, does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law prohibits children under the age of 16, from working,
 although those aged 14 and 15 may work if allowed to by the
 local trade union committee and given permission by their
 parents. Those under 18 are statutorily prohibited from
 working at night, from doing arduous work, or from working in
 dangerous areas such as mining or construction. The workday is
 prescribed as 8 hours for adults, 7 hours for those aged 16 to
 18, and 6 hours for those aged 14 and 15. These laws are
 strictly enforced by civil authorities.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The government-established minimum wage applies to all workers,
 even to those under 18 who work only 36 hours per week. While
 it is difficult to determine what portion of the work force is
 paid at the minimum wage, this wage, together with subsidies
 provided workers, appears to provide an adequate standard of
 living, although that is endangered by continuing inflation.
 The Labor Law sets 46 hours as the standard workweek. For
 those under 18 the standard workweek is 36 hours. Overtime is
 forbidden by law except in case of national emergency or
 natural disaster such as an earthquake or floods, and then only
 with the concurrence of the local labor union.
 The Labor Law, the Cooperatives Law, and the Enterprise Law
 provide for occupational safety and health standards. These
 standards are enforced by the Government and trade unions.
 Violators may be fined and imprisoned. Nonetheless, according
 to the FMTU, every fourth day a Mongolian worker dies from an
 industrial accident.
