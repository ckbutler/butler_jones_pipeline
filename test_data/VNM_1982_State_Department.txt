 VIETNAM
 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a communist dictatorship
 ruled by the Communist Party of Vietnam, the sole arbiter of
 power in the political system. The Party formally came to
 power in the North following the Geneva Conference of 1954
 which partitioned Vietnam in the aftermath of its anti-colonial
 war against the Prench. The Party then engaged in a protracted
 struggle for control of the South and was finally victorious in
 April 1975.
 This victory has had major implications for human rights as the
 North faced the prospect of integrating an independent-minded
 populace of questionable loyalty. The regime's first reaction
 to this problem was to intern all public officials and military
 officers of the former Government of the Republic of Vietnam in
 so-called 'reeducation' camps. Its second was the dispersal of
 urban dwellers to virgin and unproductive land, termed the 'New
 Economic Zones.' The third was an overly-hasty attempt to
 stifle the market economy by closing down small shops, most of
 which, not coincidentally, were owned by a minority ethnic
 group toward whom Vietnamese traditionally have had antipathy,
 the Chinese.
 The regime first deprived the ethnic Chinese of their means of
 livelihood, then encouraged their departure, often using
 coercive means, both overland and by boat. This outflow later
 included ethnic Vietnamese as well, and grew into the great
 refugee exodus which has not yet ceased.
 The other historical event of significance for human rights in
 Vietnam since 1975 was the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea in
 late 1978. By engaging in this invasion, Vietnam has been
 unable to devote resources to reconstruction from the wounds of
 its erlier struggle to conquer the South. Instead, it has
 poured resources and manpower into Kampuchea on a vast scale.
 Vietnam has engaged in human rights violations toward the
 Kampuchean people as a result of its occupation and control of
 its neighbor. Reported violations have included forced labor,
 denial of legal process, and forced relocations. Vietnam
 continues to control all policies and actions of the Kampuchean
 Government, and thus must bear a heavy responsibility for any
 violations occurring under its rule.
 Vietnamese forces have used lethal trichothecene toxins
 (commonly known as 'yellow rain') and other combinations of
 chemical agents in Laos and Kampuchea, frequently against
 civilian populations. (See the Report of the Secretary of
 State to Congress on March 22, 1982, and November 1982 for
 details.)
 The Vietnamese citizen today is potentially the victim of
 arbitrary arrest either for past association with the former
 regime or for espousal of political ideas contrary to communist
 ideology. He has the obligation to vote, but all candidates
 are approved by the Communist Party. Despite legally
 guaranteed freedom of religion, many religious leaders have
 been imprisoned. No press exists other that that controlled by
 the regime.
 There was very little improvement in the state of human rights
 in Vietnam in 1982. There have been some releases from
 reeducation camps, but not large numbers and over 60,000 remain
 
 15-1480 0 - 83 - 53

 incarcerated after seven years without trial. The most
 encouraging event was increased cooperation by government
 authorities in permitting the Amerasian children of US citizens
 formerly resident in southern Vietnam to leave for the US, and
 the expansion of a program of family reunification as relatives
 of Vietnamese residents of other countries legally emigrate
 from Vietnam.
 Economically, most citizens are not appreciably above the
 subsistance level. Vietnam still is not self-sufficient in
 food production -- largely a result of arbitrary and
 incompetent economic policies. Packages from relatives abroad
 enable many to survive. Food is insufficient for most
 Vietnamese and what is available is rationed or highly priced
 on the free market. Inflation is high and corruption rampant
 while wages are stagnant. Hanoi has often denied working
 papers and ration coupons to many of its citizens deemed
 politically unacceptable. Many reeducation camp returnees
 among others are thus forced to exist on their own in an
 underground economy, as the only legal option left open to them
 is moving to the 'New Economic Zones.' These actions by the
 Vietnamese Government deny many of its citizens the most basic
 of all human rights; that of survival. The potential for human
 rights abuse in Vietnam's export of workers to the USSR and
 Eastern Europe, apparently to help pay Vietnam's debts, is a
 source of concern.
 The forecast, both for the long and short term, remains bleak.
 For ideological reasons, as well as out of concern for their
 power and survival, the leadership will continue to maintain
 tight control and limit freedom. As long as Vietnam remains
 mired in Kampuchea, it will lack the resources to invest in
 reconstruction of its devastated economy. Any improvement in
 Vietnam's economy is likely to be marginal. Slight
 liberalization in economic policy is not likely to result in
 liberalization of cultural or human rights policies.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Although the Government admits that some 'war criminals' were
 executed in the wake of the 1975 take-over, execution for
 purely political acts is not accepted policy. Several
 executions for organizing refugee escape attempts have been
 announced, and former reeducation camp inmates have reported
 executions for escape attempts and resistance to camp
 authorities.
 Attacks by minority resistance groups and by ethnic Vietnamese
 resistance groups against Vietnamese Government authority
 usually target Peoples' Army of Vietnam units. Assassinations
 of government officials may sometimes occur, but are not
 widespread.
 b. Disappearance
 Refugees report that the authorities occasionally wait months
 before notifying relatives of a person's detention. Much of
 this, however, can be attributed to bureaucratic inefficiency
 rather than policy. Permanent disappearances, however,
 apparently do not occur as a matter of policy.
 c. Torture
 
 
 825
 Some inmates of reeducation camps have been beaten and
 otherwise physically abused. Torture, however, does not appear
 to be a widespread practice.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 In the reeducation camps, provision of food rations below
 subsistence levels, denial of medical care, and assignment to
 hard labor of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience
 are practiced regularly. Prisoners are punished severely, for
 example, by several months solitary confinement, for minor
 infractions of camp rules. These widespread practices result
 in acute suffering, permanent physical impairment, and death.
 Given the degree of Communist Party control, it must be assumed
 that these practices are a matter of government policy. The
 detainees have indeterminate sentences and, unless released,
 face the prospect of penal labor until they die of malnutrition
 or disease. Central authorities clearly have the ability to
 ameliorate these conditions if they wish. There is widespread
 agreement among refugee reports gathered in various
 geographical locations as to the severity of the camps.
 Although some reeducation camps contain common criminals, most
 of the prisoners are former officials and military officers of
 the Republic of Vietnam, many of them aged. Also included are
 chaplains and clergy from both Buddhist and Christian sects.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Government continues to hold large numbers of people
 without trial in the reeducation camps, including both those
 whose former associations raise suspicions and those whose
 current political views are suspect. Estimates of those
 detained range from 24,000 (a Vietnamese Government figure) to
 over 100,000 (unofficial sources). Interviews with persons who
 escaped or were released from camps revealed the continued
 existence of at least eight camps in 1980-81 with a population
 of at least 64,000. Reeducation camps are intended to remove
 potentially dissident elements from society, especially
 competent and/or charismatic leaders, and to produce conformity
 through confinement, indoctrination, and hard labor. Some
 prisoners, including some military officers up to the rank of
 colonel, have been released, but many are still imprisoned. A
 few have been rearrested for no discernible reason. Amnesty
 International stated in its 1982 report that its greatest
 concern in Vietnam was 'the continuing detention without charge
 or trial of thousands of members of the former South Vietnamese
 administration in 'reeducation' camps."
 The regime has spoken publicly of its program to relocate
 millions of people to virgin or unproductive rural areas in
 order to expand agricultural production. Hundreds of thousands
 have been resettled in these *New Economic Zones.' However,
 the lack of investment in infrastructure in these zones
 suggests that the primary impetus for creating them was the
 desire to disperse the large, and potentially dangerous, urban
 population. The resettlement process has involved coercion in
 most cases and force occasionally. The program has targeted
 those whose views and background leave them suspect in the
 regime's view. Conditions in these zones are widely reported
 to range from poor to life-threatening with inadequate
 provision of basic services. Many of the persons resettled
 leave, returning to the cities where they are forced to live on
 the margins of an already marginal economy, without the ration
 or neighborhood registration cards essential to procuring
 employment, food, and other essential services.
 
 
 826
 Recent reports indicate that the regime has largely abandoned
 the effort to force southerners to these zones. The
 authorities have apparently concluded that urban congestion can
 be managed as long as the safety valves of packages from
 escaped relatives abroad, the black market, and the Orderly
 Departure Program (a program under which the Government
 administers the legal departure of persons from Vietnam in
 cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees) remain available to the populace. Northerners,
 however, are still being relocated in the Mekong Delta
 region.   Resettlement often displaces pre-existing tribal
 minorities, threatening their traditional customs and heritage.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Since 1975, arbitrary arrest has occurred under the rubric of
 reeducation. In general, both political prisoners and common
 criminals are denied public trial and access to counsel.
 People regularly are arrested and imprisoned without any form
 of legal proceedings (habeas corpus, counsel, or public trial)
 because of real or suspected association with the former
 government or resistance groups or because of dissident views.
 Leadership elements of religious and minority groups also
 suffer prolonged detention.
 In general, the legal system operates as an agency for the
 enforcement of the party directives. Thus, it has no
 independence from political intervention.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Northern system of population surveillance by block wardens
 now extends to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) and other southern
 cities and rural areas, although the system works imperfectly
 in the South, partly because of a shortage of trusted party
 workers. There are reports of officials implanting
 incriminating evidence during searches of residences. There
 are other reports of officials conducting midnight searches of
 homes for draft-age males in order to fulfill draft quotas
 although this is said to be reduced in frequency over the past
 year. No warrants are needed.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights do not exist in Vietnam. The Ministry of Culture
 and Information and organs of the Party maintain tight control
 over all newspapers, books, and other publications, as well as
 all cultural exhibitions. The Government controls and censors
 all public sources of information and promotes *revolutionary
 culture' in the arts. Many prominent artists and writers have
 been arrested.
 Independent criticism of the Party and Government is not
 permitted. Self-censorship by journalists operates without
 question, given the pervasive control of the Party.
 The block surveillance system described above utilizes
 informants to monitor the activities of citizens. There are
 reliable reports that the Ministry of the Interior inspects and
 censors international mail belonging to politically suspect
 persons.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 
 
 827
 There is no freedom of assembly in Vietnam. Even assembly by
 religious communities for other than strictly spiritual
 purposes is banned. Government-controlled-and-directed
 organizations exist in lieu of labor unions. Membership in
 such organizations is encouraged. However, the function of
 labor organizations is control and dissemination of party and
 government policy to workers.
 C. Freedom of Religion
 Vietnamese authorities have attempted to systematically divide
 and control the Catholic and Buddhist churches, the Muslim
 community, and other religious sects. People are, however,
 permitted to attend religious services. Catholic priests are
 subject to police surveillance and most priests and nuns are
 .required by the authorities'to work full-time in state-run
 occupations, thus limiting their participation in religious
 activities. The Catholic church's teaching role has been
 restricted severely and many churches and all but one Catholic
 seminary in the South have been closed. Sermons require
 government approval and uncooperative priests are subject to
 confinement in reeducation camps. Catholics are closely
 watched by the security forces, are required to attend
 political lessons and are discriminated against in employment.
 In central Vietnam, thousands of Catholics have been forcibly
 relocated and required to work on government construction
 projects. The Government has sharply curtailed the number of
 new Catholic and Protestant clergy ordained and restricted
 communication between rural parishes and their bishops.
 Evangelical churches, such as the Seventh Day Adventists, are
 especially distrusted by the regime.
 Nearly all the 30,000 Vietnamese Muslims are members of the
 Cham minority, which the regime distrusts and harasses. The
 Government has disbanded the organized Muslim association and
 broken links with overseas Muslim organizations. The regime
 forbids the traditional pilgrimage to Mecca and has not given
 permission for the Muslim community to participate in the Koran
 reading contest held annually in Malaysia. Many Muslim schools
 have been closed, but most mosques are still open. The
 importation of Korans is forbidden and the printing house which
 previously published Korans has been closed.
 Buddhists have resisted efforts to control them. The
 politically active An Quang Unified Buddhist Church reacted
 sharply when the Government packed its leadership council with
 pro-party monks. In Ho Chi Minh City demonstrating Buddhists
 were arrested in April 1977 and pagodas closed. Two An Quang
 leaders remain under arrest. Monks at the formerly active An
 Quang, Xa Loi, and Vin Nghiem pagodas rarely receive visitors
 and are under close government surveillance. Pagoda schools
 are closed and, while ceremonies are allowed to continue, monks
 are not permitted to preach sermons. Nationwide, monks need
 permission to travel and to stay overnight away from their home
 temples. Some reports allege that local authorities seek to
 control the Buddhist Sangha by forbidding the donation of
 food. Few young men are allowed to join the Sangha. Other
 religious groups (notably the Cao Dai sect and the Hoa Hao, a
 Buddhist sect) also have resisted government control. The Hoa
 Hao leadership is now reportedly imprisoned. The leadership of
 * the Therevada Buddhists, most of whom are Khmer Khrom
 (Vietnamese are for the most part Mahayana Buddhists),
 similarly has either been imprisoned or banished from any
 official role and replaced by pro-regime clergy who represent
 the sect abroad.
 
 
 828
 A number of Buddhist monks view the government-organized
 conference on the unification of Buddhism, held in Hanoi in
 November 1981, and the formation of the unified Vietnam
 Buddhist Church at the conference, as part of the regime's
 effort to control Buddhism. The charter of the Vietnam
 Buddhist Church provides that it is *the only Buddhist
 organization representing Vietnamese Buddhism in all relations
 in the country and with other countries.'
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Government approval is required for all internal and external
 travel. No one is allowed to change his residence or work
 location without permission from the authorities. Only
 government officials or approved spokesmen for
 quasi-governmental organizations generally receive permission
 to travel abroad.
 A number of factorsi in addition to the generally repressive
 political situation, have combined to cause a mass exodus from
 Vietnam since 1975. Among them are ethnic persecution,
 discrimination with regard to economic and educational
 opportunities, fear of incarceration or exile to remote areas,
 and fear of conscription to fight in Kampuchea. In early 1978,
 the Vietnamese adopted a program to "facilitate* the departure
 of ethnic Chinese and others as refugees. The program was
 administered through special offices at the provincial level
 which charged large fees for exit permits and passage. At its
 height in the spring of 1979, the exodus, mostly of ethnic
 Chinese, reached over 40,000 per month by boat. An additional
 230,000 resettled in China across Vietnam's northern border.
 At the conference on Vietnamese refugees held in Geneva in July
 1979, the Government pledged a moratorium on refugee
 departures, and information from refugees who have left Vietnam
 since then indicates that the authorities are no longer
 systematically assisting departures and are punishing people
 caught trying to depart clandestinely.
 In May 1979, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) reached agreement with the Government on the legal
 departure of persons from Vietnam under the Orderly Departure
 Program. The program started slowly with only
 slightly more than 13,000 departing Vietnam (2,369 to the US)
 in the 27 months between July 1979 and October 1981. The
 Vietnamese then expanded the program, and over 17,000 left in
 the next year (4,262 to the US). At the October 1982 Executive
 Committee session of UNHCR, the Vietnamese announced that they
 planned a further expansion of the program.
 During 1982, the great majority of refugees from Vietnam left
 clandestinely. Some paid bribes to low level security
 officials to facilitate escape. Hanoi and provincial radio
 stations have broadcast reports of executions of organizers of
 failed escape attempts, as well as punishments dealt to others
 implicated. Currently, male offenders can expect sentences
 ranging from three to fifteen years at hard labor, while female
 offenders receive one to three months, with childless women
 often receiving longer sentences. Reeducation camp releasees
 can expect to be returned for an *indefinite" term. Property,
 often including the means of livelihood, is confiscated from
 those caught, as is the property left behind by the escapees.
 Individuals reportedly must often resort to bribery to be
 placed on 'Orderly Departure' lists. Refugees from the Mekong
 
 
 829
 Delta have reported that some persons have paid officials from
 eight to ten taels of gold ($4,800-6,000) per person to be
 placed on tentative 'Orderly Departure" lists with no guarantee
 as to when or if they would be permitted to leave. Persons who
 have applied for exit permits reportedly are subject to
 recurring security checks and harassment.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Authority and power are concentrated in the Communist Party.
 No political opposition to the Party is tolerated. The
 Politburo of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Communist.
 Party is the supreme decision-making body in the nation. The
 National Assembly exists to rubber stamp decisions made in the
 Politburo.
 National Assembly elections are held in Vietnam every five
 years and local elections are held more often. The electorate
 is required to participate in the elections in order to have
 ration cards validated. Voters do not have a real political
 choice. They may only strike out the names of candidates for
 whom they do not wish to vote from the single list which is
 presented them.
 Although Southerners have been appointed to some ministerial
 and National Assembly positions, distrust of Southerners is a
 significant factor in the assignment of political
 responsibilities. Even those Southerners who played
 significant roles in the National Liberation Front prior to
 1975 have largely been shunted aside since then.
 Gradual assimilation and codptation appear to be the long-run
 strategy in regard to minorities in the North. The Government
 has created special schools in the Hanoi area to train minority
 cadres who can be the 'eyes and ears' of the party among their
 own'people. Muslim and other minority religious groups are
 particular targets of this effort. Southern minorities --
 Chinese, Indian, Khmer -- have been encouraged to leave the
 country.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Vietnam is not a member of international human rights
 organizations. It has been the subject of investigation by
 Amnesty International, which published in June 1981 the report
 of an Amnesty International mission.. This report contained an
 exchange of memoranda between Amnesty International and the
 Government following the December 1979 Amnesty mission to
 Vietnam. The consistent theme of the reports on Vietnam has
 been the violation of human rights through the detention of
 persons without trial in reeducation camps under harsh
 conditions over a period of several years.
 The delegations and journalists who have visited reeducation
 camps have been shown model camps. Former prisoners have
 described extensive preparations to beautify camps prior to
 visits, temporary removal of most prisoners during, the visit,
 and careful briefing-of the prisoners-by cadre on what to tell
 delegation members.
 The Government does not permit.the existence of private groups
 to lobby for or protect human rights in Vietnam. Freedom
 House, in its report for 1982, classifies Vietnam as Not Free.'
 
 
 830
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Economic development continues to be thwarted by the impact of
 attempts to socialize Southern agriculture, output loss from
 the flight of skilled and entrepreneurial workers, and the high
 cost of maintaining defenses against China. Of particular
 importance is the cost of the war effort in Kampuchea, which
 diverts badly needed resources and personnel. The regime has
 exported scarce domestically produced agricultural and consumer
 goods for political purposes and in order to repay a portion of
 the massive assistance received from the USSR.
 About 45,000 Vietnamese workers have been sent under contract
 to work in various occupations in the USSR as well as Eastern
 Europe. There is little doubt that a significant portion of
 their wages is deducted to help pay for Vietnam's debts to
 these countries. Complaints about working conditions,
 including inadequate winter clothing, have been reported. It
 appears that many of the workers enter this work program in
 order to escape the poverty and unemployment of present day
 Vietnam. The potential for human rights abuse, however,
 remains a source of concern.
 Production incentives have ameliorated agricultural production
 shortfalls to a degree, but have not achieved self-sufficiency.
 Foodgrain production improved modestly in 1982 to 16 million
 tons, but according to international financial sources, the
 increase did not significantly lessen food shortages, as the
 Government decreased its imports of foodgrains accordingly.
 Calorie supply available for consumption was only 83 percent of
 nutritional requirements in 1977,.the latest year available,
 and has probably not improved in the five years since then.
 The heavy burden of inflation (about 100 percent in 1981) on
 city dwellers, especially government cadre and proletariat, is
 reflected in increased corruption, moonlighting, and crime.
 Corruption, especially, is now seen to be a way of life in the
 cities. The corruption in turn burdens the average citizen who
 must bribe officials to obtain public services and official
 documents.
 Because of the food shortages brought on by economic policies,
 Hanoi's Kampuchean adventure, and natural disasters, rice and
 meat rations have been reduced drastically. The families of
 draft evaders, releasees from reeducation camps, and deserters
 from the armed forces and "New Economic Zones' have been
 removed from food distribution lists. Sales of food at
 government prices are limited and most families must resort to
 the free market where prices are much higher. The black market
 sale of goods received in packages from relatives abroad has
 become an essential component of many families' income. Income
 levels have not risen to keep pace with inflation.
 Collectivization of the fishing industry and nationalization of
 most ocean-going vessels have lowered fishermens' income
 severely. According to some reports, 70 percent of the catch
 is taken in taxes. The fishing industry has been further
 crippled by severe government limits on the amount of fuel and
 water permitted on board. These measures have been adopted to
 prevent refugee escapes. Depletion of the fishing fleet
 through loss of boats to refugee flight has also hurt the
 industry.
 Education is an area in which government resources are
 adequate, given the poverty-stricken state of the country as a
 
 
 831
 whole. Those whose political affiliation is suspect, such as
 Amerasians, the children of Americans who served in Vietnam,
 often are not permitted to attend school.
 The ethnic Chinese, who account for well over half the total
 number of refugees, are discriminated against severely through
 denial of employment and educational opportunities. Former
 military officers of the Republic of Vietnam are systematically
 denied employment and the children of those former officials
 (military and civilian) are blocked from university education
 by a review of family background which culls out *undesirable
 elements.' Persons released from reeducation centers are
 subject to severe restrictions on employment and travel.
 Generally, persons with Western training and education are
 denied official employment, regardless of the need for their
 services, and are encouraged to leave.
 The level of health care has declined steadily since 1975. The
 severe shortages of medical facilities and medicines have been
 aggravated by the need to divert material and personnel for the
 care of soldiers wounded in Kampuchea. There are distinct
 levels of treatment for different ranks of cadre. Only the
 most minimal facilities are available for the average worker.
 Ordinary peasants and workers must purchase medical
 prescriptions on the open market, unlike cadre who have access
 to free or government-subsidized prescriptions. Those who are
 not employed by the state are not eligible for care at
 government medical facilities.
 Property rights are not protected by the Government and are
 antithetical to the communist ideology of state ownership.
 Although a degree of private ownership by individuals is
 permitted, ownership by groups such as corporations is not.
 Collective ownership is encouraged.
