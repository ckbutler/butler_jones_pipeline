 LATVIA
 Latvia regained its independence in 1991 after 50 years of Soviet rule. A par-
 liamentary democracy, Latvia in June held its first free and fair elections in over
 60 years, albeit under a restricted franchise (see Section 3), and in July reinstated
 its 1922 Constitution. Valdis Birkavs of the right-of-center coalition party Latvia's
 Way, which won 36 out of 100 seats in the Saeima (parliament), became Prime Min-
 ister. The Saeima in July elected Guntis Ulmanis of the Farmers' Union as Presi-
 dent (head of state). The Prime Minister, as chief executive, and the Cabinet are
 responsible for day-to-day government operations. A 1991 Constitutional Law, which
 supplements and expands on the 1922 Constitution, provides for basic rights and
 freedoms.
 Latvian authorities are gradually replacing the Soviet-trained police; however,
 there are recurrent allegations of corruption among police and security forces. The
 Home Guard, a voluntary military reserve, assists in police patrols but has no arrest
 powers. The regular military services have yet to establish internal disciplinary pro-
 cedures in accordance with democratic norms. The Latvian Republic Security Serv-
 ice was involved in at least two unsuccessful attempts to pressure the media. As
 of the end of September, 13,000 Russian troops remained in Latvia. Latvia insisted
 that all Russian troops leave the country as soon as possible; the Russians proposed
 that most troops leave in 1994, with a remaining presence at a missile early-warn-
 ing radar at Skrunda. Although negotiations continued, no agreement had been
 reached by year's end.
 Latvia made progress in stabilizing its economy and pursuing market-oriented re-
 forms. Its currency was strong enough to appreciate steadily in a free foreign cur-
 rency market. In 1993 inflation was 35 percent, and a foreign trade surplus was ex-
 pected. Latvia's economy had contracted substantially since the country regained
 independence in 1991 but appeared to stabilized in the second half of 1993. A boom-
 ing private sector accounted or about a quarter of economic activity, but unemploy-
 ment rose to an estimated 8 percent. As of September 1, private farms and gardens
 covered 54 percent of Latvia's farmland, while privatized collective farms accounted
 for much of the rest.
 The previous parliament, elected under Soviet law, deferred action on implement-
 ing legislation regarding naturalization and citizenship. It did not pass a naturaliza-
 tion law, ar  ing it hadto await a legislature elected by Latvian citizens under Lat-
 vian law. Me to the policy of Russification during the Soviet occupation, ethnic
 Latvians make up only 52 percent of the total population, and none of Latvia's
 seven largest cities has an ethnic Latvian majority. The possibility that non-
 Latvians who entered the country while it was under Soviet rule and who had no
 proven affiliation to Latvia could control the balance of political power made citizen-
 ship and naturalization issues particularly sensitive for many Latvians. The Gov-
 ernment decided to schedule elections without resolving these issues. The new Par-
 liament deliberated on several draft naturalization laws, and final passage was ex-
 
 
 948
 pected in 1994. The draft naturalization bill of the Latvia's Way Party passed the
 legislature in November in its first reading; the bill is expected to be modified before
 its second reading. In the context of the deliberations, the Latvian Government has
 pledged to submit a draft of the naturalization legislation to the Council of Europe
 for review by legal experts.
 In October the Government directed authorities to close down three small organi-
 zations that allegedly had plotted a coup against Latvia in connection with the Octo-
 ber insurrection in Moscow. Prison conditions are so substandard that they threaten
 the health of prisoners. Juvenile detainees suffer from disease and are subject to
 violence and sexual abuse (see Section 1.c.).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-No such killings by Latvian authori-
 ties are known to have occurred.
 b. Disappearance. -There were no known instances of political abductions or dis-
 appearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is prohibited under the Constitution, and there were no indications that
 such abuses occurred.
 There were credible reports of beatings of detainees and prison inmates, including
 uveniles. Sanitation facilities in some cases are inadequate, and shortages of blan-
 kets and medical care persist. Poor ventilation and inadequate lighting are common.
 Under Soviet law, prisoners awaiting trial were not allowed to send mail, and in
 general this prohibition has been continued.
 The situation for some imprisoned children was egregious. Credible reports indi-
 cate that children 14 years old are kept in filthy conditions and suffer from disease
 and deprivation. Although detention is supposed to be no longer than 6 months,
 there were cases of children being kept in prison for up to a year and a half, and
 even reports of instances of juveniles being placed in solitary confinement. Both
 boys and girls are subject to violence and sexual abuse, and in one case a 15-year-
 old boy was reportedly strangled to death by his cellmates. There have been slight
 improvements in conditions since early 1993. A new head of the Rigs Central Prison
 is to assume duties in early 1994. One of the main problems continues to be a lack
 of resources.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were no known instances of arbi-
 trary arrest or exile. Arrests are made on the basis of a prosecutorial warrant. The
 law requires the prosecutor's office to make a formal decision whether to charge or
 release a detainee within 72 hours after arrest. Charges must be filed within 10
 days of arrest. A detainee may not be held for more than 6 months without new
 arrest orders being issued by the Procurator's office. No detainee may be held for
 more than 18 months without the case going to court. Detainees have the right to
 have an attorney present at any time. The court reviews fulfillment of these require-
 ments at trial.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial.-Latvia is reorganizing its courts along demo-
 cratic lines and adding regional courts. For more serious criminal cases, two lay
 judges join the professional judge in making a determination. The law envisions
 that capital cases will be heard by a 12-member jury, but no procedures exist to
 put this into effect. There are no reports of judges having been improperly influ-
 enced by the Government.
 Trials may be closed if state secrets might be revealed, but there is no known in-
 stance of this provision being used since Latvia regained independence. All defend-
 ants have the right to hire an attorney, and the State will lend funds to destitute
 defendants for this purpose. Defendants have the right to read all charges and
 confront all witnesses. Defendants may offer witnesses and evidence to support their
 case.
 During the August 1991 Soviet coup attempt, former Latvian Communist party
 chief Alfred Rubiks proclaimed himself head of the so-called National Salvation
 Committee, which is accused of attempting to seize power in Latvia. At year's end,
 he was on trial for his part in the attempted coup. Some observers criticized the
 2-year delay between his detention and the commencement of the trial, during
 which time he was denied bail. Rubiks was elected to the new Parliament, which
 deferred seating him pending the outcome of his trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Accord-
 ing to the Constitutional Law, a judge's order must be obtained to intercept mail,
 telephone calls, or other forms of communication. In practice, however, the law in
 force on investigations allows wiretaps and searches on a prosecutorial warrant.
 
 
 949
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Latvia generally enjoyed freedom of speech and
 press throughout 1993.
 The Constitutional Law contains provisions on free speech and press, and the
 1991 Latvian press law prohibits censorship of the press or other mass media. Both
 Latvian and Russian-langua    papers printed a wide range of criticism. The media
 actively covered all aspects of the spring election campaign.
 In August the Baltic News Service (BNS) and the country's largest Russian-lan-
 guage newspaper, Sm-Sevodnya, revealed that government security officers had
 pressured them on two occasions to "cooperate" in government investigations and
 to publish information provided by the Government. BNS and the newspaper ap-
 pealed to international media organizations to assist them in resisting such pres-
 sure. The Government disavowed the actions of the security officers involved but
 maintained no laws had been broken.
 In September Parliament began considering drafts of two laws on the print and
 broadcast media. Drafts contain provisions that, if enacted, could hamper freedom
 of the press. Latvian libel law remains modeled on Soviet libel law and has the
 same standards of proof for libel against public as against private figures. In No-
 vember a court awarded damages in libel suits by former Prime Minister Godmanis
 against two newspapers. Several other papers settled out of court with Godmanis.
 In the most serious case, the court awarded damages of $1,666 (1,000 Lats) to
 Godmanis against the country's largest newspaper for an August editorial that ac-
 cused the former Prime Minister of having acted more in the interest of a private
 company (in which he was alleged to have an interest) than in Latvia's national se-
 curity. The suit was seen by most publishers as an attempt to intimidate the media.
 By 1993, virtually all newspapers in Latvia had been privatized but overall cir-
 culation figures continued to drop due to the weakening economy. Despite the over-
 all decline in circulation figures, a number of new publications have appeared, and
 there has been no loss of variety of political views.
 In 1993 the number of independent television and radio broadcasters continued
 to grow. The independents include both Latvian and Russian-language stations. Two
 cable television companies compete for subscribers in Riga; the number of cable tele-
 vision subscribers continues to grow.
 There are no restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Latvian authorities legally do
 not have the power to prohibit public gatherings but may change the time and
 place, for example, on the grounds of fear of public disorder. In 1993 numerous mass
 meetings and political demonstrations took place without government interference.
 The Constitution provides for the right to associate in public organizations. Over 20
 political parties participated in the June elections.
 In October the Cabinet directed authorities to close three small organizations that
 allegedly had plotted a coup against the Latvian Government in connection with the
 October insurrection in Moscow, including the Union of Communists. That organiza-
 tion and the like-minded Union for the Protection of Veterans' Rights have sued the
 Government for its refusal to register them as legal organizations. Trials were
 scheduled to begin in December. Communist parties are illegal in Latvia. The only
 extant group of Communists is the politically insignificant Union of Communists.
 Although numerous small groupings have formed, resident Russians have not coa-
 lesced into any large, distinct political movements.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government does not interfere in the exercise of reli-
 gious freedom. The dominant faiths are Lutheran, Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox.
 Foreign evangelists are permitted to hold meetings and proselytize. Religious groups
 are not required to register with the Government, but the documents for incorpora-
 tion as a legal entity must be filed by members who are residents of Latvia.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation. -There are no obstacles to freedom of movement within the country, for-
 eign travel, or repatriation of citizens. The number of Latvians traveling abroad has
 increased dramatically over the past several years. Some noncitizens may require
 reentry permits. Exit visas or invitations are not required.
 Latvia is not a signatory to international conventions on refugees and does not
 have a law on political asylum. Most of those seeking refugee status are persons
 from the Middle East entering by land from Russia and hoping to reach Scandina-
 via; Latvia usually attempts to return such applicants to Russia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. Latvia in June held its first
 free and fair elections since 1931 with the participation of 23 political parties rep-
 
 
 950
 resenting a broad political spectrum. Eight parties won seats in the Saeima, and
 90 percent of eligible voters participated, using a secret ballot. As citizenship and
 naturalization questions were not resolved before the elections, there was no mecha-
 nism for residents of Latvia who were not citizens to participate in the elections.
 Parliamentary representation in Latvia is not based on ethnic identity, and ethnic
 Russians serve in the Cabinet and as members of Parliament.
 The coalition Latvia's Way obtained 36 of 100 seats in the Saeima and formed a
 parliamentary coalition with the Farmers' Union (12 seats). The Saeima approved
 Valdis Birkavs of Latvia's Way as Prime Minister and in July elected Guntis
 Ulmanis of the Farmers' Union as President (head of state). The next elections are
 scheduled for October 1995.
 In November Parliament approved in the first reading the draft naturalization bill
 submitted by the ruling Latvia's Way Party. The bill includes a language require-
 ment, with an exemption for senior citizens, and a 10-year residency requirement.
 The draft includes a prevision that the Government, with parliamentary approval,
 would set quotas each year for naturalization. Parliamentary committees are ex-
 pected to suggest many changes to the bill before its second reading. Latvia is work-
 ing with human rights experts from the Council of Europe on naturalization legisla-
 tion and has pledged to submit a draft to international organization human rights
 experts before final passage. The law barring naturalization until Russian troops
 are withdrawn remains in effect, but its standing is subject to continuing delibera-
 tions on the draft naturalization law.
 There have been documented instances of abuses by the Latvian Department of
 Immigration and Citizenship against residents who are not Latvian citizens. In
 some instances, decisions by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship were
 overturned by the Court, but the Department continued to refuse to carry out the
 Court's orders. The Government in December relieved the head of the Department
 of Immigration and Citizenship of his duties, and a new head is expected to take
 up responsibilities in early 1994.
 At the end of 1993, Parliament was debating a controversial law that would deter-
 mine whether noncitizens would have the right to vote in local elections.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights.
 There are several organizations that transmit concerns raised by local ethnic Rus-
 sians to the courts and the press, but there are no domestic human rights organiza-
 tions as such in Latvia.
 The Government welcomes visits by human rights organizations and received del-
 egations from, among others, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
 (CSCE), the Council of Europe, and the United Nations. In September the Govern-
 ment granted permission to the CSCE to establish a resident mission in the country
 to "address citizenship issues and other related matters." The mission will also re-
 port on "developments relevant to the full realization of CSCE principles, norms,
 and commitments."
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitutional Law provides that all persons are equal under the law regard-
 less of race, sex, religion, language, social status, or other grounds, and grants equal
 rights to work and wagestoal nationalities.
 Women.-Women possess the same legal rights as men. The law requires that
 women may not be hired for certain jobs considered dangerous; beyond this, employ-
 ment discrimination is banned. In reality, given the extreme competition for jobs
 and the potential cost of legally mandated child birth benefits, women frequently
 face hiring and pay discrimination, especially in the emerging private sector.
 Women apparently have not brought any discrimination suits before the courts.
 Adult prostitution has not been outlawed; it is increasing and is oen linked with
 organized crime. Reliable statistics on domestic violence against women are unavail-
 able. Seme cultural factors have fostered domestic violence, often associated with al-
 cohol abuse. Observers suggest that police are sometimes reluctant to arrest in such
 cases since the victims later often drop charges. No programs exist specifically to
 assist victims of domestic abuse, though normal government-provided health care
 and disability benefits apply.
 The women's advocacy groups that exist are still small. They are involved in find-
 ing employment for women, lobbying for increased social benefits, and opposing
 army hazing of recruits.
 Children.-The Government seeks to ensure that children's human rights are re-
 spected and their basic welfare needs met. A few children's advocacy groups are ac-
 
 
 951
 tive, particularly in lobbying for legislation to protect children's rights and for in-
 creased welfare payments for children. Legislative gaps hampered efforts to win con-
 victions in child molestation cases. Law enforcement authorities have won court
 suits to remove children from abusive parents and secured convictions in child pros-
 titution cases. For a discussion of physical and other abuse of children, see Section
 1.c.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitutional Law provides that only
 citizens may occupy state positions, establish political parties, own land, and "choose
 a place of abode on Latvian territory." Under the Constitution, all residents of Lat-
 via enjoy equal rights under the law but the majority of nonethnic Latvians cannot
 fully participate in the civic life of the country. Noncitizens were active in political
 parties during the election campaign, although they did not have the right to vote.
 The Latvian language law requires employees of the State and of all "institutions,
 enterprises, and institutes' to know su icient Latvian to carry out their profession.
 The law also requires such employees to be conversationally proficient in Latvian
 to be able to deal with the public. Despite the language law, there have been no
 reports of widespread dismissals even in the city of Daugavpils, in which 87 percent
 of the population is not ethnically Latvian and Russian is the prevailing language
 in industry. Nevertheless, many non-Latvians believe that they have been
 disenfranchised and that the language law discriminates against them, although
 there are no reports of widespread dismissals among management, teachers, or
 other sectors. In the case of the police force, which is predominantly made up of
 noncitizen ethnic Russians, non-Latvian speaking police officers were given 2 years
 to learn Latvian.
 Some ethnic Russians have also complained of de facto discrimination resulting
 from Latvia's property laws, which limit land ownership to citizens. Because of past
 Soviet Russification policies, ethnic Russians generally live in newer, better housing
 than ethnic Latvians. The level of compensation for their apartments to those emi-
 inr Rusa L    Ati doe nodfiil     rn    a comensatina       n tesaofcers, for
 artm       a s   ig      h   e    t  mit   thg   t lcas se se to find
 t           vn       y  n           t  y
 ways a round such legal restrictions.
 The Government has agreed to continue using Russian as the language of instruc-
 tion in public schools where the pupils are primarily Russian speakers. Although
 all non-Latvian speaking students in public schools are supposed to be taught Lat-
 vian, there are shortages of Latvian teachers. State-funded university education is
 in Latvian, except for the medical school and some classes for outgoing seniors. In-
 coming students whose native language is not Latvian must pass a Latvian lan-
 guage entrance exam. It remains the Government's stated goal that all public
 schools eventually convert to Latvian as the language of instruction.
 Jewish community leaders report anti-Semitism is not a major problem in Latvia
 and the government has been generally supportive of efforts to rejuvenate the Jew-
 ish community.
 People with Disabilities.-Latvia does not have a law banning discrimination
 against the disabled. The Government supports special schools for disabled persons.
 A law requiring buildings to be accessible to wheelchairs took effect on January 1,
 1993. Most buildings, however, are not accessible to wheelchairs.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Latvia's law on trade unions mandates that workers,
 except for the uniformed milita, have the right to form and join labor unions of
 their own choosing. In the fall of71993, about 50 percent of the work force belonged
 to unions; union membership is falling as workers leave Soviet-era unions that in-
 clude management or are laid off as Soviet-style factories fail. The Free Trades
 Union Federation of Latvia, the only significant labor uni onfederation, is non-
 eartisan, though some leaders ran as candidates for various smaller parties that
 ailed to enter Parliament. Unions are free to affiliate internationally and are devel-
 oping contacts with European labor unions and international labor union organiza-
 tions.
 The law does not limit the right to strike. Latvia saw almost no strikes in 1993.
 Although many state-owned factories are on the verge of bankruptcy, and seriously
 behind in wage payments, workers fear dismissal if they strike, and noncitizens fear
 that their participation in strikes ma4' affect their residency status. While the law
 bans such dismissals, the Government s abilit to enforce these laws is weak.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collctively. -Labor unions have the right
 to bargain collectively and are largely free of government interference in their nego-
 tiations with employers. The law prohibits discrimination against union members
 and organizers. Some emerging private sector businesses, however, threaten to fire
 
 
 union members; these businesses usually pay better salaries and benefits than are
 available elsewhere. The Government's alifity to protect the right to organize in the
 private sector is weak.
 No export processing zones exist in Latvia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is
 banned and is not practiced. Inspectors from the Welfare Ministry's Labor Depart-
 ment enforce the ban.
 d. Minimum Ae for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum age for
 employment of children is 15, although those aged 13 may work in certain jobs away
 from school hours. Children are required to attend school for 9 years. Child labor
 and school attendance laws are enforced by state authorities through inspections.
 The law restricts employment of those under 18, for instance, by banning night shift
 or overtime work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-As of the end of 1993, the minimum monthly
 wage was set at about $24 (15 lats). Latvian authorities estimate the poverty line
 to be about $83 (50 lats) per month. Many factories are virtually bankrupt and have
 reduced work hours.
 The Labor Code provides for a mandatory 40-hour maximum workweek with at
 least one 24-hour rest period, 4 weeks of annual vacation, and a program of assist-
 ance to working mothers with small children. Latvian laws establish minimum occu-
 pational health and safety standards for the workplace, but these standards are fre-
 quently ignored.
