 NIGERIA
 Nigeria is ruled by a military regime headed by President
 Ibrahim Babangida, who came to power by a military coup in
 August 1985, overthrowing a previous military regime which in
 turn had seized power from civilians in December 1983. A
 19-member Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) is the country's
 main decisionmaking organ, while a mixed military/civilian
 cabinet presides over the Federal Military Government's (FMG)
 executive functions. Military governors head each of the 21
 states, while a minister heads the Federal Capital Territory,
 Abuja. The 1979 Constitution remains partially in effect, but
 significant provisions, namely those guaranteeing free
 elections, political parties, due process, and habeas corpus
 are suspended. Federal and state legislation, promulgated by
 decree, is largely exempt from challenge in the courts. The
 FMG continues to plan a transition to democratic, civilian
 rule with a prescribed two-party system by 1992 (postponed
 from 1990).
 The Constituent Assembly, consisting of 450 locally elected
 members and 111 FMG-nominated members, submitted its revisions
 to the 1979 Constitution to the AFRC in March 1989. The AFRC
 in May approved the draft constitution, which is influenced by
 the U.S. Constitution; it remains substantially similar to the
 1979 Constitution and is scheduled to become law on October 1,
 1992. In October, however, President Babangida abolished
 newly emerged political associations for failing to meet
 guidelines for registering national parties. Then in December
 the AFRC established two national parties, one "slightly to
 the left" and the other "slightly to the right." It also
 delayed local and state level elections to allow the new
 parties to become organized but maintained the October 1992
 date for the return to civilian rule.
 The FMG enforces its authority through the Federal security
 apparatus--the military, the State Security Service (SSS), and
 the national police--and through the courts. Deficiencies in
 organization, management, and control often lead to ongoing
 human rights violations: arbitrary arrests, detention without
 trial, and excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.
 Most of Nigeria's 100-million-plus population still lives in
 rural areas, engaging in small-scale agriculture. Nigeria is
 dependent upon its oil exports (90 percent of all export
 revenues in 1988) to pay for needed imports and service its
 massive foreign debt ($33 billion at the end of 1988). The
 decline in world oil prices caused a drop in Nigeria's oil
 revenues from $26 billion in 1981 to $6 billion in 1985. To
 address the massive contraction of the economy, President
 Babangida imposed in 1986 a Structural Adjustment Program
 (SAP), which required radical adjustments to economic
 policies. These factors taken in combination have led to a
 substantial decline in the standard of living over the past
 decade.
 Human rights continued to be subject to limitation in 1989.
 While the Government frequently voiced its commitment to human
 rights, it took a harder line with its critics following riots
 in Lagos and other southern cities in May and June. These
 disturbances, triggered in part by increasing prices,
 encompassed allegations of corruption against top leaders,
 including President Babangida, and criticism of the SAP. The
 security apparatus responded with force, killing at least 22
 persons according to official reports, injuring many others,
 
 
 269
 NiIGERIA
 and arresting hundreds, many of whom remained imprisoned at
 the end of 1989. Many universities and several newspapers
 were closed temporarily, and journalists and activists were
 detained for alleging corruption of certain high officials and
 challenging the SAP. In December, however, the Government
 abolished rwandering" as a criminal offense (akin to vagrancy),
 which could henefit hundreds of Nigerians held without formal
 charge. Furthermore, on December 31, 1989, the FMG announced
 an amnesty of prisoners to alleviate overcrowded prisons.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There was no evidence of politically motivated killing at
 government or private instigation in 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 A portion of the 1979 Constitution still in effect outlaws
 torture and mistreatment of prisoners, and Nigerian law
 provides penalties for excesses. There was no evidence of the
 systematic use of torture by Nigerian authorities in 1989,
 although in April a High Court Judge ruled against the
 defendant in one police torture case. Moreover, there were
 persistent, though unsubstantiated, allegations that capital
 punishment of convicted armed robbers is sometimes carried out
 in an inhumane way. Other public allegations and evidence of
 police brutality surfaced periodically in 1989 in connection
 with the treatment of common criminals and with relation to
 the Ketu incident (Section l.g.).
 There are also frequent charges of police brutality or
 arbitrary treatment at police checkpoints. Ostensibly to
 combat the high crime rate, these checkpoints are set up
 throughout the country, and police are often accused of
 demanding bribes or producing false arrests. Human rights
 activists and other observers claim that police make arbitrary
 arrests and attempt to extract small bribes during transport
 to detention facilities. There have also been cases of
 military personnel harassing citizens or taking the law into
 their own hands over personal disputes without being
 disciplined or punished. The Government has spoken out
 against these practices, but there have been few prosecutions
 for them.
 The press reports that prison conditions remain poor and that
 the prison system is operating at 200 percent of capacity.
 Conditions likely worsened from the large influx of new
 detainees following the riots in May and June. The Government
 has acknowledged overcrowding and has announced a program to
 build new prisons, although little construction began in
 1989. The combination of overcrowding, disease, and
 malnutrition in prisons has resulted in a heavy death toll.
 According to reputable press sources, the Ikoyi prison in
 Lagos, housing 2,500 though designed for 800, recorded 42
 deaths in the first 3 months of 1989 and over 300 deaths in
 
 
 270
 NIGERIA
 1988. Most Nigerian prisons have no toilet facilities and no
 water in the cells. Press sources report that the Benin
 prison has one water tap for its 800 prisoners. They are
 often forced by overcrowding to sleep in shifts, crouched on
 the cell floor. Prisoners often accuse underpaid prison
 wardens of stealing food supplies. The insane, the diseased,
 juveniles, convicts, and suspects are all housed in the same
 cells.
 The existence of a secret government prison on Ita Oka Island
 was revealed in 1988 by the Nigerian Civil Liberties
 Organization and was publicized by a leading Lagos newspaper.
 The Government announced 10 days later that the facility had
 been closed, but in 1989 there were new allegations that the
 facility still houses prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Cumbersome administrative procedures and bureaucratic
 inefficiency can result in persons suspected of criminal
 offenses being held for extended periods without charge or
 trial. This is so even though provisions of the 1979
 Constitution still in force guarantee persons charged with
 crimes a fair public trial in civilian courts within 3 months
 of the date of arrest. Criminal justice officials, however,
 freely admit that the system is so overburdened that the
 3-month time limit is rarely met. A report was submitted to
 the Attorney General in 1989 which included unpublished
 recommendations for correcting these abuses. In December,
 however, the Government abolished the criminal offense of
 "wandering," a hold-over from colonial statutes designed to
 exclude Nigerians from government-restricted areas. The
 statute had been misused as a vagrancy law and an excuse for
 police officers to detain persons without charge. On December
 31, 1989, the FMG announced a broad amnesty of convicted
 prisoners to alleviate greatly overcrowded prison conditions.
 Certain high court chief judges continued in 1989 to exercise
 their right to release detainees who have already spent more
 time in prison than they would serve if convicted of the
 crimes of which they are accused. However, human rights
 activists claim that 60 percent or more of a prison population
 of 58,000 are awaiting trial--often for many years--for
 offenses that carry a sentence of 2 years or less.
 The Babangida Government has retained the authority to detain
 without charge persons suspected of acts prejudicial to state
 security or harmful to the economic well-being of the country,
 as well as those suspected of being a threat to the Government
 under Decree 2 of 1984, the State Security (Detention of
 Persons) Decree. This Decree suspends sections of the 1979
 Constitution guaranteeing citizens the right to fair trial,
 due process, and judicial determination of the legality of
 detention (habeas corpus). While it imposes no time limit and
 disallows challenges of the detention in a court of law, the
 Decree provides for administrative review of such cases every
 3 months.
 Arrest authority under this Decree was expanded in 1989 and
 was shared by the Chief of General Staff, the Minister of
 Internal Affairs, and the Inspector-General of Police. The
 Government showed a penchant for using Decree 2 arbitrarily to
 detain persons it considered a threat to "public order"--which
 critics charged too often meant simple opposition to key
 
 
 271
 NIGERIA
 government policies--for an indefinite period of time. Human
 rights activists and lawyers groups sharply attacked the
 Government on the issue of Decree 2 throughout 1989. The
 Government, through its civiliai Minister of Justice, publicly
 defended'the security merits of Decree 2 and claimed that the
 Babangida regime has invoked it less often than the Buhari
 regime or other previous military regimes using similar
 decrees. Human rights observers, however, accused the
 Government by its stance on Decree 2 of paying only lip
 service to human rights. They claimed in late August that
 there were currently about 90 persons detained under Decree 2,
 80 of whom were in Lagos prisons.
 The most celebrated Decree 2 case of 1989 was that of
 outspoken government critic and Lagos lawyer, Chief Gani
 Fawehinmi. Fawehinmi, with several other persons, was
 arrested soon after the May/June riots, ostensibly for
 attempting to organize a conference on alternatives to the
 SAP. Soon after his arrest, Fawehinmi was transferred
 clandestinely to a prison facility in Borno State. In
 September, after 3 months of public outcry, Fawehinmi was
 brought back to Lagos, charged with disrupting the transition
 to civilian rule, granted bail, and immediately rearrested
 under Decree 2 and returned to Borno State. In October 1989,
 however, the FMG released Fawehinmi while awaiting trial.
 Since he continued to speak out on'political issues, there
 were apparently no restrictions on his freedom of speech, and
 his passport was restored to him.
 In another highly publicized Decree 2 case, the FMG released
 Alhaji Balarabe Musa, former governor of Kaduna State on
 October 10 after 155 days of detention for unauthorized
 political activity. Musa launched the People's Liberation
 Party in May, even though he is banned from politics until
 1992 (see Section 2.b.).
 Many detainees are held on grounds other than Decree 2. Human
 rights activists claim that detainees being held without
 charge in connection with the May/June riots and as a result
 of shortcomings in the administration of the criminal justice
 system still numbered in the hundreds at the end of 1989 and
 that the families of those still in jail or who have
 "disappeared" in the system refuse, to go public for fear of
 arrest.
 In 1989 the Government continued a process, begun in 1986, of
 reviewing the cases of persons detained or convicted under
 various decrees during the previous military administration
 (1984-1985), many of whom have already been released. In
 addition, all of those arrested as a result of the 1985 coup
 which brought Babangida into power have been released,
 including former Head of State Muhamadu Buhari and his
 second-in-command, Tunde Idiagbon.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The 1984 Decree modifying the 1979 Constitution left the
 judiciary relatively intact, but it shifted judicial
 responsibility for certain specified offenses to special
 military tribunals established outside the regular judicial
 system. The latter is composed of both federal and state
 courts and includes procedures for appeals from courts of
 first instance to appeal courts at state levels, then to the
 
 
 272
 IGERIA
 Federal Court of Appeal, and finally to the Federal Supreme
 Court. Courts of first instance under the 1979 Constitution
 include magistrate or district courts, customary or area
 courts, religious or Shari'a courts, and, for some specified
 cases, the state High Courts. In some instances, the nature
 of the case determines which court has jurisdiction. In
 principle, customary and Shari'a courts have jurisdiction only
 if both the plaintiff and the defendant agree to it, though in
 practice fear of legal costs, delay, and distance to other
 alternative courts push a number of litigants into these
 courts. Under the 1989 draft constitution (which is scheduled
 to come into force in 1992) Sharila (Islamic) courts are
 limited to followers of Islam and effectively confined to the
 11 northern states of Nigeria.
 Trials in the regular court system are public and respect
 certain constitutionally guaranteed individual rights. These
 include a presumption of innocence, the right to be present at
 a public trial, to confront witnesses and present evidence,
 and to be represented by legal counsel, if so desired. In
 capital cases, the Government provides counsel for indigent
 defendants. In other cases, indigents must rely for counsel
 on the Nigerian legal aid council, which has limited
 resources. Assistance is extended under the Legal Aid Act of
 1976 to persons with incomes of up to about $200 (at the
 current official rate of exchange) per year. There is legal
 provision for bail, though the Nigerian Bar Association
 charges that bail is underutilized with the result that many
 accused persons remain in jail while awaiting trial for petty
 offenses. Bail is denied to those charged with murder and
 armed robbery.
 The AFRC has weakened the regular court system through decrees
 promulgated by the previous military government that are still
 in effect. Under these decrees, the AFRC has transferred
 jurisdiction over cases involving corruption, currency
 violations, armed robbery, and a variety of miscellaneous
 offenses, such as drug trafficking and illegal oil bunkering,
 from the civilian judicial system to special military
 tribunals. In these cases, those charged have access to legal
 assistance, bail (except in the case of armed robbery), and
 the right to appeal (except in the case of armed robbery and
 conviction under the civil disturbances decree). In contrast
 to the previous regime, however, civilian judges now head all
 special tribunals. Military and police officers sit on these
 tribunals as coequals with the judge. Sentences by these
 special tribunals are generally severe. Convictions for armed
 robbery by the Special Robbery and Firearms Tribunals carry
 the death sentence and no right of appeal, although the
 sentence must be confirmed by the state's military governor
 before it is carried out. Conviction under the Treason and
 Other Offenses Tribunal (formed in 1986) also carries the
 death sentence and provides for appeal only to the Joint
 Chiefs of Staff. The Special Appeal Tribunal began its first
 hearing in September 1987. Its recommendations cannot be
 appealed but are subject to AFRC confirmation.
 Legal observers have been particularly critical of the
 mandatory death penalty without right of appeal, especially
 for convictions for armed robbery where the sums involved are
 minor and there appear to be irregularities in procedure.
 Armed robbers have been sentenced to death for stealing sums
 as small as about $40. Amnesty International, in its 1989
 Report, asserted that these special -courts do not meet
 
 
 273
 IGERIA
 international standards for a fair trial, especially because
 they do not allow the right of appeal.
 Judicial convictions for political- offenses (as opposed to
 detentions) are rare in Nigeria. Some observers claim that
 there are political prisoners in Nigerian jails, but can give
 no numbers and often make no distinction between those
 detainees held without charge and those convicted of political
 offenses.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Nigerian society is generally free of arbitrary interference
 by the State in the private lives of its citizens. Provisions
 of the 1979 Constitution still in force provide for rights of
 privacy in the home, correspondence, and oral electronic
 communications. While there have been isolated instances of
 unauthorized forced entry by security elements, the State does
 not carry out general surveillance of the population.
 However, in the aftermath of the May/June riots, the wife of
 the editor of The Republic newspaper was arrested in her home
 and the dwelling unlawfully searched when security forces
 failed to locate him for arrest. Human rights observers also
 alleged that government security forces intimidated potential
 witnesses after the May/June riots to prevent them from giving
 details on human rights violations by threatening arbitrary
 search and arrest. Such allegations, however, were
 unsubstantiated.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 The issue of police brutality was a major focus of the press
 and human rights activists in the aftermath of the May/June
 1989 riots in many parts of Nigeria. Security forces
 responded with force, killing at least 22 persons nationwide
 according to official reports. Human rights observers claim
 the death toll was much higher--over 200 by some estimates.
 In one highly publicized incident, police forces allegedly
 rounded up several hundred persons on the street in Ketu, a
 Lagos borough, and transported them to the nearby police
 station where many were forced into a small cell. Up to 50
 persons reportedly died from suffocation and being crushed.
 Despite the widespread publicity, no source could verify these
 claims. The Government conducted an investigation, placing
 the station's superintendent on administrative leave. He was
 later cleared and transferred.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The modified 1979 Constitution continues to provide for
 freedom of bpeech and the press, but it also reserves for the
 federal and state governments the exclusive right to own and
 operate radio and television stations. There are no
 restrictions on ownership of print media and Nigeria has a
 lively press. Among the many Nigerian daily newspapers are
 seven privately owned national dailies with large
 circulations, one daily owned by the federal Government, and
 another in which the federal Government owns a majority
 share. Many states operate their own daily or weekly
 newspapers. In some states privately owned dailies compete
 
 
 274
 NIGERIA
 with state papers. Six weekly news magazines vie for national
 readership.
 Broad criticism of the Government is tolerated, and there is
 open discussion of political, social, and economic issues.
 However, officials frequently caution journalists, both
 publicly and privately, on their responsibility and the limits
 on press activity. Although there are no published guidelines
 or decrees that limit freedom of speech and the press, most
 journalists make a well-considered decision in advance of
 publication before they step over what they sense to be the
 Government's line. The issues considered most sensitive by
 the Government are normally associated with naming top
 government officials in connection with corruption,
 publication of subjects the Government believes will incite
 the public to riot or otherwise undermine state security, and
 subjects which fall under "disrupting the transition to civil
 rule program." As a result, journalists maintain that
 self-censorship is common.
 In 1989 federal and state governments continued to arrest,
 interrogate, and detain individuals who made, or were
 preparing to make, public statements the Government considered
 threatening. The arrest in June 1989 of Chief Gani Fawehinmi
 and several others (noted in Section l.d.) is an example.
 Also in June, The Republic newspaper editor and 12 staff
 members were arrested and the newspaper closed to prevent
 distribution of an issue reportedly containing an expose of
 the illegal financial transactions of the Chief of General
 Staff. All copies of the issue were confiscated on the
 grounds that it included material which was "offensive to the
 nation." All detainees were subsequently released and the
 newspaper allowed to resume publication within several days.
 Other journalists were detained and several newspapers
 temporarily closed throughout 1989; all have subsequently been
 released and the affected newspapers have resumed publication.
 Academic freedom is generally respected by the Babangida
 Government. There were no reports of censorship of books or
 other academic publications in 1989 or of intimidation of
 university faculty. Some observers allege that the State
 Security Service maintains an active undercover presence on
 university campuses and reports directly to the Government on
 acts or attitudes deemed to threaten state security.
 The National Association of Nigerian Students and the Academic
 Staff Union of Universities remain banned for "radical
 activities." However, the Government has tolerated formation
 of new organs of student government on individual campuses.
 University vice-chancellors are held directly responsible for
 maintenance of public order on campuses and are given broad
 authority to close universities. Such closures were
 commonplace in 1989 in response to a spate of violent student
 demonstrations over campus conditions. In May and June 1989,
 the focus of student protests turned to government corruption
 and the SAP. In response, the Government announced the
 closure of six southern universities for a full academic year,
 then later reversed itself, allowing the campuses to reopen on
 October 31.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Nigeria's 1979 Constitution assures all citizens the right to
 assemble freely and to associate with other persons in
 political parties, trade unions, or other special interest
 
 
 associations. Permits are not normally required for public
 meetings indoors, unless administrative approval is needed to
 use a government facility. Permits are required in many areas
 for outdoor gatherings, but the requirement is routinely
 ignored by both the authorities and the organizations holding
 the meeting or rally. In a few isolated incidents in 1989
 security forces broke up public meetings for lack of a permit
 when the Government found the subject matter of the meeting
 objectionable or-threatening--namely criticism of the SAP. In
 most states, open-air religious services outside a church or a
 mosque continue to be prohibited.
 The provision regarding the right to form and join political
 parties was suspended by Decree 9 of 1984. The decree-imposed
 ban on bolitical activity was lifted in May 1989 in the run-up
 to registration of the two national political parties in
 October 1989. However, hundreds of present and former
 government officials and politicians remain banned from
 running for elective office in the local, state and federal
 elections scheduled for 1990-1992. Nevertheless, the
 Government often turns a blind eye to their participation in
 political events, provided they remain discreet and do not
 openly challenge the government Decree.
 Before the ban was lifted in May 1989, the police broke up
 several gatherings suspected to be political in nature.
 Several persona, including former Kaduna State governor
 Balarabe Musa, were arrested for violating the ban on
 political activity and held under Decree 2. In Musa's case,
 the Government also claims that he is a banned politician by
 virtue of his former off-ice, though no comprehensive list of
 all banned politicians has been published, and the definition
 of "banned politicians" is vague., After a prolonged court
 battle over both accusations against Musa (violation of the
 ban on political activity and status of a banned politician),
 the case was dropped, apparently on a technicality, although
 the FMG continues to maintain that Musa is a banned politician.
 Nigerians form and participate in a wide variety of special
 interest organizations, including religious groups, trade
 groups, women's organizations, and professional associations.
 Organizations are not required to register with the Government
 and are generally permitted free association with other
 national and international bodies. Following the March 1987
 religious disturbances, however, the Government required that
 religious groups be sanctioned by either the Christian
 Association of Nigeria or the Supreme Council for Islamic
 Affairs.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Nigeria's 1979 Constitution prohibits the federal and state
 governments from adopting any state religion. This is adhered
 to in practice, though some Christians have maintained in the
 past that Islam or northern origin have provided a political
 advantage. Constitutional provisions guaranteeing freedom of
 religious belief, religious practice, and religious education
 are generally respected. Reports are common that various
 ethnic groups (including local and state officials belonging
 to that group) discriminate against minorities (both ethnic
 and religious). Such actions often take the form of
 employment discrimination and bureaucratic obstacles to church
 
 
 276
 NIGRIA
 or mosque construction that delay projects, sometimes
 indefinitely. There are no restrictions on the numbers of
 clergy trained nor on contacts with coreligionists in other
 countries. Religious travel, including the hajj, is permitted
 and is even subsidized by the Federal Government.
 Publications in Arabic and the teaching of Arabic are freely
 allowed, even in predominantly Christian areas. Missionaries
 and foreign clergy, though limited by quotas, are permitted to
 work in Nigeria. The Government places no obstacles in the
 way of Nigerian missionaries working in other countries.
 Tensions between the Muslim and Christian communities remain
 high in some parts of Nigeria. Though scattered incidents
 continue to be reported, religious violence on the scale of
 the rioting which took place in the northern state of Kaduna
 in 1987 has not been repeated. In the aftermath of those
 disturbances, the Government instituted a ban, still in
 effect, on all religious organizations on postprimary
 campuses, while reaffirming the right of individual students
 to practice their religion in recognized places of worship.
 Several state governments temporarily banned religious
 preaching and playing of religious cassettes outside places of
 worship, without the written permission of police.
 Publication of advertisements paid for by religious
 organizations remains banned, although the ban is not strictly
 enforced as such advertisements occasionally appear in the
 press. Religious programming on radio and television, both
 controlled by the FMG, remains limited in some areas. The
 1982 ban on the Maitatsine Muslim sect, the source of bloody
 disturbances in 1982 and 1983, also remains in effect. The
 group still exists but is closely monitored by the police.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Nigeria's Constitution entitles citizens to move freely
 throughout Nigeria and to reside where they wish. The same
 provision prohibits expulsion from Nigeria or the denial of
 entry to or exit from Nigeria to any citizen. In general,
 these provisions have been observed. Following the elections
 in December 1987 and March 1988, chairmen of local government
 areas were ordered in June 1988 to inform their respective
 state governors of travel outside of their areas. Traditional
 rulers are also obligated to inform local government chairmen
 of their travel. Nigerians travel abroad in large numbers,
 and many thousands are studying abroad. Exit visas are not
 required. But passports of editors and reporters have been
 seized to prevent them from traveling after their publications
 have printed stories offensive to the Government. Also, under
 Nigerian law, wives--including expatriate wives--must have the
 permission of husbands to take children out of the country.
 Security officials in the past have prevented wives from
 leaving the country with children, but there were no reports
 of such interference in 1989. Citizens who leave Nigeria have
 the right to return. Citizenship cannot be revoked for any
 reason, including political reasons. No known penalties have
 been levied on Nigerians who have emigrated, settled abroad,
 or acquired another nationality. However, Nigeria does not
 recognize dual nationality, and naturalization in another
 country does not exempt Nigerians from Nigerian laws.
 Nigerians are free to change their place of work within
 Nigeria, but local laws and custom sometimes disadvantage
 citizens not indigenous to the area. For example, access to
 limited places in elementary and secondary schools is more
 
 
 277
 N~IGERIA
 difficult for children of residents of other areas who must
 also pay higher school fees than the children of local
 residents. 'There has been no forced resettlement of Nigerian
 citizens.
 Nigerian law and practice permit temporary refuge and asylum
 in Nigeria for political refugees from other countries.
 Nigeria supports and cooperates with the Lagos office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 Repatriation of refugees is normally conducted in accordance
 with UNHCR standards.  In 1989 several hundred Chadian
 refugees were repatriated at their request. No refugees were
 expelled in 1989.
 Section.3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The 19-member AFRC headed by President Babangida is the
 highest political authority in Nigeria. There is no elected
 legislative body. In 1989 citizens did not have the right to
 change their national or state governments through the
 electoral process.
 President Babangida has repeatedly stated that 1992 is the
 date for returning Nigeria to complete civilian rule. An
 appointed civilian Constitutional Review Commission completed
 its work in ewrly 1988 and in April presented a draft
 constitution to the AFRC. In June 1988, the Constituent
 Assembly, made up of representatives elected by Local
 Government Areas (basic government units) and including
 representatives of special groups (labor, women, religious
 leaders) appointed by the Government, began the process of
 refining and ratifying the Constitution in Abuja. The
 Constituent Assembly presented its recommendations and a
 revised draft to the Government in March 1989. Following AFRC
 approval of the new draft constitution, the FMG lifted the ban
 on political activity in May 1989 to allow political groups to
 form and compete for registration of two national political
 parties. Thirteen political associations emerged to compete
 for party registration.
 In August 1989, the F1MG by decree removed from office all
 elected chairmen of Local Government Areas to prepare for the
 new local government elections originally scheduled for
 December 1989. This decree established that during the period
 of transition to civilian rule, the Federal Military
 Government may suspend elected officials without reference to
 the judicial system.
 In October 1989, the National Electoral Commission (NEC)
 reported to the AFRC that the emerging political structure was
 riddled with irregularities and that none of the 13 political
 associations met the guidelines for party registration. The
 NEC concluded that the party registration competition had
 failed to meet its objective of transforming Nigeria's
 political culture by creating a "new breed" of politicians
 free from control of the "moneybags" and regional, ethnic, and
 religious bias. On October 7, President Babangida abolished
 all 13 political associations and announced that the FMG would
 create two new political parties: one "slightly to the left"
 and one "slightly to the right." In December 1989, the FMG
 enacted a decree establishing the new political parties and
 signaling its intention to maintain strict control over the
 transition process. Another December decree upheld completion
 of the transition by October 1992 but altered its timetable by
 
 
 278
 NIGERIA
 allowing the two new parties to coalesce and identify
 candidates during the first 9 months of 1990, postponing local
 elections from December 1989 until the last quarter of 1990
 and delaying gubernatorial and state legislative elections
 from 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991.
 Thousands of former Nigerian government officials, both
 civilian and military, are prohibited from participating fully
 in the transition process, although they remain eligible to
 vote. In September 1987, the Government significantly
 extended a ban announced in 1986 on partisan political
 activity for a large number of former politicians from the
 last civilian regime (1979-83) to include many political
 figures from the first civilian republic (1960-66) and past
 and present high-ranking military leaders. These persons,
 including President Babangida himself, will be barred from
 contesting any election until after the transition is
 completed in 1992. Also, former politicians who were officers
 of the previous parties will be forbidden to hold office in
 any political party or to run for elected office until that
 time. Furthermore, any person convicted or removed from
 office for various misdeeds at any time since 1960 will be
 banned for life from contesting elections or holding any
 political party office.
 Along with the July 1987 announcement of the political
 transition program, the Government promulgated Decree 19 of
 1987, which makes persons who might in any way forestall or
 prejudice the transition program liable to a prison term of up
 to 5 years. The Special Tribunal authorized to try offenses
 under Decree 19 was formed in October 1987. Its decisions may
 be appealed to the Special Appeal Tribunal.
 The composition of the AFRC and Cabinet reflects greater
 ethnic and religious diversity than any government in the
 recent past.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 As far as is known, there were no visits or requests for
 investigations of alleged human rights violations in Nigeria
 during 1989 by any international human rights group. The
 Babangida Government repeatedly renewed its pledge to uphold
 basic human rights and to tolerate criticism from local human
 rights advocates in 1989. The Human Rights Committee of the
 Nigerian Bar Association monitors the domestic human rights
 situation and characteristically speaks out against human
 rights abuses. At least four major local groups are active in
 human rights matters: the Committee for the Defense of Human
 Rights, led by a prominent Lagos physician; the Nigerian
 Council for Human Rights, chaired by a leading Senior Advocate
 of Nigeria (SAN); Human Rights Africa, led by a prominent
 Lagos lawyer and President of the Nigerian Trial Lawyers
 Association; and the Civil Liberties Organization (CLO), led
 by several Lagos attorneys and a prominent journalist. Nobel
 laureate Wole Soyinka also frequently speaks out on human
 rights issues. The Nigerian Bar Association, Soyinka, and
 leaders of all four human rights groups all made strong public
 statements criticizing the Government's continued use of
 Decree 2 and other forms of detention without charge. A
 former president of the Nigerian Bar Association, who also
 served as the chairman of its Human. Rights Committee,
 continues to hold the post of Attorney General and Minister of
 
 
 279
 NIGERIA
 Justice. He has been severely criticized by human rights
 activists for his defense of Decree 2.
 While most human rights monitors were relatively free from
 government interference in 1989, four officers of CLO were
 briefly questioned by police in January 1989 about a CLO
 report on. the status of human rights in Nigeria, but no action
 was taken against them. The CLO continues to investigate
 prison conditions and monitors developments at the Ita Oko
 Island detention center, in addition to speaking out against
 rDecree 2. Nigeria is-a member of the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no official policy of discrimination against any of
 Nigeria's 250 ethnic groups, and laws do not overtly favor one
 group over another. The Government generally makes a
 conscious effort to strike a balance among different groups in
 its decisionmaking and in appointments to key government
 -positions, and ethnic and regional hiring quotas are observed
 in -most puhli6 sector employment. However, Nigeria has a long
 historyof-tesion among its diverse ethnic groups, and
 tradition continues to impose considerable pressure on
 individual government officials to favor their own ethnic or
 .religious group. Religious and ethnic favoritism or
 harassmeht persist and are widely perceived to persist.
 Persons.not indigenous to their state of residence frequently
 experience ifficulty in jobseeking, school enrollment, and
 other areas.
 Women have always had economic power and have exerted
 influence in Nigerian society through women's councils or
 through their family connections. As primary school
 enrollment increases, women are gaining greater access to
 education. There has been a dramatic increase in the number
 -of women who have university degrees and who have become
 professionals, including teachers, lawyers, doctors, judges,
 senior government officials, media figures, and business
 executives. Despite a degree of economic independence, women
 suffer discrimination in employment and other areas, and
 experience social prejudice. The pattern of discrimination
 against women varies according to the ethnic and religious
 diversity of Nigeria's vast population. In some states,
 husbands can prevent their wives from obtaining employment or
 passports. In many states, a widow-cannot inherit her
 husband's property, which in the absence of children usually
 reverts to the husband's family. Women do not receive equal
 pay for equal work, and male professionals receive fringe
 benefits not extended to their female counterparts.
 While violence against women, especially wife beating, exists,
 there are no statistical data to help determine the extent of
 the problem. Police do not normally intervene in domestic
 disputes. Reports of wife beating tend to come from rural
 areas, where women are generally uneducated and the use of the
 legal system to protect themselves is a foreign concept and
 unlikely to be used because of pressure from traditional
 authorities. The Government has neither actively addressed
 nor sanctioned this practice, which is subject to the
 provisions of criminal law if brought to the courts. There is
 no reason to believe that the legal system would not intervene
 to protect women from wife abuse if a husband were formally
 accused. In the case of female circumcision, the Government
 
 
 280
 NIGERIA
 publicly opposes this practice, which reportedly affects about
 50 percent of the female population. The most dangerous form,
 infibulation, is practiced in some areas. However, because of
 the deep cultural roots of this practice, the Government has
 relied primarily on education through women's and public
 health organizations to help induce change in attitudes,
 rather than trying to criminalize the practice. The
 Government also opposes the selling of young girls for
 marriage by poor rural families, again primarily through
 education.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Nigerian workers may join trade unions, with the exception of
 members of the armed forces and employees of government
 services designated essential by the FMG. Employers are
 obliged by law to recognize trade unions and must pay a dues
 checkoff for employees who are members of a registered trade
 union. In 1981 organized labor claimed 3 million members out
 of a total work force of 30 million. Since then, the
 available work force has increased as the population has
 grown, while trade union membership has probably declined due
 to low economic growth.
 While the trade union movement has had, within limits,
 considerable latitude for action, it is subject to government
 oversight, which has increased during the past 2 years.
 Despite provisions in the 1979 Constitution and Nigeria's
 ratification of 28 International Labor Organization (ILO)
 conventions, government decrees and policy continue to
 restrict labor freedoms. A 1978 decree established a single
 central labor body, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), created
 42 industrial unions through forced mergers and deregistered
 all other unions. Since then the Government has publicly
 announced its intention to merge the present 42 unions into
 19. The Government has not acted upon an ILO Committee of
 Experts' finding, first enunciated in 1979 and subsequently
 repeated, that this 1978 decree violates ILO Convention 87 on
 Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to
 Organize, to which Nigeria is a party. Nor has the Government
 accepted the Committee of Experts' recommendation that the
 decree be amended.
 In December 1988, elections were held for NLC national and
 state councils to replace the councils which had been
 dissolved by the Government earlier in the year. The
 Government permitted only a single slate of candidates
 acceptable to the Government, comprised of members of the two
 major NLC factions, to run in the national council election.
 The other candidates who attempted to run were disqualified.
 The right to strike is recognized by law, except in the case
 of essential services as defined by the Government. Work
 stoppages, strikes, and protests during 1989 were relatively
 few and focused primarily upon pay issues. In February
 railway workers went on strike, for the second time in 3
 months, to collect back wages and allowances owed them; the
 strike ended when the railway authorities paid the arrears.
 At about the same time eight civil service unions threatened
 mass rallies to support their demand for restoration of fringe
 benefits which had been canceled or reduced by the 1989
 budget. The Government responded by making funds available to
 restore the benefits.
 
 
 281
 NIGERIA
 Since 1975, government policy has permitted international
 labor affiliation only with the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and affiliated Pan-African labor federations.
 Government policy does permit, however, informal "fraternal
 relations" with foreign unions and international trade
 secretariats as long as there is no formal affiliation.
 Eleven senior employees of the National Electric Power
 Authority remain in pFison, their life sentences reduced to 10
 years, for conspiracy in connection with the October 1988
 disruption of the national electrical power grid. For a
 number of years the ILO Committee of Experts has urged the
 Government to amend its legislation to cover various
 categories of workers excluded from protection against acts of
 antiunion discrimination.
 Labor unions did not participate in the May 1989 protests and.
 riots against the Government's Structural Adjustment Program.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The labor laws of Nigeria permit both the right to organize
 and the right to bargain collectively between management and
 trade unions. Collectiye bargaining is, in fact, common in
 many sectors-of the economy. Nigerian law further protects
 workers against retaliation by employers for labor activity
 through an independent arm of the judiciary, the Nigerian
 Industrial Court.
 The FMG, however, retains broad authority over labor matters.
 In many areas of contention, the unions often take their
 demands directly to FMG authorities rather than to the
 employers. At the same time, the FMG can intervene forcefully
 to end debate on issues which its feels contravene the
 Government's essential political or economic programs. (The
 dispersal of the labor-organized conference on alternatives to
 the SAP, which led to the arrest of Gani Fawehinmi--Section
 l.d., is a case in point.) Moreover, decisions which have a
 major impact on labor are often taken unilaterally. NLC
 President Bafyau complained, for example, that his
 organization was excluded from the formulation of the 1989
 budget, which, in effect, mandated continued austerity for
 most workers and included a variety of cost cutting measures
 of concern to the unions.
 There are no export processing zones in Nigeria.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Nigeria's 1979 Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory
 labor, and this prohibition is generally observed. The
 Government does operate a National Youth Service Corps under
 which all youths or young adults who have completed college or
 university training and are under the age of 30 must complete
 1 year of work.in jobs ranging from agriculture to office work
 and teaching. The Government also has an environmental
 clean-up campaign in which all citizens are required to spend
 the morning of the final Saturday of each month tidying their
 house, yard, and neighborhood and to refrain from moving about
 during this period. Both programs enjoy widespread public
 support.
 The ILO Committee of Experts has-noted that various provisions
 of the Labor Decree of 1974, the Merchant Shipping Act, and
 the Trade Disputes Decree of 1976 impose sanctions that
 
 
 282
 NIERIA
 obligate work for breaches of labor discipline or for taking
 part in a strike. The Committee has urged the Government to
 adopt the necessary measures to bring these laws into
 compliance with ILO Convention 105 on Forced Labor to which
 Nigeria is a party.
 d. Minimum Age of Employment of Children
 Nigeria's 1974 Labor Decree prohibits employment of children
 under 15 years of age in commerce and industry and restricts
 other child labor to home-based agricultural or domestic
 work. The Labor Decree does allow the apprenticeship of
 youths aged 13 to 15, but only under specific conditions.
 Apprenticeship exists in a wide range of crafts, trades and
 state enterprises. With respect to apprentices over the age
 of 15, their activity is not specifically regulated by the
 Government. These laws are enforced only sporadically,
 particularly in the rural areas where most Nigerians live.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Nigeria's 1974 Labor Decree also established a 40-hour
 workweek, prescribed 2 to 4 weeks of annual leave, and set a
 minimum wage for commerce and industry of about $17 per month
 at the current official rate of exchange but at the time of
 enactment worth nearly $200 per month. This wage is now
 sufficient only for the most minimal standard of living in the
 cities, and the Nigeria Labour Congress has called on the
 Government to increase it. The 1974 Decree contains general
 health and safety provisions, some aimed specifically at young
 and female workers, enforceable by the Ministry of Employment,
 Labour, and Productivity. Employers must compensate injured
 workers and dependent survivors of those killed in industrial
 accidents. The ineffectiveness of the Ministry in enforcing
 these laws in the workplace is regularly criticized by labor
 unions.
