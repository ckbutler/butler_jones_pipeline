 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a republic with an active multiparty democratic system, a bicameral
 Congress, and a popularly elected president. Over three decades of two-party domi-
 nance ended in 1994 when former president Rafael Caldera was sworn in as Presi-
 dent with the support of a coalition of small and medium sized parties. Five major
 political groupings now comprise the Congress. In July 1995, the Government rein-
 stated most of the constitutional protections for citizens' rights that it had sus-
 pended in June 1994 ostensibly to combat subversion and to address the country's
 financial crisis. In some border areas, suspension of the freedom from arbitray ar-
 rest and detention and search without warrant, as well as freedom to trave, re-
 mained in effect. The judiciary is legally independent, but judges are subject to in-
 fluence.
 The security apparatus comprises civilian and military elements, both accountable
 to elected authorities. The Justice Ministry controls the Judicial Technical Police
 (PTJ), which conducts most criminal investigations. The Interior Ministry controls
 the State Security Police (DISIP), which is primarily responsible for protecting pub-
 lic officials and investigating cases of subversion and arms trafficking. The General
 Directorate for Military Intelligence (DIM), under the Defense Ministry, is respon-
 sible for collecting intelligence related to national security and sovereignty. The Na-
 tional Guard, a branch of the military, has arrest powers and is largely responsible
 for guarding the exterior of prisons and key government installations, maintaining
 order during times of civil unrest, monitoring frontiers, and providing law enforce-
 ment in remote areas. It also supplies the top leadership for the Metropolitan Police,
 the main civilian police force in and around Caracas, and for various state and mu-
 nicipal police forces. Both police and military personnel were responsible for human,
 Jights abuses.

 The public sector, including the petroleum industry which accounts for some 24
 percent of gross domestic product, dominates the economy. In response to a financial
 crisis in 1994, the Government instituted price and exchange controls, which exacer-
 bated the economic recession and the Government's fiscal and monetary difficulties.
 To stabilize and revive the economy, the Government implemented a reform pro-
 gram and virtually eliminated controls in April. High inflation negatively affected
 the poor and a shrinking middle class. The Government estimates unemployment
 at 12 percent, but does not include the informal sector, which represents about 50
 percent of the labor force.
 The Government's human rights record continued to be poor in certain areas, and
 includes extrajudicial killings by the police and military, torture and abuse of de-
 tainees, failure to punish police and security officers accused of abuse, arbitrary ar-
 rests and excessively lengthy detentions, illegal searches, corruption and severe in-
 efficiency in the judicial andlaw enforcement systems, and extremely harsh prison
 conditions. Violence against women, abuse of children, and discrimination against
 the disabled continue to be problems. The Government does not rigorously defend
 the rights of indigenous people. In an effort to address these problems and better
 coordinate human rights policy, the Government created an intergovernmental
 Human Rights Commission in December.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of targeted
 political killings, but extrajudicial killings, primarily of criminal suspects, by the se-
 curity forces continued. The VenezueIan Program of Action and Education in
 Human Rights (PROVEA), a highly respected nongovernmental human rights orga-
 nization, documented 146 extrajudicial killings from October 1995 through Septem-
 ber 1996. The killings involved summary executions, indiscriminate or excessive use
 of force, death resulting from torture and mistreatment while in custody, and death
 resulting from abuse during military or public service. According to PROVEA, the
 State Police carried out 47 of the killings; the Metropolitan Police of the Federal
 District, 26; the Municipal Police, 18; the PTJ, 15; the National Guard, 12; the
 armed forces, 12; the DISIP, 11; and other branches of the security apparatus or
 a combination of branches, 5.
 The perpetrators of extrajudicial killings act with near impunity, as the Govern-
 ment rarely prosecutes such cases. The police often fail to investigate crimes alleg-
 edly committed by their colleagues and characterize incidents of extrajudicial
 killings as "confrontations," even though eyewitness testimony and evidence strong-
 ly indicate otherwise. In addition, the civiian judicial system remains highly ineffi-
 cient and sometimes corrupt, and military courts are often strongly biased in favor
 of members of the armed forces accused of abuse. A special pretrial summary phase
 called "nudo hecho," which is used in cases involving pub ic officials and is con-
 ducted in secret, often shields members of the security forces from prosecution, since
 cases can languish in that phase for several years. In the small number of prosecu-
 tions in which the courts convict perpetrators of extrajudicial killings and other
 abuses, the sentences issued are frequently light or the convictions are overturned
 on appeal. Unlike common criminals, members of the security forces charged with
 crimes rarely spend much time in prison.
 In February several agents of the National Guard in Maracaibo detained Danny
 Ojeda Arrieta ostensibly for failure to carry proper identification. Two hours later
 they delivered him to a hospital with severe head injuries. He died 2 days later.
 The guardsmen involved claimed that Ojeda Arrieta jumped from their moving car.
 The Zulia state legislative assembly has requested an investigation. In April several
 members of the Caracas Metropolitan Police took Ramses Zambrano from his home
 to question him about a burglary. Less than an hour later they took him to a hos-
 pital with severe bruises to his chest, neck, and face. Zambrano died a short time
 later-, the case was under investigation. In June following a robbery and shooting
 in a Caracas bakery in which a policewoman and a suspect were killed, members
 of the Metropolitan Police captured uninjured two other suspects whom they hand-
 cuffed and took away. A few hours later the police delivered the two suspects to the
 morgue, dead from bullet wounds. The authorities charged seven policemen with the
 killings, but a judge released all of them in September on the grounds that the case
 as filed was technically deficient.
 In October during a dispute with some inmates, members of the National Guard
 fired teargas canisters into a closed cellblock of La Planta prison in Caracas which
 started a fire that killed 25 trapped inmates. The authorities charged three National
 Guard members and one prison guard with manslaughter. The prison guard, who
 
 
 579
 applied the lock, testified that the National Guard prevented him from opening the
 cell when the fire started. Their trial had not been held by year's end.
 A prosecutor charged with investigating the 1995 disappearance of Marcos Tulio
 Briceno Escalona told his family members that Briceno had been killed and his body
 dumped in a reservoir. Although witnesses claimed that PTJ members detained
 Briceno just before his disappearance, the prosecutor's office found insufficient evi-
 dence to charge any official. PROVEA included his death in its list of extrajudicial
 killings. There has been no trial or other resolution of the August 1995 execution-
 style killing of 21-year-old Hector Rojas, although the authorities have imprisoned
 four members of the PTJ.
 There were no prosecutions or new revelations surrounding the discovery of a
 common grave in April 1994 in the Sierra de Perija region of Zulia state. Forensic
 experts provided no count of the number of bodies found in the grave, but human
 rights groups placed the number at around 15. At least one of the bodies showed
 signs of execution-style killing. Although members of a special rural contingent of
 the Zulia state police were alleged to have committed the killings, there were no
 arrests. A number of persons have come forward with credible testimony in recent
 years that there are additional common graves in the Sierra de Perija and
 Catatumbo regions as a result of killings by security forces, although subsequent
 government investigations were inconclusive. Human rights groups reported that
 local farmers and indigenous people are afraid to come forward with additional in-
 formation for fear of reprisals.
 The authorities also never prosecuted or held anyone responsiblefor the November
 1992 killing of at least 63 prisoners at Catia prison. The National Guard-erro-
 neously claiming that coup leaders had distributed arms there-stormed the prison,
 opened cells, and fired on inmates. The majority of bodies found were reportedly
 shot at close range, suggesting summary executions. Apart from the officially re-
 corded 63 prisoners kille  the ate of 25 others remains unknown-either their bod-
 ies were not found or they escaped during or near the time of the killings. The Com-
 mittee of Family Members of the Victims of the Unrest (COFAVIC) continued to
 seek prosecutions and a thorough investigation of the Catia prison killings.
 There were no prosecutions for the 1992 killing of reporters Maria Veronica
 Tessari and Virgilio Fernandez by members of the security forces. Tessari had been
 covering a student demonstration and Fernandez a coup attempt.
 Minimal progress was made towards resolving some 300 alleged extraudicial
 killings by security forces during and after the civil unrest of February-Marc 1989.
 There has been only one prosecution: A police officer was found guilty in 1991 of
 killing 18-year-old Eleazar Ramon Mavares, shot by several police officers some 18
 times at close range. The courts released the officer from prison 1 year later. In ne-
 gotiations held with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in
 1995, the Government agreed to initiate a new investigation of the Mavares case,
 punish those responsible, and provide indemnities to the victim's family. The Gov-
 ernment's offer to pay $14 737 (7 million bolivars) in damages was judged inad-
 equate by the faily. COFAVIC referred 44 cases surrounding the 1989 killings to
 the IACHR, asserting that the Government had not ensured justice.
 In September the Inter-American Court of Human Rights awarded $722,332 in
 damages to two survivors and the families of 14 fishermen killed in 1988 by military
 and police officers near the border town of El Ampar, Apure state. The military
 originally claimed that the deaths were the result of action taken against Colombian
 guerrillas, but the Government later acknowledged responsibility and said that it
 would pay indemnities to the survivors and the victims' families. In August 1994,
 a military tribunal overturned the conviction of 16 defendants in the case despite
 strong evidence that they had participated in a planned ambush.
 Mob lynchings of supposed criminals is a growing problem. The victims are almost
 always known criminals who prey on residents of poor neighborhoods. Between Oc-
 tober 1995 and September 1996, PROVEA recorded 14 lynchings resulting in death
 and 24 attempted lynchings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reliable reports of persons who disappeared
 after being detained by the police or the armed forces.
 There were no developments in connection with the 1995 disappearances of Julio
 Rafael Tovar, Fidel Ernesto Croes Aleman, Luis Martin Sanches-Vargas, Juan Dan-
 iel Monsalve, or Jose Ramos; or the 1994 disappearances of Elsida Ines Alvarez,
 Benjamin Vasquez, or Fidel A. Sanabria. All had reportedly been detained by secu-
 rity force members prior to their disappearances. A family member of Yolanda
 Landino, who disappeared in 1993, claims that she is living in Colombia.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture, but credible human rights groups report that security
 forces continue to abuse detainees physically. This abuse most commonly comprises
 
 
 580
 beatings during arrest or interrogation, but there have been incidents when the se-
 curity forces used near suffocation and othe'r forms of torture that leave no telltale
 signs. Most victims come from the poorest and least influential parts of society.
 There were also cases of torture of political activists and student leaders, after they
 were arrested and held on charges such as assault or destruction of property.
 PROVEA documented 63 cases of torture from October 1995 through September
 1996. A large number of cases were never reported because the victims feared ret-
 ribution. According to PROVEA, the PTJ were responsible for 31 of the reported tor-
 ture incidents; the State Police, 6; the Metropolitan Police, 5; the DIM, 4; the armed
 forces, 3; the DISIP, 2; the National Guard, 1; and unknown branches of the secu-
 rity apparatus or a combination of branches, 11. Many of these cases were in border
 areas where constitutional protections were suspended.
 Torture, like extrajudicial killings, continues because the Government does not
 ensure the independent investigation of complaints needed to bring those respon-
 sible to justice. In addition to lack of vigor by the judiciary, the fact that the Insti-
 tute of Forensic Medicine is part of the PTJ also contributes to a climate of impu-
 nity, since its doctors are unlikely to be impartial in their examinations of cases
 that involve torture by members of the PTJ. Very few instances of torture have re-
 sulted in convictions.
 In January and twice in April plainclothes Caracas police detained and tortured
 Luis Escobar Ugas, an activist with the Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement. During
 the last detention Escobar suffered eight cigarette burns on his left arm and was
 forced to kneel for a mock execution. In May members of the PTJ suspended bank
 robbery witness Ramon Molina Castro from the ceiling by his hands, which were
 handcuffed behind his back. He stayed in that position or 3 hours, and he no longer
 has use of his hands or arms. He was released from detention after 8 days with
 the threat of death if he reported what had happened. In June while investigating
 an arson burning of 13 buses, members of the FPJ allegedly beat, suspended from
 the ceiling, and threatened with death eight suspects in order to extract confessions.
 The prosecutor ordered medical examinations m order to determine whether the
 suspects had been tortured; the results were negative, and no charges were filed.
 In the border area where constitutional protections have been suspended, the Na-
 tional Guard and army commit abuses with near impunity. The Support Network
 for Justice and Peace has documented many such cases by amassing detailed wit-
 ness testimony. For example, in February in the Anaru district of Apure state two
 drunken guardsmen reportedly entered the house of two women and a baby and sex-
 ually assaulted one of the women. Later in the same day 10 guardsmen went to the
 house to threaten the women if they fied a complaint. They nevertheless did so,
 but the guardsmen were not detained.
 There has been no resolution of the border-area cases from 1995, in which mem-
 bers of the military tortured 23 rural workers near Cararabo and 19 peasant farm-
 ers in La Victoria, both in Apure state.
 Prison conditions continued to be extremely harsh due to underfunding, poorly
 trained staff, corruption among prison staff and National Guard members, and over-
 crowding so severe as to constitute inhuman and degrading treatment. As of Decem-
 ber 5, the 31 prisons administered by the Ministry of Justice held 25,369 inmates,
 of whom the courts had sentenced only 6,513. The prisons operate on average at
 twie their designed capacity. Inadquate diet, minimal health care, a prisoner to
 guard ratio as high as 40 to 1, and physical abuse by guardsand by other inmates
 omany prison riots. At least two deaths were attributed t guards: That of a
 prisoner shot in the face in Catia prison, and a prisoner tortured to death by fellow
 inmates instigated by National Guard members in Tocoron prison. In October
 guards fired tear gas canisters that started a fire that killed 25 inmates in a locked
 cellblock (see Section L.a.). Inmates often have to pay guards as well as each other
 to obtain necessities such as space in a cell, a bed, and food. Guns, knives, and ille-
 gal drugs are easily smuggled into most prisons, and violence between prisoners is
 very common.
 In March a 6-hour-long pitched battle between rival inmate groups in La Pica
 prison in Monagas state left at least 12 persons dead and 25 injured. In April a riot
 in Santa Ana prison in Tachira state left six dead and two injured. PROVEA reg-
 istered a total of 220 prisoners killed and another 1,333 wounded as a result of vio-
 lence from October 1995 through September 1996. According to the Ministry of Jus-
 tice, 207 inmates were killed, mostly by firearms or knives, and 1,133 were wounded
 during the year. In addition, hundreds of others died as a consequence of filth, poor
 diet, and inadequate medical care.
 There were no prosecutions of public officials for the corruption and neglect that
 contributed to the January 1994 riot at Sabaneta prison in Maracaib, in which in-
 mates killed 105 fellow prisoners and wounded scores of others. Prison staff and the
 
 
 National Guard were generally unwilling to enter the facility in the months leading
 up to the riot, allowing a state of near anarchy to develop. In addition, during the
 riot, the National Guard allegedly waited for at least 2 hours before entering to re-
 store order. As a result, the number of casualties increased unnecessarily.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors. Delegations
 from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the IACHR visited several
 prisons in 1996 and came to similar conclusions regarding the inhuman conditions.
 The Government acknowledged the poor state of the prisons and made plans to im-
 prove the situation. The President inaugurated two prison ex ansions in December,
 designed to replace Caracas' violence-prone Catia prison, and the Government an-
 nounced plans to build three new prisons in 1997. Nonetheless, funding for prisons
 remained extremely low, preventing significant improvement in most penitentiaries.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exi/e.-In 1995 the Government reinstated the
 constitutionally protected freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention in all but 16
 municipalities along the Colombian border where guerrilla activity was a continuing
 problem. However, the press and human rights groups continued to report a large
 number of arbitrary detentions during anticrime sweeps in impoverished areas by
 the Metropolitan Police, the DISIP, the National Guard, and the PTJ. The authori-
 ties detained persons during the sweeps for up to 2 days while they checked crimi-
 nal records; most were released without charges. PROVEA documented 8,888 per-
 sons detained in sweeps from October 1995 through September 1996.
 The law provides for the right to judicial determination of the legality of deten-
 tion; however, the police may hold persons without an arrest warrant for up to 8
 days, and the courts may hold them for up to an additional 8 days in court custody.
 In many cases, the police abused detainees physically and psychologically during the
 initial 8-day period and illegally held them incommunicado. During the second 8-
 day period a judge may, on the basis of the police investigation, order either the
 formal arrest or the release of the suspect. Arbitrary arrests are common, and au-
 thorities sometimes exceed the time limits for holding suspects. Prison officials often
 illegally demand payment from prisoners for transportation to judicial proceedings
 at which formal charges are made. Those who are unable to pay are often forced
 toforgotheir judicial earings.
 The 1939 Vagrancy Lawpermits the detention for up to 5 years, without warrant,
 trial, or judicia appeal, of people deemed by the police to be a danger to society
 even though there is no evidence that they committed a punishable crime. This law
 is used chiefly against people with previous criminal records who are detained dur-
 ing police sweeps. In October the governor of Carabobo decreed that the Vagrancy
 Law would be applied to squatters on public and private land. PROVEA documented
 the application of this law against 552 detainees from October 1995 through Sep-
 tember 1996.
 Forced exile is illegal and is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The civilian judiciary is legally independent, but
 judges are subject to influence from a number of sources.
 The judicial sector consists of the Supreme Court, which is the court of final ap-
 peal; the prosecutor general, who provides opinions to the courts on prosecution of
 criminal cases and acts as public ombudsman to bring public employee misconduct
 or violations of the constitutional rights of prisoners or accused to the attention of
 the proper authorities; the Ministry of Justice, which manages the national police
 force and prisons and files complaints in criminal courts; and the Judicial Council,
 which oversees the lower courts as well as the selection and training of judges. The
 lower court system includes district and municipal courts as well as trial and appeal
 courts which deal with civil and criminal matters.
 The law provides for the right to a fair trial and considers the accused innocent
 until proven guilty in a court. The justice system, however, is overburdened and in-
 efficient, suffers from widespread corruption, and lacks public credibility. Judges are
 underpaid, poorly disciplined, and susceptible to political influence. The judicial
 process is paper intensive, requiring the costly and time-consuming production of vo-
 luminous reports at every stage by judges, attorneys, and witnesses. Case backlogs
 and lengthy pretrial detention averaging 4 / years are the norm.
 The law provides for public defenders for those unable to afford an attorney, but
 there are not enough public defenders to handle the caseload. The Judicial Council
 reported that there are 159 public defense attorneys for the entire country
 Military courts can try civilians in cases of armed subversion and whenever
 armed forces members are involved. Military courts are subject to a requirement for
 a speedy trial and a statute of limitations similar to that of civilian courts. Persons
 convicted by a military court have the same right tf appeal to the Supreme Court
 as do those convicted by the civilian system. Mlitary courts, however, are signifi-
 cantly different from civilian courts in that by law the President must review every
 
 
 case after the initial investigation stage and decide if that case will go to trial.
 Human rights groups assert that this gives the executive excessive power to inter-
 vene in military cases. In addition the Supreme Court selects military judges from
 a list of candidates provided by the Minister of Defense, a process that links the
 careers of military judges to the high command. The tendency of military judges to
 be responsive to the views of their military leaders, to maintain procedural secrecy,
 and to act slowly in high-profile cases in which the military is implicated make im-
 partial or timely trials for defendants unlikely. As a result, military offenders evade
 punishment for extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Con-
 stitutional provisions prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, and
 correspondence. However, from June 1994 to July 1995, the Government suspended
 the constitutional protection of freedom from search without a warrant, along with
 other freedoms. This suspension remained in effect in some border areas throughout
 1996. Even after reinstatement of the provision in urban areas, security forces often
 conducted searches of homes without warrants, especially during anticrime sweeps
 in impoverished neighborhoods. In recent years, there have been some complaints
 of telephone surveillance, and human rights monitors accused the security forces of
 illegal telephone monitoring.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice. Indi-
 viduals criticize the Government publicly, although there were a few instances of
 reprisal. In February an artist was detained after exhibiting on a street corner his
 painting of the President and the Pope together with starving people. In October
 the DISIP detained an astrologer overnight and questioned him because he had pre-
 dicted that the President would die in 1997. In December a judge sentenced the au-
 thor of a 1995 book to 1 year in prison for criminal defamation. The book, titled
 "How much does a judge cost?" (Cuanto vale un juez?), is a compilation of accusa-
 tions of judicial corruption; the judge also ordered confiscation of the book.
 The print and electronic media are independent. However, a 1994 law forbids per-
 sons without journalism degrees to practice and requires journalists to be members
 of the National College of Journalists. Media owners, under the name Venezuelan
 Press Bloc, brought a case to the Supreme Court in November 1995 challenging the
 law as a violation of the freedom of expression provided for in the Constitution and
 international agreements on human rights that have the force of law. The Court had
 not ruled by year's end.
 Some newspapers claimed that the Government restricted their access to foreign
 exchange to pay for newsprint because they took an antigovernment editorial line.
 Courts used restraining orders to limit re prting on certain cases. The police har-
 assed television reporters who had filmed te arrest of two robbery suspects just be-
 fore the police shot and killed them. The authorities never prosecuted security force
 members who killed two reporters in 1992 (see Section L.a.).
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-he Government generally re-
 spects the constitutional provision for freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
 Public meetings, including those of all political parties, are generally held
 unimpeded. The Government requires permits for public marches but does not deny
 them for political reasons.
 As in earlier years, many demonstrations turned violent and were quelled by se-
 curity forces. In January and February there were a number of violent protests
 against bus fare increases throughout the country. Hooded youths known as
 "encapuchados" frequently fomented the violence. In June groups of encapuchados
 set fire at night to a total of 13 minibuses used to transport workers from the Cara-
 cas suburbs. The fire killed a couple sleeping in one of the buses. In November vio-
 lence broke out at the Central Umversity of Venezuela and the Pedagogic University
 Institute of Caracas after the Government turned down a request to hold a march
 to protest a higher education bill in Congress. There were also a number of inci-
 dents where security forces contained or stopped peaceful protests. According to
 PROVEA, 181 people were injured during demonstrations and 756 detained from
 October 1995 through September 1996.
 The Government generally respects the constitutional provision for freedom of as-
 sociation. Professional and academic associations operate without interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, pro-
 vided that a faith does not threaten public order or violate good custom. The au-
 thorities respect this right- in practice; all religious groups enjoy freedom of worship.
 
 
 583
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right of citizens and legal residents
 to travel within the country and to go abroad and return. The Government, how-
 ever, can suspend the freedom to travel, as it did from June 1994 to July 1995. The
 Government also restricts foreign travel for persons being investigated for criminal
 activities.
 Venezuela traditionally has been a haven for refugees, exiles, and displaced per-
 sons from many European, Caribbean, and Latin American countries. The Govern-
 ment cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Government policy
 oes afford first asylum, but precise data were not available. There were a total of
 337 applicants for asylum, of which 45 were accepted; about 90 percent of these
 cases involved first asylum. There were no reports of forced return of persons to a
 country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right peacefully to change their gov-
 ernment, and citizens exercise this right through periodic, free, and fair elections
 held on the basis of universal suffrage. An antiquated and inefficient system for
 counting votes, however, gives rise to numerous and, in some cases, credible allega-
 tions that the political parties that dominate electoral councils commit fraud.
 Women and nonwhites participate fully in government and politicsbut remain
 underrepresented in senior leadership positions. Women hold 12 seats as Deputies
 in the 203-member lower house of Congress, 3 seats in the 53-person Senate and
 1 of 27 ministerial positions. Indigenous people have traditionally not been fully in-
 tegrated into the political system due to their lack of knowledge of how it works,
 low voter turnout, and residency in areas far from the capital and other cities. Few
 indigenous people are in the Government, and only one is in Congress as an alter-
 nate deputy.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups generally operate without government re-
 striction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Both
 international and local human rights organizations were provided ready access to
 the prison system. However, government officials were often critical of human rights
 groups, accusing them of seeking to discredit the State and undermine the country's
 image. In July the Minister of thie Presidency met with Amnesty International (AI)
 chairman Pierre Sane, who had come to present Al's report on prison conditions.
 The Minister later asserted that Sane had his mind made up on the subject i ad-
 vance of the meeting. Subsequently, the Minister of Interior opened a dialog with
 the local Al representative in an effort to establish a channel to allow information
 about human rights abuses to reach the Ministry for investigation.
 In July and October, several human rights monitors operating in the militarized
 zone of Apure state were jailed briefly without justification. In December the Presi-
 dent named a national human rights commission, whose functions include advising
 the executive branch on human rights issues, making recommendations to improve
 respect for human rights, and facilitating cooperation with international and non-
 governmental bodies concerned with human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on ethnic origin, sex, or disability. The
 Government, however, does not sufficiently enforce laws that safeguard the rights
 of indigenous people, protect women against societal and domestic violence, and en-
 sure disabled people's access to jobs and public services. Very few resources are de-
 voted to children's welfare; young delinquents are locked in institutions that are un-
 safe and dangerous.
 Women.-Women face substantial institutional and societal prejudice with respect
 to rape and domestic violence. The law makes rape extremely difficult to prove re-
 quiring at a minimum medical examination within 48 hours of the violation. ew
 police officers are trained to deal responsibly with rape victims. A total of 7,816 sex-
 ual assaults, including rape, were reported to the authorities in 1995; data for 1996
 were not yet available at year's end. Women's organizations, however, assert that
 such figures are very low and do not accurately portray the problem of rape and
 sexual assault. The overwhelming majority of victims do not report the incident or
 press charges due to societal pressure and their own feelings of guilt.
 
 
 584
 
 Domestic violence against women is very common and has been aggravated by the
 countr's economic difliculties. According to local monitors, the police are generally
 unwilling to intervene to prevent domestic violence, and the courts rarely prosecute
 those accused of such abuse. In addition, poor women are generally unaware of legal
 remedies and have little access to them.
 The Congress reformed the Civil Code in the 1980's to make women and men le-
 gally equal in marriage. Women account for roughly half the student body of most
 universities, have advanced in many professions, including medicine and law, and
 have gradually surmounted many of the barriers to their full participation in politi-
 cal and economic life. Nonetheless, women are still underrepresented in the higher
 ranks of labor unions and private industry.
 The Labor Code specifies that employers must not discriminate against women
 with regard to pay or working conditions, must not fire them during pregnancy and
 for a year after giving birth, must grant them unpaid leave and benefits for 6 weeks
 before the birth of a child and 12 weeks after, andmust provide them with 10 weeks
 of unpaid leave if they legally adopt children under 3 years of age. According to the
 Ministry of Labor and the major labor federation, these regulations are enforced in
 the formal sector, although social security payments are often delayed.
 Children.-The Government scaled back its expenditure on education, health, and
 social services. While the law provides for universal free education, the Government
 dedicates very little funding to primary and secondary education. According to a
 study by two reputable nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), one in four children
 is malnourished. Many government agencies responsible for the welfare of children
 are pla~ed by corruption, and government funding often does not reach the chil-
 dren it is intended to help. In addition, a large number of children are not eligible
 to receive government assistance because their birth is not properiy documented.
 A surveyby the National Institute for Minors determined that 206,000 children
 were involved in illicit activities, principally bgging but also petty theft, prostitu-
 tion, and drug trafficking. Some 40,000 children were exploited sexually, according
 to a 1994 study. The preliminary results of a national epidemiological survey con-
 ducted in Apri1-June showed that heroin, along with other dregs, has been intro-
 dued to pubic and private schools. The authorities in the metropolitan Caracas
 area, the states of Carabob and Lara, and in some municipalities in Guarico,
 Merida, and Portugesa instituted a 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew for unsupervised ui-
 nors. Children's rights advocates claim that curfews permit the police to act arbi-
 trarily in detaining persons who have committed no crime.
 Because reform institutions are filled to capacity, hundreds of children accused of
 infractions are confined in jails. Crowded into small cells, child inmates often live
 in filth, are fed only once a day, and sleep on bare concrete floors. The Coche facility
 near Caracas was temporarily em ptied of its 53 inmates in September after press
 exposure of the harsh conditions there. The authorities have not formally charged
 most of the children in jails with any crimes.
 The recent increase in poverty has raised the level of stress within families and
 led to a rise in the number of abandoned children and to more child abuse. More-
 over, neighbors often hesitate to report cases of child abuse, due to a fear of entan-
 glement with the authorities and ingrained attitudes regarding family privacy. The
 overburdened judicial system, though very slow, generally ensures that in most situ-
 ations children are removed from abusive households once a case has been reported.
 Public facilities for such children, however, are inadequate and have poorly trained
 staff.
 People With Disabilities.-cThe physically disabled have minimal access to public
 transportation, and ramps are practically nonexistent, even in government build-
 ings. According to local advocates, the disabled are discriminated against in many
 sectors, including education, health care, and emploment.
 In 1993 the Government passed the first comprehensive law to protect the rights
 of the disabled. That law requires that all newly constructed or renovated public
 parks and buildings provide access for the disabled. Among other important provi-
 sions, the law forbids discrimination in employment practices and in the provision
 of public services. However, the Government did not make a significant effort to im-
 plement the new law, to inform the public of it, or to try to change societal prejudice
 against the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Although the law prohibits discrimination based on ethnic or-
 iin, members of the country's indigenous po ulation frequently suffer from inatten-
 tmn to and violation of their human rights. There re about 316,000 indigenous peo-
 ple comprising 28 ethnic groups, ording to a special 1992 census.
 The Consitutiestion pre  for special laws governing "the protection of indigenous
 communities and their progressive incorporation into the life of the nation." None-
 theless, local political authorities seldom take account of the interests of indigenous

 Feple when making decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the al-
 ocation of natural resources. In March a judge in Puerto Ayacucho stopped the
 state government of Amazonas from building a road without undertaking an envi-
 ronmental impact assessment. As farmers and miners intrude on their habitat, in-
 digenous communities are threatened by deforestation and water pollution. Few in-
 digenous people hold title to their land. Since 1994 the Panare indigenous group of
 Bolivar state has unsuccessfully tried to defend its land from encroachment by cat-
 tle ranchers. In September a land dispute involving 28 families of the Wayuu indig-
 enous group of Zulia state resulted in their being forcibly removed from their homes.
 In 1995 representatives of the 19 indigenous groups of Amazonas state brought
 a case to the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the law that defines
 political boundaries in their state. They claimed that the law, promulgated in 1994,
 jeopardized their collective possession of ancestral lands and did not respect tradi-
 tional indigenous systems of decisionmaking. In December the Supreme Court ruled
 in their favor, declaring the law null because it was passed without the required
 consultations with the affected population.
 Many of the country's indigenous people live isolated from modern civilization and
 lack access to basic health and educational facilities. High rates of cholera, hepa-
 titis-B, malaria, and other diseases plague their communities. An outbreak believed
 to be leptospirosis killed 15 people in the Yanomami village of Manotheri between
 November 1995 and January 1996. Severe flooding in July destroyed indigenous
 homes and gardens in Amazonas state, causing a dramatic increase in malnutrition,
 diarrheal diseases, and other health problems.
 The Yanomami, among the most isolated of the indigenous people, have been sub-
 ject to persistent incursions into their territory by illegal gold miners. The miners
 have not only introduced new diseases but social ills as well. In August 1993, Brazil-
 ian miners killed at least 16 Yanomami in a remote area of Amazonas state and
 then retreated into Brazilian territory. The Government failed to seek their prosecu-
 tion forcefully, and the Brazilian authorities released the miners after 3 months' de-
 tention. In August and September, the Government undertook a massive military
 operation in southern Amazonas state to dislodge illegal miners; about 80 were ar-
 rested, but several hundred more were believed to be still operating.
 In February 1994, members of the army shot and killed three members of the
 Yucpa ethnic group after women in the group tried to block the soldiers from taking
 wood they had cut. The military allegedly responded by firing indiscriminately.
 There were no arrests of those responsible for the killings.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Both the Constitution and labor law recognize and
 encourage the right of unions to organize. The comprehensive 1990 Labor Code ex-
 tends to all private sector and public sector employees (except members of the
 armed forces) the right to form and join unions of their choosing. The Code man-
 dates registration of unions with the Ministry of Labor, but it reduces the Ministry's
 discretion by specifying that registration may not be denied if the proper documents
 (a record of the founding meeting, the statutes, and the membership list) are sub-
 mitted. Only a judge may dissolve a union, and then only for reasons listed in the
 law, such as the dissolution of a firm or by agreement of two-thirds of the member-
 shi.
 One major union confederation, the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers (CTV),
 and three small ones, as well as a number of independent unions, operate freely.
 About 25 percent of the national labor force is unionized. The CTV's top leadership
 includes members of several political parties. The majority are affiliated with the
 country's largest party, Democratic Action (AD). The CTV and the AD exercise re-
 ciprocal influence on each other.
 The law recognizes the right of public and private sector employees to strike.
 However, public servants may only exercise it if it does not cause "irremediable
 damage to the population or to institutions." The Labor Code allows the President
 to order public or private sector strikers back to work and to submit their dispute
 to arbitration if the strike "puts in immediate danger the lives or security of all or
 part of the population." During 1996 most strikes occurred among government em-
 ployees such as teachers, whose strike lasted more than 6 weeks; judicial workers,
 who were on strike for over 2 weeks; and physicians in public hospitals and clinics,
 whose strike included emergency care. In addition, there were a number of work
 stoppages by public sector employees to protest the Government's delay in paying
 negotiated an agreed-upon salary increases and bonuses.
 There are no restrictions on affiliation with international labor organizations, and
 many union organizations are active internationally.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code protects and
 encourages collective bargaining, which is freely practiced. According to the code,
 employers "must negotiate" a o1lective ontract with the union that represents the
 majority of their workers. The code also contains a provision stating that wages may
 be raised by administrative decree, provided that the Congress approves the decree.
 The law prohibits employers from interfering with the formation of unions or with
 their activities and from stipulating as a condition of employment that new workers
 must abstain from union activity or must join a specified union. Ministry of Labor
 inspectors hear complaints regarding violations of these regulations, and can impose
 a maximum fine of twice the minimum monthly wage for a first infraction. Under
 the code, union officials enjoy special protection from dismissal. If a judge deter-
 mines that any worker was fired for union activity, the worker is entitled to back
 pay plus either reinstatement or payment of a substantial sum of money, which var-
 ies according to his years of seniority.
 Labor law and practice is the same in the sole export processing zone as in the
 rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code states that no one
 may "obligate others to work against their will." However, there are credible reports
 of prison labor being administratively imposed on persons detained under the Va-
 grancy Law.
 d.M inimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code allows children
 between the ages of 12 and 14 years to work only if the National Institute for Mi-
 nors or the Labor Ministry grant special permission. It states that children between
 the ages of 14 and 16 years may not work without permission from their legal
 guardians. Minors may not work in mines or smelters, in occupations "that risk life
 or health" or could damage intellectual or moral development, or in "public spec-
 tacles."
 Those under 16 years of age must by law work no more than 6 hours a day or
 30 hours a week. Minors under the age of 18 years may work only during the hours
 between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. The Ministry of Labor and the National Institute for Mi-
 nors enforce the law effectively in the formal sector of the economy but much less
 so in the informal sector, which accounts for about half of total employment. Accord-
 ing to a 1992 survey of sample households, more than 1 million children work in
 the informal sector, mostly as street vendors; large numbers of children also work
 as beggars and bootblacks.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is a national urban minimum wage and
 a national rural minimum wage. The monthly minimum wage was $32 (15,000 boli-
 vars) in the private sector for urban workers and $26 (12,500 bolivars) for rural
 workers. In addition, minimum wage workers in the private sector received manda-
 tory food and transport bonuses amounting to $80 (37,800 bolivars). Total take-
 home pay in the public sector, the product of collective bargaining, was at least
 equal to that received by private sector minimum wage workers. Fringe benefits are
 added to these minimum figures; they vary with the workers' individual cir-
 cumstances, but in general increase wages by about one-third. However, even with
 bonuses and benefits, the minimum wage is not sufficient to provide a decent stand-
 ard of living for a worker and family. Unions point out that this combined income
 is far less than the cost of a family's basic food basket, estimated in September at
 $247 (116,395 bolivars).The law excludes only domestic workers and concierges from
 coverage under the minimum wage decrees. Under the Labor Code, the rates are
 set by administrative decree, which Congress may either suspend or ratify but may
 not change. The Ministry of Labor enforces minimum wage rates effectively in the
 formal sector of the economy but generally does not enforce them in the informal
 sector.
 The 1990 Labor Code reduced the standard workweek to a maximum of 44 hours,
 and requires 2 "complete days of rest each week." Some unions, such as the petro-
 leum workers, have negotiated a 40-hour week. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours
 daily, 10 hours weekly, or 100 hours annually, and may not be paid at a rate less
 than time and a half. The Ministry of Labor effectively enforces these standards in
 the formal sector.
 The 1986 health and safety law is still awaiting implementation regulations and
 is not enforced. The delay is due largely to concern that the law provides penal sanc-
 tions against management when violations of health and safety occur and to ambi-
 guity in the law over what constitutes a violation. The Labor Code states that em-
 ployers are obligated to pay specified amounts (up to a maximum of 25 times the
 minimum monthly salary) to workers for accidents or occupational illnesses, regard-
 less of who is responsible for the injury.
 It also requires that workplaces must maintain "sufficient protection for health
 and life against sicknesses and accidents," and it imposes fines of from one-quarter
 
 
 587
 to twice the minimum monthly salary for first infractions. In practice, however, un-
 safe job sites are seldom closed down by Ministry of Labor inspectors. Under the
 law, workers can remove themselves from dangerous workplace situations without
 jeopardy to continued employment.
