WESTERN SAHARA
 Morocco assumed adminitration of the northern three provinces
 of the Western Sahara after the withdrawal of Spanish forces
 in 1975, and of the southernmost province in 1979 when
 Mauritania renounced its claim to the area. The Polisario, an
 organization which is supported by Algeria and which seeks
 independence for the territory, has challenged first Spain's
 and later Morocco's claim to the territory since 1973, and
 sporadic fighting between its and Morocco's forces continued
 in 1988.
 Sovereignty over the territory remains a subject of
 international dispute. The Organization of African Unity
 (OAU) has attempted to mediate a solution, and in 1981 Morocco
 agreed that a referendum should be held to determine the
 population's wishes regarding independence or integration with
 Morocco. These efforts collapsed in 1984 when the Saharan
 Democratic Arab Republic (SDAR), the civilian arm of the
 Polisario, was seated at the OAU summit, and Morocco withdrew
 from the OAU in protest. Morocco had also rejected an OAU
 resolution calling for direct negotiations between Morocco and
 the Polisario.
 Morocco called upon the United Nations to administer the
 referendum, and in 1986 U.N. Secretary General Perez de
 Cuellar lent his good offices to efforts to arrange such a
 referendum. In November-December 1987, a U.N. technical team
 visited the territory to explore the practical aspects
 involved in holding a referendum, and on August 30, 1988,
 Morocco and the SDAR accepted in principle the Secretary
 General's proposal to conduct it under U.N./OAU auspices. The
 Secretary General then named a Special Representative, whose
 mission was to work out the practical details for holding a
 referendum. Disagreement continues over conditions for
 declaring a cease-fire and for the conduct of the referendum
 itself. However, discussions were under way between the two
 sides early in 1989 as the Special Representative prepared to
 begin his work.
 Since 1977 the northern provinces of El Ayoun, Smara, and
 Boudjour have participated in elections held in Morocco, and
 these three, plus the southernmost province of Oued Ed Dahhab,
 participated in the 1983 and 1984 elections. All 10
 parliamentary seats allotted to the Western Sahara are filled
 by persons of Western Saharan origin, and the governors of all
 four provinces, appointed by King Hassan, are native Saharans.
 The governors administer the provinces in the same manner as
 Moroccan provinces are administered. Investment in the
 Western Sahara is tax-free and the Moroccan Government has
 stipulated other financial incentives to encourage development
 in the territory.
 The civilian population in the portion of the Western Sahara
 under effective Moroccan control (approximately 85 percent of
 the territory) is subject to Moroccan political institutions
 and laws. In general, they experience the same human rights
 and worker rights practices as Moroccans in areas of undisputed
 Moroccan sovereignty. There are, however, reports that
 Saharans often have more difficulty obtaining passports, that
 their political views are more closely monitored than those of
 residents of Morocco proper, and that police and paramilitary
 authorities react especially harshly against those suspected
 of supporting the Polisario. The Moroccan Government denies
 such charges and counters with allegations of Polisario human

 rights abuses. There has been no opportunity to evaluate the
 human rights practices of the Polisario in areas of the
 Western Sahara outside of the berm, the Moroccan earthwork
 defense line, and these allegations therefore cannot be
 confirmed or denied.
 The Polisario has established an embryonic labor wing called
 the Sario Federation of Labor (UGTSARIO), which reportedly
 enjoys close relations with the Soviet-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions and with a few Arab and African
 national labor centers. UGTSARIO does not engage in customary
 trade union activities, however, in the Polisario-controlled
 areas.
