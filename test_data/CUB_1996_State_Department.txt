 CUBA
 Cuba is a totalitarian state controlled by President Fidel Castro, who is Chief of
 State, Head of Government, First Secretary of the Communist Party, and Com-
 mander in Chief of the armed forces. President Castro exercises control over all as-
 pects of Cuban life through the Communist Party and its affiliated mass organiza-
 tions, the government bureaucracy, and the state security apparatus. The party is
 the only legal political entity, and President Castro personally chooses the member-
 ship of the select group that heads the party. The party controls all government po-
 sitions, including judicial offices.
 The Ministry of Interior is the principal organ of state security and totalitarian
 control. The Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR), led by President Castro's brother
 Raul, exercises control over this Ministry. In addition to regulating migration and
 controlling the Border Guard and the police forces, the Interior Ministry inves-
 tigates and actively suppresses organized opposition and dissent. It maintains a per-
 vasive system of vigilance through undercover agents, informers, the Rapid Re-
 sponse Brigades, and the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR's).
 While the Government traditionally used the CDR's to mobilize citizens against dis-
 senters, impose ideological conformity, and root out "counterrevolutionary" behavior,
 severe economic problems have reduced the willingness of citizens to participate in
 the CDR's and thereby lessened their effectiveness. Other mass organizations also
 inject government andgCommunist Party control into every citizen's daily activities
 at hom, work, and school. There were instances in which members of the security
 forces committed human rights abuses.
 The Government continued to control all significant means of production and re-
 mained the predominant employer, despite permitting some carefully controlled for-
 eign investment and legalization of some minor categories of self-employment. Al-
 though the Government forecast a 5 percent economic growth rate for 1996, the
 economy remained in a slump due to the inefficiencies of the centrally controlled
 economic system, the collapse of Cuba's trade relations with the former Soviet bloc,
 and the end of the $4 to $5 billion in annual Soviet subsidies. Despite some eco-
 nomic recovery, gross domestic product is still only about two-thirds the 1989 level,
 and total foreign trade about one-fourth the 1989 level. For the sixth straight year,
 the Government continued its austerity measures known euphemistically as the
 "special period in peacetime." Agricultural markets, legalized in 1994, gave consum-
 ers wider access to meat and produce, although at prices beyond the routine reach
 of most Cubans living on peso-only incomes. The system of "tourist apartheid" con-
 tinued, in which foreign visitors receive preference over citizens for food, consumer
 products, and government services, as well as access to hotels and resorts from
 which Cuban citizens remain barred.
 The Government's human rights record worsened in 1996 with the large-scale
 crackdown against the prodemocracy umbrella group "Conciio Cubano," the
 shootdown of two U.S. civilian airplanes in international airspace, increased reports
 of deaths due to the excessive use of force by police, further restrictions on the dis-
 tribution of foreign publications, increased use of exile and internal exile to control
 the activities of independent journalists and human rights advocates, antagonism to
 any foreign diplomatic criticism of human rights practices, restrictions on foreign
 contacts with human rights activists, the denial of visas to prominent U.S. journal-
 ists, and the expulsions of visiting foreign journalists. The authorities continued
 routinely to harass, threaten, arbitrarily arrest, detain, imprison, defame, and phys-
 ically attack human rights advocates and members of independent professional asso-
 ciations, including journalists, economists, and lawyers, often with the goal of en-
 couraging them to leave Cuba. Members of the security forces and prison officials
 continued to beat and otherwise abuse detainees and prisoners. The Government
 
 
 414
 continued to restrict sharply basic political and civil rights, including: The right of
 citizens to change their government; the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, asso-
 ciation, religion, and movement; the right to privacy; and various worker rights. The
 judiciary is completely subordinate to the Government and to the Communist Party.
 The Government denied human rights advocates due process and subjected them to
 unfair trials. Political prisoners were offered the choice of exile or continued impris-
 onment. Prison conditions remained harsh.
 In April the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) once again
 assed a resolution endorsing the report of the UNHRC Special Rapporteur, which
 detailed Cuba's violations of human rights. The Government continued to refuse the
 Special Rapporteur permission to visit Cuba.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Reports increased of deaths due to
 the excessive use of force by police. Policeman Jose Angel Merino Fragoza of the
 Sixth Precinct of Marianao in Havana reportedly shot and killed 30-year-old Renzo
 Falbello Gallego on the night of September 14 for not stopping when Memo called
 out, -Halt, Jose." Falbello apparently did not believe that the policeman was ad-
 dressing him. The Government tried Memo for manslaughter and a court and sen-
 tenced him to 7 years in prison on December 20.
 On May 24, a policeman shot and killed 28-year-old Ivan Agramonte Arencibia
 in Havana. Agramonte who was reportedly carrying contraband pizza dough on the
 back of his bicycle, had fled a policeman's order to halt. Policemen YosvaniMaturell
 Fernandez and Omar Castro pursued Agranonte, knockinghim off his bicycle and
 then beating him. While Agramonte lay semi-conscious on the ground, Maturell took
 out his pistol and shot him in the head. He died shortly thereafter at a nearby hos-
 pital. On September 6, the Government tried Maturell for manslaughter and sought
 a prison sentence of 14 years. The court had not issued its verdict at year's end.
 The authorities detained Omar Castro for 5 days and then released him.
 On March 9, policeman Francisco Valdes shot and killed 26-year-old Osmany
 Campos Valle on his family's small ranch in Guane, in the province of Pinar del
 Rio; Valdes had just returned from a party at which alcoholic beverages had been
 served. On seeing some movement on the ranch, Valdes had asked the person's
 identity and although Campos reportedly repeated his nickname several times,
 Valdes shot him. The authorities tried Valdes on May 22 in a Ministry of Interior
 courtroom for "special cases." The prosecution sought a 12-year prison sentence and
 monthly supportpayments of about $1.50 (30 pesos at the prevailing legal exchange
 rate) for each of Campos' two young children. On appeal, the court sentenced Valdes
 to 8 years' imprisonment.
 Late in the evening of December 16, 1995, a policeman in Camaguey shot at Yoel
 Leyva and Pedro Roque, whom he had ordered to halt. The 18-year-old Leyva died
 the following day. The youths reportedly had told the policeman that they could not
 stop because the bicycle they were riding had no brakes. At the wake, Carlos Diaz
 Barranco, First Secretary of the Communist Party of Camaguey, pledged to bring
 the policeman to justice. The policeman was tried on December 16, 1995 and re-
 leased in February.
 On April 18, the Government tried the prison officials and inmates alleged to have
 been involved in the September 12, 1995 death in police custody of Estanislao Gon-
 zalez Quintana. While the court determined that Gonzalez' death was the result of
 alcoholism-related heart problems, not the beating he received at the hands of the
 defendants, the prosecution nevertheless sought prison sentences of 10 years for the
 prison guard, 12 years for one of the inmates, and from 1 to 4 years on the charge
 of dereliction of duties for other prison officials. Gonzalez' widow denied that Gon-
 zalez had suffered from heart problems or alcoholism. The court sentenced the pris-
 on guard and the inmate to 2 years' imprisonment and the other prison officials to
 8 months' house arrest. The widow appealed the sentences, and appeals trials were
 pending as of November.
 On February 24, the Cuban Air Force shot down two unarmed civilian aircraft
 from the United States, killing all four people aboard. The report issued by the
 International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) found that the shootdown occurred
 in international airspace and without warning. The ICAO Council "reaffirmed its
 condemnation of the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight as being incom-
 patible with elementary considerations of humanity and the rules of customary
 international law." The U.N. Security Council endorsed the report and the ICAO
 Council resolution and "noted that the unlawful shooting down by the Cuban Air
 Force of two civil aircraft on 24 February 1996 violated the principle that states
 
 
 415
 must refrain from the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight and that, when
 intercepting civil aircraft, the lives of persons on board and the safety of the aircraft
 must not be endangered." The UNHRC expressed its "dismay [over] the loss of
 human life and disregard for human rights norms shown by the Government of
 Cuba."
 On October 16, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) issued
 its final report on the Government's July 13, 1994 sinking of the "13th of March"
 tugboat in which 41 individuals died. The Government did not respond to the
 IACHR's preliminary report issued on May 3. The IACHR concluded that the Gov-
 ernment violated Article I of the American Declaration on the Rights and Duties
 of Man, which guarantees the rights to life and the integrity of the person, and Arti-
 cles VIII and XVIII, which guarantee the rights of transit and justice, respectively.
 The report found the Government legally obligated to indemnify the survivors and
 the relatives of the victims for the damages causedhb. DisapparanceThere were no
 reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits abusive treatment of detainees and prisoners but there
 were i        in which members of the security forces and prison officials beat and
 otherwise abused human rights advocates, detainees, and prisoners. At the police
 station in Nueva Gerona, on the Isle of Youth, policeman Gerardo Acedia Frometa
 reportedly subjected detainee Octavio Rodriguez Gonzalez to electric shocks during
 an interrogation in June. Rodriguez allegedly was taken to an extremely cold inter-
 rogation room and seated on, and handcuffed to, a metal chair which was bolted to
 the floor. The policeman then reportedly applied electric shocks to the chair.
 Individuals linked to state security forces subjected human rights advocates to
 physical aggression. Four men attacked Diosdado Gutierrez Hernandez, a member
 of the Human Rights Party of Cuba, on the street the night of April 20 in Pinar
 del Rio and whispered "take your human rights" while punching him in the stom-
 ach. They did not rob him.
 In May the Cuban Psychiatric Society (CPS) withdrew its 1993 invitation to the
 American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Committee on International Abuse of Psy-
 chiatry and Psychiatrists which had planned to visit Cuba to investigate charges
 that the Government was repressing political dissidents through abusive psychiatric
 interventions. The CPS reportedly found APA's conditions that a Cuban-American
 psychiatrist be included on the delegation and that interviews with dissident psychi-
 atrists be permitted to be "colored by political interests.
 Prison conditions continued to be harsh. The Government claims that prisoners
 have guaranteed rights, such as family visitation, adequate nutrition, pay for work,
 the right to request parole, and the right to petition the prison director. However,
 police and prison officials often denied these rights and used beatings, neglect, isola-
 tion, denial of medical attention, and other abuse against detainees and prisoners,
 including those convicted of political crimes or those who persisted in expressing
 their views. There are separate prison facilities for women and for minors.
 The IACHR reported that prison authorities subjected prisoners who protested the
 conditions or treatment to reprisals such as beatings, transfer to punishment cells,
 transfer to prisons far from their families, suspension of family visits, or denial of
 medical treatment.
 A member of the France-Liberte delegation that interviewed political prisoners in
 May 1995 stated that lengthy and often incommunicado pretrial detention con-
 stitutes a form of psychological torture. State security officials also subjected dis-
 sidents to systematic psycho ogical intimidation, including sleep deprivation, impris-
 onment in cells with common criminals, aggressive homosexuals, or state security
 agents, and threats of physical violence, in an attempt to coerce them to sign in-
 criminating documents or to collaborate. Human rights advocate Alberto Perera
 Martinez, detained as part of the Government's crackdown aginst the Concilio
 Cubano (see Section 1.d.), reported that prison guards deprived him of sleep for 17
 consecutive days, woke him at regular intervals throughout the night for question-
 ing, and kept him in a cell with 24-hour-a-day illumination in order to pressure him
 to sign false statements. During the crackdown, the authorities held human rights
 advocate Eugenio Rodriguez Chaple, a diminutive man in poor health, in the same
 cell as a boxer who was detained on criminal charges.
 At the Kilo 8 prison in Camaguey, Jesus Chamber Ramirez, who sentenced to 10
 years' imprisonment for enemy propaganda and disrespect against government au-
 thority, was regularly denied family visits because ofhi insistence on treatment as
 a political rather than a common prisoner. Prison authorities often placed political
 prisoners in cells with common and sometimes violent criminals and required that
 they comply with the rules for common criminals.
 
 
 The rights to adequate nutrition and medical attention were also regularly vio-
 lated. The IACHR described the nutritional and hygienic situation in the prisons
 together with the deficiencies in medical care, as "alarming." Both the IACHR and
 the U.N. Special Rapporteur, as well as other human rights monitoring organiza-
 tions, reported widespread incidence in prisons of tuberculosis, scabies, hepatitis
 parasitic infections, and malnutrition. In the Guamajal prison in Villa Clara, ieveral
 tuberculosis-infected prisoners staged a hunger strike in mid-July to protest the lack
 of appropriate medical care. On February 9, a guard at the same prison hit a hun-
 gry prisoner, Eleodoro Sanches, on the head with a metal spoon, causing a gash that
 required two stitches, for eating a stolen plate of boiled bananas in the kitchen
 where he worked.
 The authorities regularly denied prisoners other purportedly guaranteed rights
 such as the right of correspondence. At the Guamajal prison on January 15, political
 prisoners gave their personal correspondence to a prison official to send to their rel-
 atives. Those letters were found later that day torn and discarded in a wastepaper
 basket.
 Three prison guards severely beat Ramon Varela Sanchez, Vice President of the
 Marti Civic League, on his head, back, and chest on May 3 after he intervened on
 behalf of another prisoner who was denied medical attention for an abscessed molar.
 Due to the severity of his injuries, the authorities transferred Varela to a prison
 hospital where he remained for 6 days. Varela's lawyer presented a formal com-
 plaint to the Ministry of Interior official responsible for prisons, but no action was
 taken against the prison guards. Varela, who had been held without charges since
 July 30, 1995, was Finally tried on September 25. The Government alleged that
 Varela was the intellectual author of an arson attack on a train station in the
 Calabazar municipality of Havana and sought 5 years' imprisonment. During the
 trial, however, the authorities changed the charge, and the court sentenced him to
 2 years imprisonment for inciting to commit delinquent acts.
 Prison officials also confiscated medications and food brought by family members
 for political prisoners. In March a prison official at the Kio 8 prison seized the
 medications and food brought by relatives for political prisoners Eduardo Gomez
 Sanchez, Jorge Luis Garcia Perz, Aejandro Mustafa Reeand Luis Gustavo
 Dominguez Gutierrez. They were threatened with beatinsif they complained.
 n March the prison warden at Kilo 8 denied pastoralvisits and confiscated reli-
 gious books, including the Bible, from political prisoner Jorge Luis Garcia Perez.
 Garcia, who staged several hunger strikes in protest, is a member of the group of
 political prisoners at Kilo 8 who publicly denounce human rights violations occur-
 ring in the jprison.
 Prson officials at Kilo 8 mounted a campaign to fred and seize any reports of
 human rights violations within the prison. In a meeting with a group of prisoners
 in mid-April, a prison official promised that those who passed no tea rom
 counterrevolutionary prisoners to visiting relatives would be expelled from their
 prison jobs, while those who turned them in to the authorities would receive con-
 jugal visits and other benefits.
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of prison conditions by
 international or national human rights monitoring groups.
 d. Arbitray Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Law of Penal Procedures requires
 police to file formal charges and either release a detainee or bring the case before
 a prosecutor within 96 hours of arrest. It also requires the authorities to provide
 suspects with access to a lawyer within 10 days of arrest. However, the Constitution
 states that all legally recognized civil liberties can be denied anyone actively oppos-
 ing the "decision of the Cuban people                     authorities routinely
 invoke this sweeping authority to deny due process requirements to those detained
 on purported state security grounds.
 The authorities routinely engage in arbitrary arrest and detention of human
 rights advocates, subjecting them to interrogations, threats, and degrading treat-
 ment and conditions for hours or days at a time. The police detained Ronald Faxas
 Maceo on January 31 in Old Havana for distributing copies of the Spanish-language
 version of the Miami Herald and the magazine Dissident. They hldhim overnight,
 fIned him about $5 (100 pesos) for disrespect, and warned that he could be impris-
 oned for 4 to 5 years for spreading enemy  heldathema On July 22, police dtai ed
 Marvin Hernandez and Benito Fojaco ande n propaa n d sa em ienfuegos for
 meeting with a foreign diplomat. The authorities detained human rights adocate
 Osmel ugo Gutierrez on May 22, held him for a month at the state security head-
 quarters in Havana, and then transferred him to the 1580 prison pending trial on
 charges of disrespect and inciting to commit a delinquent ant. The secretary of his
 human rights organization, Griseo Galera Gomez, faced similar charges but was re-
 leased on ball. The charges reportedly hemined from their organizations petition
 
 
 417
 drive and other efforts to protest the forcible eviction of squatters in a shantytown
 in the San Miguel del Padron municipality of Havana. As of November, no trial date
 had been set.
 On January 6, state security agents arrested John Sweeney, a visiting researcher
 with the Heritage Foundation, and interrogated him for 4 hours about the purpose
 of his visit and his contacts in Cuba. They reportedly said that they had accom-
 panied" him since his arrival in Cuba.
 Amnesty International noted that the Government had changed its tactics in deal-
 ing with human rights advocates, and "rather than arresting them and bringing
 them to trial, the tendency was to repeatedly detain them for short periods and
 threaten them with imprisonment unless they gave up their activities or left the
 country." The Government applied this tactic to dozens of members of Concilio
 Cubano, a prodemocracy umbrella group composed of over 130 human rights, politi-
 cal opposition, and independent professional organizations, which was founded in
 October 1995. The harassment intensified in the weeks surrounding Concilio
 Cubano's planned February 24 meeting to discuss Cuba's future. State security
 ageats visited, harassed, threatened, or briefly detained over 200 individuals, in-
 cluding 4 of the 5 members of the Coneiio Cubano secretariat (see Section 1.e.). The
 UNHRC "deplored" the detention and harassment of Concilio Cubano members.
 The authorities detained Concilia Cubano activists Eugeno Rodriguez Chaple,
 Rafael Solano, Alberto Perera Martinez, Nestor Rodriguez Lobaina, Heriberto
 Leyva, and Radames Garcia de la Vega for 6 to 8 weeks, much of the time incommu-
 nicado. They subjected them to physical threats, several interrogations daily, impris-
 onment in cells with aggressive common criminals, sleep deprivation, confiscation of
 food, vitamins, and medications brought by relatives, and strictly supervised and
 limited family visits. When released, all were told that they would be brought to
 trial and given lengthy prison terms if they did not leave the country.
 The Penal Code also includes the concept of "dangerousness," defined as the "spe-
 cial proclivity of a person to commit crimes, demonstrated by his conduct in mani-
 fest contradiction of socialist norms." If the police decide that a person exhibits signs
 of dangerusness, they may bring the offender before a court or subject him to "ther-
 apy" or "political reeducation." Government authorities regularly threaten prosecu-
 tion under this article. Both the UNHRC and the IACHR condemned this concept
 for its subjectivity, the summary nature of the judicial proceedings employed, the
 lack of legal safeguards, and the political considerations behind its application. Ac-
 cording to the IACHR, "the special inclination to commit crimes referred to in the
 Cuban Criminal Code amounts to a subjective criterion used by the Government to
 justify violations of the rights to individual freedom and due process of persons
 whose sole crime has been an inciination to hold a view different from the official
 view."
 On May 7, a court tried human rights advocate Ernesto de Ia 0 Ramos in San
 Juan y   atinez in the province of Pinar del Rio and sentenced him to 2 years' im-
 prisonment on the charge of dangerousness for belonging to a dissident organization
 and disseminating news about Cuba on foreign radio stations. As of November, De
 a 0 Ramos also faced trial on a separate charge of disseminating enemy propa-
 ganda.
 The Government also used exile as a tool for controlling and eliminating the inter-
 nal opposition. The Government regularly offered exile as the condition for release
 to political prisoners. In January the Government released political prisoners Luis
 Grave de Peralta Morell, Carmen Julia Arias Igesias, and Eduardo Ramon Prida
 Gorgoy at the request of visiting U.S. Congressman Bill Richardson. They were
 taken from prison directly to the airport for departure.
 In contrast to its general practice of offering exile only after imprisonment, the
 Government increasingly threatened to charge, try, and imprison human rights ad-
 vocates and independent journalists if they did not leave the country. Human rights
 advocates Mercedes Parada Antunez, Eugenio Rodriguez Chaple, Alberto Perera
 Martinez, Luis Felipe Lores Nadal, Ludila irene Almira, and Miguel Angel Aldana,
 and independent journalists Rafael Solano, Roxana Valdivia Castilla, and Olance
 Nogueras Rofe, were among those threatened. Amnesty International expressed
 "particular concern" about this practice, which "effectivey prevents those concerned
 from being able to act in public life in their own country.
 The Government also increasingly began to employ internal exile as a means to
 restrict the activities of independent journalists and human rights advocates. The
 authorities prohibited independent journalists Olance Nogueras Rofe and Roxana
 Valdivia Castila from traveling to Havana from their hometowns of Cienfuegs and
 Cieg de Avila, respectively, unless the travel was for the purpose of making ar-
 rangements to leave the country.

 One June 6, police arrested university reform advocates Nestor Rodriguez Lobaina
 and Radames Garcia de la Vega, who had remained in Havana following their re-
 lease from detention in April despite orders to return to their homes in the eastern
 provinces. A court tried them on June 12 for resisting authority and disobedience
 and sentenced them to 6 months and 1 year, respectively, of restricted movement
 in their hometowns, 5 years of internal exile in their home provinces, and to report
 periodically to the local police. According to Amnesty International, "the sentence
 is believedto have been imposed to prevent them from returning to the capital to
 carry on with their activities." Rodriguez and Garcia remained in Havana pending
 the results of their appeal and the police arrested them again on June 25 for breach
 of sentence. The following day, when taken to the courthouse, Rodriguez reportedly
 appeared with facial bruises and accused a civilian-clad security agent of having
 beaten him. While handcuffed, he was attacked and again beaten by the agent. The
 authorities forcibly sent Rodriguez and Garcia to the provinces of Guantanamo and
 Santiago, respectively, on July 1. The authorities also confiscated their identity doc-
 uments, which Cuban citizens are required to carry at all times, as a means of en-
 forcing the restriction on their movement. In mid-July, state security agents threat-
 ened Rodriguez and Garcia with imprisonment if they continued their political ac-
 tivities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution provides for independ-
 ent courts, it explicitly subordinates them to the National Assembly (ANPP) and the
 Council of State, which is headed by Fidel Castro. The ANPP and its lower level
 counterparts elect all judges. The subordination of the courts to the Communist
 Party further compromises the judiciary's independence.
 Civil courts exist at municipal, provincial, and Supreme Court levels. Panels com-
 posed of a mix of professionally certified and lay judges preside over them. Military
 tribunals assume jurisdiction for certain counterrevolutionary cases. Cuban law and
 trial practices do not meet international standards for fair public trials. Almost all
 cases are tried in less than a day.
 There are no jury trials. While most trials are public, trials are closed when state
 security is allegedly involved. Prosecutors may introduce testimony from a CDR
 member as to the revolutionary background of a defendant, which may contribute
 to either a longer or shorter sentence. The law recognizes the right of appeal in mu-
 nicipal courts but limits it in provincial courts to cases such as those involving max-
 imum prison terms or the death penalty. The law requires that an appeal be filed
 within 5 days of the verdict.
 Criteria for presenting evidence, especially in cases of human rights advocates,
 are arbitrary and discriminatory. Often the sole evidence provided, particularly in
 political cases, is the defendant's confession, usually obtained under duress and
 without the legal advice or knowledge of a defense lawyer. The authorities regularly
 deny defendants access to their lawyers until the day of the trial. Several dissidents
 who have served prison terms report that they were tried and sentenced without
 counsel and were not allowed to speak on their own behalf. Amnesty International
 stated that "trials in all cases fall far short of international standards for a fair
 trial."
 The law provides the accused the right to an attorney, but the control that the
 Government exerts over the livelihood of members of the state-controlled lawyers'
 collectives-especially when they defend persons accused of state security crimes-
 compromises their ability to represent clients. Attorneys have reported reluctance
 to defend those charged in political cases out of fear of jeopardizing their own ca-
 reers.
 The Government summarily tried and imprisoned four members of the Concilio
 Cubano (see Section 1.d.). The police arrested Concilio Cubano founder Leonel
 Morejon Almagro on February 15. A court sentenced him on February 23 to 6
 months' imprisonment for resisting authorities; on appeal, it sentenced him to an
 additional 9 months' imprisonment for disobedience. The court also fined his defense
 attorney, Jose Angel Izquierdo Gonzalez, for characterizing the trial as a "sham."
 In August the authorities transferred Morejon from Vallegran4e prison on the out-
 skirts of Havana to Ariza prison in Cienfuegos, on the southern coast of Cuba, for
 refusing to accept the prison's reeducation system.
 The police also arrested Concilio Cubano secretariat member Lazaro Gonzalez
 Valdes on February 15, and a court sentenced him on February 22 to 14 months'
 imprisonment for disobedience and disrespect. Izquierdo, who also represented Gon-
 zalez, was only informed of the charges a few hours before the trial and was only
 able to speak to his client a few minutes beforehand. People believed to be members
 of the Government's Rapid Response Brigade, armed with iron bars and sticks, re-
 portedly surrounded the courthouse during the trial.
 
 
 The police arrested Juan Francisco Monzon Oviedo, an alternate member of the
 coordinating body of Concilio Cubano, on March 18, and a court sentenced him on
 March 21 to 6 months' imprisonment for illegal association. His attorney did not ap-
 pear for the trial. The authorities detained human rights advocate Roberto Lopez
 Montanez on February 23, and held him until a court tried and sentenced him on
 July 16 to 15 months' imprisonment for disrespect and falsification of documents.
 Despite serious health problems, the Government refused to release Lopez on bail
 pending trial.
 According to Amnesty International some 600 persons were imprisoned for var-
 ious political crimes. Other human rights monitoring groups estimate that between
 1,000 and 1,500 individuals-not including those held for ganerousness--were im-
 prisoned on such charges as disseminating enemy propaganda, illicit association,
 contempt for authorities (usually for criticizing Fide Castro), clandestine printing,
 or the broad charge of rebellion, often brought against advocates of peaceful demo-
 cratic change. In a television interview in October 1995, President Castro acknowl-
 edged and attempted to justify the existence of political prisoners in Cuba by stating
 that this was a normal practice in many other countries.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though the Constitution provides for the inviolability of one's home and correspond-
 ence, official surveillance of private and family affairs by government-controlled
 mass organizations, such as the CDR's, remains one of the most pervasive and re-
 pressive features of Cuban life. The State has assumed the right to interfere in the
 lives of citizens, even those who do not actively oppose the Government and its prac-
 tices. The Communist Party controls the mass organizations that permeate society.
 Their ostensible purpose is to "improve" the citizenry, but in fact their goal is to
 discover and discourage nonconformity. Citizen participation in these mass organi-
 zations has declined; the economic crisis has both reduced the Government's ability
 to provide material incentives for their participation and forced many people to en-
 gage in black market activities, which the mass organizations are supposed to report
 to the authorities.
 The authorities utilize a wide range of social controls. The Interior Ministry em-
 ploys an intricate system of informants and block committees (the CDR's) to monitor
 and control public opinion. While to a lesser extent than in the past, CDR's continue
 to report on suspicious activity, including conspicuous consumption; unauthorized
 meetings including those with foreigners; and defiant attitudes toward the Govern-
 ment and the revolution.
 State security often reads international correspondence and monitors overseas
 telephone calls and conversations with foreigners. The Government controls all ac-
 cess to the Internet, and all electronic mail messages are subject to censorship. Citi-
 zens do not have the right to receive publications from abroad, although newstands
 in foreigners-only hotels and outside certain hard currency stores do sell foreign
 newspapers and magazines. The Government continued to jam U.S.-operated Radio
 Marti and Television Marti; Radio Marti broadcasts frequently overcame the jam-
 ming attempts. Security agents subject dissidents, foreign diplomats, and journalists
 to harassment and surveillance.
 The authorities regularly search people and their homes, without probable cause,
 to intimidate and harass them. During the Government's crackdown on Concilio
 Cubano, state security agents searched the homes of dozens of human rights advo-
 cates and independent journalists, seizing typewriters, personal and organizational
 documents, books, and foreign newspapers. On April 26, state security agents
 searched the office of the Inependent Press Bureau of Cuba and seized files, cor-
 respondence, magazines, two typewriters, a computer, a printer, and office supplies.
 The authorities regularly detained human rights advocates after they visited the
 US. Interests Section, confiscated their written reports of human rights abuses, and
 seized copies of U.S. newspapers and other informational material.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government does not allow criticism of the
 revolution or its leaders. Laws against antigovernment propaganda, graffiti, and in-
 sults against officials carry penalties of from 3 months to 1 year in prison. If Presi-
 dent Castro or members of the National Assembly or Council of State are the object
 of criticism, the sentence is extended to 3 years. Local CDR's inhibit freedom of
 speech by monitoring and reporting dissent or criticism. Police and state security
 officials reglarly harassed, threatened, beat, and otherwise abused human rights
 advocates in pub ic and private as a means of intimidation and control.
 The Constitution states that electronic and print media are state property and
 acannot become in any case private property." The Communist Party controls all
 media as a means to indoctrinate the public. All media must operate under party

 guidelines and reflect government views. In late June, the Cuban Institute of Radio
 and Television demoted translator Pedro Hernandez Diaz for refusing to "soften" the
 subtitled translation of the last two lines of the 'Star Spangled Banner" in a movie
 to be shown on Cuban television.
 At year's end, the authorities fired the director and three writers and editors of
 the Havana Tribune, a weekly published by Havana province's Communist Party,
 for two pieces that appeared on December 22. One was an article that appeared to
 attack the pet project of two influential officials and the other an editrial subject
 to interpretation as a subtle criticism of the regime. These firings bighlighted the
 ideological rigidity witbin wMich the official media must operate, and are expected
 to cause reporters and editors to follow the official line even more stridently in the
 future.
 The Government usually did not jam forei  radio broadcasts; however, it contin-
 ued to jam U.S.-operated Radio Marti and Television Marti (see Section 1.f.)
 Theo Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) isted Cuba as one of the 10 worst
 "enemies of the press" because of the Government's prohibition against any inde-
 pendent publications or broadcasters. The Government subjects independent jour-
 nalists to internal travel bans, periodic overnight detentions, the harassment of
 friends and relatives, seizures of written manuals and computer and facsimile
 equipment, and repeated threats of prolonged imprisonment. The CPJ publicly com-
 pl-ainied about the denial of essential telecommunications services to inde~endent
 journalists. The Inter-American Press Association awarded its 1996 Grand Prize for
 Press Freedom to the Tndependent Press Bureau of Cuba, the Association of bIde-
 pendent Journalists of Cuba, Havana Press, CubaPress, and La Patria-all inde-
 pendentuprss agencies-for their work in the face of constant government harass-
 ment and threats.
 Several visiting foreign journaists who met with independnt journalists were
 harassed or expelled from the country. On June 12, four men seize Rodrigo Alonso,
 a Chilean national in Cuba to prepare a Progrlam on the life of Che Guevara, as
 he left his hotel. They forced im into a car, drove him around Havana for about
 4 hours, and questioned him aggressively about his activities in Cuba. The authori-
 ties expelled Susan Bilello, a representative of the CPJ, and Jacques Perrot a rep-
 resentative of the French-based "Reporters Sans Frontieres," from Cuba on iune 20
 and July 12, respectively.
 The Goveent rigorously monitored other forms of expression and often ar-
 rested people for the crimes of enemy propaganda and clandestine printing. Enemy
 propaganda was considered to include materials ranging from the Universal Iec-
 laation of Human Rights, to reports of human rights violations, to mainstream for-
 eign newspapers and magazines. In September state security agents searched the
 library oft e Grand Masonic Lodge, seized illegal" newspapers and magazines, and
 then met with the Masonic leadership. On September 15,  eore representatives of
 over 200 lodges, Grand Mason Eriberto Saborit Verdocia announced that Gustavo
 Pardo had been fired from his position as library director and expelled from the Ma-
 sonic Lodge. He presented five cartons of books, which he suggested be burned.
 The Government prohibits all diplomatic missions in Havana from printing or dis-
 tributing publications, particularly newspapers or newspaper clippings, unless those
 publications deal exclusively with conditions in the mission's home country and re-
 ceivenprior government approval. The Government reacted negatively against for-
 eign diplomats who focused on human rights problems in Cuba. It withdrew official
 approval for a new foreign ambassador because of his public comments that his door
 would be open to dissidents, and refused to renew the visa of another diplomat who
 maintained contacts with human rights activists, requiring that she leave the coun-
 try for allegedly eng g in "activities incompatible with her diplomatic status.
 Foreign Miistr officials accused the diplomat of distributing antigvernment lit-
 erature to dissident groups, citing such volumes as George Orwel's novel "Animal
 Farm" and biographies of Cuban independence heroes Jose Marti and Antonio
 Maceo.
 On December 24, the ANPP rubber-stamped a new law proscribing citizens from
 seeking or providing any information to any representative of the U.S. Government
 that might be used directly or indirectly in the application of US. legislation. This
 includes accepting or distributing any publications, documents, or other material
 from any origin which the authorities might interpret as facilitating implementation
 of such legislation.
 The Government circumscribes artistic, literary, and academic freedoms. In a
 March 23 speech to the Fifth Plenary Session of the Communist Part , Party Second
 Secretary Raul Castro chastised intellectuals, Communist Party members, artists,
 and the media for ideological laxity. The Communist Party shortly thereafter re-
 placed the director of the Center for the Study of the Americas, a think tank that
 
 
 Raul Castro had specifically criticized for having succumbed to foreign ideas and
 lifestyles. The authorities fired Jorge Luis Acands, chairman of the Marxist Studies
 Department at the University of Havana, on April 19 after foreign news reports
 quoted him describing declining student enrollment in Marxist studies courses. They
 discharged University of Havana professors Miriam Gras and Gloria Leon without
 right of retirement in early September. The Communist Party had previously ex-
 pe led the two professors. The party and the university reportedly objected to the
 regular professional contacts that Gras, a professor of political science, and Leon,
 a professor of American studies, maintained with foreign diplomats and visiting aca-
 demics.
 The educational system teaches that the State's interests have precedence over all
 other commitments. The Ministry of Education requires teachers to evaluate stu-
 dents' ideological character and note it in the records that students carry through-
 out their schooling, and which affect their future educational and career prospects.
 In many cases, the Government demands that teaching materials for courses such
 as mathematics or literature have an ideological content.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution
 grants limited rights of assembly and association, these rights are subject to the re-
 quirement that they may not be "exercised against *** the existence and objec-
 tives of the Socialist State." The law punishes any unauthorized assembly, including
 for private religious services, of more than three persons, even in a private home,
 by up to 3 months in prison and a fine. The authorities selectively enfo  this pro-
 hibiton and often use it as a legal pretext to harass and imprison human rights
 advocates. The authorities have never approved a public meeting of a human rights
 group. The Government did not formally respond to the December 22, 1995 written
 request to the Council of State from the Condiio Cubano for authorization to hold
 a meeting on February 24-27 to discuss Cuba's future. State security officials in-
 formed human righ   eader Gustavo Aros   ergnes verbally on February 16, the
 day after the crackdown began, that the Government would not permit such a meet-
 mhePenal Code specifically outlaws "illegal or unrecognized groups." The Ministryr
 of Justice, in consultation with the Interior Ministry, decides whether to give orgam-
 zations legal recognition.
 Along with recognized churches, the Roman Catholic humanitarian organization
 CvAS, small human rights groups, and several nascent fraternal or professional
 organizations are the only associations outside the control of the State, the party,
 and mass organizations. The authorities continue to ignore these aups applica
 tions for leg  recoition, thereby subjecting members to potential charges of illegal
 association.
 All other legally recognized nongovernmental groups are affiliated with or con-
 trolled b the Government. Referring to the research institutes that he had criti-
 cized in his March23 speech, Hal Castro stated in April that "the party has the
 right to question and analyze whether a [research] center that depends on it for ma-
 terial and human resources is doing what it is supposed to  and, if not, to correct
 things." Several of these research institutes applied for and received consultative
 status as nongovernmental organizations with the U.N. Economic and Social Coun-
 cil (ECOSOC). Under ECOSOC rules, government support may be acceptable for a
 nongovernmental organization but should at no time "intere with the free expres-
 sion of views of the organization."o
 c. Freedom of Religon.-In recent years, the Government has eased the harsher
 aspctos r prepression of religious freedom. In 1991 it allowed religious adherents
 to join the Communist Party. In 1992 it amended the Constitution to prohibit reli-
 gious discrimination and removed references to "scientific materialism," i.e., athe-
 ism    z as the basis for the Cuban State. Nevertheless, the State prohibits members
 of the armed forces from ao aoi nyone in their household to observe religious
 ractices except elderly relatives if their religious beliefs do not influence other
 a   iymembers and are not "damaging to the revolution.
 Despite continued prohibitions on access to the media and establishment of reli-
 gious schools, and restrictions on the number of foreign priests and nuns, the
 Roman Catholic Church has observed that it has relatively more latitude in which
 to carry out its pastoral mission. Church attendance in all denominations has grown
 in recent years.
 However, religious persecution continues. In December 1995, the Government is-
 sued a resolution preventing any Cuban or joint enterprise from selling computers,
 fax machbines, photocopiers, or other equipment to any church. A December 1, 1995
 decree signed by Politburo member Jose Ramon Machado Ventura prohibited
 Christmas trees and decorations in public buildings, except those related to the
 tourist or foreign commercial sector, and completely prohibited Nativity scenes. (Of-
 
 
 ficial recognition of all religious holidays ended in 1961.) In February the Union of
 Communist Youth (UJC) affiliate within the lawyers' collective in the town of Palma
 Soriano expelled attorney Cesar Antonio Martinez Melero from his longstanding
 membership because of his active involvement in the Roman Catholic Church. In
 April a disciplinary board of the Julio Mella Polytechnic Institute suspended Raul
 Leyva Amaran's student stipend for 6 months for refusing on religious grounds to
 participate in a February 27 rally in support of the Government's shootdown of two
 civilian US. aircraft. Leyva had said that as a Catholic, he "did not support the vio-
 lent death of anyone and for reasons of conscience [he] could not go to the rally."
 The Government continued its 1961 prohibition on nearly all religious processions
 outside churches and denied churches access to the mass media.
 The Government requires churches and other religious groups to register with the
 , cial registry of associations to obtain official recognition. The Government pro-
 iit with occasional exceptions, the construction of new churches, forcing many
 g congregations to violate the law and meet in people's homes. Government
 assment of private houses of worship continued, with evangelical denominations
 reporting evictions from, and bulldozing of, houses used for these purposes. In the
 province of Las Tunas, neighbors of one private house of worship tried to provoke
 fights with parishioners, blared music during religious services, and tried to pour
 boiling water through the windows during a religious service. In the western mining
 town of Moa, a group of evangelical leaders submitted a written appeal to the local
 Communist Party to stop the harassment of church members and the demolition of
 private houses of worship and to lift the prohibition on the construction, expansion,
 or remodeling of churches. The authorities warned religious leaders in Havana that
 they would impose fines from $550 to $2,800 (10,000-50,000 pesos), imprison lead-
 ers and withdraw official recognition from the religious denomination itself unless
 the private houses of worship were closed.
 The Government, however, relaxed restrictions on members of the Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses, whom it had considered "active religious enemies of the revolution" for their
 refusal to accept obligatory military service or participate in state organizations.
 The Government authorized small assemblies of Jehovah's Witnesses, the opening
 of a Havana central office, and the publishing of the Jehovah's Witnesses' Watch-
 tower magazine and other religious tracts.
 State security officials regularly harassed human rights advocates prior to reli-
 gious services commemorating special feast days or before significant national days.
 A crowd of thugs, armed with wooden clubs hidden inside rolled-up newspapers,
 surrounded the Sacred Heart Church in central Havana before a mass on July 13,
 the second anniversary of the Cuban Coast Guard's sinking of the "13th of March"
 tugboat in which 41 people died.
 d.Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government generaly does not impose legal restrictions on domes-
 tic travel, except for persons found to be HIV-psitive, whom it initially restricts to
 sanitoriums for treatment and therapy before conditionally releasing them to the
 community. However, state security officials forbade some human rights advocates
 and independent journalists from traveling outside their home provinces and has
 begun to sentence others to internal exile (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government imposes some restrictions on both emigration and temporary for-
 eign travel. It allows the majority of ersons who qualify for immigrant or refugee
 status in other countries to leave Cu a. In certain cases, however, the authorities
 delay or deny exit permits, usually without explanation. Some of the denials involve
 professionals who have tried to emigrate and whom the Government subsequently
 banned from working in their occupational field. The Government refused permis-
 sion to others because it considers their cases sensitive for political or state security
 reasons. The Government also routinely denies exit permits to young men approach-
 ing the age of military service until their 27th birthday, even when it has author-
 ized the rest of the family to leave. However, most of those cases approved for mi-
 gration to the United States under the September 9, 1994 U.S.-Cuban migration
 agreement eventually receive exemption from obligatory service and exit permits.
 Migrants who travel to the United States must pay fees of $600 per adult, $400
 per child, plus airfare. Such fees-which must be paid in dollars-are equivalent to
 2% years of a professional person's salary. In April a ministerial decree reduced the
 fee by half for 1,000 individuals, but by year's end, 238 of these individuals still
 could not pay even this reduced amount. The International Organization for Migra-
 tion is considering options to handle the fees for those refugees.
 The Government denied temporary exit permits to several human rights advo-
 cates, including Osvaldo Paya Sardinas, Vladimiro Roca Antunez, and Rene Gomez
 Manzano.
 
 
 423
 The Penal Code provides for imprisonment from 1 to 3 years or a fine of $15 to
 $50 (300 to 1,000 pesos) for unauthorized departures by boat or raft. The office of
 the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has stated that it regards any
 sentence for illegal exit of over 1 year as harsh and excessive. Under the terms of
 the May 2, 1995 US.-Cuba migration accord, the Government agreed not to pros-
 ecute or retaliate against rafters returned to Cuba from international or U.S. wa-
 ters.
 In August 1994, the Government eased restrictions on visits by, and repatriation
 of, Cuban emigrants. Cubans who establish residency abroad and who are m posses-
 sion of government-issued "permits to reside abroad" may travel to Cuba without
 visas. The Government reduced the age of people eligible to travel abroad from 20
 to 18 years and extended the period for temporary stay abroad from 6 to 11 months.
 In November 1995, the Government announced that emigrants who are considered
 not to have engaged in "hostile actions" against the Government and who are not
 subject to criminal proceedings in their country of residene may apply at Cuban
 consulates for renewable, 2-year multiple-entry travel authorizations.
 The Constitution provides for the granting of asylum to individuals persecuted
 "for their ideals or struggles for democratic rights against imperialism, fascism, colo-
 nialism, and necolonahism; against discrimination and racism; for national libera-
 tions; for the rights of workers, peasants, and students; for their progressive politi-
 cal, scientific, artistic, and literary activities, for socialism and peace. The Govern-
 ment honors the principle of first asylum and provided it to a small number of per-
 sons in 1996. According to the UNHCR, five foreign nationals sought asylum or ref-
 ugee status from the Government in 1996. There were no reports of the force return
 of persons to countries where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have no legal right to change their government or to advocate change.
 The Constitution proscribes any political organization other than the Communist
 Party. A small group of leaders select members of its highest government bedies-
 the Politburo and the Central Committee.
 The authorities tightly control all elections. The Government has ignored calls for
 democratic reform. The European Union suspended negotiations toward a coopera-
 tion agreement in February because of lack of progress toward political or economic
 reform and in December adopted a common position binding on all member states.
 It directly links improvement of European Union relations with Cuba to progress
 toward a democratic transition and an improvement in the human rights situation.
 The Government rejects any change judged incompatible with the revolution. The
 Government has systematically retaliated against those who have peacefully sought
 political change.
 Although not a formal requirement, Communist Party membership is in fact a
 prerequisite for high-level official positions and professional advancement.
 Government leadership positions continued to be dominated by men. There are
 very few women or minorities in policymaking positions in the Government or the
 party. There are three women on the Politburo. Two of the 14 provincial party sec-
 retaries are women, the first chosen in 1993. The head of the Union of Communist
 Youth is a woman. Although blacks and mulattos make up over half the population,
 they hold only 2 seats in the 26-member Politburo.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not recognize any domestic human rights groups, or permit
 them to function legally. The Government subjects domestic human rights advocates
 to intense intimidation, harassment, and repression. In violation of its own statutes,
 the Government refuses to consider applications for legal recognition submitted by
 human rights monitoring groups.
 The Government has steadfastly rejected international human rights monitoring.
 In 1992 Cuba's U.N. representative stated that Cuba would not recognize the
 UNHRC mandate on Cuba and would not cooperate with the Special Rapporteur,
 despite being a UNHRC member. This policy remains unchanged. The Government
 consistently refused even to acknowledge requests by the Special Rapporteur to visit
 Cuba.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Cuba is a multiracial society with a black and mixed race majority. The Constitu-
 tion forbids discrimination based on race, sex, or national origin, although evidence
 suggests that racial and sexual discrimination occur often.
 
 
 424
 Women.-Violent crime is rarely reported in the press and there are no publicly
 available data regarding the incidence of domestic violence. The law establishes
 strict penalties for rape, and the Government appears to enforce the law. Prostitu-
 tion has increased greatly in the last few years; press reports indicate that tourists
 from various countries visit specifically to patronize inexpensive prostitutes. During
 its 1995 annual meeting, the official Federation of Cuban Women criticized govern-
 ment-sponsored advertising that promoted sex-related tourism.
 The Family Code states that women and men have equal rights and responsibil-
 ities regarding marriage, divorce, raising children, maintaining the home, and pur-
 suing a career. Women are subject to the same restrictions on property ownership
 as men. The Maternity Law provides 18 weeks of maternity leave and grants work-
 ing women preferential access to goods and services. About 40 percent of all women
 work, and they are well represented in the professions.
 Chrildren.-The Constitution states that the Government will protect "family, ma-
 ternity, and matrimony." It also states that children, legitimate or not have the
 same rights under the law and notes the duties of parents to protect them. Edu-
 cation is free and is grounded in Marxist ideology. State organizations and schools
 are charged with the 'integral formation of children and youth." The national health
 care system covers all citizens. There is no societal pattern of abuse of children.
 People with Disabilities.-The law prohibits discrimination based on disability,
 and there have been few complaints of such discrimination. There are no laws that
 mandate accessibility to buildings for people with disabilities.
 National/RacialIEthnic Minorities.-Many blacks have benefitted from the social
 changes of the revolution. Nevertheless, there have been numerous reports of dis-
 proportionate police harassment of black youths.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution gives priority to state or collective
 needs over individual choices regarding free association or provision of employment.
 The "demands of the economy and society" take precedence over an individual work-
 er's preferences. The law prohibits strikes; none are known to have occurred. Estab-
 lished labor organizations have a mobilization function and do not act as trade
 unions or promote or protect worker rights, including the right to strike. Such orga-
 nizations are under the control of the State and the Party.
 The Communist Party selects the leaders of the sole legal confederation, the Con-
 federation of Cuban Workers, whose principal responsibility is to ensure that gov-
 ernment production goals are met. Despite disclaimers in international forums the
 Government explicitly prohibits independent unions and none exist. There has been
 no change since the 1992 International Labor Organization (ILO) finding that inde-
 pendent unions "do not appear to exist" and its ruling that Cuba violated ILO norms
 on freedom of association and the right to organize. Those who attempt to engage
 in union activities face government persecution.
 Workers can lose their jobs for their political beliefs, including their refusal to join
 the official union. The authorities dismissed Blanca Nieves Cruz Rivero, a secretary
 for 13 years with the Ministry of Justice in the province of Pinar del Rio, from her
 ob on April 16. According to her dismissal letter, Nieves violated her work contract
 y "refusing to participate in the mass organizations and to be affiliated with the
 public administration union; and for having contact with people who do not share
 the philosophy of the revolution and for opposing it in an open manner as an activ-
 ist of so-called human rights groups; and for having realized activities such as
 speaking on enemy radio stations that transmit from abroad messages of a
 counterrevolutionary content." Nieves had written an open letter to Raul Castro on
 April 2 criticizing his speech to the Fifth Communist Party Congress and had been
 interviewed on Radio Marti.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining does not
 exist. The State Committee for Work and Social Security sets wages and salaries
 for the state sector. Since all legal unions are government entities, antiunion dis-
 crimination by definition does not exist.
 In 1993 the Government removed some of the restrictions on self-employment im-
 posed in 1968 and allowed people to apply for licenses to work in over 125 different
 occupations, expanded to over 160 in 1994. Besides adding another 20 occupational
 categories, in 1995 the Government removed its previous ban on self-employment
 licenses for university graduates. However, university graduates cannot get self-em-
 ployment licenses to work in their professional field and must remain employed in
 their state job to qualify for a self-employment license.
 There are no functioning export processing zones in Cuba, although the 1995 For-
 eign Investment Law (Law 77), authores the establishment of free trade zones and
 industrial parks. Law 77 continued to deny workers the right to contract directly
 
 
 with foreign companies investing in Cuba. The Government requires foreign inves-
 tors to contract workers through state employment agencies, which are paid in for-
 eign currency and, in turn, pay their workers in pesos. Workers subcontracted by
 state employment agencies must meet certain political qualifications. According to
 Marcos Portal, Minister of Basic Industry, the state employment agencies consult
 with the party, the Confederation of Cuban Workers, and the Union of Communist
 Youth to ensure that the workers chosen deserve to work in a joint enterprise.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Neither the Constitution nor the
 Labor Code prohibit forced labor. The Government maintains correctional centers
 where it sends people for crimes such as dangerousness. They are forced to work
 on farms or building sites, usually with no pay and inadequate food. The authorities
 often imprison internees who do not cooperate. The Government employs special
 groups of workers, known as "microbrigades," on loan from other jobs, on special
 building projects. These microbrigades have increased importance in the Govern-
 ment's efforts to complete tourist and other priority projects. Workers who refuse
 to volunteer for these jobs often risk discrimination or job loss. Microbrigade work-
 ers, however, reportedly receive priority consideration for apartments. The military
 channels some conscripts to the Youth Labor Army, where they serve their 2-year
 military service requirement working on farms that supply both the armed forces
 and the civilian population.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum working age
 is 17 years. The Labor Code permits employment of 15- and 16-year-olds to obtain
 training or fill labor shortages. All students over age 11 are expected to devote 30
 to 45 days of their summer vacation to farm work, laboring up to 8 hours per day.
 The Ministry of Agriculture uses "voluntary labor" by Student Work Brigades exten-
 sively in the farming sector. The law requires school attendance until the ninth
 grade, and this law is generally respected.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage varies by occupation and
 is set by the Bureau of Labor and Social Security. The minimum monthly wage for
 a maid, for example, is $8.25 (165 pesos); for a bilingual office clerk, $9.50 (190
 pesos); and for a gardener $10.75 (215 pesos). The Government supplements the
 minimum wage with free medical care, education, and subsidized housing and food.
 Even with these subsidies, however, a worker must earn far more than the average
 monthly wage to support a family. The Government rations most basic necessities
 such as food, medicine, clothing, and cooking gas, which are in very short supply,
 if available at all.
 The standard work week is 44 hours, with shorter workdays in hazardous occupa-
 tions, such as mining. The Government also reduced the workday in some govern-
 mental offices and state enterprises to save energy. Workplace environmental and
 safety controls are usually inadequate, and the Government lacks effective enforce-
 ment mechanisms. The Labor Code establishes that a worker who considers his life
 in danger because of hazardous conditions has the right not to work in his position
 or not to enga e in specific activities until such risks are eliminated. According to
 the Labor code, the worker remains obligated to work temporarily in whatever
 other position may be assigned him at a salary prescribed by law. Industrial acci-
 dents apparently are frequent, but the Government suppresses such reports.
