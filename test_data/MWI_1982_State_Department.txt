 MALAWI
 The Government of Malawi is a one-man autocracy in which Life
 President Hastings Kamuzu Banda has held virtually unchallenged
 power, based on a philosophy combining nationalism and tradi-
 tionalism, since independence in 1964. President Banda has
 maintained undisputed control over all aspects of government
 and heads the sole legal political party, the Malawi Congress
 Party, which controls the Government. The Party contains
 separate women's and youth branches which assist in funneling
 grassroots interest and concerns to the leadership, while at
 the same time acting as a conduit for implementation of deci-
 sions taken by the leadership. Popular participation is circum-
 scribed by and subordinated to the prevailing political, economic,
 and social philosophy of the Life President. The Government
 emphasizes economic development which, according to its claims,
 can only be accomplished in an atmosphere of "peace and calm, law
 and order..'
 Malawi became independent in 1964 with a per capita Gross
 National Product of approximately $100. From that time until
 the end of the 1970's, the GNP grew at the substantial real rate
 of about seven percent annually, resulting in a 1982 per capita
 GNP of $220. Malawi is, however, still one of the world's poor-
 est countries. The Government's major priority has been the
 economic development of the land and its more than six million
 citizens. While progress has been made, it has not been without
 cost. There have been and continue to be violations of civil and
 political rights in response to real or perceived challenges to
 the authority of the Government.
 Opposition to the Government is banned, and challenges to the
 system are suppressed. Total loyalty, not merely passive
 acceptance of party and government policy, is demanded under
 penalty of suspicion and perhaps detention by the authorities.
 Thus, if suspect by the authorities of anything less than un-
 flinching loyalty to the Life President and Party, a person's
 rights may easily be violated. Hence, such civil liberties as
 exist do so at the suffrance of the authorities and are highly
 circumscribed. Political activity is limited to participation in
 the sole political party and conforming with its views and
 practices. But, while limitations on human rights are pervasive
 in Malawi, they are not particularly harsh. There are only 50
 political prisoners, and relative freedom of association exists.
 There have-been few changes in the state of human rights in the
 past year. A general liberalizing trend began in 1977 with the
 release of a large number of political detainees, and it has
 continued in less dramatic fashion since. Arbitrary arrest,
 however, with resulting short term detention for perceived
 violations of prevailing political, economic and social norms,
 is still commonplace, and is accompanied by degrading and some-
 times cruel treatment. Such actions are directed at individuals
 and not groups or classes of the citizenry. Thus, they are not
 institutionalized and may be applied according to individual
 circumstances. There appears little likelihood of a major shift
 in the direction of human rights practices during the reign of
 President Banda.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 The government of Malawi has not executed anyone on political
 
 
 188
 grounds since the mid-1970's, when a Party purge was conducted
 at high levels. There is no evidence of killings or the
 sanctioning of killings by the limited exile opposition.
 b. Disappearance
 Malawians are frequently surreptitiously detained by the police,
 usually acting at the direction of the Party. Such disappear-
 ances are usually short-lived (no more than a few weeks or
 months) and are carried out in the name of either national
 security or breach of Party discipline. There are no known
 instances where such detentions have led to death. Dissident.
 groups confine their opposition activities to protesting from
 outside Malawi.
 c. Torture
 While torture is not officially condoned by the Government, it
 is, nontheless, practiced by both Party and police officials.
 There is no specific reference to torture under Malawian law.
 Torture which does occur generally takes the form of beatings
 "in camera" by police authorities and can occur at the time
 of arrest or detention or during interrogation. Such activities
 are rarely, if ever, publicized or punished.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Malawians convicted of violations of the law are sentenced
 to varying prison terms. Less severe and less dangerous
 offenders are normally sent to prison farms while more dangerous
 offenders are sent to Zomba prison. Sentences which include
 hard labor are the norm, while execution is practiced (hanging)
 for capital offenses such as murder and treason. Prisoners
 who comply with internment rules are not believed to be treated
 in a cruel or inhuman manner. Political prisoners may be incar-
 cerated either at Zomba prison, at a prison farm, or may be
 under a looser form of detention such as house arrest, depending
 on the will of the President. In its 1982 report~reviewing
 events of 1981, Amnesty International noted reports that poli-
 tical detainees receive harsh treatment, including complete
 isolation and denial of contact with relatives.
 There is little evidence that punishment in criminal cases
 varies according to social class, race, sex, or religion. Accord-
 ing to a reliable source, political detainees are less suscep-
 tible than are criminal suspects to harsh or degrading treatment.
 The facilities in Malawian prisons are generally on the level of
 other less developed countries and reflect official efforts to
 maintain humane conditions of treatment.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 At any given time there may be numerous detainees held without
 charge who have been arrested arbitrarily for real or perceived
 offenses against the Party or Government. As indicated prev-
 iously, however, these detentions, without specific charges
 being filed, are invariably for a short term. Most observers
 agree that there are probably less than 50 long-term political
 detainees, although some international human rights organizations
 have challenged this figure, claiming thousands of detainees are
 incarcerated in Malawi. There is little, if any, evidence to
 support this charge. Habeas corpus, per se, does not exist,
 although there are provisions in the law permitting the High
 Court to order the release of a prisoner. Successful appli-
 cation of these provisions in at least one recent case
 
 
 189
 should not be construed to imply that habeas corpus or its
 equivalent is commonplace in Malawi. Preventive detention
 exists but according to credible legal authority, its use
 is uncommon now. Detention laws and practices greatly favor
 the state rather than the individual. Thus, a suspect can
 be held without charge for a long period of time following
 an arrest, while a case is being developed by authorities.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Individuals charged with criminal offenses are generally dealt
 with promptly and fairly in the modern court system, where the
 defendant has the right to legal counsel. Legal counsel is
 effective. The defendant has a right to a trained defender who
 has normal access to the defendant and judicial proceedings.
 Government exerts little control over the trial system in civil
 cases tried before the High Court or magistrate courts. There
 is little or no evidence with respect to government control over
 the traditional court system. Legal practioners may appear in
 traditional courts in some cases, i.e., when the case in ques-
 tion is'not one of customary law and in those traditional
 courts so prescribed in Malawi law statues. Courts are gen-
 erally open to the public and defendants are charged publicly.
 The modern judiciary (High Court and magistrate courts) is
 almost:totally independent of the executive, other than the fact
 that the President appoints the Chief Justice of the High Court
 who, in turn, appoints other modern court justices. Tradition-
 al cOurt justices are all appointed directly by the President;
 hence there is more room, presumably, for executive influence.
 It is generally believed that there is little executive
 interferenice in traditional court cases dealing in matters
 of customary law. There is probably some executive pressure
 applied on traditional courts which are adjudicating cases
 of a political nature, but there is little, if any, evidence
 available to prove this assumption.
 All political cases are not automatically tried in traditional
 court. The decision is made by either the director of public
 prosecution or the attorney general, but the trend, of late,
 is that political cases are likely to wind up before a tradi-
 tional court. There is a right to appeal in both the modern
 and traditional court systems. Trial in military court is
 reserved for violations of military codes of justice.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Under Malawi law, warrants must be obtained before entry of
 the home, and they must be obtained on an individual basis.
 Whether or not this is observed in practice is open to ques-
 tion. There is evidence that police enter houses of real or
 imagined suspects at will under special entry authority to
 conduct searches for people or incriminating evidence. Other
 violations of the home generally do not occur.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Xncluding:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Exercise of these freedoms is restricted in law and practice
 to prohibit any criticism of government officials and policies.
 All media are under direct or indirect government control. The
 state radio network disseminates news directly authorized by
 the government information agencies. The two national news-
 papers operate under informal self-censorship guidelines. Both
 media have shown increasing candor in coverage of international
 
 
 190
 issues over the past two years. In practice the principal focus
 of government censorship is on the proscription of material
 deemed sexually immoral. There also has been increasing liberal-
 ization in the application of censorship controls affecting
 materials for broad public distribution, with more reliance on
 self-policing methods and establishment of broad categories of
 exemption from examination or control. There is freedom of
 inquiry into the natural and social sciences at the university
 level, including examination of political ideologies at radical
 variance with those of the Government, provided this does not
 extend to explicit criticism of the Government. The unwritten
 prohibition against public discussion of certain issues is by *far
 the more serious problem. The issues are fairly clear and univer-
 sally known and include presidential succession, opposition
 political viewpoints, criticism of government organizations
 and/or officials, population control, communism, and violent
 physical assaults on world leaders.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Malawian individuals and organizations are generally free to
 meet and associate as long as the purpose is not to protest
 against government or party policy or practices. Professional,
 fraternal and service organizations exist and are encouraged by
 the Government. No political meetings are permitted other than
 those of the Party. Labor unions exist, but their activities
 are highly circumscribed, and they are generally ineffectual.
 Strikes are not legally prohibited, but they rarely occur and
 when they do they are not publicized. Labor unions are virtual
 appendages of the party, hence, of the Government. The Malawi
 Trade Union Congress is permitted to associate with inter-
 national labor organizations, but such association is conducted
 with the permission and supervision of the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state or preferred religion, and freedom to prac-
 tice one's religious beliefs is permitted as long as particu-
 lar religious tenets do not preclude recognition of the temporal
 authority of the state. There are no restrictions placed on
 religious observances and ceremonies. Conversion from one
 religion to another is permitted, and followers of minority
 religious persuasions are not discriminated against. There was
 repression of adherents of the Jehovah's Witnesses faith in the
 mid-1970's when members were deemed to be engaging in political
 activities. Problems were overcome through mutual accommodation,
 however, and there has been no recurrence of such repression
 since.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 No restrictions have been observed on movement within Malawi
 nor is there significant restriction on travel abroad. How-
 ever, passports have been denied to some persons on political
 grounds. Legal provisions exist for restricting the movement
 of those convicted of criminal or political offenses. Formal
 emigration is not restricted, nor is it encouraged. With the
 exception of a small group of political dissidents, there is no
 outward flow of Malawian refugees from the country. If an
 expatriate was born in Malawi, he or she may return. Citizen-
 ship may, in principle, be revoked, but in practice this is
 not done.
 While Malawi does not accord official status to refugees from
 neighboring countries, it has treated them generously, and has
 pursued a policy of persuading rather than coercing such refugees
 
 
 191
 to return to their own countries. Asian residents and citizens
 are free to travel within the country. Since the late 1970's,
 however, they have been required to reside in one of three urban
 areas (Lilongwe, Zomba, or Blantyre/Limbe). Even within some of
 these urban centers there are strict rules governing where all
 Asians except expatriate ethnic Asians may reside and operate
 businesses. Asian residents (Malawian and non-Malawian citizens
 alike) have been compelled to transfer ownership of specific
 catagories of businesses to ethnic African Malawian citizens.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Malawi is ruled by one man, the Life President, through the
 apparatus of the sole political party and Government which are
 closely linked. No opposition political parties are permitted.
 One must be a Party member to participate in the political life
 of the nation, to be a member of parliament, or to be a civil
 servant. Thus, Malawi's political processes are highly central-
 ized. Nearly half of the population are members, at least
 nominally, of the Party, but active Party membership is obliga-
 tory if one aspires to higher levels of leadership. The perva-
 siveness and broad based structure of the Party does provide for
 some choice among candidates for office. There are nearly always
 at least three candidates standing for election to office, such
 as for a parliamentary seat. All those whose name appear on the
 ballot have been nominated by the appropriate level of the Malawi
 Congress Party and submitted to the President for vetting. Active
 campaigning for election is not permitted. All candidates repre-
 sent the same ideology and must be of the same political persua-
 sion as the nation's leadership. Alternative policies, programs,
 or even outlooks are not tolerated. Elections only permit the
 elector to select among the similar candidates or not to vote.
 The National Assembly (parliament) consists of both "elected" and
 nominated members, the percentage of each fluctuating annually,
 and has little real authority. It is mainly concerned with
 ratifying Government policy. The President determines who will
 serve as a nominated member. There is no difference between the
 powers of those elected or nominated. Women are an integral and
 important part of the Political dynamics, as the women's League
 is a mainstay of the Party. Women members also sit in parliament
 (mostly as nominated members). The Party apparatus serves to
 transmit decisions from on high to the local level, and it func-
 tions as a channel for grass roots opinions to reach decision
 makers. At the local and area level, the Party and Government
 interact closely in virtually all public service activities and
 projects.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Malawi usually avoids participation in international human rights
 bodies. In 1980 the Malawi Government responded to a long stand-
 ing complaint lodged with the UN Human Rights Commission concern-
 ing the persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses by rejecting the char-
 ges. No futher complaints have been placed with the UNHRC since.
 Since the capture of Malawian dissident Orton Chirwa, his wife,
 and son in late 1981, human rights groups from abroad have con-
 tacted governments which aee represented at the diplomatic level
 in Lilongwe to ensure that the Chirwas are accorded due process.
 The government's response has been publicly non-committal. How-
 ever, there has been virtually no communication between government
 and external non-governmental human rights groups, nor have such
 groups been permitted to visit Malawi. Internally, there are no
 organizations or formal groups which are dedicated per se to the
 protection of individual liberties, nor would such groups be
 allowed to exist. In its 1982 report, Amnesty International
 
 
 192
 continued to express concern about the use of detention without
 trial and the lack of effective safeguards against ill-treatment
 of political detainees.
 4. Economic, Social and Cultural Situation
 Malawi has a de facto mixed economy. There is heavy state in-
 volvement in key sectors of the economy, largely caused by in-
 sufficient indigenous private capital and an absence of inerests
 by foreign investors. The upward trend in Malawi's economy
 from the time of independence in 1964 until the late 1970's
 has leveled off in the past three years. Per capita gross
 domestic product (GDP) grew from $180 in 1964 to $234 today,
 but has actually declined in real terms in the last three years.
 The economy is predominately agricultural. The inflation rate
 reached 13 percent in 1981 and has remained high since then.
 Numerous factors, both domestic and international, have contri-
 buted to a deterioration in the nation's terms of trade. Prices
 have fallen for Malawi's principal exports (tobacco, sugar, and
 tea), while import prices (most importantly for petroleum pro-
 ducts) have escalated. Two successive years of adverse weather
 conditions and crop disease in 1982 have resulted in poor
 harvests of staple food crops. Disruptions of transport routes
 through Mozambique (Malawi's lifeline to the sea) also have
 occurred. The short term economic outlook is dim. Current
 account deficits are estimated to exceed $150 million annually
 through the mid 1980's, and the balance of payments deficit
 will continue to be around $30-$40 million a year.
 The Government's development efforts since independence have
 focused on economic gropth with equity: emphasis has been on
 alleviation of rural poverty by increasing agricultural produc-
 tivity. Education and, more recently, health, come next in
 Malawian priorities. In 1979 academic enrollment increased
 dramatically: 10.4 percent in primary schools; six percent in
 secondary schools; and 20 percent at the university level.
 While strides in the educational area have been significant
 (there were nearly 800,000 students attending schools in Malawi
 in 1979 of a total national population of about six million),
 severe problems remain as the literacy rate is still only 25
 percent, and spaces in secondary schools are available for
 only 10 percent of those eligible from primary school.
 Government expenditures for health, water, education, and hous-
 ing relative to other budget items have remained low. In the
 1970's nearly nine percent of the budget was allocated for these
 sectors, and during the period from 1978/79 to 1980 it was eight
 percent. Health and life expectancy in Malawi are below average
 relative to other Sub-Saharan African countries. Life expectancy
 at birth is now 44.2 years (up from 38.5 years in 1968), reflect-
 ing only a marginal improvement in a decade. The infant mortali-
 ty rate at 171.9 per 1,000 live births is about 20 percent higher
 than the Sub-Saharan average. The crude birth rate is 52 live
 births per 1,000 population -- one of the highest in Africa.
 Average annual calorie intake of 100 percent of requirements is
 higher than the continental average. Thirty-three percent of the
 population had access to safe drinking water (70 percent in urban
 areas) in 1979, but this is expected to increase to over 80 per-
 cent by 1986. Malawi had the third highest number of persons
 per physician of the nations of sub-Saharan Africa.
 Malawi enjoys a considerable degree of ethnic and linguistic uni-
 formity. While ethnic and regional differences do exist, they
 have not been a disruptive element within the society. Over 75
 percent of the population speaks and/or understands Chichewa, the
 
 
 193
 language of the Chewa and Nyanja. In 1968 Chichewa became the
 national language of Malawi. English is the official language
 for government and business. Malawi's indigenous groups are
 sufficiently alike in culture and social organization to permit
 relatively easy interaction, including intermarriage, mixing in
 agricultural settlements, and mixed grouping for political
 purposes.
