 BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a multiparty democracy. The Constitution vests
 executive power in the President, currently Quett Masire, who
 was reelected in 1989 for a second 5-year term. The President
 selects his Cabinet from members of the National Assembly.
 While there are several active political parties in Botswana,
 in-practice the- country's politics are dominated by the
 governing Botswana Democratic Party (BDP). All citizens,
 regardless of race, are free to participate fully in the
 economic and political life of the country.
 Botswana's military, the Botswana Defense Force (BDF), numbers
 about 6,500 soldiers. The Botswana National Police (BNP)
 numbers about 3,00U. Both the BDF and BNP are subordinate to
 civilian authority. Episodes of soldiers firing on civilians
 appear to have been effectively halted by new "rules of
 engagement" promulgated last jear. The trial of military
 personnel accused of shooting civilians in 1988 and 1990
 resulted in the conviction of one soldier, the acquittal of
 another, and a $400,0af judgment against the BDF.
 Botswana's economy is market oriented with strong encouragement
 for private enterprise. Spurked by diamond revenues, the
 country's economy has expanded rapidly, with real gross
 domestic product (GDP) growth averaging nearly 9 percent
 annually since 1980. Since independence in 1966, per capita
 GDP has increased from $69 to a current figure of about
 $2,400. However, more than 50 percent of the population lives-
 outside the formal sector, gaining its livelihood from
 subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Income distribution
 is heavily skewed, with the top 20 percent of the population
 probably earning two-thirds of the total income, with the
 bottom 50 percent earning less than one sixth.
 Botswana's laws and. legal system provide for a broad range of
 individual rights and freedoms, which are widely observed in
 practice. However, women face significant legal and practical
 discrimination, and public consciousness of the problem of
 violence against women is growing. There have been some past
 reports of police beatings of detainees, but none in 1991-
 Labor conditions are generally good (iven the level of economic
 development, although trade unions continue to face certain
 legal restrictions-
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedo- from:
 a. Political and-other extrajudicial killing
 There were no reports of such killings-.
 b- Disappearance
 There have been no reports of politically motivated
 disappearances since Botswana's independence 25 years ago.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 In the past, there have been credible reports of police
 beatings of suspects and detainees, which were condemned by
 government officials. Police officers found to have abused
 suspects are subject to both internal disciplinary procedures
 and criminal prosecution.

 BOTSWANA
 No cases have been reported of women being raped or subjected
 to other abuses while in custody. Arrested women are
 immediately placed in the charge of matrons, reducing the
 potential for mistreatment by male police officers.
 Caning is allowed for certain offenses for men below age 40.
 Strict conditions regulate the size of the cane, require
 medical examinations of the prisoner before and after
 punishment, and prescribe strokes only across the buttocks. A
 recent High Court opinion disallows corporal punishment for
 children below 14 which, however, under the rubric of
 "traditional punishment," can still be meted out by parents and
 village headmen.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Citizens are protected from arbitrary arrest under the
 Constitution. An arresting officer must clearly inform the
 person being arrested of the charges and of the right to remain
 silent. An accused person may contact anyone of his choosing.
 In most cases, a suspect must be charged before a magistrate
 within 48 hours of arrest. Bail is allowed, and detainees have
 the right to hire attorneys of their choice. Poor
 communications in rural villages, however, make it difficult
 for detainees to obtain legal assistance. There is no public
 defender service for those unable to afford a lawyer.
 Once a suspect has appeared before a magistrate, he or she may
 be detained only if the magistrate issues a writ of detention,
 valid for 14 days and renewable every 14 days thereafter.
 There have been complaints, including in 1991, that police and
 rangers from the Department of Wildlife have held people
 accused of poaching longer than the prescribed 48 hours.
 Offending police officers have been administratively punished
 or sued successfully in civil actions.
 These restrictions on detention do not apply to illegal
 immigrants (mostly Zimbabweans or Zambians); there are perhaps
 200 to 300 such persons per year. These illegal immigrants are
 usually found in periodic sweeps by the police and deported
 after being held for up to 2 weeks. Botswana's Constitution
 allows the President to declare a person a "prohibited
 immigrant" and order deportation, but this provision has seldom
 been used. No explanation is required nor is any normally
 given, and the order is not subject to judicial review. A
 prohibited immigrant can reenter Botswana only with
 presidential authorization. There was one such case in. 1991,
 but the deportee was not named publicly.
 Persons charged under the National Security Act (NSA) must be
 arraigned before a magistrate within 96 hours, and suspects may
 be held indefinitely. However, this Act has rarely been
 invoked. Security cases are often tried under ordinary
 criminal procedures after an initial hearing.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Botswana's judiciary is independent of the executive and
 legislative branches of government in both law and practice.
 Botswana has two court systems, the regular courts and the
 customary (traditional) courts. In the regular courts, a
 defendant's right to due process is provided for by law and
 largely honored in practice, although many defendants are not
 apprised of their rights in pretrial or trial proceedings.
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 Most trials are held in public, and court records are public.
 However, trials under the National Security Act may be held in
 secret. As a rule, courts appoint public defenders only for
 those charged with capital crimes (murder and treason);
 lawyers in these cases serve on a no fee basis. Thus, those
 charged with noncapital crimes are often tried without legal
 representation if they cannot afford an attorney. However,
 defendants may confront witnesses and present evidence.
 Customary courts usually handle land, marital, and property
 disputes as well as minor crimes.' There are clearly defined
 appeal procedures with separate courts of appeal in both
 systems, as well as the possibility of appeals to the High
 Court. Customary courts are open only to members of the tribe
 served by the particular court. The tribal chief presides over
 the court, and there are no attorneys for either side.
 There were no political prisoners reported in Botswana in 1991.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 These rights are safeguarded by law, and privacy in family
 matters is respected. Court-issued search warrants are
 required, but police officers of the rank of sergeant and above
 can enter, search, and seize property provided they believe "on
 reasonable grounds" that criminal- activity is involved, that
 evidence would be lost or compromised by waiting for a warrant,
 and that the evidence is later brought before a magistrate. In
 practice, this means that seizures of property are frequently
 made'without resort to search warrants. Evidence gained
 without a warrant is admissible in court. Judges can
 disqualify such evidence if it can be shown that it would not
 likely have bee- compromised-by taking the time to obtain a
 proper warrant. There is no evidence of arbitrary or illegal
 surveillance of persons or their communications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Includingz
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are provided for in- the
 Constitution -and respected'in- practice. Opposition viewpoints
 and criticism of the Government are freely expressed. However,
 both the government media and the independent press follow
 unwritten rules against criticizing senior officials directly
 or-discussing the personal lives or financial affairs of
 important figures.
 Although the Botswana Press Agency (BOPAX is part of the-
 Department of Information and Broadcasting, it functions witha
 great deal of autonomy, and its editorials do not always
 reflect the Government's view. The Government's daily
 newspaper, made available free of charge, consists largely of
 reports-of speeches of ministers and-other high officials and
 international wire service stories.
 While opposition parties' activities receive adequate press
 coverage, the government media tend to give more space to
 ruling party viewpoints, and the independent press tends to
 present more balanced coverage. In the past, the Government
 has clashed'with the independent press over the proper
 reporting of national security issues. Books and publications
 are not censored. Academic freedom is fully respected,
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 although a proposed new law would restrict the right of
 university students to conduct protests on campus.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Botswana has a long history of peaceful assembly which is
 integral to traditional village life and is exemplified in the
 village meeting, the kgotla. During kgotla meetings, men
 freely question leaders and voice opinions on local politics.
 Women do not typically speak out at kgotla. Permits are
 required for public meetings and demonstrations and are usually
 granted as long as the police believe public order will be
 maintained.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed. There is no state religion,
 although the majority of the population identify with some
 denomination of Christianity. Hindu, Muslim, and Baha'i groups
 practice their faiths freely. There are no restrictions on
 places of worship, the training of members of clergy, religious
 publishing, religious education, conversion or participation in
 charitable activity. There are no restrictions against
 missionaries or foreign clergy. There is no discrimination
 based on religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Botswana has no restrictions on movement within the country.
 foreign travel, emigration, or the right to return. Passports
 are easily obtained.
 Refugees documented by the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) are readily accepted into Botswana but are
 normally required to live in the refugee settlement at Dukwe,
 in northeastern Botswana, although the Government may authorize
 them to live elsewhere. Due to past allegations from
 neighboring countries that refugees were using Botswana as a
 launching area for subversive operations beyond Botswana's
 borders, refugees found out of their authorized living areas
 can be declared by the Government to have abandoned their
 refugee status and be deported to neighboring countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Batswana have the right to peacefully change their government
 through democratic means, although in practice one party, the
 Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), has dominated Parliament since
 independence 25 years ago. Members of Parliament are elected
 by universal suffrage and secret ballot; the President is
 elected by the Parliament. Thirty-four of the 38 members of
 the National Assembly are elected every 5 years; the remaining
 4 are appointed by the President. In the 1989 elections, the
 BDP won 31 of the 34 elective seats. There are currently eight
 active political parties, but only two, the BDP and Botswana
 National Front (BNF) are represented in Parliament.
 Women and minorities legally have the same political rights as
 everyone else. Even though the traditional patriarchal society
 has discouraged women from taking part in politics, women vote
 in greater numbers than men, and the numSer of positions held
 by women in various institutions is increasing. Women hold
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 about 40 percent of the seats in local and district councils,
 and there are two women in Parliament, one of whom is the
 Minister of'External Affairs. There are a number of female
 senior lecturers at the university, but as yet few females of
 professorial rank..
 Section 4 Government Attitude Toward International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups operate freely. Organized in 1989,
 the Botswana Association for Human Rights expects its official
 registration- as a nonprofit organization to be completed by the
 end of the year. The goals of the association are- to focus
 natiohal attention on laws needing reform, to make
 recommendations to the National Law Reform Committee, to
 heighten public awareness about.human rights, and to pressure
 the Government to ratify more of the existing international
 human rights instruments. Independent organizations dealing
 with the rights of women and rural dwellers also exist.
 The Government also permits international organizations
 involved in human rights advocacy to operate in Botswana,
 including the International Committee of the Red Cross, the
 UNHCR, the International Labor Organization (ILO), and others.
 To date, there have been no international investigations of
 human rights violations in Botswana. The Government has stated
 that it would cooperate if there were such-an investigation.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Tswana majority, comprising about 65 percent of the
 population, has a tradition of peacefully coexisting with the
 largest minority, the Kalanga, which constitutes 25 percent of
 the population. Although ethnic rivalries are not entirely
 absent, no ethnic group suffers from serious discrimination.
 The most prominent complaint comes from the Government's
 refusal to allow instruction in minority languages in schools,
 Groups living 'In remote areas, including the Kqalagadi7 and the
 San Cthe BushmenY, have suffered discrimination in the past in.
 access to government services and legal redress, partly because
 of their distance from settled areas and their nomadic
 lifestyle. They are still poorly represented in politics, but
 some are being resettled and are gaining better access to
 government services.
 The Constitution and Penal Code forbid discrimination basect on
 color, race, nationality or creed but do not mention
 discrimination based on sex  However, a number of laws and
 customs have the effect of restricting political,'social, and'
 economic opportunities for women- For example, women married
 under the "in common property" concept become legal minors.
 This means that a married woman may not purchase or sell
 property, or make other legally binding agreements without her
 husband's consent. While a woman may enter a binding
 transaction as a public trader, she may become a trader only
 with her husband's consent. Under customary law a husband may
 have additional wives after consulting with his first wife and
 the families, although this practice is dying out.
 Marriage license applications are increasingly accompanied by
 explanations of marriage "out of common property" under which a
 woman retains the property she brings to a marriage as well as
 
 
 22.
 
 BOTSWANA
 full adult legal standing after marriage. Although frowned
 upon by more traditional families, these marriages are
 increasingly common.
 A woman is required to obtain her husband's permission for the
 use of contraceptives or for operations to prevent conception.
 Under 1991 legislation, abortion is allowed in cases of rape,
 incest, when the physical or mental health of a mother is
 threatened, or when a child will suffer grave physical or
 mental abnormalities. Two physicians must agree that the
 health of the mother or child is threatened. If the health of
 a married couple's child is at risk, or the mother is an unwed
 minot, abortion is a family decision. Otherwise, the law does
 not require the consent of the husband or father.
 The Attorney General maintains that women have no legal
 recourse in sex discrimination cases. However, the recent case
 of a female attorney who challenged the Citizenship Act on
 discrimination grounds was decided in favor of the.plaintiff.
 She held that the law discriminated against her by preventing
 her from transmitting Botswana citizenship to her children
 since her husband, the children's father, was not a Botswana
 citizen. The State has appealed the case, arguing that the
 authors of the Constitution did not intend to outlaw
 discrimination based on sex. A long list of laws would have to
 be changed if the decision stands.
 Inheritance laws and customs call for each child to receive a
 share of an estate regardless of sex. The oldest male child
 receives a larger share but is responsible for his widowed
 mother and minor siblings.
 Domestic violence against women is on the increase as Botswana
 society becomes more urban and people live away from constant
 contact with the extended family. Men have traditionally had
 the right physically to "chastise" their wives, although this
 is changing. Since marital problems are considered a problem
 to be dealt with between husband and wife, the police are
 reluctant to intervene. Problems are still frequently settled
 by the extended family, with fully 75 percent of the cases of
 domestic violence brought to police attention withdrawn because
 of family pressure. As a conseqence of these factors, no
 accurate statistics exist on the extent of domestic violence.
 The incidence of rape has grown, with increased depersonalized
 urbanization as a major factor, although increased reporting
 should not be discounted. The maximum penalty is life
 imprisonment with mandatory corporal punishment; the average
 sentence is 4 years with corporal punishment. A form of female
 circumcision exists in Botswana, but it is rarely performed and
 only by a few traditional doctors.
 Concerted government action to improve the status of women has
 been slow in coming. In .1981 the Ministry of Home Affairs
 established a women's affairs unit which published a woman's
 guide to the law and information on the citizenship law. It
 has also done research on such subjects as maternity leave and
 teenage pregnancy. The majority party (the BDP) established a
 women's wing to focus on women's issues in 1987.
 There is no evidence of particular jobs being reserved for
 men. Women are highly visible in the professions, commerce,
 and as laborers, and women s organizations are growing in
 number. The most active group is Emang Basadi, which seeks to
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 educate women about their rights, argues for the enforcement of
 fathers'- obligations to support their children, and argues for
 day care in institutions that employ large numbers of women,
 like the National University and banks. In addition, numerous
 local women's-groups are organized for self-help.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers (except for pensionable-government workers) are free to
 establish or join labor unions. Government workers may form
 associations which function as-quasi-unions. Unions are well
 developed in mining, railways, banking, and among government
 manual workers. There is one major confederation of trade
 unions, the Botswana Federation of Trade Unions (BFTU). Trade
 unions in Botswana are independent of government control or
 party affiliation-and actively seek to represent their members'
 interests. Unions'may employ'administrative staff, but
 Botswana law requires elected union officials to work full time
 in the industry the union represents. This severely limits
 union leaders-effectiveness and has been criticized by the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).
 In addition, the law severely restricts'the right, to strike.
 Legal.strikes are theoretically possible after an-exhaustive
 arbitration process, but there has never'been a legal strike.
 There were three. notable wildcat strikes in 1991 in the mining
 sector., Managemenft maintained that all three were illegal, and
 all were settled.peacefully (but with few gains for the
 strikersY. In November unskilled and semiskilled government
 workers struck for 1 week over long-standing wage demands. All
 workers returned to their jobs without winning salary
 increases, and the Government is pursuing legal actions against
 the strike organizers for not following procedures stipulated
 by the Labor Code.
 Unions 'may freely join international organizations, and labor
 representatives regularly attend international conferences.
 Discussions continued in 1991 between government, employers,
 and trade unions over reform of labor laws. Umions say that
 elected officials. should be able to serve members.' needs full
 time. Unions are also asking for severance pay greater than
 the usual 2 months' pay. Finally, unions want restrictions on
 the Labor Commissioner's right to attend BFTU mbetings..
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colldctively
 Although. employers are required under the Trade Union Act to
 bargain with any trade union that organizes at least 25 percent
 of the work f6rce in a given industry, the union's ability to
 demand collective.bargaining depends on its overall strength.
 Collective. bargaining is common in the mining sector,,where
 trade uhibns',are' -relatively str6ng', but is virtually
 nonexistentt ih most others.
 Public sector salaries are set by the Government and formerly
 served as a benchmark for private sector wages. However,
 Parliament voided that policy in 1990, and pay raises and
 inflation indexing must now be negotiated separately in the
 private sector. In early 1991 government employees received
 raises ranging from 13 percent at the lowest levels to 90
 percent at executive levels.
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 Although the law prohibits employers from dismissing workers
 for union activities, there is disagreement over how well they
 are enforced. Other reasons are often given for dismissals so
 it is difficult for dismissed employees to prove that union
 activities were the real reason. Dismissals may be appealed to
 labor officers or civil courts, but labor officers rarely do
 much more than order 2 months' severance pay. Labor law
 practice in Botswana's only export processing zone, in
 Selebi-Phikwe, is the same as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is not practiced in Botswana and is
 specifically forbidden by the Constitution.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Botswana law prohibits the employment of children 12 years of
 age and under by anyone except members of the child's immediate
 family. No one under the age of 15 may be employed in any
 industry, and only persons over 16 may be employed in night
 work. No person 16 or younger is permitted to work in
 hazardous jobs, including mining. Botswana law also protects
 young people from recruiters for jobs outside the country.
 Scattered violations of age standards occur in small-scale and
 family enterprises and in the informal sector. The Department
 of Labor is insufficiently staffed to enforce full compliance.
 Although education is not compulsory, it is almost universally
 available, and most children attend school at least through the
 seventh grade. The Government is rapidly making 9 years of
 free public education universally available.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum monthly wages are established by law for all but
 agricultural and domestic workers. The level varies by
 industry, and the lowest minimum is barely adequate for one
 person to maintain a decent standard of living in an urban
 environment. In most cases, workers must supplement this with
 a second job or subsistence farming. Most families have more
 than one wage earner.
 The law mandates a maximum 48-hour workweek with provisions for
 overtime pay (time and a half) for more than 48 hours. Most
 major employers use the standard workweek, but some smaller
 firms refuse to pay overtime, and action is seldom taken
 against them. The Government establishes basic job health and
 safety standards. Most industries adhere to the standards,
 although compliance by construction firms is sometimes lax.
 Nevertheless, industrial accident rates are not high on the
 whole. While workers who complain about hazardous conditions
 have legal protection from dismissal, application of this
 enforcement has been uneven. Enforcement of safety standards,
 which is divided between the Departments of Labor and Mines and
 the Ministry of Health, has been hampered by inadequate
 staffing.
