 BURUNDI
 Burundi is a one-party state dominated by President Jean-
 Baptiste Bagaza, an army colonel, who is assisted in governing
 by the party's Central Committee and a Council of Ministers.
 He came to power in 1976 through a bloodless military coup
 in which he led a group of young military officers in
 ousting a military government considered by many to be both
 incompetent and tainted by serious human rights violations.
 While the military continues to play a dominant role in the
 Government, Bagaza has reduced their direct influence by
 steering the country toward essentially civilian governing
 institutions and appointing civilians to key government
 positions. A few military officers remain in high positions.
 Since the proclamation of the *Second Republic" in 1976, the
 National Party for Unity and Progress (UPRONA) has gradually
 emerged under Bagaza as the most important political institu-
 tion in Burundi. As president of the party, Bagaza has
 predominant influence. The party formulates policies which
 are executed by the President and his Council of Ministers,
 some of whom are also party leaders. As head of the Government,
 Bagaza has the executive power to appoint and dismiss the
 members of his Council of Ministers. Under the Constitution
 adopted by referendum in 1981, the President also exercises
 legislative powers and appoints and dismisses judges. The
 armed forces maintain law and order and the Government
 monitors dissent through informers.
 Following an hiatus of 17 years, the National Assembly was
 reestablished in late 1982. While the Constitution also
 extends legislative power to the National Assembly, to date
 it has not initiated any legislation of its own except for
 amending a few laws submitted by the executive branch.
 Although it is the newest and least influential governmental
 institution in Burundi, in its first session it rejected a
 tax measure proposed by the Government and has promise of
 evolving into more than a rubber-stamp institution. While
 there are multi-candidate elections in both the party and
 the National Assembly, all candidates must be approved in
 advance by the party.
 The population of Burundi share a common language and
 cultural heritage, and is divided into two ethnic groups:
 the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi. The Tutsi historically
 dominated the Hutu through a quasi-feudal system of chieftain-
 ships and land ownership. This dominance continues today
 through control of modern emerging social and governmental
 institutions.
 The Second Republic has tried to relieve ethnic tensions by
 opening party institutions to all Burundi and appointing
 Hutus to all levels of the Government, including ministerial
 positions. While social and cultural discrimination exists,
 there is no evidence of government sanctioned discrimination
 against Butus and they are not persecuted. As their situation
 has improved, large numbers of Hutus who fled during the 1972
 massacres are returning from their refuge abroad and are re-
 integrating into national life. Burundi remains a very
 poor country and most of its citizens earn a livelihood as
 (46)
 
 
 subsistence farmers on their privately-owned plots. A
 continued high fertility rate diminishes the gains made in
 food production and economic growth. Women are still
 second-class citizens but government laws and practices are
 improving their status.
 While there have been no reports of serious abuse in 1983
 of the right to be free from governmental violations of the
 integrity of the person, basic civil and political rights
 are severely restricted. The right of citizens to change their
 government is denied and only within the party structure is
 it possible to play any political role.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There are no indications or allegations of killings for political
 motives or of summary executions.
 b. Disappearance
 No instances of disappearances have been reported or alleged
 this year. Relatives or consular representatives are made
 aware of arrests or detentions.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by law. However, cruel treatment of
 suspects or detainees, in the form of beatings at the time
 of arrest or interrogation, does occur. Such treatment is
 generally limited to cases where the accused is arrested in
 connection with violent crimes or resisting arrest.
 Prison conditions are severe due to lack of adequate hygiene,
 medical care, and food. During 1983 an effort has been made
 by the Government, with assistance from the International
 Committee of the Red Cross, to improve the physical conditions
 of prisons. Prisoners are segregated according to the nature
 of their crimes, are allowed regular family visits, and
 participate in rehabilitory work programs. The Government
 admits that individual instances of abuse of prisoners by
 prison guards or officials do occur but insists that those
 responsible for such abuses have been punished. For example,
 the daily newspaper published the arrest and incarceration of
 two police officers accused of assaulting and torturing a
 detainee.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Suspects caught in the commission of a crime are immediately
 detained. Otherwise arrests occur with the service of a
 warrant. Charges must be formally stated by a public prosecutor
 in the presence of the detainee within five days of arrest
 after which a magistrate issues an order, based on the nature
 
 
 48
 of the crime and likelihood of the defendant's attempting
 flight, to incarcerate or release the defendant pending trial.
 Bail is known only in cases of embezzlement. The standards of
 arrest and imprisonment are not always upheld, as is made clear
 from a series of articles in the local press covering the sup-
 pression of crime. In these articles, high court magistrates
 are quoted as addressing meetings of judicial officials on the
 need to adhere to the legal principles as a means of ensuring
 prompt and just punishment of criminals. The essence of the
 complaint is that too many criminals go free or unpunished be-
 cause of failure to apply the legal provisions.
 The state also has the power to place individuals in preventive
 detention, for a period not to exceed 30 days, in cases
 involving a threat to the security of the State. A judicial
 review of preventive detention is mandatory. There are
 credible allegations of individuals being detained and
 questioned by State Security personnel for expression of
 views hostile or critical of the Government. Such detention
 involves mostly government personnel or influential private
 citizens. Reports of this type of detention lasting longer
 than the legal period are infrequent and cannot be verified.
 In the one or two known cases where a detention extended
 beyond the legal period, the detainee was subsequently
 charged with violations of civil law.
 Exile of nationals does not take place on a de jure basis.
 There are a number of cases where individuals prefer to
 continue residing outside of Burundi after leaving as
 refugees or political opponents of the Government. Citizens
 of neighboring countries suspected of criminal activity and
 lacking proper residency documents are expelled.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under the Constitution of Burundi, the judiciary does not
 operate as a separate, independent branch of government.
 While there is a certain degree of autonomy in the day-to-day
 administration of justice through the courts and the Consti-
 tution states that the President guarantees the independence
 of the courts and tribunals, there are understood limits to
 that independence. For example, in addition to appointing
 judges, the President has the power to dismiss judges. The
 Government's Ministry of Justice, i.e. the executive branch,
 held a seminar in 1983 to explain the role of the judiciary
 to judges and magistrates. The Minister of Justice explained
 that judges must follow the instructions and recommendations of
 the party, the Government, and the President. He also noted
 that while judges have substantial powers, that the Government
 will never tolerate badly rendered judgments and arrests.
 Judicial authorities are expected to complement and cooperate
 with the pursuit of *common objectives" as defined by the
 party.
 Burundi has three separate court systems to deal with civil/
 criminal, military, and state security cases. Military tribunals
 handle only military personnel. The State Security Court has a
 mandate which would allow it jurisdiction over both civilian and
 military personnel and which provides that its proceedings need
 not be made public. To date, this court has not been used.
 
 
 The Burundi system of criminal justice is patterned along
 European inquisitorial models whereby the question of the guilt
 of an accused offender is often virtually resolved during the
 pretrial proceedings which may involve lengthy investigations.
 At the pretrial stage, the Government generally dismisses cases
 where the charges are weak or unsubstantiated and proceeds to
 trial when it believes guilt has been established. By this stage,
 the defendant has usually already admitted his guilt and hence
 trials tend to be short. Burundi law provides a right to legal
 counsel and indigents are defended by the state. Although due
 process is largely observed, the functioning of the system is
 hampered by the lack of legally trained personnel and the heavy
 case load. A body of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals,
 hears appeals from the lower courts. The verdict of the Supreme
 Court is final with the exception of the President's right to
 pardon all cases. There is no right to appeal in a case tried by
 the State Security Court. There are no verified cases of purely
 political prisoners, although one such case has been alleged.
 There are a very few (three or four) prisoners who were initially
 detained for political activities hostile to the Government.
 However, those prisoners were subsequently charged with, tried
 for, and found guilty of civil offenses, usually embezzlement or
 corrupt practices.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Citizens are not forced to become members of any organization.
 Membership in the political party and its affiliated organiza-
 tions is open to all but not required. The Government does
 undertake general monitoring of dissent. Paid informers of
 the State Security Office report on discontent and dissension
 as well as criminal activity.    Public dissent is not allowed
 outside of party meetings. The security system is mostly
 concerned with potential violence against the Government.
 The right to privacy of correspondence and the inviolability
 of the home are guaranteed in the Constitution. A judicial
 warrant is required for a law enforcement official to enter
 and search a search a private residence. There are no
 reports of violations. There is no information available
 concerning the monitoring of correspondence.
 Section 2   Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government controls all domestic publications and
 broadcast media. The French language daily and the Kirundi
 language weekly are published by the Ministry of Information,
 which also runs the domestic radio stations. The media are
 required to defend the fundamental policies of the party and
 the Government. Some criticism of government mismanagement
 and secondary aspects of policies is permitted in the
 printed press but not on radio. Journalists are    state
 employees and as such would be subject to disciplinary
 action if their criticism went beyond what is considered
 tolerable. There is no television station. Since 1980
 private ownership of television, used by Burundi nationals
 
 
 50
 to receive telecasts from Zaire, has been prohibited.
 Normally there is no interference with the distribution of
 foreign news publications. Foreign films are subject to
 censorship usually confined to sexually explicit material.
 There are limits to academic freedom in Burundi's education
 system. At the primary and secondary school, teachers are
 expected to support government policies. At the university
 level, professors come from several countries and are
 permitted to lecture freely in their subject areas. However,
 the Government encourages conformity and unity in civic edu-
 cation at the university in the name of national development.
 Freedom of speech is limited by statute. Criticism of the
 party and government policies or leadership is allowed only
 within party meetings.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The express authorization of the Government is required for
 all political meetings or speakers. This effectively
 guarantees government control of all public fora and limits
 freedom of association to participation in the party or its
 affiliated youth, labor, or women's movements.
 The party controls the labor union. The principal roles of
 the union, to which virtually the entire salaried work
 force belongs, are to educate its rank and file regarding
 their legal protections and serve as a mediator between
 workers and employers. However, during 1983, the union
 clearly showed a degree of independence by proceeding with
 the election of its national leadership in a manner not
 approved by the party. The issue was over secret or open
 balloting and ended in a compromise, which was claimed as
 a victory by those opposed to party dominance. The union
 is also free to maintain links with international labor
 organizations, among them, the African American Labor
 Center and the International Labor Organization.
 Article 230 of the labor code recognizes the rights of
 workers in the private sector to strike if the majority so
 desire and on condition that the employer receive a six day
 notice. The article further states that workers in strategic
 industries cannot strike. Article 10 of the civil code
 denies government employees the right to strike. The right
 to strike is limited in practice because the definition of
 .strategic' industry is left to the Government and because
 the labor union is integrated within the party structure.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Burundi is a secular state and freedom of religion is
 respected with the exception of the Jehovah's Witnesses.
 The Jehovah's Witness group is seen as being under foreign
 control and its doctrine is considered dangerous to society
 since it challenges the precepts of civil authority, such as
 military service, and hence is perceived as a direct challenge
 to the legitimacy of the Government. Religious beliefs do
 not exclude individuals from political participation or
 
 
 51
 social benefits. The Government, however, has made it
 clear that churches must confine their activities to religion
 and social works and stay out of political matters, which
 includes Hutu/Tutsi relations. In the past, large numbers
 of missionaries have been expelled for political reasons.
 This year the Government expelled two missionaries and
 refused to extend the residence permits of seven other
 Catholic missionaries, in effect expelling them. Although
 the Government gave no reasons for these recent expulsions,
 possible explanations would be traditional church-state
 rivalry, personality conflicts, and irritation with the
 missionaries' outspokenness on social and political issues.
 The Government has not prevented the replacement of expelled
 missionaries nor has it refused new arrivals. The Government
 has also ordered that religious groups meet only in designated
 churches, temples, or mosques. Access to the media has
 been curtailed with the long-standing suspension of a
 Catholic newspaper and of religious broadcasts on the radio.
 There are no barriers to the training of clergy or to
 maintenance of links with religious hierarchies or groups in
 other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement is generally free within Burundi, although government
 policies discourage migration to the cities. There is
 no curfew or system of internal pass controls. Foreign
 travel and emigration are relatively free. However, the
 Government requires exit visas as well as passports.
 Occasionally the Government withholds these documents
 without explanation. One particular politically motivated
 case in 1983 was the Government's lengthy delay in allowing
 the family of a Burundi national employed by the United
 Nations to rejoin him outside the country after their visit
 to Burundi.
 Burundi's refugee and asylum practices are humane and coopera-
 tion with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees is
 close. The country's estimated 70,000 refugees, primarily
 Tutsis of Rwandan origin who fled to Burundi in the early
 1960's, have mostly been settled although they are not very
 often awarded citizenship. Refugees from Burundi are
 returning in increasing numbers and have full rights as
 citizens.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 In practice, this right is suppressed by the present Government.
 The Constitution allows the existence of only one political
 party, the National Party for Unity and Progress. Only the
 president of the party may be the sole candidate for President
 of the Republic. Power resides primarily with the President,
 Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, and with the party Central Committee.
 The party is open to all Burundians who profess allegiance
 to its principles. The Government claims membership by over
 half the adult population. The party regularly holds
 
 
 congresses at the local and regional levels where members
 can discuss issues, raise new topics of concern, and make
 recommendations. While there are multiple candidates for
 official positions in the party, balloting is generally not
 secret. The party's first National Congress was held in
 1979. The vast majority of representatives at that National
 Congress were civilians elected at the local level, but
 there were also pre-selected representatives of the youth,
 labor, and women's movements and several representatives of
 the armed forces. The National Congress, in addition to
 defining fundamental orientations, "elected" through
 a referendum the party president in 1979 through secret
 balloting in which Bagaza, the only candidate, received 99.5
 percent affirmative votes. While failure to gain a 50
 percent approval means the party must select a new president,
 Bagaza is again expected to be confirmed as the party leader
 at the next National Congress scheduled for 1984/85.
 The Central Committee is the controlling organ of the
 party between National Congresses. The Central Committee
 consists of 49 members, 15 of whom are appointed by the
 President with the remainder elected by the National Congress
 or by the affiliated movements. There were two candidates for
 each of the elective seats on the Central Committee. The party
 President appoints a Political Bureau from the Central
 Committee membership. The membership of the Central Committee
 includes Hutus and women.
 The Constitution also provides for a National Assembly, which
 came into being in 1982 with a five-year mandate. Four-fifths of
 the 65 representatives are voted for by secret ballot under
 universal adult suffrage and the remainder are appointed by the
 President. The National Assembly is empowered to levy taxes,
 approve the national budget, and enact legislation in the areas of
 government organization, property and civil rights, labor matters,
 and individual rights and obligations. The National Assembly's
 composition was drawn from a list of candidates preselected by
 provincial electoral colleges, composed of party and government
 officials, and approved by the Political Bureau. Two candidates
 for each elective seat were permitted. Although these political
 exercises are controlled by the Government and designed to pre-
 serve its rule, secret balloting was respected in the
 National Assembly "election" as several leading party
 members and high government officials failed to win seats.
 During the 1983 sessions of the National Assembly, represen-
 tatives exercised limited legislative powers. Most of the
 laws introduced by the Government were ultimately approved
 unanimously, although the representatives rejected the
 government proposal for a health care law. The Government
 agreed to withdraw and redraft its proposed statute taking
 into account the National Assembly's recommendations. The
 National Assembly also amended the proposals for a municipal
 land tax and rental tax .before passing the legislation. As
 with the other governmental institutions, however, the
 National Assembly is not intended to be a separate and
 independent power but is expected to cooperate and complement
 the other constitutional institutions.
 Although the military is still represented in all the party
 organs and in the Government, its role has declined since
 
 
 53
 1979 when the party Central Committee replaced the Supreme
 Revolutionary Council of 29 officers which had ruled since
 1976. Only three military officers are currently cabinet
 members. Voters under the present Constitution can only
 express disatisfaction by sending incumbents down to defeat.
 Section 4   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Burundi is a party to the Organization of African Unity and
 United Nations covenants on human rights and its constitution
 provides for the protection of these rights.
 In 1983 there were no reports of requests for outside
 investigations of alleged human rights violations. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited
 Burundi in 1982 to investigate prison conditions. The
 Government complied with the ICRC's standard conditions for
 visits to prisoners or detainees. In its 1983 International
 Report, Amnesty International explained that it did not
 report on Burundi because of insufficient-information
 on human rights violations. Freedom House rated Burundi
 "not free' in 1983.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Burundi is among the poorest countries of the world, with a
 1981 per capita gross national product of $235. Population
 density is one of the highest in Africa with a population of
 4.56 million (1983) inhabiting a land area of only 27,834
 square kilometers. The population growth rate for 1983 is
 estimated at 2.8 percent. Nearly 95 percent of Burundians
 earn their livelihood from agriculture. The traditional
 feudal land tenure system has been abolished and most
 individual farmers own the land they cultivate. Food
 production has not increased as rapidly as the population.
 Calorie supply as a percentage of requirements was estimated
 at 99.09 (1979). The Government saw a need to cope with the
 high rate of population growth and during 1983 adopted a
 voluntary comprehensive family planning policy. To meet the
 need to expand food production, the Government has emphasized
 agriculture in its most recent five year plan (1983-87).
 Burundi's relatively small monetary economy is based on the
 export of coffee which accounts for 90 percent of foreign
 exchange earnings. The economy and government revenues
 have been particularly hard hit by the steady decline in
 world coffee prices since 1979. Worldwide inflation,
 sharply rising energy costs and high transportation costs
 have hampered economic growth. Real economic growth over
 the past five years has stayed only slightly ahead of
 population growth. Burundi is heavily reliant on foreign
 assistance, and the Government has succeeded in attracting
 increased levels of assistance from western bilateral donors
 and from various multilateral sources.   Health care is
 inadequate as Burundi suffers from a shortage of personnel,
 facilities and budgetary resources. This is reflected in
 the fact that life expectancy at birth is only 41.9 years
 (1980) and the rate of infant mortality is 117 per 1,000
 
 
 54
 live births (1983). Although most urban dwellers (77
 percent in 1970) have access to potable water supplies, the
 percentage of the rural population with access to safe
 year-round water is very low. Educational opportunities,
 despite considerable government efforts supported by donor
 assistance, remain below the needs of the population. Only
 22.6 percent of adults are literate according to 1980
 figures. World Bank statistics for 1979 show primary school
 enrollment of 23 percent of the school age population (28
 percent for males; 18 percent for females). Since the
 adoption of a two shift system, however, Government statistics
 show a large improvement. Only a small fraction of those
 completing primary school can obtain places in the nation's
 35 secondary schools. An even smaller percentage of students
 win places in the nation's sole university, but once there,
 they receive high quality instruction in a competitive
 environment.
 A crucial factor in Burundi is the country's social structure.
 While all Burundians speak the same language and share a common
 culture, the minority Tutai, traditionally a pastoral people,
 have for centuries dominated the political, social, and economic
 institutions of the country. The result of this domination of
 the majority Hutu, traditionally a farming people, was a period
 of political instability, lasting from the late 1950's to the
 mid 1970's, marked by ethnic violence which culminated in
 the government-sanctioned massacres in 1972 of perhaps
 150,000 Hutus in response to a Hutu uprising against the
 Tutsi. Nearly 200,000 Hutus fled to neighboring Rwanda and
 Tanzania. Since 1976, with the advent of the Second Republic,
 which takes as its basic legitimizing principle the pursuit
 of national reconciliation and unity, the degree of ethnic
 tension has been markedly reduced. Thousands of Hutu
 refugees have returned to Burundi. Intermarriage has also
 contributed to a blurring of ethnic distinctions. The low
 level of economic development in rural areas affects both
 Tutsi and Sutu, with difference in economic status between
 the two groups generally not discernible in the countryside.
 However, because of their longstanding dominance of the
 Government and access to education, the Tutsi predominate in
 the modern sector. The military remains under Tutsi control.
 While there is social and cultural discrimination, there is
 no evidence that Hutus are denied equal protection of the law.
 The situation is improving gradually as the Hutu receive the
 education now generally available to them.
 Women in society hold a secondary position although their
 status is undergoing considerable change from traditional
 patterns. Although the Constitution provides for legal
 equality, in practice discrimination in the civil code
 continues. A significant improvement in the legal status of
 women came in 1980 with the issuance of a new legal code on
 families. This code prohibits polygamy and use of dowry,
 and allows women control of family matters in the absence of
 the husband. Women, however, still cannot inherit land and
 cannot work if forbidden to by their husbands. Although
 fewer women than men attain an education, once it is attained
 women can generally find suitable employment. The Government
 does not discriminate against women in hiring or in the jobs
 open to them. Women are represented at all levels in the
 political life of the country. However, their main vehicle
 of political expression is the women's movement affiliated
 with the party. The party remains dominated by males.
