 ALGERIA
 According to its Constitution, Algeria is a socialist, Islamic
 state in which ultimate power is vested in a single political
 party, the Front de Liberation Nationale. Chadli Bendjedid
 monopolizes key positions as Secretary General of the Party,
 President of the Republic, and Minister of Defense. Nonetheless,
 most important decisions are taken by consensus involving the
 military, government, and party elites.
 These elites are bound together by the common experience of a
 harsh struggle for independence. A sense of "revolutionary,
 anti-colonial mission" is basic to their self-perception of what
 Algeria is and ought to be. Importantly, this revolutionary
 consensus is the principal source of popular legitimacy for the
 Government of a nation which has little else to draw on in
 creating a spirit of national cohesion.
 The human rights situation did not change significantly in 1983.
 Although the Constitution contains human rights guarantees, civil
 liberties remain restricted and political rights in particular are
 circumscribed by the party and the Government, which limit
 electoral choices and restrict public debate to officially
 sanctioned forums. Recent trends have been favorable, however,
 including increased emphasis on the local institutions of the
 party and popularly elected assemblies at the local and national
 levels. There is an expectation that Algeria's pragmatic
 evolution, both politically and economically, should also bring
 short- and long-term improvements in human rights.
 Although equal before the law, women are restricted in the
 enjoyment of their'freedoms by tradition. The status of women is
 slowly improving through greater education and increased
 participation in public life, but the great majority of women
 remain in traditional roles.
 Urban police and the rural-oriented Gendarmerie generally adhere
 to constitutional guarantees against arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. Military Security forces in practice are given
 greater leeway, although there are no documented cases of abuse.
 Algeria's is a Socialist economy, largely under state control.
 The private sector is, however, increasingly recognized as a
 legitimate and valuable participant. The development of extensive
 hydrocarbon resources allowed Algeria to undertake ambitious
 industrialization programs in the past two decades. The country's
 considerable agricultural potential suffered, although the current
 five-year plan (1980-84) places emphasis on revitalizing
 agriculture, creating employment, and building housing and
 schools. Major problem areas include underemployment, lack of
 productivity, and gaps in the supply and distribution system.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were no politically motivated killings in 1983, nor any
 charges of such.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detention are neither
 (1196)
 
 
 1197
 condoned nor practiced. There were no accusations of such
 practices in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture. Nevertheless, Amnesty
 International reported receiving unconfirmed reports of
 ill-treatment in Algerian prisons.
 Little is known of prison conditions, which are said to range from
 primitive to modern. In the primary civil prison in Algiers,
 prisoners are often crowded into cells and sanitary conditions are
 poor. Better conditions are found in some smaller outlying
 prisons and jails. All prisons have medical facilities, and each
 prison has a contract with a local doctor who visits the prison
 regularly to treat ill prisoners. Prisoners who are seriously ill
 may be transferred to local hospitals. Prison diet is often
 inadequate; prisoners' families may provide much of their food.
 Families are allowed to visit prisoners and, in some cases at the
 discretion of local prison authorities, conjugal visits are
 permitted. Prisoners convicted of civil crimes are quartered
 apart from those convicted of crimes such as terrorism. The
 treatment, however, is generally similar.
 Lawyers are allowed regular access to their clients. Meetings
 take place under visual supervision of a guard. As far as is
 known, the International Committee of the Red Cross has not
 requested access to detainees or prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution states that no one may be prosecuted, arrestedor
 held except as provided by law. It also provides that detention
 for questioning in criminal investigation cases cannot exceed 48
 hours, after which the suspect must be charged or released. The
 Penal Code provides for informing detainees immediately of charges
 against them. The great majority of cases are handled by the
 urban police and the more rural-oriented Gendarmerie who generally
 adhere to constitutional requirements.
 Though theoretically bound by the same provisions as the police,
 Military Security in fact operates under fewer restrictions and is
 said to hold suspects up to a month before releasing or charging
 them. Military Security is authorized to investigate not only
 military offenses, but also cases involving internal security and
 foreign intelligence collection. In cases that appear to involve
 subversion, either foreign-inspired or domestic, Military Security
 may also investigate civil crimes that ordinarily would be under
 police jurisdiction.
 Once charged, an individual may be held under preventive detention
 while his case is being investigated. This period of preventive
 detention can last many months. Some 23 Islamic Fundamentalist
 leaders arrested in December 1982 have yet to be tried; two are
 known to be free while awaiting trial.
 Expression of views critical of the Government (unauthorized
 strikes, student demonstrations) is tolerated within limits.
 Reluctance to provoke a punitive government response has meant
 that the full extent of these limits is rarely tested.
 
 
 1198
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants have free access to counsel and there is no harassment
 of defense counsel by the Government. As far as is known,
 defendants are made fully aware of the charges against them at the
 time they are bound over for trial. Trials are public, and
 defendants have the right of appeal. The judicial system is
 divided into three partst civil courts, military courts, and the
 State Security Court. The civil courts are generally independent
 of executive or military control. Military courts deal directly
 with espionage and with offenses committed by military personnel,
 such as absence without leave and theft. The State Security Court
 at Medea is not in permanent session, but has jurisdiction over
 cases that are deemed "to endanger the national security." At
 least a ministerial-level decision is required to refer a case to
 the State Security Court. It generally provides procedural
 protections similar to those of civilian courts.
 The Administrative Court for Financial Accountability has been
 active in 1983, convicting numerous high-/and middle-grade
 officials of financial corruption. Procedural protections similar
 to those of civilian courts are provided.
 All political prisoners have been released since President
 Bendjedid took office in February 1979.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Membership in political organizations is not required, except for
 senior government and military officials who must be members of
 the party. Other than this, the Government does not interfere
 with the private lives of Algerians.
 Inviolability of the home is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 generally is honored in practice except in some cases involving
 Military Security. Police forces may not enter a house without a
 warrant from the local prosecutor or investigating magistrate, nor
 may they enter a residence during night hours.
 Section 2  Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, it
 also states that such freedom may not be used to "undermine the
 foundations of the Socialist revolution." The print media are
 published either by the Government or the party. Journalists are
 government employees. The distribution of foreign newspapers and
 magazines is also controlled, though such publications are
 available. The French-language weekly Jeune Afrique is
 proscribed. The French-language daily Le Monde is occasionally
 seized. The Government does not permit criticism of its
 authority; however, criticism of specific programs and policies
 and the performance of government offices and state enterprises is
 allowed and even encouraged.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There is only one legal political party and one inclusive labor
 union, the General Union of Algerian Workers. These and other
 "mass organizations" for youth, women, farmers and veterans, all
 
 
 1199
 tightly controlled by the party, are the primary recognized
 associations in Algeria. Security personnel watch public
 gatherings closely. Limited political opposition, such as
 occasional student demonstrations, is tolerated. There were no
 significant demonstrations in 1983. Opposition political tracts
 are sometimes circulated, almost certainly with the knowledge of
 the Government. Strikes are illegal in the public sector, but
 workers have successfully used strikes, without the sanction of
 the national union, to win more pay and benefits.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Legally an Islamic state, Algeria protects the rights of the small
 Christian and Jewish minorities. There is little evidence of
 individual prejudice; in fact, Westerners of all faiths are
 generally warmly received, especially in rural areas. Christian
 churches and Jewish synagogues exist. There are no formal
 restrictions on missionary activity, but in general the Christian
 clergy directs its activities to the Christian expatriate
 community. In a rare case in 1983, the visas of visiting British
 evangelists were revoked when their occupation became known.
 The Islamic "clergy" is trained by the Government. Friday sermons
 are not formally censored, but Government monitoring constrains
 the clergy's freedom of expression. Religious travel such as the
 Hajj (the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca) is organized by the
 Government. There were no overt manifestations of Islamic
 dissidence in 1983.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom to travel within Algeria and abroad and to emigrate is
 guaranteed by law and generally is respected in practice. One of
 the first acts of the Bendjedid government was to remove the exit
 visa requirement for Algerians traveling abroad; passports,
 however, may take months to acquire. The amount of hard currency
 which Algerians may carry abroad has been doubled but remains the
 primary limitation on foreign travel. These changes have resulted
 in significantly increased Algerian travel abroad. The Algerian
 and French Governments have agreed on a series of measures, such
 as special benefits, to encourage some of the nearly one million
 Algerian workers in France to return voluntarily to Algeria.
 Except for foreign diplomats, who must apply for permission to
 travel farther than 50 kilometers from Algiers, travel within
 Algeria is generally unrestricted. Visitors must fill out police
 registration forms if they are staying overnight in a locality.
 The Gendarmerie routinely sets up vehicular checkpoints in the
 countryside.
 The Constitution provides for the right of political asylum.
 According to estimates of international experts (whose access to
 the camps has however been restricted), there may be as many as
 120,000 refugees in camps near Tindouf. Most of them are said to
 be from the Western Sahara. Algeria has also admitted between one
 and two thousand Palestinians from Lebanon. There also are
 several thousand refugees of the Sahel drought, mostly from Mali
 and Niger, around Tamanrasset in southern Algeria. The Government
 contributes to the support of all of the Saharan and Sahelian
 refugees, as does the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees.
 
 
 1200
 The Government hosts various foreign opposition and dissident
 groups, such as the Polisario and Palestine Liberation
 Organization. Many of their representatives are located in
 Algiers.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Rights of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Major political decisions are made by the top leadership of the
 party, Government, and military, all three headed by President
 Bendjedid. The political process is confined to the single party,
 which significantly limits deviation from the path prescribed by
 ruling authorities. While fundamental policy decisions are not
 questioned, there is considerable airing of popular aspirations
 and grievances within the party organization, within the National
 Popular Assembly, the provincial and local councils, and in the
 government-controlled press. The Assembly also has legislative
 functions. There is universal adult suffrage. All candidates for
 office are nominated by the Party, though voters usually have a
 choice among several candidates. Freedom House says that
 elections are managed by the party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no known visits by international organizations in
 1983. There are no internal human rights organizations. Algeria
 supports human rights initiatives in U.N. and regional forums, but
 usually does not take the lead.
 In its 1983 Report, Amnesty International expressed concern about
 unconfirmed reports of "ill-treatment in Algerian prisons" and
 noted that it is following the trials of some leaders of an
 Islamic Fundamentalist movement. Freedom House rates Algeria "not
 free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Algerian economy is largely socialist, with the main economic
 sectors run by state enterprises; however, recognizing that
 private enterprise has an important contribution to make, the
 December 1981 Party Congress officially endorsed a larger role for
 the private sector. At present, about one-half of the arable land
 remains with independent herders and farmers, most retail
 businesses and service firms are privately owned, and there are
 several thousand private industrial firms in operation.
 An estimated 3.2 percent annual population increase and a
 fertility rate of 7.4 (1982) make it difficult to meet nutritional
 and social needs and to provide full employment, but minimum vital
 needs are being met. About 20 percent of nonagricultural workers
 are unemployed, and a 1976-79 estimate put the urban population
 living below the absolute poverty level at 20 percent. The
 current five-year plan (1980-1984) emphasizes social needs, such
 as housing, education and health care.
 Per capita gross national product (GNP) was $2,291 in 1981. About
 one-half of GNP is consumed and the other half is invested. This
 rate of investment is high, reflecting a conscious government
 policy. The rate of real growth in 1981 was 9 percent.
 
 
 1201
 The Government controls most food supplies, although the private
 sector is increasingly important. One-third of the nation's food
 must be imported because of inefficient agriculture. While food
 supplies are adequate, the cost is high and supply irregular.
 Housing is in extremely short supply, and the situation has
 deteriorated. Efforts to correct the shortage are under way. A
 total of 450,000 dwelling units are scheduled for construction in
 the period 1980-84.
 Most health care is rudimentary, but free and widely available.
 An ambitious program to build some 600 new clinics has been
 launched. Life expectancy was 57 years in 1980, compared with 47
 in 1960. Infant mortality was 110 per 1,000 live births in 1979.
 While most of the population was considered to have access to safe
 water, water-borne diseases remain a serious problem, especially
 for young children.
 Education is free through the university level and is compulsory
 between the ages of six and thirteen. Educational facilities have
 been vastly expanded since independence, but they are still
 insufficient in both rural and urban areas. The literacy level in
 Arabic, French, or both is approximately 40 percent of the
 population over nine years of age, but is steadily increasing as
 the large majority of children now attend school.
 The total Berber population has been estimated at between
 one-quarter and one-third of Algeria's 20 million inhabitants. In
 the last few years there have been demonstrations by Berbers,
 sometimes leading to violent clashes between demonstrators and the-
 Government, over cultural rights for Barbers. The Government has
 shown more concern in recent years for reconciling its policy of
 developing the identity of Algeria as an Arab nation with Berber
 desires to preserve their own culture and language, while
 retaining French as a language of work and education. Concessions
 have been made, including the introduction of Berber as an
 academic subject in the major universities. Moreover, Berber
 regions have received extra attention in Government programs to
 build schools, housing, and municipal infrastructure. Although
 Berber nationalism remains an area of concern, tensions were
 reduced in 1983 and no major confrontations were reported.
 The status of women in Algeria is improving, but tradition and
 culture make it difficult for women to follow an independent
 path. Women are equal to men under the law but, in fact, do not
 fully exercise their rights. The great majority of Algerian women
 remain in traditional roles, although their participation in
 public life is growing. Ten women have been elected to the
 Popular National Assembly, two are members of the Central
 Committee of the party, and several women have been elected to the
 Council of the National Committee of the party. Women also serve
 in the armed forces.
 An effort has been made to close the gap separating women from men
 in education. According to government statistics, 62 percent of
 all school-age girls were enrolled in 1980 compared with 39
 percent in 1965. In 1979, about 40 percent of all students were
 female. A new family code has been negotiated in 1983, but not
 yet formally approved. Among its principal components is
 encouragement of "birth spacing."
