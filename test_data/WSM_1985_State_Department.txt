 WESTERN SAMOA
 Western Samoa lies in the South Pacific Ocean approximately
 1,600 miles northeast of New Zealand and looks to that country
 as a model for its democratic practices and educational
 system. The culture of Western Samoa is essentially Polynesian
 but uniquely Samoan. Traditional authority is vested in the
 matai. Each extended family, or aiga, has at least one matai,
 who is appointed by consensus of the aiga. Ownership of land
 is legally vested in the matai. It is the matai's
 responsibility to direct the economic, social, and political
 affairs of the aiga. There are 362 villages in Western Samoa
 with a total of 12,000-plus matai, who can fine or otherwise
 punish offenders of village rules.
 The 1960 Constitution established a parliamentary democracy on
 the Westminister model but with variances which allowed for
 "Fa'a Samoa" or the "Samoan Way." The Constitution provides
 for a Samoan Head of State, a unicameral legislature, an
 independent judiciary, protection of Samoan land and
 traditional Samoan titles, and guarantees of fundamental rights
 and freedoms. The present Head of State, Malietoa Tanumafili
 II, holds the position for life. His successors will be
 elected by the Legislative Assembly for 5-year terms. The Head
 of State appoints as Prime Minister, the leader of the
 Government, an elected member of the Assembly who can command
 majority support in that body. Members of the Cabinet are
 appointed by the Head of State with the advice of the Prime
 Minister. They and the Prime Minister hold office as long as
 they enjoy the confidence of the Assembly. The 47 Assembly
 members are elected for 3-year terms. All legislation needs
 approval by the Head of State before becoming law.
 The Western Samoan economy, which is primarily agricultural, is
 beset by many of the problems of a developing country. It is
 particularly susceptible to shifts in world prices for its
 export commodities such as coconut oil. The Government has
 implemented austerity measures in an attempt to improve the
 suffering current accounts deficit, but there is no evidence
 that human rights have been affected by economic conditions.
 There were no significant human rights issues in Western Samoa
 in 1985.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for political motives, whether by the Government or by
 opposition political organizations, does not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no secret arrests, clandestine detentions, or
 abductions in Western Samoa.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel or degrading treatment or punishment are
 prohibited by law in Western Samoa, and there have been no
 instances of such practices.

 WESTERN SAMOA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are full and effective legal safeguards of
 internationally recognized rights in this area. The
 Constitution guarantees freedom from forced labor. Exile,
 internal or external, is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Western Samoan law guarantees the right to a fair public trial,
 and this right is honored. All charges are stated formally and
 clearly. Defendants are entitled to counsel. There are no
 special courts to deal with political or security offenses, and
 the judiciary is independent of government interference or
 influence. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government respects the privacy of the people and does not
 permit arbitrary interference with family, home, or
 correspondence. Both law and local custom provide for the
 protection from invasion of the home and from seizure of
 property without substantive and procedural safeguards,
 including search warrants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are fundamental parts of the
 Constitution. They are respected in law and practice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the right of peaceful assembly and
 to form associations- and unions. There are no significant
 restrictions.
 While trade unions have not emerged in the private sector, the
 public service has an employees' organization which engages in
 collective bargaining. The Government has permitted efforts to
 develop unions, and the courts have upheld the right to strike
 and to enter into collective bargaining.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution along
 with the freedom of thought and conscience. Each person is
 guaranteed the right to change religions or belief and to
 worship or teach religion alone or with others. There is no
 government-favored religion. Almost all of the people are
 Christians.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees the right to travel and move freely
 throughout Western Samoa and to change residence. Samoans are
 free to travel abroad, and they can emigrate and return to
 Samoa without restriction.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Western Samoa's Government is based upon the British
 parliamentary system, with actual power vested in the Prime
 Minister and the Legislative Assembly. The Legislative
 Assembly is elected every 3 years. Forty-five of the Assembly
 members are elected by approximately 12,000 matai in Western
 Samoa, and the other two seats are filled by universal
 suffrage of those citizens who are not Samoan by heritage.
 Although there is some pressure for extending suffrage to all
 citizens, the concept is seen by many as conflicting with "Fa'a
 Samoa." The existing system is viewed as being democratic, in
 that the matai traditionally consult with their extended
 families before making decisions such as choosing among
 candidates for the Assembly. In recognition of this practice,
 candidates campaign among nonmatai in an effort to influence
 the eventual choices made by the matai. The matai system is
 conservative but does allow for change. While Samoans must
 show respect and obedience to their matai in family and
 communal affairs, the matai have well-defined responsibilities
 which, if not met, can result in removal.
 Western Samoa has only the rudiments of political parties.
 The Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP) was founded in 1982,
 and the Christian Democratc Party early in 1985. The current
 Government, a coalition of HRPP defectors and Christian
 Democrats, unseated an HRPP government through parliamentary
 maneuvers in December 1985.
 The political process in Samoa still tends to be a function of
 personality rather than party. In recent experience, elections
 have occurred more frequently than the prescribed 3-year cycle,
 primarily as a result of no-confidence votes.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No requests for human rights investigations were made to the
 Western Samoan Government in 1985, nor have human rights
 organizations found cause for comment or special reporting on
 Western Samoa. There are no local nongovernmental
 organizations which concern themselves with human rights. The
 Amnesty International 1985 Report does not contain an entry for
 Western Samoa. Freedom House rates it "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of Western Samoa was 161,000 in 1983 and,
 according to 1981 statistics, growing at the rate of, .6
 percent. The low growth is due to emigration, the birth rate
 being considerably higher than that figure. Yearly per capita
 income was estimated for 1981 as $623. Ninety percent of the
 work force is in agriculture, cultivating both subsistence and
 cash crops.
 Western Samoa suffers from a critical balance of payments
 problem. As a result of austerity measures adopted by the
 Government, the economy is slowly improving. The Government's
 main development goal is to improve agriculture.
 Life expectancy at birth in Western Samoa is 66 years, and the
 infant mortality rate, according to 1982 World Health
 
 
 907
 WESTERN SAMOA
 Organization figures, is 35 per 1,000 live births. Ninety-five
 percent of the population has access to safe water.
 Education is not compulsory or free. The total primary school
 enrollment is 127.3 percent, with males representing 123.5
 percent and females at 131.7 percent. The adult literacy rate
 is 97.8 percent: 98.7 percent in urban areas and 97.5 in rural.
 The Labor and Employment Act of 1972 and 1973 regulations
 establish a 40-hour workweek for the private sector and a
 minimum wage, currently about $.25 an hour. It is illegal to
 employ children under 15 years of age except in "safe and light
 work." The law also establishes certain rudimentary safety and
 health provisions, such as a requirement for fencing around
 dangerous machine parts. Independent observers say, however,
 that the safety laws are not enforced except when accidents
 highlight noncompliance and that many agricultural workers,
 among others, are inadequately protected from pesticides and
 other health hazards. Part of the problem is low safety
 consciousness, which government education programs are
 addressing. The law does not apply to service rendered to the
 matai, some of whom require children to work at what might be
 considered "child labor." Government employees are covered
 under different and more stringent regulations, which are
 adequately enforced.
 Under the Constitution, women are afforded the same rights as
 men. While women have been active in the Assembly, other
 public offices, and community affairs, they are generally
 underrepresented in proportion to their share of the population.
