 NIGERIA
 A military coup brought the Federal Military Govern-
 ment (FMG) to power in 1966. After the 1967-70
 civil war, amnesty was extended to all but a few
 secessionist leaders, and Nigeria achieved noteworthy
 success in bringing about internal reconciliation ahd
 the reintegration of secessionist elements. On July
 29, 1975, a bloodless coup resulted in a change of
 government leadership. On February 13, 1976, the Head
 of State, General Murtala Muhammed, was assassinated
 in an abortive coup, and the present Head of State,
 Lt. General Olusegun Obasanjo, assumed office.
 General Obasanjo announced at that time his intention
 to fulfill his predecessor's promise to return to
 civilian rule by October 1, 1979, and has meticulously
 adhered to a schedule to meet this goal. On September
 21, 1978, he ended the twelve year State of Emergency
 and the ban on political activity.
 Chapter III of the 1963 Constitution contains broad
 human rights guarantees which generally remain in
 force. From time to time, however, FMG decrees
 circumscribe some rights. The new Nigerian Constitu-
 tion, published on September 21, 1978, also contains
 broad human rights guarantees which will become the
 supreme law of the land at the time the civilian
 government is installed on October 1, 1979.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is neither condoned nor practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punish-
 
 (136)
 
 
 137
 ment is not practiced. Death sentences imposed by
 civilian courts normally are not carried out in
 public, although armed robbers convicted by civilian
 trial are occasionally executed in public as a
 deterrent measure. Nigerian prisons lack many modern
 facilities, but prisoners are generally well treated.
 A program to improve prison facilities is in progress.
 Family members are permitted liberal access to
 prisoners and are allowed to provide food, clothing
 and other basic needs.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Although not a common practice, there have been
 instances of arbitrary arrest when the Government
 believed a threat to internal security or other
 emergency existed. At the time the State of Emer-
 gency was ended in September 1978, Gen. Obasanjo
 announced that a decree would be issued enabling the
 Chief of Staff and the Inspector General of Police
 to detain "undesirable elements" for more than
 twenty-four hours. This decree has not yet appeared,
 and it may be that the nineteen state governments
 will assume.primary responsibility for public order
 during the year of transition. To the best of the
 Department of State's knowledge, there currently are
 no political prisoners in Nigeria, nor are we aware
 of any recent arrests or detentions on the grounds
 of public disorder.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials are the norm. The Public Officers
 (Special Provisions) Decree of March 2, 1976, denies
 dismissed public officials the right to seek redress
 in court. In recent years, the State of Emergency
 provisions were rarely invoked, and the ordinary
 Nigerian continues to be treated justly by the
 courts under both traditional and statutory law.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The right to be free from invasion of the home is
 protected by FMG policy. We are not aware of any
 
 
 138
 violations of this right.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The FMG has introduced programs designed to fulfill
 basic needs for food, shelter, improved health care,
 and education. About 65 percent of the federal budget
 is allocated to development projects. A primary goal
 of the 1975-80 development plan and the current annual
 budget is to accelerate economic growth and improve
 the living conditions of the poor. One feature of the
 development plan is the National Accelerated Food
 Production Project. Another, the Universal Primary
 Education scheme, is an ambitious program to provide
 free primary education to all Nigerian children.
 While reliable statistics are not available, it
 appears that the success of these programs has been
 limited, to some extent by reduced oil revenues and
 the consequent economic retrenchment.
 The Government consistently condemns and has taken
 legal actions to discourage corruption. However,
 corruption remains an endemic social and political
 problem which does divert private and public resources
 from needed development projects. There is no syste-
 matic discrimination, based on tribal, racial, or
 sexual grounds, in employment or other economic
 activity. However, women in Nigeria, who have in the
 past occupied a circumscribed position typical of
 traditional societies, make up only a small proportion
 of the top levels of the business, governmental, and
 academic communities.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Nigerians are free to practice the religion of their
 
 
 139
 choice. Political organization, assembly, and comment
 on political subjects were banned by the Military
 Government in 1966, but this ban has not been strictly
 enforced sipce June 1978 and was lifted on September
 21, 1978. Although censorship of the press is minimal
 and infrequent, a two-year ban on the fortnightly
 newsmagazine Newbreed was imposed in June 1978 under
 the Newspapers (Prohibition of Circulation) Decree 17
 of 1967, allegedly for exacerbating tribal and reli-
 gious tensions. The FMG in late 1978 suspended two
 newspaper editors in one city and called in a reporter
 for questioning in another, in both cases for publishing
 stories on political developments which the Government
 viewed as inaccurate or inopportune. All TV and radio
 broadcast organizations are now wholly owned by the
 Government, and only two major newspapers remain
 independently owned. All of the media are used to
 present Government views, but they are also frequently
 critical of the Government's foreign and domestic
 policies. The Government is attentive to such
 criticism and public reaction to it.
 In February 1978, the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC)
 was inaugurated, marking the completion of the
 FMG-ordered reorganization of the trade union move-
 ment. This federation of member unions, which are
 organized along industry lines, has freely elected its
 officials, won the right to collect dues by check-off,
 and sent its president to participate in the 1978
 conference of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO). However, the FMG continues to impose a ban
 against strikes in "essential services" and has
 decreed a forfeiture of pay and other benefits against
 striking workers. The FMG has also imposed stiffer
 penalties against employers who "disrupt the economy"
 by ignoring decisions of the Industrial Arbitration
 Panel. The ILO Committee of Experts recently criti-
 cized the Nigerian Government for contravening the ILO
 Convention, specifically by banning eleven Nigerian
 labor leaders from union activity without a court
 hearing and by failing to recognize a worker-organized
 Nigerian Labor Congress in 1975.
 The FMG banned the National Union of Nigerian Students
 
 
 140
 following student demonstrations in April 1978 against
 increased university boarding fees. Approximately ten
 persons were killed, some by gunfire from the police
 and military. Two university Vice Chancellors and ten
 faculty members were dismissed and three student
 leaders were expelled after submission of a report
 from a commission of inquiry convened to investigate
 the incidents.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 These basic freedoms are respected.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The FMG appears determined to maintain its announced
 schedule to return to civilian rule by October 1,
 1979. The ban on political parties and national
 political activity, in effect since 1966, was lifted
 in September 1978. Nonpartisan local elections were
 held in December 1976, and a constituent assembly was
 convened in October 1977 to adopt a new Constitution.
 This Constitution was delivered to the Supreme Mili-
 tary Council on August 29, 1978, was published when
 the ban on politics was lifted, and is scheduled to
 take effect on October 1, 1979. In January 1978, the
 Federal Electoral Commission conducted a nation-wide
 voter registration campaign of all adults 18 years of
 age and over.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 We are not aware of any recent request by an interna-
 tional or non-governmental institution to investigate
 human rights conditions in Nigeria. The Nigerians
 have always maintained a high interest in human rights
 violations in southern Africa and have recently been
 willing to consider violations in other parts of the
 
 
 141
 continent. In that regard, the FMG has permitted a
 Nigerian to serve as the "eminent African personality"
 in the United Nations investigation of human rights
 conditions in Uganda.
