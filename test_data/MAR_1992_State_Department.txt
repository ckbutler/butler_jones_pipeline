 MOROCCO
 The Constitution of Morocco provides for a pluralistic political system and a par-
 liamentary form of government with an independent judiciary. However, while
 amendments to the Constitution approved in a September referendum gave some-
 what more power to the Prime Minister and Parliament, ultimate authority remains
 with the King, who appoints and dismisses the Prime Minister and who may dis-
 solve the Parliament and rule by decree. Past elections to Parliament and municipal
 councils were not free of government manipulation. Official results of the September
 constitutional referendum showed a 97.27-percent voter turnout with 99.96 percent
 voting in favor of the amendments, a result widely challenged by opposition and
 other observers.
 The security apparatus is composed of several overlapping police and paramilitary
 organizations operating within a framework of written legal provisions designed to
 maintain public order. The Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire (DST), Surete
 Nationale, auxiliary forces, and judicial police are under the supervision of the Min-
 ister of the Interior, while the Gendarmerie Royale, though technically a branch of
 the armed forces, reports directly to the palace. Security forces continued to commit
 human rights abuses, including torture. According to the US. Arms Control and
 Disarmament Agency, total military expenditures for 1989 were $1,203,000,000.
 There is no indication that efforts will be made to reduce these expenditures in the
 near future.
 In Morocco's free enterprise economy, about 40 percent of the work force is en-
 gaged in agriculture, whid provides on average about 16 percent of the gross do-
 mestic product. Since the early 1980's, Morocco has actively pursued a program of
 economic reform and liberalization which has recently helpedspur growth and in-
 vestment, particularly i ightindustry. Total employment has been increasing, but
 not enough to offset the rapid growth of the available work force.
 The human rights situation in Morocco regressed somewhat in 1992. The Royal
 Consultative Council on Human Rights (CCD), created by King Hassan in 1990
 to make reform recommendations, made no new recommendations in 1992. Rather,
 the CCDH appeared increasingly to be manipulated by the Government for propa-
 ganda purposes. There was increasingly strong government pressure on the rights
 of free speech and press in cases perceived to affect the security of the State, most
 notably in the politically motivated trial and sentencing of labor leader Noubir
 Amaoui. A few political prisoners were released in 1992, including the last three
 members of the leftist group, ilal Amam, jailed since the 1970's, although signifi-
 cantly fewer political prisoners were released than in 1991. Also released were the
 last two inmates of the infamous secret detention facility at Tazmamart who were
 transferred to Kenitra prison in 1991. Widespread abuses and important restrictions
 on basic human rights continued. Credible reports persisted of torture and police
 brutality, with no new reports of government efforts to punish perpetrators. Other
 principal problems included inability of citizens to change the government, arbitrary
 arrest and detention, lack of fair trial in political and security cases, lack of an inde-
 pendent judiciary, and restrictions on the freedoms of travel, assembly and associa-
 tion, and religion. Constraints on women's rights also continued. King Hassan un-
 dertook a campaign in August to reform Moroccan law to better insure observance
 of equal rights for women, but no specific improvements had been implemented by
 yea? s end.
 RESPEC FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were several credible reports
 of death in police custody in 1992, the most publicized of which was the death in
 January of a member of a group or striking workers conducting a sit-in at the Royal
 Office of Complaints. The striker reportedly died as a result of injuries inflicted by
 the police as they broke up the sit-in. The Government officially denied the allega-
 
 
 1057
 tion, claiming the man died of a heart attack. In December a 62-year-old street ven-
 dor taken in a sweep in Marrakech died after 1 hour in police custody. A separate,
 well-publicized case involving a death in custody in October 1991 remained unset-
 tled, with the trial of police officials implicated in the death apparently postponed
 with no date set.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported permanent disappearances in 1992.
 Temporary "disappearances" continued to result from the practice of holding persons
 in pretrial incommunicado detention, without notifying families or attorneys, for
 .onger than the legal limit of 48 hours. In some cases, these disappearances took
 the form of apparent kidnapings in which the victims were abducted by security
 force elements in unmarked cars. The victims were released days or sometimes
 weeks later, either by the police or by their unidentified "kidnapers."
 In March the family of Houcine el-Manouzi, a union activist who disappeared in
 1972, issued a communique claiming el-Manouzi was still alive and being held in
 a secret detention facility at the. military fortress of Ahermoumou. In August a com-
 mittee of support for el-Manouzi demanded information on his whereabouts but re-
 ceived no official response. Relatives publicly sought information about three other
 men who disappeared in 1964 and 1973 and claimed that the men were being de-
 tained at Ahermoumou. An organization in Europe called the Committees for the
 Fight Against Repression in Morocco claimed in May that the Government main-
 tamed four other clandestine detention centers. The existence of the detention cen-
 ters and the detention of the four men were not independently confirmed. Moroccan
 human rights groups continued to assert that an indeterminate number of perma-
 nent "disappeared persons" remain to be accounted for by the Government.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Conatitution contains no specific guarantee against torture or abuse at the
 hands of government officials. Credible reports of torture and degrading treatment
 persisted at the reduced level seen in 1991. Torture and mistreatment occurred
 most often during the initial period of incommunicado detention following arrest and
 were used to extract confessions. Methods of torture included beatings (particularly
 on the soles of the feet), sleep deprivation, partial suffocation, electric shocks, keep-
 ing prisoners blindfolded and handcuffed for weeks on end, or keeping them naked
 and alone in dark punishment cells or latrines. Following conviction, prisoners are
 often subjected to random violence by guards and deliberately deprived of family
 visits, sleep, baths, blankets, medical care, and wholesome food. Political prisoners
 also complained of beatins by criminal offenders incited by prison guards.
 Local newspapers continued to publish complaints of prisoners concerning harsh
 treatment and degrading prison conditions, often in the form of communiques from
 the prisoners or their families. In several instances prisoners went on hunger strike
 to protest their treatment and prison conditions. In December the nonpartisan Mo-
 roccan Human Rights Organization (OMDH), citing the apparent suicide deaths of
 four prisoners in September, criticized the "growing deterioration" of Moroccan pris-
 on conditions.
 The detention facility in the military fortress at Tazmamart, notorious for its
 harsh treatment of prisoners and the fact that its existence was never acknowledged
 by Moroccan authorities, was reportedly destroyed in 1992 after being closed in
 1991. Rumors of its renewed use, however, continued to be heard. Three former
 Tazmamart prisoners, freed in late December 1991, left Morocco in early January
 for France, where they publicly complained of their treatment in Morocco and their
 resulting poor health. In mid-January former Tazmamart prisoner Mbarek Touil
 who was released in September 1991, was issued a passport by the Government and
 allowed to leave Morocco to rejoin his family in the United States. The last two
 former Tazmamart prisoners, Mohamed Raiss and Ghani Achour, were released in
 September and November. The Government refused to comment on other prisoners
 who died in detention at Tazmamart.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government often ignores legal
 guarantees of procedural due process. Moroccan law requires that a detainee be
 brought before a judge within 48 hours of detention (extendable to 96 hours upon
 approval of the prosecutor) and informed of the charges against him. Incommuni-
 cado (garde a vue) detention was shortened to 48 hours, plus a one-time 24-hour
 extension if requested by the prosecutor, under the CCDH reforms adopted by Par-
 liament in April 1991 and promulgated into law by King Hassan on December 30,
 1991. Other CCDH recommendations, many still not adopted by the Government,
 provide for expanded court and prosecutorial oversight, speeding up initial hearings,
 the right of access to an attorney during detention, and autopsy in cases of prisoner
 death. According to Moroccan human rights groups, observance of the new require-
 ments was spotty and particularly poor in rural areas. Human rights groups and
 
 
 1058
 members of the security forces reported that resistance to the new constraints
 among some members of the security forces was considerable.
 Arrests usually take place in public view, but police sometimes refuse to identify
 themselves, and warrants are not always used. Moroccan law requires that a lawyer
 be present after the detainee's first appearance in court. Morocco does not have an
 extensive system of bail, although defendants are sometimes released on their own
 recognizance. The bail system was expanded by Parliament in December 1991 to
 give judges greater latitude in granting bail or provisional liberty but the expansion
 did not apparently result in substantially increased use of bail. Moroccan law does
 not provide for habeas cous or its equivalent. Under a separate Code of Military
 Justice, miitary personnel may be detained without warrants or public trial, but
 no such instances were reported in 1992.
 Abdessalam Yassine, leader of the banned Islamist organization Justice and Char-
 ity, remained under house arrest at his home in Sale after 2 years' detention with.
 out trial for any crime, even though members of his organization, tried and con.
 victed of membership in a banned organization and distributing leaflets, were re.
 leaed on expiration of their prison terms in December 1991 and January 1992. His
 supporters say that the authorities frequently forbid his contact with members of
 his family and friends.
 In February there were several credible reports of widespread arbitrary arrests
 of Sahrawi (i.e., native Saharan) youths in the Western Sahara. The Government
 officially denied the reports,      that all Sahrawi prisoners were freed follow-
 ing a 1991 pardon by King Hassan. The reports persisted, however, with one sug-
 gesting that some prisoners were trsnsferred to detention centers within Morocco.
 Moroccan human rgts grups also accused the Government of maintaining secret
 detention facilities whe re de hld without judicial process. Two such fa-
 cilities identified by the groups were the Ain Atik and El Ank centers in Casa-
 blanca. The Government did not respond to public requests for information on the
 alleged centers.
 Tere are no known instances of Moroccans being sentenced to exile. There con-
 tinue to be, nonetheless, a number of political activists who remain abroad, mostly
 in France, Belgium, and Switzerland rather than risk arrest on their return to Mo-
 rcco.
 e. Denial of Fair Pubic Tdia.--Morco has a dual legal system: A secular system
 based in part on French legal tradition and a parallel Islamic system which adju-
 dicates family matters and inheritance law for Moroccan Muslims. The secular sys-
 tem includes courts of original jurisdiction, appellate courts, and a Supreme Court.
 Those accused of political and security offenses are tried in the secular courts.
 In general, ases are brought before an initial review court--the court of first in-
 stance--which may call for a hearing quickly to bring cases to trial. The detainee
 is informed of charges and questioned by a judge who determines if charges have
 merit. If the infraction is minor, the judge may release the detainee or impose a
 light senance. If a more extensive investigation is required, the judge may release
 detainees on their own recognizance. In cases of alleged political crimes, detainees
 are often held for lo   a n  before trial There are credible reports of detainees
 being convicted on the basis of confessions extracted under duress. The criminal
 court system is heavily dependent on confessions, and authorities are apparently
 motivated to apply sufient pressure on the detainee to extract a statement ade-
 quate to assure his conviction.
 The Moroccan judicial system is generally considered susceptible to political inter-
 vention and control when a case involves challenges to royal authority or state pol-
 icy, and those accused of such crimes often do not enjoy the procedural safeguards
 needed to ensure a fair trial. Human rights grups often provide legal counsel for
 defendants in such cases. In criminal caes dfen ants often reeive only cursory
 hearings, and judges depend on police reports to decide cases. Although the State
 provides an attorney at public expense for serious crimes (when the alleged offense
 carries a sentence of over 5 years), appointed attorneys oten provie  dequate
 representation. For lesser crimes, needy defendants usually are not represented by
 counsel.
 One case that received unusual attention was the trial of the labor leader, Nouir
 Amaoui, who was charged with defamation based on statements he had made to a
 Spanish journalist about the corruption of government ministers (see also Section
 2.a.). He was found guilty and sentenced in April to 2 years in prison. The trial,
 widely seen a politically motivated, was conducted in Rabat under unusually strict
 security conditions. Public access was tightly restricted, as was the entry of defense
 attorneys and journalists, some of whom were roughed up and injured by the secu-
 rity forces. The OMDH accused the Government of packing the courtroom with pe-
 lice in civilian clothes and of blocking court access to the press and public. The ov-
 
 
 1059
 ernment also invoked press controls (see Section 2.a.) in an effort to limit coverage
 of the trial. Moroccan legal experts criticized court procedures, the length of the sen-
 tence, and the failure of the prosecutor to send the case to the Court of Appeal in
 a timely manner as contravening Moroccan law. Amaoui's case was finally set for
 appeal in January 1993. Numerous protests in support of Amaoul were held
 throughout the year. In November a demonstration m front of the Sale prison
 (where Amaoui was held) was broken up by police with such violence that the
 OMDH described the security forces' behavior as "having the character of a punitive
 action.*
 The OMDH issued a list of prisoners in June that contained the names of 102
 prisoners "of opinion", 80 prisoners accused of armed conspiracy or attack for politi-
 cal reasons, and 350 prisoners convicted following demonstrations or strikes. In Au-
 gust the coordinating committee of the Moroccan Human Rights Association
 MHt)eand the Moroccan League for the Defense of Human Rights (MLDHR) an-
 nounced it had a list of 567 'syndical or political prisoners" and 60 'disappeared
 persons." On August 7, the opposition Istiqlal party daily al Alam published part
 of that list, including 137 names of "political prisoners" and 27 "disappeared per-
 sons." The general secretariat of the CCDH, without convening the Council itself,
 issued a statement refuting the al Alam list and asserting, like the Government,
 that there are no political prisoners in Morocco. Because the Government defines
 several categories of speech as criminal (see Section 2.a.), it regards most who de-
 scribe themselves as political prisoners to be common criminals.
 The figures given by Moroccan human rights groups for the number of political
 prisoners do not include Sahrawis held in Morocco or the Western Sahara. The best
 estimate for the number of Moroccan political prisoners at the end of 1992 was be-
 tween 160 and 180. A few political prisoners were released from confinement during
 the year. In January King Hassan pardoned and released the last three members
 of the Hlal Amnam Organization jailed in the 1970's.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution states that the home is inviolable and that no search or investigation
 may take place without a search warrant issued in compliance with the law. Cur-
 rent law stipulates that a search warrant must be obtained from a prosecutor on
 valid grounds. This stipulation is not always observed, however, and there were con-
 tinued reports of illegal searches of the homes and offices of suspected political ac-
 tivists.
 Selective government surveillance of certain persons and organizations both for-
 eign and Moroccan, includes monitoring telephones and opening mail. ;Re univer-
 sity campuses continued to be under close surveillance. An extensive informant sys-
 tem exists, especially on the campuses and in the cities.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, but by Moroccan law and tradition there are three forbidden topics: the monar-
 chy, Morocco's claim to the Western Sahara, and the sanctity of Islam. In an inter-
 view with French journalists in September, the King reiterated that to state that
 the Western Sahara is not Moroccan is a crime against state security. Many Moroc-
 cans are careful about criticizing government policies for fear of government re-
 prisal. In November Moroccan authorities arrested Ahmed Belaichi of the AMDH for
 affronting the military," based on remarks he made about the military on a local
 television show concerning illegal emigration to Europe. At his December trial,
 Belaichi was sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment and fined. The April trial of labor
 leader Noubir Amaoui on defamation charges was widely regarde as a politically
 expedient method for jailing Amaoui after he gave an interview in March to a small
 opposition weekly in which he suggested political change would come "from the
 street" and questioned the utility of the monarchy. In May a provincial labor leader
 was sentenced to 5 years in prison without parole for "insulting the person of the
 King" during a public discussion between members of different unions. Press sen-
 sitivity about the case wassuch that newspapers refrained from reporting details
 of the actual offense and reported only the section number of the law under which
 he was convicted. The severity of the sentence was generally attributed to political
 motivations on the part of the Government.
 Press freedom is significantly restricted, though the limits are not clearly defined.
 Under a 1958 decree the Government controls the licensing of newspapers and jour-
 nals through a registration procedure. In practice the requirement of registration is
 used, both by central and regional authorities, to prevent the issuance of publica-
 tions by organizations or persons considered to be "suspect," for example, those who
 advocate the overthrow of the monarchy. Publications that are issued by persons or
 organizations that have not complied with the registration procedure or that are
 
 
 1060
 
 deemed to be a threat to state security may be seized and destroyed. During 1992
 the Government forbade the distribution of editions of a number of Moroccan publi-
 cations. In May publication of the opposition journal Houriyat al-Mouaten, successor
 to the banned aI-Mouaten, was suspended. In July the related journal al-Mouatana
 was also banned, apparently for its coverage of the Amaoui case. Also in July an
 edition of the Islamist journal Arraya was seized by the Government. The opposition
 daily al-Ittihad al-Ishtiraki complained in September that the Government blocked
 the sale of the journal at Moroccan airports in an effort to prevent its distribution
 abroad.
 The Government also has the power, under Article 55 of the Press Code, to censor
 newspapers directly by ordering them not to report on specific items or events. In
 April the Government invoked Article 55 ordering opposition journals to limit their
 coverage of the Amaoui trial to official Maghreb  ab Press releases. In an unusual
 move, several journals openly defied the order, citing a public duty to publish their
 own reporting of the trial. The Government retaliated by bringing charges against
 the directors of al Anoual and al-Ittihad al-Ishtiraki. Their trials began in May
 after the Amaoui verdict was announced, and the prosecution quickly requested and
 was granted indefinite postponements. An unrelated appeal of Mohamed el Brini
 and Abdelkader Haimer, respectively editor and reporter of Al-Ittihad al-Ishtiraki,
 who were sentenced in 1990 to 3 months in prison for a "defamatory" article on judi-
 cial corruption, was also heard in May. The case was postponed indefinitely, leaving
 the prosecutor the option to raise the case at a later date. The three postponements
 occurred in three different courts on three successive days, all at the prosecution's
 request, prompting widespread speculation about the Government's manipulation of
 the courts.
 The Government does tolerate satirical and often stinging editorials in the opposi-
 tion parties' dailies. In addition, press coverage continued to contain reports of tor-
 ture and abuse of authority and prisoners' complaints of harsh treatment and de-
 grading prison conditions.
 None of the news media is entirely independent of government control, which is
 exercised through directives from the Ministry of Interior and Information. Media
 self-censorship is assisted by the Interior and Information Ministry's practice of of-
 fering "fiidance" on certain topics. The Government owns the official press agency,
 Ma hre Arab Press and the Arabic Daily al Anbaa.
 The Moroccan public has access to a variety of foreign newspapers and magazines,
 particularly from Europe and the United States, that reflect a broad spectrum of
 oinon.   any contain regular and often critical coverage of events in Morocco. The
 vernment continued in 1992, with reduced frequency compared to previous years,
 to ban editions of foreign publications that contained articles about Morocco the au-
 thorities considered particularly offensive. For example, distribution of the February
 13 edition of Le Monde was blocked, apparently because it contained an interview
 with three former Tazmamart prisoners. The Government also seized the November
 and December issues of Le Monde Diplomatique to prevent their distribution in Mo-
 rocco; the November issue contained an interview with Moroccan exile Abraham
 Serfaty, while the December edition included an expose on illegal emigration from
 northern Morocco to Spain. Opposition dailies also reported that distribution of var-
 ious August and September editions of the French journals Le Monde, Liberation,
 Figaro, and Quotidien was banned by the Government because of their coverage of
 the Moroccan constitutional referendum. An issue of the London-based, Arabic-lan-
 guage weekly Al-Wasat was reportedly seized by authorities in December because
 it contained an article on Islamic fundamentalism in Morocco.
 The Government owns the only television station broadcasting nationwide (the
 sole private station, 2-m, can be seen in most urban areas) and one radio station.
 Satellite dish antennas, though expensive, are available, permitting free access to
 a wide variety of foreign broaacasts. Residents of northern Morocco can also receive
 Spanish television with normal antennas. The Government does not impede recep-
 tion of foreign broadcasts.
 Academic freedom is somewhat limited. There are strictures against scholarly in-
 vestigation of the monarchy and Islam, although there continues to be limited re-
 search and publishing on Islam and Islamic fundamentalism.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-This right is significantly re-
 stricted. Although there are constitutional guarantees of assembly and association,
 they are limited by three decrees, dating from 1935, 1939, and 1958, which permit
 the Government to suppress even peace ul demonstrations and mass gatherings. In
 December 1991 and January 1992, local authorities in Casablanca broke up regular
 meetings of the OMDH, claiming that the group had not followed established proce-
 dure for obtaining permission to hold a public meeting. In February the authorities
 finally permitted a meeting after the OMDH publicly threatened legal action. The
 
 
 1061
 Government also banned a number of Labor Day demonstrations and meetings on
 Ma 1.
 MeL Government broke up a variety of other peaceful demonstrations, often ar-
 resting and giving prison terms to the participants. In March the authorities ar-
 rested high schoor students strikin toprtest examination procedures in Safi, Fes,
 and Ifrane. A peaceful gathering of35 ralamist University students in Fes in March
 resulted in convictions and sentnces of up to 1 year in prison. Police arrested 110
 members of the banned Islamist group Justice and Charity who staged a sit-in in
 el Kelaa des Sraghna in May. Sympathizers of the group claimed 12 of the protest-
 ers were "kidnaped" and tortured. Twelve of the protesters were sentenced to prison
 terms. In May three unemployed university graduates were sentenced to 6 months
 in prison and fined for participation in an unapproved march in Rabat.
 The right to form organizations is limited. Under a 1958 decree, persons wishing
 to create an organization must apply to the Ministry of Interior and wait for ap-
 proval before holding meetings. In practice, the Government uses the req-_uirement
 to prevent persons considered"huspect" or who advocate replacement of the monar-
 chy from forming legal organizations. Islamist and leftist groups experienced consid-
 erable difficulty in obtaining official sanction. An Islamist association in Sefrou
 called Dar al Quran complained in April that it was arbitrarily prevented by local
 authorities from meeting. Interference with the right of association also occurs at
 the individual level. In March a member of Justice and Charity was arrested and
 tried solely on the basis of his alleged membership in the organization.
 Political parties must be approved by the Ministry of Interior, which uses this
 power to control participation in the political process. The Islamist group Reform
 and Renewal reportedly was denied status as a political party and chose instead to
 seek an electoral alliance with a small, legal political party
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the official religion of Morocco, 99 percent of Mo-
 roccans are Sunni Muslims, and the King bears the title "Commander of the Faith-
 ful." The Moroccan Jewish community of approximately 7,000 is permitted to prac-
 tice its faith, as are Christians. Although the Constitution provides for freedom of
 worship, only the practice of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism is tolerated in keep-
 ing wit Islamic law and tradition. The King has stated that all religions other than
 Islam, Christianity, and Judaism are heresies. The Baha'i community (150-200 peo-
 ple) has been forbidden to meet or hold communal activities since 1983. Attempting
 to convert a Moroccan to any faith other than Islam is punishable by imprisonment.
 According t Islamic law and tradition, conversion of any kind from Islam is strictly
 prohibited. Moroccan Jews may convert to Islam, but they are not actively encour-
 aged to do so.
 The Government monitors Friday mosque sermons and the curriculum of Koranic
 schools to ensure that approved doctrines are taught. Fundamentalist Islamic activi-
 ties are sometimes subjected to official repression but are largely tolerated so long
 as they remain restricted to the propagation of Islam and educational and charitable
 activities. Islamist groups that question the King's status as Commander of the
 Faithful are suppressed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although freedom of movement within Morocco is guaranteed by the
 Constitution, in practice the security forces set up roadblocks throughout Morocco
 and stop traffic at will. Roadblocks, maintained in some regions in the same spot
 for years, create what some characterize as internal frontiers. In the Western Sa-
 hara, which is administered by Morocco, movement is restricted in areas regarded
 as militarily sensitive.
 Freedom to travel outside Morocco is controlled by the Ministry of Interior
 through passport issuance and immigration control processes. Though delays are not
 uncommon, most Moroccans receive passports within 1 month of application. There
 are frequent allegations of corruption in the passport offices; applicants are report-
 edly forced to pay gratuities to obtain application forms and to make sure that the
 application is not lost in the bureaucratic labyrinth.
 The Government has refused to issue passports to a number of Moroccans includ-
 ing political activists, former political prisoners, and Moroccan Baha'is. In February
 the OMDH    ublished a list of 29 former political prisoners, human rights monitors
 lawyers and others who were denied passports. In December the OMDH said it had
 received an additional 29 complaints and that of the total 58, only 9 had received
 passports during the year. The OMDH said inquiries it made with the Ministry of
 Interior about those and other cases received no response. The organization de-
 scribed instances in which the border police seized passports or otherwise blocked
 the exit of Moroccans trying to leave the country usually without explanation. One
 applicant stated that officials of the Ministry of1 Interior told him thnat, as a pre-
 condition of passport issuance, he would have to sign a statement promising to re-
 
 
 1062
 to the Ministry any political or other information he might gather while abroad.
 man refused and was not issued a passport. In July Casablanca lawyer
 Abderrahim Berrada, who had been seeking renewal of his passport since 1977, re-
 ceived a new passport apparently after a French magazine reporter asked the Inte-
 rior Minister about his case.
 Women must have permission from either their fathers or husbands to obtain a
 passport. A divorced woman must have her father's permission to obtain a passport
 and, if she has custody of children, she must obtain permission from the children's
 father before passports can be issued to the children. In a speech in September
 King Hassan announced he would seek to reform the laws governing passports and
 travel for women, characterizing the male consent requirement as contrary to Islam
 and the Moroccan Constitution.
 There were no reports that the Government deported a Moroccan citizen in 1992.
 Moroccan law considers any person who acquires Moroccan nationality to be a citi-
 zen for life. Moroccans may not renounce their citizenship, though the King may re-
 voke it-which he does very rarely. Tens of thousands of Moroccans hold duarna.
 tionality and travel on passports from two countries; while in Morocco they are re-
 garded as Moroccan citizens. The Government has sometimes refused to recognize
 the right of foreign embassies to act on behalf of dual nationals or even to receive
 information concerning their arrest and imprisonment. Dual nationals also complain
 of harassment by Moroccan immigration inspectors. The law encourages voluntary
 repatriation for Moroccan Jews who have emigrated; Moroccan Jewish emigres, in-
 cluding those with Israeli citizenship, freely visit Morocco. The law also encourages
 the return of Saharans who have opposed Morocco in the Western Sahara conflict.
 Returning former members of the Polisario, a group seeking independence for the
 Western Sahara, who are deemed to pose no threat to security are integrated into
 Moroccan life.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Moroccan citizens do not have the right to change their government peacefully.
 The King, as Head of State, appoints the Prime Minister, who is Head of Govern-
 ment. The Parliament has the theoretical authority to effect change in the system
 of government, but has never exercised it. Moreover, the Constitution may not be
 amended without the King's approval. In 1991 the King expressed his view that de-
 mocratization should come slowly to the region. Two-thirds of the members of Par-
 liament are elected directly by universal adult suffrage, while one-third are elected
 indirectly by municipal councils and by business, labor, and agricultural "chambers."
 The Ministry of Interior appoints provincial governors, though municipal councils
 are elected.
 In May the King announced an electoral process designed to culminate in the elec-
 tion of new municipal councils and a new parliament. The electoral laws were re-
 formed to create electoral commissions with power to oversee the process and to
 hear complaints of irregularities. The administration of the elections remained, in
 spite of opposition party objections, in the hands of the Ministry of Interior. The cre-
 ation of new voter rolls-the fi-st step in the process--took place in July and August
 amid numerous charges of irregularities, some of which were reviewed and corrected
 by the electoral commissions. However, many irregularities, such as government of-
 ficials going door to door to require individuals to register, went uncorrected.
 The first vote under the new electoral process occurred in September in a referen-
 dum on the King's proposal for a revised Constitution. The new Constitution in-
 creases slightly the powers of the Prime Minister and Parliament but leaves no
 question that the King will continue to rule. It also creates a Constitutional Council
 to review the constitutionality of laws, as well as an Economic and Social Council,
 and devolves certain powers to regional political units. Despite the call of four oppo-
 sition parties for nonparticipation in the referendum, official results showed a 97.27
 percent participation rate, with 99.96 percent voting for approval. The results are
 widely regarded as having been manipulated by the Government.
 The balloting process itself was susceptible to abuse in that the voter was re-
 quired to cast one colored ballot (yes or no) and retain the other. The retained ballot
 thus provided evidence of a yes or no vote, and opposition parties claimed that gov-
 ernment officials, especially in rural areas, demanded to see retained ballots in
 order to assure "yes votes. The Parliament, elected in 1984 in a vote challenged
 by opposition parties as having been rigged by the Government and extended in a
 1990 referendum for 2 years, was dissolved at the end of its term in July. Following
 the constitutional referendum in September, municipal and professional organiza-
 tion elections were held in October and direct parliamentary elections are scheduled
 
 
 1063
 for A ril 1993. In the absence of a parliament, King Hassan is, in accordance with
 the Constitution, ruling by decree.
 The old parliament included representatives of nine political parties, including op-
 position parties. The beginning of the new electoral season brought the formation
 of a number of new political parties. By the end of the year, 16 parties were offi-
 il recognized by the Government, and another 5 existed unofficially.
 Women enjoy the right to vote and to run for office. Some women have been elect-
 ed to municipal councils, but there were no women in the Parliament that left office
 in July, and there are no women on the CCDH. In the October 16 local elections,
 despite the King's calls for increased political participation by women, women can-
 didates did not fare well and played a marginal role.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are three officially recognized human rights groups in Morocco: two are af-
 filiated with opposition political parties, while the third is nonpartisan. The Moroc-
 can League for the Defense of Human Rights (MLDHR) (Istiqlal party) and the Mo-
 roccan Human Rights Association (Party of the Socialist Avant Garde) have formed
 a coordinating committee and generally issue joint communiques. The MLDHR
 chose, however, to participate in the CCDH, while the association did not. The non-
 partisan OMDH also chose to participate in the CCDH.
 In general, the Government neither hinders nor cooperates with investigations
 conducted by Moroccan human rights groups. An investigation into the 1990 Fes
 and Tangier riots by the OMDH collapsed because of a lack of cooperation from local
 officials. A parliamentary commission investigating the riots reportedly fared better
 but complained that officials interviewed were concerned mostly with shifting blame
 elsewhere. The commission presented its report to the King at the end of December
 1991, and at least part of it was formally disclosed to Parliament in April. The re-
 port described the incidents, set the number of dead at 43 (the official toll was 5)
 and inured at 360, and made a series of recommendations for reform. By the end
 of the year, no significant stps had been taken to act on those recommendations.
 The Government does not cooperate with international investigation of violations
 of human rights in Morocco. It generally does not respond to inquiries about specific
 political pisners transmitted by diplomatic missions. Reuets by nongovern-
 mental organizations (NGO's) to send investigative teams to Morocco are usually re-
 fused. If allowed in the country, human rights monitors are generally refused access
 by the Government to people or things they want to see. For example a group of
 Spanish union leaders visited Morocco in July to meet with the jailed labor leader
 Noubir Amaoui but was denied access to him.
 n 1990, in response to criticism of Morcco's human rights performance, the King
 created the CCDH which represents Morocco at certain international human rights
 forums such as the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) and with
 foreign NGO's. The Moroccan Government has regularly participated in inter-
 national human rights forums and serves as interim p resident of the Preparatory
 Commission for the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Geneva.
 In February 1991, the CCDH issued a series of recommendations to the King con-
 cerning, inter alia, gvernment contact with international human ights organiza-
 tions. Parliament enacted the recommendations into law in April (sec also Section
 1.d.), and the King promulgated the new laws by decree at the end of 1991. Since
 the issuance of its recommendations, the CCDH has ceased to meet regularly. In
 1992 it focused on sendindelegations to the United States and Europe to present
 government positions on  human rights and on publicizing alleged human rights
 abuses at the Polisario-ontroelled refugee camps at Tindouf. In August the CCDH
 General Secretariat, acting without convening the Council itself, issued a statement
 denouncing the Al Alam list of political prisoners (see Section i.e.) and asserting
 that Morocco has no political prisoners. The statement was sharply attacked by
 human rights groups and opposition parties and was viewed as an indication of gov-
 ernment control of the CCDH. The OMD threatened to withdraw its representa-
 tive on the Council if the CCDH continued to appear to be manipulated by the Gov-
 ernment.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution affirms the legal equality of all Moroccans, and the Government
 does not discriminate based on ethnicity.
 Although there is no official discrimination, Moroccan blacks generally ocupy the
 lower social strata, though a few hold high government or palace positions. sme
 Moroccan descendants ofsub-Saharan African slaves suffer various forms of social
 
 
 1064
 discrimination arising out of prejudices on the part of some Arabs and Berbers, the
 two major ethnic groups in Morocco.
 Under the CriminalCode Moroccan women are accorded the same treatment as
 men but not under Moroccan family and estate law, which is based on the Malikite
 School of Islamic law. In marriage, for example a husband may repudiate his wife,
 but the wife may not repudiate her husband. The situations under which a woman
 may sue for divorce are more limited than for men. Women inherit only half as
 much as their male siblings. Well-educated Moroccan women often succeed profes-
 sionally, particularly in the areas of law, medicine, education, and government serv-
 ice. There are, however, few women in the top echelons of their professions, and
 there are no women ministers or members of Parliament. Women compose approxi-
 mately 24 percent of the work force, with themajority of them in the industrial,
 service, and teaching sectors.
 Women suffer most from inequality in the rural areas. Rural women perform most
 hard physical labor; the rate of literacy is noticeably lower for women than for men;
 and girls are much less likely to be sent to school than boys. Women who earn their
 secondary school diploma, however, have equal access to university training.
 The law and social practices governing violence against women reflect Morocco's
 Islamic culture and the importance placed on the honor of the family. The Criminal
 Code includes severe punishment for men who are convicted of raping a woman or
 girl, and the defendant bears the burden of proving his innocence. Human rights
 monitors estimate, however, that many sexual assaults go unreported because of the
 stigma attached to being a victim. In situations in which the victim is a virgin, fami-
 lies still occasionally opt for the victim to marry the assailant in order to preserve
 honor. Otherwise, in those cases where rape is reported (perhaps as few as 1 in 10),
 the assailant is prosecuted and imprisoned.
 Although a woman who is the victim of wife beating has the right to complain
 to the police, as a practical matter she would not generally do so unless she were
 prepared to file for divorce and leave her husband's home. The law excuses the mur-
 der or injury of a wife who is caught in the act of committing adultery. A woman
 would not be excused of committing violence against her husband under the same
 circumstances.
 The civil law status of Moroccan women is governed by the Moudouwana, or code
 of personal status, which is based in part on the Koran. Women's and other political
 organizations have called for reform of the Moudouwana. Some Islamists attacked
 the move for reform as heretical, and one theologian issued a fatwa, or religious
 opinion, in May saying advocacy of Moudouwana reforms should be punished by
 death. In a series of speeches in August and September, King Hassan announced
 he would consult with women's groups and with senior religious authorities to deter-
 mine what parts of the Moudouwana could be reformed without contravening its Is-
 lamic underpinnings. Noting that reform would take time, he pledged to change the
 family law in a manner consistent with Koranic law to provide women the equal
 treatment guaranteed them in the Constitution.
 Some Berber spokesmen believe that the Berber identity is not adequately main-
 tained because Berber languages are not taught in schools and there are no Berber
 publications (a situation compounded by the lack of a written Berber script). Ber-
 ers are well represented in the Government and the officer corps of the military.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution guarantees "the right of association
 and the right to join any trade union and political organization." Workers are free
 to form and join unions throughout the country. The right is exercised widely but
 not universally. According to the trade union federations, well over a million of Mo-
 rocco's 9 million workers are unionized; 5 percent of the work force is a more accu-
 rate estimate. Substantial numbers of workers in the public sector are unionized.
 Three of the 17 existing trade union federations dominate the labor scene; all are
 organizationally independent of the Government. They are the Union Marocain de
 Travail (UMT) the Confederation Democratique de Travail (CDT) and the Union
 Generale des Travailleurs Marocains (UGTM). The UMT has no political affiliation,
 the CDT is linked to the Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP), and the UGTM
 to the Istiqlal party. Both the USFP and Istiqlal are currently opposition parties.
 Unions are not entirely free of government influence. The internal intelligence
 services of the Ministry of the Interior keep the Government fully apprised of trade
 union activity, and the selection of union officers and the carrying out of their duties
 is sometimes subject to government pressure.
 Workers have the right to strike and do so. Most work stoppages are intended to
 advertise grievances and last 24 hours or less. However, strikes can be prolonged
 and arise not only from economic demands or working conditions but also from
 
 
 1065
 union rivalries- all three of these elements were present in a long and inconclusive
 strike at Casablanca's bus transport authority early in the year. The first months
 of 1992 also saw a series of 24-hour "sector strikes"-by health workers, teachers,
 and transport workers--led by the trade union federations associated with the oppo-
 sition political parties. In the second half of 1992, strike activity was limited.
 Labor activism was dampened by the intimidating effect of the separate arrests,
 trials, and sentencing of Noubir Amaoui and UGTM activist Driss Lagimi.
 Unions belong to regional labor organizations and maintain ties with inter-
 national trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution acknowl-
 edges the right to strike (Article 14), and includes labor organizations among the
 entities that serve to "organize and represent the citizens" (Article 3). An implied
 right to organize and bargain collectively is exercised. The multiplicity of trade
 union federations creates competition to organize workers. Any group of eight work-
 ers may organize, and it is easy for a worker to change trade union affiliation. Thus
 a single factory may contain several independent locals or locals affiliated with more
 than one labor federation.
 In both the process of organizing and during collective bargaining, labor laws are
 observed most often in the corporate and parastatal sectors of the economy where
 ad hoc government mediation and arbitration procedures to promote worker-em-
 ployer negotiations are more easily applied. These mediation procedures do not in
 practice limit unions' freedom to bargain collectively. The unions' most common
 complaint against employers is that they refuse to negotiate seriously.
 In the informal and underground economies and in the textile and artisanal
 (handicrafts) fields, labor laws and regulations are routinely ignored. Small employ-
 ers, especially in the agricultural sector, are often ignorant of labor laws and regula-
 tions. While the protection of the right to organize and bargain collectively exists
 in the Constitution and Labor Law, the Government does not always enforce the
 protections fully. As a practical matter, in Morocco the unions have no judicial re-
 course to oblige the Government to act when it has not met its obligations under
 the law. Moreover, political considerations often lead the Government to hinder the
 full exercise of worker rights in an effort to control the unions.
 Laws protecting collective bargaining are not highly developed. In some parts of
 the industrial and parastatal sectors there is a long-established tradition of collec-
 tive bargaining, but this practice is not spreading to emerging sectors of the econ-
 omy. The wages of unionized workers are established through practices that include
 discussions between employer and worker representatives. However, wages for the
 vast majority of workers are set unilaterally by the employer.
 In the industrial sector collective bargaining agreements are often invoked in
 legal disputes when a worker claims to have been reprimanded or dismissed for
 trade union activity. Employers usually cite work-related reasons for the dismissals.
 An employer intending to fire workers without replacing them must apply in ad-
 vance to the provincialgovernor through the labor inspetor's office. In cases where
 employers plan to replace fired workers, the labor inspector provides replacements
 and mediates the cases of workers who protest their dismissal. Any worker fired for
 a serious infraction, such as sabotage, is entitled by law to a court hearing.
 Notwithstanding legal safeguards, employers regularly fire workers for trade
 union activity that they see as threatening to employer interests. Reinstatement is
 sometimes ordered by courts, but legal proceedings can be expensive and time-con-
 suming. Labor complainants are often vindicated in court proceedings, but court de-
 cisions awarding damages and back pay can be difficult to enforce. Ministry of
 Labor inspectors serve as investigators and conciliators in labor disputes; the in-
 spectors are not very effective, however, because they are few in number, carry
 heavy workloads, and do not have the resources to investigate all cases. In addition
 to pursuing their complaints through the Ministry of Labor's inspectors, unions in-
 creasingly are going directly to court with their corplaints.
 Moroccan labor law applies equally to the small an er export zone. The propor-
 tion of unionized workers there is about the same as in  orocco as a whole.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Morocco has ratified both Inter-
 national Labor Organization (ILO) Conventions against forced labor. The ILO's
 Committee of Experts in its report for 1990 noted, however, that there is no Moroc-
 can legal or constitutional prohibition against forced or compulsory labor. As far as
 is known, forced or compulsory labor is not practiced in Morocco.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Children may not be legally em-
 ployed or apprenticed before age 12. Special regulations govern the employment of
 children between the ages of 12 and 16. In practice, children are often apprenticed
 before age 12, particularly in artisanal work. The argument is made that they need
 to acquire skills, such as weaving or rug-making, before they reach the age of 12.
 
 
 1066
 Safety and health conditions as well as salaries in enterprises employing children
 are often substandard. The use of minors is common in the rug-making and tanning
 industries. Children are also employed informally as domestics and usually receive
 little or no wages. Poverty and a pervasive cultural acceptance of child labor keep
 abuse of the child labor laws prevalent nationwide. The Ministry of Labor, through
 its corps of labor inspectors, is responsible for enforcing child labor regulations.
 Child labor laws are generally well observed in the industrialized, unionized sector
 of the economy. The inspection mandate of labor inspectors does not, however, in-
 clude domestic employees.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The King in May set a new minimum indus-
 trial wage and granted a wage increase to agricultural workers. Despite food, diesel
 fuel, and public transport subsidies, a family cannot maintain a decent standard of
 living on the minimum wage of a single worker. In many cases several members,
 some of them working in the informal economy, combine their income to support the
 family. The minimum wage is not enforced effectively in the informal and artisanal
 sectors of the economy. It is enforced fairly effectively throughout the industrialized,
 unionized sector of the economy, though unionists complain that employers often,
 by means of deductions and other techiniques, pay their workers less than the law
 requires.
 Most workers in the industrial sector of the economy, except for those employed
 in garment assembly, earn more than minimum wage. Moreover, workers are cus-
 tomarily paid between 13 and 16 months' salary for every 12-month year. The infor-
 mal sector provides a safety net for those who would otherwise be unemployed or
 underemployed. The extensive parallel economy employs directly or indirectly an es-
 timated 50 to 75 percent of the working population, often in part-time jobs. The law
 provides a 48-hour maximum workweek, with not more than 10 hours or any single
 day, premium pay for overtime, paid public and annual holidays, and minimum con-
 ditions for health and safety, including the prohibition of night work for women and
 minors. As with other regulations and laws, these are observed unevealy, if at all,
 in the informal sector. Labor inspectors endeavor to monitor working conditions, ac-
 cidents, and labor disputes, but lack sufficient resources and authority to investigate
 many complaints and mandate full compliance with the law.
