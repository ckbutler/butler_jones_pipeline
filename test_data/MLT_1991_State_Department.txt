 MALTA
 Malta is a constitutional republic and parliamentary democracy.
 Executive power is vested in a president who appoints as prime
 minister the leader of the party which gains a plurality of
 seats in the quinquennial elections for the unicameral
 legislature. The two major political parties reflect widely
 divergent political views. After 16 years of Labor Party rule,
 the election in 1987 brought the Nationalist Party to power
 with a one-seat majority in Parliament.
 Law enforcement and internal security are the responsibility of
 the Malta police under the command of a civilian commissioner.
 The Minister of the Interior (concurrently Minister of
 Education) has jurisdiction over the police. A specially
 trained riot police, the Special Assignments Group (SAG), forms
 part of the regular police force. Although human rights is a
 subject included in the curriculum of the police academy, there
 are reports of police brutality.
 The Maltese economy is a mix of state-controlled and private
 firms. Malta is heavily dependent on tourism. Foreign private
 investment in export-oriented, light manufacturing industry is
 actively promoted, and the Government is also developing Malta
 as a container transshipment point and a center for offshore
 business activities.
 The Maltese Government is strongly committed to human rights.
 Constitutional protection for the fundamental rights and
 freedoms of the individual is upheld by an independent
 judiciary. Women encounter a degree of culturally based
 inequality. In 1991 the Government passed an amendment to the
 Constitution, to become effective in July 1993, which prohibits
 discrimination based on sex and stipulates equal rights for
 women workers.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There have been no reports of political killing.
 b. Disappearance
 No cases of political disappearance are known to have occurred.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits inhuman or degrading punishment or
 treatment. These prohibitions are generally respected in
 practice. Allegations of mistreatment by prison authorities of
 a foreigner imprisoned for drug smuggling caused the Government
 to conduct a legal inquiry into the case, the results of which
 were pending at year's end.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention is provided for in
 the Constitution and generally respected in practice. The
 police may, on the basis of reasonable suspicion, arrest a
 person for questioning. Within 4a hours, persons so arrested
 must be brought before the court and charged or released.

 There is no right to legal counsel during this 48-hour period.
 Persons incarcerated pending trial have access to counsel, and
 periodic hearings are mandatory. Provision for bail exists.
 There are no reports of political exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution requires a fair public trial before an
 impartial court. Defendants have the right to counsel of their
 choice, at public expense if necessary. They-enjoy a
 presumption of innocence, may confront witnesses and present
 evidence, and have the right of appeal. The courts'
 jurisdiction is limited in certain areas. Lay tribunals (e.g.,
 the Industrial Tribunal, the Cormissioners for Justice, and the
 Inheritance Partition Tribunal) have exclusive authority over
 certain judicial functions, although their independence is not
 legally guaranteed. Defendants in cases before the Industrial
 Tribunal or the Public Service Commission may not be represented
 by lawyers.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Protection of the privacy of the home is ensured by the
 Constitution and generally respected in practice. Search
 warrantsmay be issued, on reasonable suspicion of crime, by
 police officers above the rank of inspector without a court
 order. Electronic surveillance is prohibited by law.
 Membership and participation in political parties is
 voluntary. However, there is strong societal (e.g., family,
 employment) pressure for affiliation with particular parties.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression (speech and presd) is protected by the
 Constitution and generally respected in practice. The only
 exception is the 1987 constitutional amendment that bans
 foreign participation in local politics (e~g., guest foreign
 speakers sponsored by a political party) during the period
 prior to an election.
 In 1991 the Government passed a new broadcasting law, which
 effectively ended state monopoly of the brbadcast media. It
 provided for the licensing of private radio stations, including
 stations for the political parties and the Catholic Church, and
 laid down legal guidelines for a commercial cable television
 system, which is expected to be in operation in 1992.
 Ten privately owned daily, weekly, and monthly newspapers freely
 express partisan views. Several newspapers are associated with
 political parties. Academic freedom generally is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of peaceful assembly is provided for in the
 Constitution. Police permits are routinely issued for political
 meetings and other public activities of political parties or
 groups of citizens.

 c. Freedom of Religion
 The right to practice the religion of one's choice is protected
 constitutionally and is respected. The overwhelmingly dominant
 religion is Roman Catholicism; small numbers of people practice
 other religions. State subsidies are granted only to Catholic
 schools. In the state schools, students have the opportunity
 at some stage to opt for religious instruction in the Catholic
 faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country,
 foreign travel, or emigration. Maltese emigrants who have
 acquired the citizenship of another country and resided abroad
 for a minimum of 6 years may hold dual citizenship.
 Foreign nationals claiming refugee status while visiting Malta
 generally are not permitted to remain in Malta but are allowed
 to stay until arrangements have been made for settlement in a
 third country. The Emigrants' Commission, established in 1987
 as the local representative of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), has worked well in providing
 assistance and counseling for refugees until they are accepted
 by the UNHCR.
 In 1991 some 700 Albanians on board two ships sought refuge in
 Malta. The Government handled the influx in an orderly and
 humanitarian manner, providing the refugees with food, clothing,
 and some money. However, they were not permitted to remain.
 One ship departed voluntarily, and passengers from the other
 ship were returned expeditiously by air to Albania. The
 refugees reportedly never asked for asylum.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Malta is a parliamentary democracy in which the incumbent
 Nationalist Party and the opposition Malta Labor Party dominate
 public life. Political activity is often intense, and partisan
 feelings can be very pronounced, heated, and polarized.
 Elections in which all parties participate freely are held
 every 5 years, with universal suffrage for those 18 years of
 age and over. During the 1987 election, 96.11 percent of those
 registered actually voted.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several local human rights groups and persons interested in
 promoting and protecting human rights operate freely. The
 Government places no restrictions on investigations by
 international human rights groups. It is strongly committed to
 human rights and is active in international human rights forums.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Maltese citizens have a legal right to housing, employment, and
 education on a nondiscriminatory basis. The commissions
 established by the Government to process complaints of
 injustice inflicted during the preyious government's rule
 continued their investigations of alleged injustice with
 
 
 118I
 MALTA
 respect to the appointments to public offices, the granting of
 licenses, permits, and government contracts, and the provision
 of public services.
 For reasons derived from tradition and culture, Maltese society
 has only recently begun to associate women's rights with human
 rights. In 1991 the Government approved the publication of a
 draft bill in the form of a white paper giving women and men
 equal status in marriage. The bill would amend the existing
 family law which subordinates married women to their husbands
 in economic and financial matters, as well as authority over
 the children. The draft bill was being widely publicized and
 debated at yedr's end.
 In 199i the Government passed a constitutional amendment, to
 become effective in July 1993, prohibiting all forms of
 discrimination based on sex, with the particular aim of
 ensuring equal rights for working women and the same wages for
 the same work as men.
 There are no laws specifically prohibiting abuse of women.
 Violence in the family and abuse against women and children
 have only recently been brought out in the open. According to
 women's groups, violence is more widespread than was previously
 believed. A church refuge for women, which also assists
 battered women, is partially supported by the Government.
 There is also a privately organized association engaged in
 counseling and assisting battered women. In response to
 pressure by this association and the government-established
 Commission for the Advancement of Women, the Government
 introduced specialized training for police to deal with family
 violence.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right, respected in practice, to associate
 freely and to strike. The only groups restrained from striking
 are the uniformed personnel of the armed forces and the
 police. In 1991 there were 24 registered trade unions
 representing 50 percent of the work force.
 Although the Government encourages the development of free
 trade unions, the largest trade union in Malta, the Gerneral
 Workers Union, is institutionally tied to the Malta Labor
 Party. The other, smaller unions are generally independent of
 political parties. Maltese unions belong to a variety of
 international trade union groupings.
 During the first 9 months of 1991, there were eight strikes.
 All were short stoppages with a maximum duration of 2 days and
 a minimum of 2 hours; Reasons for the strikes ranged from
 working conditions to recognition of trade unions. There were
 no major disputes.
 Under the Industrial Relations Act of 1976, the responsible
 minister may refer disputes to the Industrial Tribunal for
 binding settlement. The International Labor Organization (ILO)
 objects to that provision, most recently in the 1991 Committee
 of Experts report, pointing out that it in effect limits the
 right to strike; however, both labor and employers appear to
 have no objection to the clause. In practice, a striking union
 can ignore an unfavorable decision by continuing the strike on
 another ground. The Government has initiated a study of the
 
 
 1182
 MALTA
 1976 Act aimed at bringing it into conformity with European
 Community laws as well as ILO Convention 87 on freedom of
 association and improving certain provisions, such as those
 affecting job security.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are free, in law and in practice, to organize and
 bargain collectively. While most wages are negotiated between
 unions and employers, the Government in 1990 mandated a
 substantial nationwide wage increase after reaching agreement
 with the unions and employers. On December 10, 1990, the three
 social partners (government, trade unions, and employers)
 signed a comprehensive agreement regulating industrial
 relations and income policy. Cost of living increases are now
 established in accordance with government statistics based on
 the retail price index as calculated by a tripartite,
 independent committee. During the term of this 3-year
 agreement, the Malta Council for Economic Development will
 inform all three partners semiannually of the projected changes
 in tne price index. The projections are to serve as a basis
 for negotiations on collective agreements.
 According to the Industrial Relations Act, an employer may not
 take action against any employee because he or she belongs to a
 trade union. Complaints may be addressed through a court of
 law or an industrial tribunal composed of one member each named
 by the employer, the union, and the Government. Complaints of
 discrimination may also be lodged with the Commission against
 Injustices.
 There are no export processing zones in Malta.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is constitutionally prohibited and does not
 exist. Any claimed violations would be submitted for
 adjudication to the Constitutional Court.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children younger than 16 years may not legally be employed.
 The law is generally respected and the Department of Labor,
 which is responsible for enforcement, does so effectively.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legal minimum wage, which is generally enforced, provides a
 decent standard of living for a worker and family when
 government subsidies for housing, health care, and free
 education are also added in.
 Maximum hours of work are regulated by Wage Council orders for
 various trades. For most sectors, the maximum is 40 hours per
 week, but in some trades the maximum allowable is 43 or 45
 hours per week. Government labor regulations prescribe daily
 rest periods of 1 hour. The annual paid vacation according to
 law is currently 22 working days. In general, these laws and
 regulations are effectively enforced by the Department of Labor.
 The proposed establishment of an authority for workers' health,
 safety, and welfare has still not materialized. Enforcement of
 occupational health and safety standards, the responsibility of
 the Department of Labor, has been lax. Existing laws are
 outdated and inadequate to protect workers effectively.
