 ITALY
 Italy is a democratic, multiparty republic with a parliamentary system of govern-
 ment. Legislative power is vested in the Parliament, which is directly and freely
 elected on the basis of universal adult suffrage. Executive authority is vested in the
 Council of Ministers, headed by the President of the Council. Italy's judiciary is
 independent of the executive but subject to political party pressure. The Chief of
 State, the President of the Republic, is elected by Parliament and representatives
 of Italys 20 regions.
 Terrrist violence of both the left and right has remained at low levels in recent
 years. The virtual elimination of terrorism has freed law enforcement resources for
 the struggle against organized crime, which remains a serious problem. Some Major
 terrorist crimes of the 1970's and 1980's remain unsolved.
 Italy has an industrialized market economy which is among the world's largest.
 It is characterized by sizable government ownership of the primary industrial sec-
 tore and a private sector in which small and medium-sized companies are especially
 dynamic.
 Italy continued to experience a substantial influx of third world and Eastern Eu-
 ropean immigrants, and increased public attention was devoted to the problem of
 racism. The human rights situation continues to be good, and the Government open-
 ly addresses human rights issues which arise.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect For the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kilhing.-Neither government forces nor legal
 opposition organizations engaged in politically motivatedkillings.
 b.Disappearance.-There were no cases of politically motivated disappearance or
 kidnapings. Six persons continue to be held by kidnapers.
 S        eand Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Freedom from torture is provided for by law and respected in practice. Cruel and
 degrading punishment is forbidden by law. While cases of violations have been rare,
 there have been credible reports that detainees and prisoners were abused during
 olice interrogation in several cases. Those perpetrating ill-treatment rarely have
 teen the object of disciplinary proceedings.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detentn, or Exile.-Polie procedures are carefully controlled
 by law and judicial oversight. Arbitrary arrest is not practiced. Anyone detained by
 the authorities must be charged within 48 hours. Italian law imposes strict time
 limits on pretrial detention, which includes all detention prior to the conclusion of
 all appeals. In normal criminal cases, the maximum permissible duration of pretrial
 detention varies according to the gravity of the crime. The maximum time that any
 person may be held in pretrial detention is 4 years, with no more than 2 years at
 each step of the trial and during the appeals process. The Government has moved
 to extend the total period to 6 years for defendants accused of Mafia-related crimes.
 Pretrial detention is not permitted for minor offenses. Judges may grant provi-
 sional liberty to persons awaiting trial. As a safeguard against abuse, "liberty tribu-
 nals" are empowered to re4ew evidence in cases of persons awaiting trial and to
 decide whether continued detention is warranted.
 Exile abroad as a form of punishment is unknown. Legislation adopted in July
 requires persons convicted of Mafia-type offenses to move their residence to their
 region of origin.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-A fair and public trial is assured by law and
 broadly observed in practice. Counsel is provided for the accused, free of charge if
 necessary. Good faith efforts are made to guarantee due process rights. Neverthe-
 less, trial procedures can be cumbersome, and trials freuently last years.
 A revised Code of Criminal Procedure which entered into force in 1989 seeks to
 streamline the process. The revised Code provides for a more adversarial system de-
 siened to romote speedier trials. Unfamiliarity with the new system on the part
 
 
 810
 of judicial authorities, as well as bureaucratic problems, has led to disappointing re-
 suits.
 All court cases may be appealed to the highest appellate court,the Court of Cassa-
 tion. There are no politica or security courts or political prisoners. The judiciary is
 independent of the executive, but it is widely accepted that the political views of
 individual judges and their links to political parties may affect proceedings. Judges
 are subect to intimidation by organized crime. Two prominent judges investigating
 the Mafia were murdered in Sicily, one in May and one in July. In August the Gov-
 ernment passed a comprehensive anticrime bill, and in September and October
 there were several arrests of prominent alleged Mafia figures. In September the
 Italian Judicial Directorate (CSM) began an investigation of a judge on Italys High
 Court of Appeals for alleged technical errors in reaching judgments in Mafia trials.
 Newspapers alleged that his decisions to release numerous alleged Mafia figures
 over the years were influenced by political figures and organized crime.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 concept of the privacy of the home is safeguarded legally and respected by the au-
 thorities. Searches and electronic monitoring may be carried out only under judicial
 warrant and in carefully defined circumstances.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Free speech and a free press are assured under
 Italy's democratic political system, which allows expression of a wide spectrum of
 political views. Although there is no censorship, publications may be seized for viola-
 tion of obscenity laws or for defamation of state institutions. These powers are sel-
 dom invoked.
 In addition to government-run radio and television, many private radio stations
 exist; political views of these stations differ widely. A lively political debate over the
 issue of media regulation reflects public concern over the potential for monopolistic
 power on the part of the private media. The Government's recent allocation of pri-
 vate television channels was a controversial issue during the year because of the
 belief that some political parties hope to gain an advantage from the distribution
 of stations through their links with the private owners.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Italian citizens freely exercise
 their right of peaceful assembly, which is limited only in cases where national secu-
 rity or public safety is endangered. Permits are not required for meetings, but orga-
 nizers of public demonstrations must notify the police in advance. Professional and
 employer associations organize and represent their constituencies freely.
 c. Freedom of Religion. -Persons are free to profess and practice any religious
 faith. All religions are free to organize and proselytize within the limits imposed by
 the laws governing public order. Italy's relations with the Roman Catholic Church
 are governed by a 1984 agreement (Concordat) between the Government and the
 Holy See, which was ratified in 1985. The agreement, which replaced the Concordat
 of 1929, recognizes the rights and place of Catholicism but no longer accords it the
 status of a state religion. The Roman Catholic Church continues informally to enjoy
 special standing in Italy because of the presence of the Vatican and because the
 overwhelming majority of Italians is Roman Catholic. Taxpayers may elect to des-
 ignate a small percentage (determined by law) of their tax payment to the Catholic
 Church or to other denominations or humanitarian organizations. This year the Ad-
 ventist Church has also applied to receive state subsidies. When taxpayers do not
 specify other denominations or organizations, their payments are proportionally di-
 vided between the Catholic Church and the Adventist church on tl.e basis of the
 total percentage of voluntary donations received by each denomination.
 Roman Catholic religious instruction is offered in the public schools as an optional
 subject. The Ministry of Education has not resolved a controversy over the "hour
 of religion" in schools. Proponents of religious instruction have advocated that stu-
 dents who choose not to enroll in a religion course spend the hour studying another
 subject instead. The Constitutional Court expressed the view that it would violate
 the students' rights to force them to do so. Some schools, however, have not followed
 the Court's view, which has the effect of an advisory opinion, and the issue remains
 open.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Italian citizens may travel freely both within the country and abroad.
 Emigration is unrestricted. Citizens who leave are guaranteed the right to return,
 and the Constitution forbids deprivation of citizenship for political reasons. During
 the year, the Government proposed a bill for the ratification of the European Com-
 munity's (EC) Schengen Treaty on open borders among EC members.
 In 1992 approximately 7,000 official and 10,000 unregistered refugees came to
 Italy from the former Yugoslavia. according to the statistics of the United Nations
 
 
 811
 High Commissioner for Refugees in August. The Italian Government arranged for
 their temporary stay. Some regional governments provided assistance for employ-
 ment, housing, health care, and education.
 A new law on citizenship which came into force in August reduced from 5 to 3
 years the period of residence necessary for immigrants to take on Italian citizenship.
 Although details of the new law are still in dispute in the Constitutional Court, the
 law also, in effect, recognizes dual nationality for the first time by providing that
 Italian expatriates do not give up their Italian citizenship when they are natural-
 ized in another country.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Italy has a parliamentary system. Members of Parliament are elected on the basis
 of universal adult suffrage. Although the Constitution outlaws the Fascist party, a
 wide range of organized and active political parties exists from the far left to the
 far right of the political spectrum. Election campaigns are free and open, and voting
 is by secret ballot. The two chambers of Parliament and regional, provincial, and
 municipal councils are elected either at regular intervals of 5 years or when special
 elections are called by the President of the Republic.
 There are no restrictions in law on the participation of women in government and
 politics. Political and social customs result, however, in a lower percentage of par-
 ticipation by women than by men.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental organizations, including human rights organizations, are free to
 investigate conditions in Italy, attend trials, and publish their findings.
 The Italian Government and nongovernmenta human rights organizations sup-
 port human rights around the world. Italy participates fully in various international
 human rights organizations and is a strong supporter of respect for human rights
 and fundamental freedoms.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 There is no legal discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex, ethnic back-
 ground, or political opinion. Recently enacted changes in the special statute for Alto
 Adige give German speakers there additional safeguards. The statute received final
 approval in 1992 from the Government of Austria; it provides a highly advanced set
 of regulations for safeguarding a minority. A new problem is emerging in the region,
 however, as the Italian-speaking community in the Alto Adige claims reverse dis-
 crimination. Italian speakers, a minority in parts of the region, have been leaving
 the area, where they have difficulty obtaining employment.
 North Africans residing and working in Italy and the population of Gypsy origin
 have been subject to discrimination. Employees of international organizations from
 third-world countries living in Rome report more difficulty than their European col-
 leagues in finding housing . The Government funds nonprofit organizations which
 provide social assistance to third world nationals living in Italy. In this area, the
 Government also works closely with the Italian Catholic Church, which has been a
 powerful public voice condemning discrimination against, and mistreatment of, mi-
 norities.
 The Lombard League and other grass-roots political groupings which espouse sep-
 aratist and nationalist themes continue to attract followers. Some of the League s
 positions are widely perceived to have racist overtones. The Lombard League's posi-
 tion in favor of strict limits on third-world immigration into Italy, and on the rights
 and benefits which those immigrants enjoy once in Italy, are two examples cited by
 critics. Another is the League's advocacy of greater self-government for the north
 on the grounds that the poorer regions of southern Italy are culturally and eth-
 nically distinct areas that inhibit the economic growth and development of the more
 prosperous north.         .
 There were aggressive racial incidents aimed at foreigners and immigrants. Immi-
 grant lodgings have been destroyed by arson. "Skinheads" knifed two North Africans
 and beat up foreign students. They also claimed responsibility for the December 8
 attack in Rome on a Somali-brn Italian indigent who was severely burned when
 hit by a thrown container of burning liquid. The Government quickly denounced the
 incident and mounted an investigation to find the perpetrators.
 Despite official efforts to integrate the Gypsy population into Italian society,
 Gypsy communities continue to stand out and to attract negative, sometimes violent
 attention. Such attention is based, at least in part, on the increase in pickpocketing
 and other street crimes in which some members of these groups appear to be pre-
 dominant participants. During the first half of 1992, trailers in Gypsy camps in
 
 
 812
 Rome and Bologna were set on fire. Police regularly investigate such incidents, and
 the Government prosecutes perpetrators. Local administrations and communities
 have shown sensitivity to the need to ensure equal treatment of those who belong
 to nomadic groups and who are, for the most part, Italian citizens. Approximately
 4,000 Gypsies reside in the greater Rome area. Most of them live in precarious and
 unhygienic conditions.
 There are about 35,000 Jews in Italy who are, for the most part, well assimilated.
 In the second half of 1992, there were sporadic anti-Semitic incidents, such as the
 desecration of tombs in a Jewish cemetery, appearance of anti-Semitic graffiti, and
 threatening, anonymous letters. On November 9, over 100,000 Italians turned out
 for marches in more than 33 cities on the 54th anniversary of Kristallnacht to show
 solidarity against renewed outbreaks of anti-Semitism in Europe. The marches were
 addressed by major politicians of the Italian left, right, and center. Government offi-
 cials and the leaders of the Catholic Church of Italy have led efforts to counter
 manifestations of anti-Semitism in Italy. On November 5 about 100 members of a
 Jewish youth group assaulted the Roman headquarters of a small neo-Nazi organi-
 zation.
 Women participate freely in political and social life, but despite legal guarantees,
 employers continue to favor men over women in filling jobs, particularly those with
 prospects for advancement to management. In 1992, 2 of 25 cabinet members, 31
 of 325 senators, and 51 of 630 deputies in the lower house were women. Women
 fill only 3.3 percent of managerial positions and are poorly represented in the pro-
 fessions. Women tend to remain in traditional employment areas, although there
 are female police officers in many Italian cities. Until the early 1960's, employers
 could legally dismiss a woman who married. Since 1963 it has been illegal to dis-
 miss a female employee within 1 year of her marriage date except "for cause." Some
 sectoral labor agreements contain a paragraph prohibiting sexual harassment.
 Women enjoy equal rights with men in marriage. In the event of divorce, a woman
 is entitled to a share of the survivor's pension and any inheritance in the event of
 the death of her ex-husband. The property of a married couple is considered commu-
 nity property unless husband and wife agree to keep their property divided. All as-
 sets acquired prior to marriage are exempt from the community property provision.
 Italian legislation provides women protection from physical abuse. Police and
 judges are not reluctant to intervene and mete out punishment in such cases. Al-
 though there are no reliable studies indicating statistically the extent of domestic
 violence against women, newspaper reports of such violence are common. The Prime
 Minister's Office on the Status of Women has stated that, while laws exist to punish
 those who commit acts of violence against women, and the laws are enforced, vic-
 tims often do not bring charges due to fear, shame, or ignorance of the law. In re-
 cent years, Italy has manifested growing concern over violence against children. A
 nationwide telephone hotline service to help abused children was established in
 1987. It has received over 200,000 calls since its inception. Parliament is considering
 legislation to bring Italy into conformity with the Declaration of the World Summit
 for Children.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Workers' Statute of 1970 provides for the right
 to establish trade unions, to join unions, and to carry out union activities in the
 workplace. Trade unions are not government controlled, and the Constitution fully
 protects the right to strike, which is frequently exercised. In practice, the three
 major labor confederations possess status and influence (in comparison to the small-
 er independent unions) for reasons that go well beyond their membership size. They
 have strong ideological ties to the three major political parties and administer cer-
 tain social welfare services for the Government, which compensates them accord-
 ingly. Moreover, the Workers' Statute favors the three confederations to the extent
 that it is difficult for small unions, including the so-called "base committees"
 (COBAS) at the shop floor level, to obtain recognition. In 1990, however, one of the
 COBAS, the locomotive engineers, was recognized and admitted to the bargaining
 table.
 A 1990 law limits the right to strike in essential public services such as transpor-
 tation, sanitation, and health. Public sector workers not covered by these restric-
 tions engaged in demonstrations and a partial general strike in late 1992 in protest
 against government economic policies. Italian unions associated freely and actively
 with international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right of workers to orga-
 nize and bargain collectively is protected by the Constitution and is freely practiced
 throughout the country. Labor-management relations are governed by legislation,
 custom. collective bargaining agreements, and labor contracts. A key element of
 
 
 labor-management-government cooperation affecting the industrial relations cli-
 mate, the 1986 agreement on indexing wages (scaa mobile) to the cost of living
 every 6 months, was nullified in December 1991 when the major labor confed-
 erations accepted its termination as part of a new system of adjustments to be
 worked out in 1992. No new system was worked out, and on July 31, 1992, another
 tripartite agreement was negotiated, permanently abolishing the old system.
 National collective bargaining agreements in practice apply to all workers, regard-
 less of union membership. Collective bargaining at the national level (involving the
 three confederations, the public and private employers' organizations, and, were
 appropriate, the Government) occurs irregularly and deals with issues of mutual
 concern. Sectoral negotiations involving national-level industry unions and employ-
 era' organizations typically occur every 3 or 4 years and cover all aspects of labor
 relations; they also apply to all workers, whether unionized or not. Voluntary,
 nonbinding mediation is provided by the Ministry of Labor and is often effective in
 bringing labor and management together.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union members
 and organizers. A 1990 law encourages workers in small enterprises (i.e., less than
 16 employees) to join unions and requires "just cause" for dismissals from employ-
 ment. Protection of worker rights in the case of transfer of company ownership is
 provided in a new law which brings Italy into compliance with a European Commu-
 nity directive on the subject. The law requires that the unions of both the former
 and the new owners' companies be consulted in advance of the sale and that no
 worker benefits be lost as a result of the transfer.
 There are no areas of the country, such as export processing zones, where union
 organizations and collective bargaining are impeded or discouraged.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and does not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under current legislation no child
 under 15 years of age may be employed (with some specified exceptions). We Min-
 istr of Labor, having consulted with the labor organizations, may, as an exception,
 authorize the employment of children over 12 years of age on specific jobs . There
 are also specific restrictions on employment in various dangerous or unhealthful oc-
 cupations up to the age of 18 for men and 21 for women. No women, regardless of
 age, are permitted to be employed underground in quarries, mines, or tunnels. In
 general, minimum age laws are effectively enforce  However, some employment of
 children occurs in the shadow economy, particularly in the agricultural sector in the
 less prosperous southern parts of Italy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage set under Italian
 law; basic wage and salary levels are set forth in collective bargaining agreements.
 National collective bargaining agreements contain minimum standards to which in-
 dividual employment contracts must conform. In the absence of agreement between
 the parties, the courts may step in to determine fair wages on the basis of practice
 in related activities or related collective bargaining agreements.
 Working time and safety standards are established by law and buttressed and ex-
 tended in collective labor contracts. The Basic Law of 1923 provides for a maximum
 workweek of 48 hours-no more than 6 days per week and 8 hours per day. The
 8-hour day may be exceeded for some special categories. Most collective bargaining
 agreements provide for a 36- to 38-hour week. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours
 per day or an average of 12 hours per week.
 Basic health and safety standards and guidelines for compensation for on-the-job
 injuries are set forth in an extensive body of law and regulations. In most cases
 these standards are exceeded in collective bargaining agreements. Enforcement of
 health and safety regulations is entrusted to labor inspectors, who are employees
 of local health units and have, the same status as judicial police officers. Inspectors
 make periodic visits to companies to ensure observance of safety regulaticns. Viola-
 tors may be fined or even imprisoned; it is common for Italian judges to fine employ-
 ers guilty of infractions. Trade unions also play an important role in reporting sae-
 ty violations to inspectors. Still, coverage is hampered by the inadequate number
 of inspectors. Because of high unemployment, there is also pressure on workers to
 accept unsafe conditions if they want jobs. There are many substandard work places
 in Italy, especially in the south.
