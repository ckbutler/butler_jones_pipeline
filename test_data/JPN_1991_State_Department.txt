 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy based on a constitution
 adopted in 1947. Sovereignty is vested in the people, and the
 Emperor is defined as the symbol of state. On the national
 level, power is divided among executive, legislative, and
 judicial branches. Executive power is vested in a cabinet,
 composed of a prime minister and ministers of state responsible
 to the Diet, Japan's two-house parliament. The Diet, elected
 by universal suffrage and secret ballot, designates the prime
 minister, who must be a member of that body. Nearly 70 percent
 of the electorate usually votes in general elections, contested
 by six political parties covering a broad ideological spectrum.
 For the last 36 years the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
 has held a parliamentary majority. The judicial system has
 several layers of courts, with the Supreme Court as final
 authority.
 A well-organized and disciplined police force generally
 respects the human rights of the populace. However, there
 continued to be reports of harsh treatment of suspects in
 custody. The police force is firmly under the control of the
 civil authorities. The Civil Liberties Bureau in the Ministry
 of Justice and the Human Rights and Refugee Division in the
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs monitor problems relating to human
 rights practices in Japan.
 Japan's free market economy has the world's second largest
 gross national product. Increased consumer demand and capital
 investment have maintained the economy's steady expansion over
 the last 5 years.
 The Constitution states: "All of the people are equal under the
 law and there shall be no discrimination in political,
 economic, or social relations because of race, creed, sex,
 social status, or family origin." The human rights assured by
 the Constitution and Bill of Rights are secured by a just and
 efficient legal system. However, the "Burakumin" (a group
 traditionally treated.as outcasts), the Ainu (Japan's
 indigenous people), women, and alien residents experience
 varying degrees of discrimination. Current laws against
 discrimination contain virtually no penalties for offenders.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known cases of political or other extrajudicial
 killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of abductions, secret arrests,
 ,clandestine detention, or hostage holding by security forces or
 any other organization.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is provided for in the Constitution. According to
 reports by several Japanese bar associations, police often use
 physical violence, including kickings and beatings, to obtain
 
 
 877
 JAPAN
 confessions from suspects in custody. While such abuse remains
 a problem, several courts have overturned convictions obtained
 by forced confession. No such cases were reported in 1991.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is provided for
 in the Constitution and respected in practice. Japanese law
 provides for judicial determination of the legality of
 detention. Persons cannot be detained without charge, and
 prosecuting authorities must be prepared to demonstrate before
 trial that probable cause exists to detain the accused. Under
 the Criminal Procedure Code, a suspect may be held
 incominunicado in police custody for up to 72 hours without
 representation by defense counsel. This period may be extended
 by a judge for up to 25 days if necessary. If an indictment
 follows, the suspect is transferred to a criminal detention
 facility. This practice, referred to as the "substitute prison
 system," was the subject of critical testimony by Japanese
 nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) before the U.N.
 Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of
 Minorities. The NGO's criticized in particular the fact that
 the police may hold a person in custody for up to 28 days,
 thus, they say. allowing the detention itself to be used as an
 interrogation tool. Furthermore, since the system does not
 allow appointment of a pro bono attorney until an indictment
 has been filed, those who cannot afford legal counsel may be up
 to 28 days without it.
 The length of time before a suspect is brought to trial depends
 on the nature of the crime but rarely exceeds 2 months; the
 average is 1 to 2 months. By law there is no right to legal
 representation during interrogation. However, the Ministry of
 Justice has stipulated that a detained person should be able to
 meet with counsel within 48 hours of the accused's request.
 This time limit is sometimes ignored. Counsel is provided at
 government expense when the arrested person cannot afford one.
 Preventive detention does not exist.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for the right to a speedy and public
 trial by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases, and this
 right is respected in practice. The defendant is informed of
 charges upon arrest and assured a public trial by an
 independent civilian court with defense counsel and the right
 to cross-examination. The Constitution assures defendants the
 right not to be compelled to testify against themselves as well
 as free and private access to counsel, although the right to
 such access is sometimes abridged in practice. Defendants are
 also protected from the retroactive application of laws and
 have the right of access to'incriminating evidence after a
 formal'indictment has been made. Judges are appointed by the
 Cabinet for a 10-year term which can be renewed until the age
 of 65. Justices of the Supreme Court can serve until the age
 of 70, but face periodic review through popular referendum. A
 defendant who is dissatisfied with the decision of a trial
 court of first instance may, within the period prescribed by
 law, appeal to a higher court. There are several levels of
 courts, with the Supreme Court serving as the highest judicial
 authority. There is no trial by jury in Japan. There are no
 political prisoners.

 JAPAN
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made
 upon separate warrant issued by a judicial officer. Standards
 for issuing such warrants exist to guard against arbitrary
 searches. There were no reports that the Government or any
 other organization arbitrarily interfered with privacy, family,
 home, or correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution, an independent press and judiciary, and a
 functioning democratic political system combine to ensure
 freedom of speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice. While Buddhism and Shintoism remain the
 two major religions, there are many others, including several
 Christian denominations. Foreign missionaries are welcome and
 gain admission to Japan through a specific visa category for
 foreign religious workers. Some temples and shrines receive
 public support as treasured national properties.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Japanese citizens have the right to travel freely, both within
 Japan and abroad, to change their place of residence, to
 emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily. Japanese nationality
 can be lost by naturalization in a foreign country or failure
 to elect Japanese nationality at the proper age. Immigrants
 reportedly face police harassment and widespread discrimination
 in obtaining housing, jobs, and health care.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Japanese citizens have the right and ability peacefully to
 change their government. A parliamentary democracy, Japan is
 ruled by the political party or parties able to form a majority
 in the lower house of its bicameral Diet. The Liberal
 Democratic Party (LDP) has been in power on the national
 level--through control of the lower house--continbously since
 its establishment in 1955. The political system is open,
 however. The LDP owes its longevity primarily to pragmatic and
 effective governance and to the fragmentation of the opposition
 parties. Local and prefectural governments are often
 controlled by coalitions. Elections on all levels are held
 frequently, suffrage is universal, and ballots are secret.
 Postwar population movements have left some parliamentary
 electoral districts disproportionately large; some districts
 have more than three times the population of others. The
 Supreme Court has called for greater equality in the value of
 
 
 879
 JAPAN
 votes, but the lack of a nonpartisan mechanism to make such
 changes has slowed the process of adjustment.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A number of local human rights organizations exist. They do
 not face any governmental restrictions or impediments to their
 work. The Government does not obstruct or inhibit the
 investigative activities of international nongovernmental
 organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The exclusive nature of Japanese society, reinforced by
 cultural and ethnic homogeneity and a history of isolation from
 other cultures, has impeded the integration of minority
 groups. Despite improvements in Japan's legal system, Korean
 permanent residents (most of whom were born, raised, and
 educated in Japan) and the Burakumin (descendants of feudal-era
 "outcasts" who practiced so-called unclean professions such as
 butchering and undertaking) are frequently the victims of
 entrenched social discrimination which has restricted the
 access of both groups to private housing, employment, and
 marriage opportunities. The Ainu, descendants of the original
 inhabitants of Japan, are also subject to discrimination,'
 especially regarding employment opportunities.
 Beginning in 1969, the Government introduced a number of
 social, economic, and legal programs designed to improve
 conditions for the Burakumin and hasten their'assimilation into
 the mainstream of Japanese society. While the Government has
 approved funding for these programs through 1992, organizations
 representing the interests-of the Burakumin are lobbying for a
 new law expanding programs and specific antidiscrimination
 legislation. In 1991 the Government announced plans for a fund
 for protecting the rights of the Ainu and improving their
 status through education beginning in 1993.
 The legal obligation to carry an alien registration card and to
 be fingerprinted have been leading concerns among permanent
 resident aliens residing in Japan, particularly second and
 third generation Korean residents who constitute 82 percent of
 all such aliens. In response to continued appeals from the
 Republic of Korea, the Government announced in January a number
 of steps to improve the status of Korean residents, including
 ending fingerprinting within 2 years and easing the requirement
 to carry the registration card at all times.
 In addition, Korean permanent residents are subject to various
 forms of entrenched-social discrimination. In recent years,
 the Government has enacted several laws and regulations
 extending to permanent resident aliens equal access to public
 housing and loans, social security pensions for those
 qualified, and certain public employment rights. Employment
 rights were recently extended to technical positions in local
 government, but fell short of allowing resident aliens
 employment as full-time teachers in public schools and in
 administrative positions in public service. Private sector
 employment and social discrimination are still common.
 Antidiscrimination laws affecting Korean residents were
 initiated as government guidance and are not backed up by
 penalty provisions.
 
 
 880
 According to law, aliens with 5 years' continuous residence are
 eligible for naturalization and the simultaneous acquisition of
 citizenship rights, including the right to vote. In fact,
 however, most eligible aliens do not apply for citizenship, in
 part due to fears that their cultural identity would be erased
 by that act.
 Estimates of Japan's illegal foreign worker population range
 from 100,000 to 200,000 persons. The majority of these workers
 ar6 from South and Southeast Asia and have come in search of
 better paying manufacturing and construction jobs created by
 Japan's labor shortages. Activist groups claim that, with
 little or no knowledge of the Japanese language or their legal
 rights, foreign workers can easily be discriminated against by
 employers. Some illegal alien workers have suffered
 exploitative treatment, but there is no evidence that it is
 common. The total number of illegal aliens is unknown and
 there are no statistical data on their experiences. Japanese
 media have reported on the influx of foreign workers who are
 doing the dirty, difficult, and dangerous work that Japanese
 now disdain. The Government has tried to decrease the inflow
 of illegal foreign workers by prosecuting employers under
 recent revisions of the immigration law and assessing penalties
 on employers of undocumented foreign workers. A June 1991
 survey published by the Ministry of Justice reported record
 levels of deportation of foreigners, totaling 13,934, an
 increase of 34 percent since 1990. The Government continues to
 study the foreign worker issue in a special committee. Several
 citizens' groups are working with illegal foreign workers to
 improve their access to information on worker rights.
 Late in 1990, press stories criticized Japan's failure to
 protect adequately Chinese dissidents in Japan by extending the
 visas of those who fear persecution in China or by preventing
 intimidation by Chinese Embassy officials. Since then, the
 Japanese Government has agreed to regularize their status but
 has not granted asylum or refugee status. In some cases, the
 Government has extended their visas; in others, it has issued
 special activities visas giving temporary residence status for
 up to 3 years and renewable. The Japanese Government continues
 to believe that only a tiny fraction of the thousands of
 Chinese students in Japan have a well-founded fear of
 punishment by the Chinese Government. There is no information
 that any Chinese citizen with a credible claim of fear of
 punishment for prodemocracy activities since June 4, 1989, has
 been deported by the Japanese Government. In 1991, for the
 first time, the Government deported a Chinese citizen who
 claimed fear of persecution. The Japanese Government
 considered her case through regular procedures, including
 consultation with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees, before returning her to China together with other
 Chinese migrants. There were reports that Chinese students
 seeking to extend their visas face numerous obstacles and
 impediments, although such problems are common among other
 foreign students as well. There continue to be credible
 reports of Chinese officials in Japan engaging in harassment
 and intimidation tactics against prodemocracy students.
 The position of women in society and the home, although
 significantly improved during the last few decades, continues
 to reflect deep-seated traditional values which assign women a
 subordinate role. In this environment, violence against women,
 particularly domestic violence, often goes unreported due to
 social and cultural concerns about shaming one's family or
 endangering the reputation of one's spouse or offspring.
 
 
 881
 JAPAN
 Typically, victimized women more often return to the home of
 their parents rather than file reports with authorities.
 Therefore, Ministry of Justice statistics on violence against
 women undoubtedly understate the scope of the current
 situation. Many local governments are responding positively to
 a need for confidential assistance by establishing special
 women's-consultation departments in police and prefectural
 offices.
 Although discrimination by private employers against women is
 prohibited by the Constitution. it persists. Women comprise 40
 percent of the employed population. Legislation over the past
 30 years has been adjusted to accord them the same legal status
 as men. The Equal Employment Opportunity Law of 1986 was aimed
 at eliminating sex discrimination in such areas as recruitment,
 pay, and working hours. The law does pot expressly forbid
 discrimination; it merely states that "employers should
 endeavor" to avoid it. Under this law and other regulations,
 the Ministry of Labor attempts to encourage corporate
 compliance with its objectives by positive inducements,
 including subsidies; it does not enforce compliance through
 fines or other punitive measures. Under these circumstances,
 significant disparities in pay and access to managerial
 positions persist. There were two 1990 court cases of
 discrimination against women. In one landmark case, the court
 found violations of Article 14 of the Constitution and the
 Labor Standards Law,, which resulted in national media coverage,
 and awarded compensation to the victims. The other case is
 still pending in a Fukuoka court. Public awareness of
 discrimination against women and sexual harassment in the
 workplace has increased. Some government entities have alsp
 established hotlines and designated ombudsmen to handle
 complaints of discrimination and sexual harassment.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of workers to organize, bargain, and act collectively
 is assured by the Constitution. Approximately 25 percent of
 the active work force belongs to unions. Unions are free of
 government control and influence. The Japanese Trade Union
 Confederation (Rengo), which represents 8 million Japanese
 workers, was formed in 1989 through the merger of several
 confederations and is Japan's largest labor organization.
 There is no requirement for a single trade union structure, and
 there are no restrictions on who may be a union official.
 Members of the armed forces, police, and firefighters, however,
 are not permitted to form unions or to organize. The
 International Labor Organization's Committee of Experts in 1991
 again criticized Japan's denial of the right of firefighters to
 organize as unwarranted. Japanese law allows unions to lobby
 and to make political campaign contributions,- and most unions
 are involved in political activity as well as labor relations.
 Rengo and other labor groups are active in supporting political
 parties and individual candidates, and promoting their
 political and social agenda. Organized labor generally
 supports the opposition political parties and provides key
 funds and manpower. Unions are active in international bodies,
 most notably the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions, and maintain extensive international contacts. The
 right to strike is implicit in the Constitution, and it is
 exercised. During 1990, 144,000 working days were lost to
 strikes. In 1991, as in earlier years, a disproportionately
 large number of strikes took place during the "spring wage
 
 
 882
 JAPAN
 offensive." Public employees, however, do not have the right
 to strike, although they do have recourse to mediation and
 arbitration in order to resolve disputes. In exchange for a
 ban on their right to strike, government employees' pay raises
 are determined by the Government based on a recommendation by
 the independent National Personnel Authority.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution states that unions have the right to organize,
 bargain, and act collectively, and these rights are exercised
 in practice. Collective bargaining is widely practiced. The
 annual "spring wage offensive," in which individual unions in
 each industry conduct negotiations simultaneously with their
 firms, attracts national attention. Japanese management
 usually consults closely with unions on issues. However, trade
 unions are independent of management and aggressively pursue
 the interests of their workers. Antiunion discrimination is
 prohibited by law and in practice does not take place. There
 are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Labor Standards Law prohibits the use of forced labor, and
 there are no known cases of forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under the revised Labor Standards Law of 1987, minors under 15
 years of age may not be employed as workers, and those under
 the age of 18 years may not be employed in dangerous or harmful
 work. Child labor laws are rigorously enforced by the Labor
 Inspection Division of the Ministry of Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages are administratively determined by the Minister
 of Labor or the Director of the Prefectural Labor Standards
 Office based usually on the recommendation of the tripartite
 Minimum Wage Council. Minimum wage rates vary by industry and
 region. These wage rates are sufficient to provide workers and
 their families with a decent living. The Labor Standards Law
 provides for the phased reduction of maximum working hours from
 the present 44-hour 6-day workweek to 40 hours by early in the
 1990's. The Ministry of Labor effectively administers various
 laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety,
 principal among which is the Industrial Safety and Health Law
 of 1972. Standards are set by the Ministry of Labor and issued
 after consultation with the Standing Committee on Safety and
 Health of the tripartite Labor Standards Commission. Labor
 inspectors have the authority to suspend unsafe operations
 immediately, and the law provides for workers to voice concerns
 over occupational safety and to remove themselves from unsafe
 working conditions without jeopardizing their continued
 employment.
