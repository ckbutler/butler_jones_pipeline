 THE BAHA05AS
 The Bahamas is a constitutional, multiparty democracy. A
 member of the Commonwealth of Nations, its political and legal
 traditions are similar to those of the United Kingdom. The
 Queen is recognized as Head of State and represented by an
 appointed Governor General. The Progressive Liberal Party
 (PLP) has governed since 1967 under the same leader, Prime
 Minister Sir Lynden 0. Pindling. The last general elections
 were in June 1987.
 The police and small defense force generally respect the human
 rights provisions of the Constitution and other statutes.
 There have, however, been allegations of mistreatment of some
 prisoners by the police. The Bahamas has a well-established
 judicial system based on British common law and procedures.
 Tourism is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for
 approximately 60 per cent of the gross national product;
 finance and off-shore banking is the second most important
 sector. Government efforts to diversify the economy have met
 with little success.
 The Constitution provides for the protection of fundamental
 rights and freedoms without discrimination by reason of sex,
 race, religion, national origin, or political opinion, and its
 provisions are generally observed. The Bahamas' human rights
 record remained generally good in 1989, but police abuse of
 detainees and unsafe and unhealthy prison conditions were
 cause for concern.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect forr the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. 'Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudiciaI
 killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated abductions or
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits the use of torture and other forms
 of cruel or degrading treatment or punishment. However, both
 Americans and Bahamians detained by police continue to report
 instances of police brutality during the course of arrests and
 interrogations. In an incident currently under investigation,
 the Bahamian Defence Force boarded a U.S.-registered power
 boat to search for drugs, failed to produce identification,
 and allegedly physically assaulted the captain and crew.
 Prisoners at The Bahamas' 6ne prison facility, Foxhill,
 located just outside of Nassau on New Providence Island, have
 reported and independent observers have confirmed, that
 conditions are unhealthful and harsh. A local newspaper
 article described the "initiation" rite of homosexual rape
 performed on some new prisoners--a practice of particular
 concern given the relatively high incidence of AIDS in the
 population. Even prison officials acknowledge that

 overcrowding is a proplem. Four to five prisoners are usually
 housed in 6-foot by 8-foot cetlfor 2� 1/2 hours daily 5 days
 a week and dxe-not'perniltted tb"leave their cells at all the
 other 2 days. Sanitation facilities are, at best, poor, with
 most cells-equilp6d only with a slop bucket or trench-type
 urinals that provide breeding grounds for iisects.
 In the women  section, female prisoners are housed in
 dormitories containing 20 to 24 bunk beds. They are given
 consigerablymore time outside of the cells than are male
 prisoners a~d 'I6t generally subjected to sexual assault.
 However, frigqbqpt kloods caused by heavy rains sometimes leave
 about 2 ikqhep'f standing water in the dormitories. As pipes
 back up, hihfn wtste mixes with the water, and tarantulas and
 centipedas See) refuge ifi the beds. Some prisbhers have
 alleged occasional deliberate neglect of ill prisoners by
 guards.
 d. _Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention.
 The right to a judicial determination Qf the legality of
 detention it respected; charges are normally brought within 48
 hours of~arrest, and those arrested are usually allowed access
 to an'attorney of'their own choosing.
 With regard to forced'or compulsory labor, See Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 An independent judiciary, appointed by the executive branch on
 the advice of a Judicial and Legal Service Commission,
 conducts fair and public trials. The Constitution entitles
 defendants to counsel, and access to defendants is freely
 permitted. There have been instances, however, when persons
 accused of a crime have spent periods of as much as 18 months
 in maximum security facilities awaiting trial. Legal.
 representation at public expense is provided only-for capital
 cases. There are no political prisoners.
 �. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not interfere in the private lives of its
 - citizens. The>onstitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search,
 .or seizure, and thb law requires warrants-to be issued before
 -primatelyiuowned property can be entered and searched. The
 Government neither censors mail nor restricts receipts of
 foreigncoirespondence or publications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is restrained primarily by strict
 libel laws and the government monopoly of radio and
 television. The Bahamas operates under a libel law unchanged
 since the 19th century. While journalists generally find the
 law somewhat rigid, its supporters claim that it results in a
 more-dignified and courteous treatment by the press than would
 be the case without it. While the two privately owned daily
 and one weekly newspapers freely criticize government
 policies, they also refrain from scrutinizing certain issues
 for fear of libel suits; the morning daily lost at least two
 major suits in 1989. The result is a form of self-censorship
 
 
 463
 THE BAHA4AS
 which attenuates public debate on controversial issues.
 Radio and television-broadcasting is a government monopoly
 under present legislation. The government-controlled
 Broadcasting Corporation of the Bahamas (BCB) operates radio
 services in Nassau and Freeport and a nationwide TV service
 from Nassau. A private U.S.-based cable TV system presently
 exists in Freeport, although there are reports that the
 Government is pressuring the owners to sell at below free
 market price. In September opposition politicians once again
 introduced legislation which, if adopted, would permit the
 licensing of privately owned radio stations. They argue that
 the government-run BCB cannot objectively comment on
 government policies, and that this is particularly important
 in the case of radio, the major source of news for Bahamians.
 For example, current legislation allows the government party
 to purchase four 15-minute broadcasts each year and the
 opposition to buy onel15-minute broadcast annually if it
 constitutes less than a third of Parliament. Two opposition
 broadcasts are possible if they hold more than a third of
 parliamentary seats. Generally, however, the views of the
 Government receive a thorough airing on radio and television
 programs while those of the opposition and the Government's
 other critics are given little notice. The opposition's
 proposal was referred to committee after a parliamentary
 debate in which even some government party members expressed
 support for amending the present law. Foreign books and
 publications freely enter the country and academic freedom
 appears to be respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the rights of free assembly and
 association, and these rights are observed in practice.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is full freedom of religion, and discrimination based on
 creed is prohibited. There is no favored or official state
 religion, but most church members belong to Protestant
 denominations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are free to travel domestically and abroad, and there
 are no restrictions on the right to change residence or
 workplace. Large groups of Haitians continued to enter
 Bahamian waters, and the Bahamian Defense Force and the U.S.
 Coast Guard have cooperated in repatriating them. From April
 1988 to July 1989, 20 Cuban refugees landed while attempting
 to flee Cuba for Florida. Although The Bahamas is signatory
 to the U.N. Protocol of 1968 relating to refugees, the Cubans
 were treated as illegal immigrants and jailed for varying
 periods. They were eventually released to await third-country
 resettlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Bahamas is a constitutional denfocracy with a multiparty
 political system. The political process is open to all
 
 
 464
 THE BAHADIAS
 members of society, with citizens aged 18 and over eligible to
 register and vote. There are two principal parties: the
 governing Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) and the opposition
 Free National Movement (FNM). The PLP led the country for 5
 years of internal-self-government before independence in 1973
 and has held power without interruption since.
 General elections held in June 1987 returned the PLP to power
 with a clear parliamentary majority. The FNM,.however,
 claiming extensive electoral violations, challenged the
 results in the electoral court. The PLP responded by
 challenging seats won by the FNM. The electoral court settled
 nearly all of these challenges in September; the composition
 of Parliament, in which the PLP holds 31 seats, the FNM 16,
 and independents 2, remained unchanged.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international human rights organizations visited the
 Bahamas during 1989. There are two local human rights groups,
 the Grand Bahamas Human Rights Organization and the New
 Providence Human Rights Organization. During 1989 the latter
 took a strong stand against a proposed National Service Bill
 which would have restricted the constitutional rights of those
 in National Service; the bill never came to a vote in
 Parliament. The Government made no effort to restrict the
 activities of either of these organizations or any
 international organization investigating human rights issues.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on grounds of sex, race, or
 religion, and The Bahamas has a generally good record in this
 regard. Women participate prominently at all levels of
 government and are well represented in the judiciary as well
 as in professional and business sectors. There does not
 appear to be a signficant wage gap. The Constitution does,
 however, make several distinctions between the sexes regarding
 citizenship by, for example, preventing female Bahamians from
 bestowing citizenship upon their spouses.
 Abuse of women, particularly spousal abuse, is a problem in
 The Bahamas. However, it is unusual for a spouse to be
 charged and convicted of a crime stemming from domestic
 violence. In late 1989 the House of Assembly considered
 legislative changes to strengthen the provisions against
 spousal and child abuse. The bill was with the House of
 Assembly Committee of the Whole but was expected to be passed
 before the end of the session.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitutional provision for the right of free assembly
 and association specifically mentions labor unions, and unions
 operate freely without restriction. They are independent of
 government control, have the right to strike, choose their own
 delegations to the International Labor Organization (ILO)' and
 maintain affiliations with international and regional labor
 organizations. Although construction workers at a hotel
 project conducted a three-week "withdrawal of services", no
 
 
 official strikes were registered in 1989.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are free to organize, and unions engage in collective
 bargaining without government interference or restriction in
 any sector. Collective bargaining is extensive for the 30
 percent of the work force which is organized. The Department
 of Labor attempts to mediate disputes, and the law provides
 for arbitration tribunals to help resolve stalled contract
 negotiations. Notwithstanding the provisions of the
 Industrial Relations Act of 1970 which prohibit discrimination
 by employers against union members and organizers,
 unionization of retail store and restaurant employees has been
 discouraged over the years by employer pressure and arbitrary
 dismissal practices. Allegations of antiunion discrimination
 are ultimately decided by the Supreme Court. There are no
 export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution specifically prohibits forced or compulsory
 labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no legal minimum age for the employment of children.
 Although the law does not specifically address child labor,
 the requirement of compulsory education until age 14
 effectively discourages child employment.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, employers cannot permit
 their employees to work more than 48 hours a week. This
 provision is effectively enforced. Maternity leave is
 provided by law for female workers, who are guaranteed their
 right to reemployment following childbirth. The Labor
 Department conducts periodic inspections of workplaces to
 ensure lighting, safety, and ventilation standards are met.
 There is no minimum wage law in the Bahamas; however, wage
 levels in this primarily service-oriented, tourist-based
 economy are considered to provide a decent standard of living
 for workers.*
