 THE GAMBIA
 A former British colony on the West African Coast, The Gambia
 is a parliamentary democracy with an elected President.
 However, a state of emergency imposed after the July 1981 coup
 attempt continues in effect, giving the Government wide powers
 of detention. The country is extremely small (slightly over
 4,000 square miles) and is virtually surrounded by neighboring
 Senegal. Its population of 695,000 (1983 census) consists
 largely of subsistence farmers growing rice and the country's
 primary export crop--groundnuts (peanuts). The Gambia has
 functioning democratic institutions and, with the exception of
 coup attempts in 1980 and 1981, has had a history of political
 stability under the leadership of its first President, Sir
 Dawda Jawara. The ruling People's Progressive Party dominates
 the House of Representatives; the leading opposition party and
 independents also won seats in the May 1982 legislative
 elections. The country, which gained independence in 1965,
 converted from a parliamentary to an executive Presidency form
 of government in 1970, following a national referendum. There
 is universal suffrage for all persons aged 18 and older. The
 judiciary is independent and consists of a Supreme Court, Court
 of Appeals, and various subordinate courts; the judges are
 appointed by the Central Government.
 Under emergency provisions, 1,094 persons were originally
 detained in 1981, after the bloody struggle led by leftist
 military elements which resulted in the deaths of over 800
 people. A recent news report stated that 870 of those detained
 were released without charges, 17 were tried and acquitted, 163
 convicted and sentenced (32 of these sentenced to death--none
 yet executed), and 78 are currently undergoing trial.
 Additionally, all 51 of those in detention pending further
 investigation were released from prison on August 20. (Figures
 do not add up and thus must be considered as approximations.)
 The process of confederation with Senegal, formalized by the
 treaty of December 1981, continued to have a pronounced impact
 on Gambian institutions in 1983. Important protocols covering
 defense and security were signed at the beginning of the year,
 and The Gambia has recently reconstituted its own military
 forces, now comprised of an army and a gendarmerie, to conform
 to the Senegalese military structure. Senegalese military
 forces remain in The Gambia to provide internal security and to
 guard key bridges, government buildings, and military camps.
 The behavior of the Senegalese troops has been exemplary.
 There are no instances of the Goverment using the troops for
 repressive acts and no evidence of the troops harassing the
 local population; there have been few reports of local friction.
 Under the terms of the Confederation, both countries maintain
 their individual sovereignty and political institutions.
 Further cooperation is planned in the fields of customs and
 currency. The Gambia signed and ratified the Organization of
 African Unity Human Rights Charter in 1983.
 Along with many of its neighbors, The Gambia was sorely affect-
 ed by the world recession and a decrease in the demand and the
 market price for its major export crop, groundnuts. Drought
 affected both groundnut and rice production. The Government
 hopes to sign an agreement with the International Monetary Fund
 in 1984 to provide badly needed balance-of-payments and budget
 support.

 Major events in The Gambia during 1983 affecting the human
 rights situation were: a) the expiration in July of legis-
 lation permitting charges of treason to be brought against
 persons in connection with the July 1981 coup attempt,
 b) establishment of a law reform commission in July to
 promote the reform and systematic development of statutory
 and traditional laws, and c) the continuing state of
 emergency.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There have been no instances of political killings in The
 Gambia in 1983. An independent judiciary, open courts,
 established trial procedures, and an appeal process insure that
 the accused receive a fair trial. At present, according to
 press reports, 32 persons have been sentenced to death--after
 lengthy public trials observing due process of law--for crimes
 committed in connection with the 1981 coup attempt. The cases
 are now undergoing appeal and, following the appellate court
 decision, there could be resort to a request for executive
 clemency. No executions have taken place.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no known record or allegation of abduction, or secret
 detention by any element of the Government or by any group in
 the country.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The constitutional prohibition against torture is observed in
 practice. No allegations of torture have been noted in 1983.
 The Constitution also contains prohibitions against cruel, in-
 human, and degrading punishment. Persons familiar with the
 operation of the legal system, and whose opinions are respected,
 believe that courts are alert to any allegation of mistreatment
 in prisons. These sources also acknowledge that there may be
 lapses in supervision resulting in individual instances of
 mistreatment of prisoners. There are segregated prison
 facilities for men and women of both maximum and minimum
 security types. Amnesty International reported that 36 persons
 were being held in leg irons in 1982; a Presidential order banned
 the use of leg irons on December 30, 1982. According to the best
 information available, the ban is being honored. The Government
 has allowed prison visits by representatives of the local Red
 Cross and by close family members.
 Sentences including fines and imprisonment are related to the
 severity of the crime committed and are based upon schedules
 set forth in statutes or regulations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are well developed constitutional and legal procedures
 governing the arrest, detention, and bringing to trial of
 
 
 142
 persons accused of crimes. These are based on British legal
 practice. However, under the Emergency Act still in force,
 the Government may order the detention of any person who is
 considered to have been involved in acts prejudicial to the
 public safety or public order, in the preparation or
 instigation of such acts, or in impeding the maintenance of
 supplies and services essential to the life of the community.
 Such persons may be held up to 14 days without a detention
 order. Detainees are free to exercise their right to legal
 counsel. The Emergency Act, which has been extended by the
 legislature several times, continues in force.
 Legislation requiring that treason charges in connection with
 the 1981 rebellion be brought to court within a period of two
 years expired on July 31, 1983. As mentioned above, a total of
 1,094 persons have been detained under the emergency regulation;
 most of them have been released.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Three kinds of law operate in The Gambia: general, Shari'a,
 and customary law. Shari'a law, governing certain aspects of
 social interaction of rural Muslims, is observed, even in the
 capital of Banjul, in marriage and divorce proceedings.
 Customary law covers marriage, inheritance, divorce, land
 tenure and utilization, local tribal government, and all other
 civil and social relations originating in the traditional
 religious and tribal situation of the country. General law,
 based on English statutes and modified to suit the Gambian
 context, governs criminal cases and trials and most organized
 business practices. If there were a conflict between general
 and Shari'a law, general law would prevail. Trial procedures
 in general law are carefully regulated to insure protection of
 the rights of the accused. Criminal defendants are guaranteed
 by the Constitution the right to a public trial, the presump-
 tion of innocence; the right to be informed promptly, and, in
 language the accused understands, of the nature of the offense
 charged; adequate time and facilities for preparation of a
 defense; the right to defend oneself or select one's own
 counsel; the right of cross-examination; and the right to a
 paid interpreter if needed. The accused also has the right to
 be present, not to be required to testify against him/herself,
 and to be free from double jeopardy and from the application of
 ex post facto definitions of crimes. Under the law, a detained
 person must come to trial within one week. This waiting period,
 however, can be extended twice, making the total time of
 detention before trial allowed under the law 21 days. If an
 accused person is released on bail, the individual need not
 come to trial until the investigation is completed, and there
 apparently is no time limit for investigations. Appeals
 normally proceed from the Supreme (trial) Court to the Court of
 Appeal, the country's highest tribunal. Jury trials are
 limited to certain specified cases such as murder.
 Trials for those persons detained by Presidential order under
 the Emergency Act were delayed because of the extraordinary
 measures the Government undertook to cope with the large number
 of detainees. The court system in this tiny nation was over-
 whelmed. The Government therefore established a special
 division of the Supreme (trial) Court, which included judges
 and prosecuting and defense attorneys from neighboring
 
 
 143
 English-speaking countries, all of which have the same basic
 legal system as The Gambia. This unusual step was taken
 because of a shortage of trained legal personnel in The Gambia,
 to avoid overwhelming the regular judicial process, and to
 demonstrate publicly the Government's concern for impartiality.
 Informed observers believe that the trials may be completed by
 the end of this year, with the appeal process continuing into
 another year.   Trial procedures for emergency regulations
 detainees are the same as for other accused. The delay in
 completing the trial process for detainees seems to stem from
 the basic problem of coordinating the availability of non-
 resident judges and trial counsels.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides guarantees against arbitrary search
 of person and property. It excepts the voluntary submission
 to a search by the individual, or a search that is reasonably
 required in the interests of national defense or other public
 interest. Under the criminal code, search warrants are issued
 by magistrates upon application by the police, based on probable
 cause. Under the Emergency Act searches of premises or vehicles
 for suspected firearms or other enumerated articles are
 authorized by the Inspector General of Police or the Commander
 of Military Forces. There are a number of police and military
 check points in and around Banjul. Drivers are stopped and
 vehicles searched from time to time.
 The rights of f.mily are of extreme importance in this conserva-
 tive Muslim society. Marriage, the raising of children, and
 religious instruction are regulated by a combination of
 individual preference and ethnic and religious tradition. The
 Government does not intrude in family matters except to protect
 public safety and morality. There is no effort to censor or
 control personal correspondence or communications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides guarantees of press freedom. In
 practical terms The Gambia, with its small, mainly rural,
 largely illiterate, and multilingual population, does not
 support an active press. There are no dailies. There is a
 government weekly paper and several intermittently published,
 mimeographed news sheets. Recently, le Soleil, a Dakar-based
 paper, has begun publishing an English-language weekly, using
 Gambian staff and concentrating on Gambian news. There are a
 government radio station and a private commercial station, which
 broadcasts largely musical programs. Magazines and some news-
 papers from outside the country are available at a few outlets
 in the capital. There is no televison in The Gambia, although
 Senegalese stations can be received. The Government dominates
 the media through Radio Gambia, but there have been no reported
 instances of government interference with the commercial radio
 station. The Government does not attempt to censor published
 materials originating either within or outside the country.
 The Emergency Act, with its broad powers of detention, has had
 an inhibiting effect on criticism of the Government by inde-
 pendent news sheets; commentators are said to have been
 noticeably more outspoken in the past.
 
 
 144
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no restrictions on freedom of association and assembly
 in the Constitution. Under the Emergency Act, however, public
 meetings are held only with prior notification to and permission
 from the police. According to the best information available,
 no permits for meetings have been denied, but the authorities
 require meetings to be public. Trade unions remain a minor
 element in Gambian economic and political life and are not as
 active as in previous years, probably because of the state of
 emergency and the low levels of economic activity in some
 sectors. Less than 20 percent of the work force is engaged in
 the industry, commerce, and service sectors, where unions nor-
 mally are active. Trade unions are small and fragmented. In
 January, the Government agreed that the Gambian Workers' Union
 may resume its functions. The operation of the Union, the most
 active in The Gambia, was suspended in 1977, ostensibly for
 financial irregularities and failure to file required financial
 reports. It is believed that the Union has not yet complied
 with the request to clean its financial house, and full Union
 activity remains conditional on filing reports and rectifying
 irregularities. Other unions continue to function under basic
 labor and trade union legislation. Union members have freedom
 of movement to attend meetings outside the country. The
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions sponsored a
 two-week course on trade unions in mid-April with the assistance
 of the Gambian Workers Union.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The constitutional guarantees of freedom of conscience, thought,
 and religion are observed in practice. The state is secular.
 Muslims constitute over 90 percent of the population; the
 schools provide instruction in the Koran for Muslim students.
 Christians, both Catholic and Protestant, freely and actively
 practice their religion. There is a small Bahai community in
 Banjul. Missionaries are permitted to carry on their work in
 the country. No evidence of discrimination in employment or
 education or in other areas of Gambian life on the grounds of
 religion has been observed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution has provisions guaranteeing freedom of movement
 subject to conditions protecting public safety, health, and
 morals. There is no restriction on freedom of emigration or
 freedom of return. Internally, police and military checkpoints
 exist in and around Banjul; under the Emergency Act, travelers
 and their vehicles may be searched. There is no evidence that
 police harass travelers.
 Because of historic and ethnic ties with the people of Senegal,
 Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and Mali, people tend to move unregulated
 across borders, which are poorly marked and difficult to police.
 Under the Confederation Treaty of 1981, neither Gambians nor
 Senegalese require passports or visas to travel to the other's
 country. The border is essentially open, and movement across the
 border is constant. There is a high tolerance for foreigners and
 no effort is made by the Government to discriminate against them.
 There are no refugees in The Gambia. Early in 1983, some 600
 Gambians were among the vast numbers of illegal aliens expelled
 by Nigeria. Their return has caused no noticeable impact.
 
 
 145
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The Government is elected by citizens 18 years of age and older;
 the chief executive official (the President) and the members of
 the legislature (House of Representatives) are popularly
 elected, as are also the district councils and the chiefs who
 exercise traditional authority in the villages and compounds.
 A functioning multiparty system exists in The Gambia. The
 principal opposition party, the National Convention Party,
 contests national and district elections. Other opposition
 parties contest the Presidency and other offices on a selected
 basis. Independents have run for and won legislative seats.
 In the 1982 election, the Government party, the People's
 Progressive Party, won 35 seats in the House of Representatives,
 the National Convention Party, six, and independents, two. Two
 by-elections have since been held, both won by the People's
 Progressive Party. The opposition is not able to defeat or
 modify significant legislation because of its small size, but
 debate is open and accepted parliamentary procedures are
 observed. In the district elections in the spring of 1983,
 the opposition, presuming that the elections would be fixed,
 chose to boycott the elections rather than contest them.
 The People's Progressive Party has been in power since
 independence. Despite the continuation in power of one
 party, there has always been an active organized opposition.
 There have not been any serious allegations of election fraud.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 After the coup attempt in 1981, the Government adopted a policy
 of permitting visits of international human rights organizations
 to observe the conditions of the detainees and the trial process.
 Amnesty International sent an observer in January 1982 to attend
 two trials; an Amnesty mission in August 1982 then visited The
 Gambia and held discussions with high government officials,
 including President Jawara. The only humanitarian organization
 in The Gambia is the local Red Cross. There have been no
 requests for investigation of alleged human rights abuses in
 The Gambia. Amnesty International was concerned about the 32
 death sentences imposed between late December 1981 and June
 1982. Sixteen of those sentences were confirmed on appeal and
 Amnesty International urged the authorities to commute them.
 To date, none of those prisoners have been executed. Freedom
 House rates The Gambia "partly free.'
 Internationally, the Government has been a proponent of human
 rights in Africa and advocated in the Organization of African
 Unity (OAU) the adoption of a Charter of Human Rights. In
 January 1983, The Gambia became the 17th OAU member to ratify
 the Charter.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Gambia is a poor, almost overwhelmingly agricultural, nation
 with a population of 695,886 people, according to informal
 reporting of the April 1983 census. The population growth rate
 is, according to the census, 3.4 percent a year (World Bank, 2.6
 
 
 146
 percent). Per capita income (1981) was estimated at $348.30
 a year. The adult literacy rate is estimated at 14.8 percent
 (1980). Approximately 42 percent (1979) of eligible children
 attend primary school. There are no current functioning
 institutions of higher learning.
 Life expectancy at birth is 42 years; the infant mortality
 rate in 1983 was 195.6 per 1,000. Only 12 percent (1970)
 of the population is believed to have access to safe
 water (the urban rate is 97 percent). The ratio of calorie
 supply available for consumption relative to nutritional
 requirements is 93 percent (1977).
 Almost 83 percent of the people live in rural areas. The
 principal ethnic groups are Mandinka, Woloff, Fula, Jola,
 and Serahuli. Most people are Muslim. Rural life is
 village and family oriented. While individual initiative
 and choices are valued, rights and privileges are generally
 perceived to reside in the group rather than in the individual.
 Traditional values remain strong but are changing. Education
 of women is increasingly accepted, and women participate in
 the professions and in political life. Marriages are still
 often arranged, but there is increasing freedom of personal
 choice. Family planning, focused on the health and welfare
 of mother and child, remains controversial but is gaining
 acceptance. There is a Women's Bureau in the Office of the
 President which actively promotes debate on women's issues.
 The strength of community practices and traditions has
 strongly influenced the high degree of tolerance in the diverse
 Gambian society. There is a deep respect for the tradition
 of living at peace with one's neighbors. The level of
 intercommunal violence is extremely low.
 The Gambia depends on one major crop, groundnuts, for foreign
 exchange; this is subject to the vagaries of weather and world
 market conditions. Most of the population consist of sub-
 sistence farmers who are not able to satisfy The Gambia's food
 requirements. As a result, the Government has relied on
 external food assistance for the last several years. The
 Government has adopted a five-year development plan which
 emphasizes crop diversification and greater agricultural
 productivity as the most rapid way of improving the level of
 consumption and the welfare of the people.
 Practically all of the funding for the development plan must
 come from external sources--grants and loans. The
 Government's ability to absorb and administer the assistance
 has been hampered by a lack of facilities and trained
 personnel.
 Despite The Gambia's many problems in development, there is no
 evidence of serious or systematic discrimination in the
 availability of government services or assistance to any
 particular segment of the population.
