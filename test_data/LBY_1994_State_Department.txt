 LIBYA*
 The Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is a dictatorship ruled by
 Mu'ammar Al-Qadhafi (the "Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution") who is
 aided by extragovernmental Revolutionary Committees and a Comrades Organiza-
 tion. Libya's governing principles are expressed in Mr. Qadhafi's "Green Book ." Bor-
 rowing from Islamic and pan-Arab ideas, Mr. Qadhafi has created a political system
 that purports to establish a "third way" superior to capitalism and communism. He
 uses assassination and intimidation to control his enemies abroad and summary ju-
 *The United States has no Embassy in Libya. Information on the human rights situation is
 therefore limited.

 dicial proceedings to suppress opposition at home. The Government exercises tight
 control over ethnic minorities, such as Berbers, and continues to repress banned Is-
 lamic groups.
 Libya maintains an extensive security apparatus, consisting of several elite mili-
 tary units, including Mr. Qadhafi's prsonabodygards, as well as the local Revolu-
 tionary Committees and People's Committees.    e result is a multilayered, perva-
 sive surveillance stem which monitors and controls the activities of individuals.
 In August Mr. Qadhafi proposed a program to seize private wealth, deeming all
 private assets above a nominal amount to be the fruits of exploitation or corruption.
 The Government dominates the economy through complete control of the country's
 oil resources, the principal source of foreign exchange. It uses part of the oil income
 for development, but much income has been lost to waste and corruption.
 The human rights situation worsened in 1994 as the security service continued
 a crackdown after a coup plot was foiled in October 1993. Most rights remain tightly
 restricted. There are
 no effective right to freedom of speech, including expression of views opposing
 those of the Government, to peaceful association or assembly, to formation of trade
 unions, or to strike. Citizens do not have the right to change their government, nor
 the right to a fair public trial, to be represented by legal counsel, to be secure in
 their homes or persons, or to own private property.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Foreign observers report at least 17
 persons were hanged in early 1994 after they were found guilty in summary trials
 for their roles in a reported attempt coup d'etat in October 1993. Thousands of per-
 sons were arrested in the post-October crackdown. Dozens of those reportedly died
 in detention.
 A large number of offenses, including political offenses and "economic crimes," are
 punishable by death. Law No. 71 of 1972 stipulates the death penalty for any person
 associated with a group opposed to the principles of the revolution. Despite his long-
 standing stated intention, Mr. Qadhafi has not acted to abolish the death penalty
 for this offense. To the contrary, a 1991 law stipulates the death penalty for persons
 "whose lives constitute a threat or cause depravity to society..
 b. Disappearance.-Mansur Kikhya, a former Libyan Foreign Minister under Mr.
 Qadhafi and a prominent exiled dissident, disappeared from Cairo in December
 1993. The Egptian Government has been unable to account for Kikhya's disappear-
 ance. Many observers, citing Libya's long history of antidissident campaigns and Mr.
 Qadhafi's public calls in late 1993 for violence against regime critics abroad, believe
 that Libyan agents abducted Kikhya. Kikhya's whereabouts are still unknown.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although Libya is a party to the United Nations Convention against Torture and
 Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, security personnel
 reportedly torture prisoners during interrogations or for punishment. Government
 agents periodically detain and reportedly torture foreign workers, particularly those
 from sub-Saharan Africa. Torture reports are difficult to corroborate because many
 prisoners are held incommunicado.
 Methods of torture reportedly include: chaining to a wall for hours, clubbing, elec-
 tric shock, the application of corkscrews in the back and lemon juice in open
 wounds, breaking fingers and allowing the joints to heal without medical care, suffo-
 cation by plastic bags, deprivation of food and water, and beatings on the soles of
 the feet. Libyan law calls for fines against any official using excessive force, but
 there are no known cases of prosecution for torture or abuse.
 In 1994 Mr. Qadhafi again publicly called for a stricter application of Islamic law,
 or Shari'a. He criticized the leniency of judicial punishments and recommended leg-
 islation to authorize amputation for thievery and public whipping for adulterers. In
 February the Government adopted laws mandating Koranic punishments, but at
 year's end there was no evidence these laws had been enforced.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-By law the Government may hold detain-
 ees incommunicado for unlimited periods. It also holds many political prisoners in-
 communicado in unofficial detention centers, controlled by members of the Revolu-
 tionary Committees. The Government is believed to hold in detention between 400
 to 500 political prisoners. Many have been held for long periods without charge.
 Thousands of other detainees may have been held for periods too brief (3 to 4
 months) to permit confirmation by outside observers.
 While undergoing interrogation, sometimes for as long as several months, pris-
 oners do not have access to legal counsel. There have been credible reports that the
 
 
 1140
 Government has arbitrarily forced some foreign workers into military training and
 military service on behalf of Libya or coerced them into subversive activities against
 their own countries.
 The Government does not impose exile as a form of punishment; to the contrary,
 Mr. Qadhafi seeks to pressure Libyans working or studying abroad to return to
 Libya. However, the regime arbitrarily expels noncitizens (see Section 6.e.).
 e. Denial of Fair Publi Tria/.-Most civilians are tried in regular courts, but their
 cases may be referred to less formal "people's courts" or to military or revolutionary
 courts, depending on the recommendation of the security forces. Some trials are held
 in secret or even in the absence of the accused. In other cases, the security forces
 have the power to judge persons guilty without trial, particularly those deemed
 "tritors to the pope(i.e., opponents ofMr. Qadhafi's idolog or reign).
 Persons accused of political offenses have been tried in secret before ad hoc revo-
 lutionary courts rather than in regular civilian courts. Defendants in such cases do
 not have the right to choose their own counsel.
 A 1981 law prohibits the private practice of law and stipulates that all attorneys
 must work as employees of the Secretariat of Justice. The accused are not accorded
 due process under the law, despite the regime's claims of adherence to international
 principles of justice.
 Mr. Qadhafi has used public speeches to incite local cadres to take extrajudicial
 action against suscted regime opponents. In 1994 a regime-inspired mob de-
 stroyed the home o a person mistaken as a regime opponent who was living abroad.
 Mr. Qadhafi claimed that his personal intervention prevented the mob from killing
 the family living in the house. Later the actual family members of the opponent-
 acting under regime-inspired duress--described him as "insane" and called for his
 arrest if he returned to Libya.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government does not respect the right to privacy. Security agencies often disregard
 the legal requirement to obtain warrants before entering a private home. They also
 routinely monitor telephone calls.
 The security agencies and the Revolutionary Committees oversee an extensive in-
 formant network. Libyan exiles report that mere family ties to suspected regime op-
 ponents may result in government harassment and detention. The Government may
 seize and destroy property belonging to the "enemies of the people" or those who
 "cooperate" with foreign powers. In early 1994 citizens reported that Mr. Qadhafi
 warned that members of the extended family of any regime opponent risk the death
 penalty.
 In August Mr. Qadhafi proposed a program to seize private wealth, deeming all
 private assets above a nominal amount to be the fruits of exploitation or corruption.
 He encouraged local cadres to investigate and report any citizen retaining "exces-
 sive" private assets after the expiration of a grace period, during which citizens
 could turn over such assets to the Government.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The authorities tolerate some difference of opin-
 ion in People's Committee meetings and at the General People's Congress but in
 general severely limit freedom of speech. This is especially true with regard to criti-
 cism of Mr. Qadhafi or his regime. Infrequent media criticism of regime members
 or policies is interpreted as orchestrated attempts to test public opinion or as efforts
 to weaken the popular support of Mr. Qadhafi's potential challengers within the
 Government.
 The regime restricts freedom of speech by prohibiting all political activities not
 officially approved; enacting laws so vague that many forms of speech or expression
 may be interpreted by the regime as illegal; and by operating a pervasive system
 of informants that creates an atmosphere of mistrust at all levels of society.
 The State owns and controls the media. There is a state-ran daily newspaper, Al-
 Shams, with a circulation of 40,000. The Revolutionary Committees publish several
 smaller newspapers. The official news agency, JANA, is the designated conduit for
 official views. The regime does not permit the publication of opinions contrary to
 government policy. Such foreign publications as Newsweek, Time, the International
 Herald Tribune, Express, and Jeune Afrique are available, but authorities routinely
 censor them and can prohibit them from entry onto the market.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Public assembly is permitted
 only with regime approval and in support of the regime's positions. The Government
 limits the right of association; it grants such a right only to institutions affiliated
 with the regime. According to Law No. 71 of 1972, political activity found by the
 authorities to be treasonous is punishable by death. An offense may include any ac-
 tivity that is "opposed * * * to the principles of the Revolution." Independent trade
 
 
 1141 '
 
 unions and professional associations do not exist. The regime regards such struc-
 tures as unacceptable "intermediaries between the revolution and the working
 forces."
 Despite these restrictions, citizens staged several informal protests in 1994 to
 complain about the deteriorating economy and express dissatisfaction with the Gov-
 ernment. At least one large demonstration took place in Bani Walid, the location
 of the regime's preemptive strikes against the October 1993 coup attempt.
 c. Freedom of Religon.-Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim. In an apparent effort
 to eliminate all alternative power bases, the regime has banned the once powerful
 Sanusiyya Islamic sect. In its place, Mr. Qadhafi established the Islamic Call Soci-
 ety (ICS), which is the outlet for state-sanctioned religion as well as a tool for ex-
 o rting the Libyan revolution abroad. In 1992 the Government announced that the
 CS would be disbanded; however, its Director still conducts activities, suggesting
 that the organization remains operational. Islamic groups at variance with the
 state-approved teaching of Islam are banned.
 In 1994 security forces continued to arrest suspected members and sympathizers
 of banned Islamic groups and to monitor activities at mosques. Some practicing
 Muslims have shaved their beards to avoid harassment from security services. Mr.
 Qadhafi has publicly denounced Libyan "mujaheddin" (generally, conservative
 Islamists who fought with the Afghan resistance movement against Soviet forces)
 as threats to the regime. Most political detainees are reportedly associated with
 banned Islamic groups.
 Members of some minority religions are allowed to conduct services. Services in
 Christian churches are attended by the foreign community. A resident Catholic bish-
 op, aided by a small number of priests, operates two churches.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-With the exception of security areas, the Government usually does not
 restrict the internal movement of Libyan citizens. It requires exit permits for travel
 abroad. Following the failed October 1993 coup plot, the Government imposed addi-
 tional exit requirements, including authorization from certain ministries and limits
 on access to hard currency. Women must have their husbands' permission for travel
 abroad. Authorities routinely seize the passports of Americans, as well as those of
 some other nationals, married to Libyan citizens upon entry into Libya.
 In 1991 Libya and Egypt agreed to allow the unrestricted travel of their nationals
 across their mutual border, and thousands of Libyans reportedly go back and forth
 regularly. This travel, as well as travel from Libya to Tunisia, continued at a high
 level in 1994, partly as a result of the international embargo on airline service to
 Libya. In response to antiregime activity, the Government tightened border controls
 temporarily in late 1993 and again in mid-1994. The Government increased restric-
 tions on travel across the Tunisia-Libya border in late 1994, possibly in reaction to
 improving Tunisian relations with Israel. In late 1993, the Egyptian media reported
 that Mr. Qadhafi turned over three expatriate Egyptian Islamists to the Egyptian
 security services.
 The Revolutionary Committees maintain surveillance of some citizens when they
 are abroad. The right of return is more nearly an obligation; the regime often calls
 on students, many of whom receive a government subsidy, and others working
 abroad to return to Libya on little or no notice. Students studying abroad are inter-
 rogated upon their return. Some citizens, including exiled opposition figures, refuse
 to return.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The people of Libya do not have the right to change their government. Major gov-
 ernment decisions are controlled by Mr. Qadhafi, his close associates, and commit-
 tees acting in his name. Mr. Qadhafi appoints military officers and official func-
 tionaries down to junior levels. Corruption and favoritism, partially based on tribal
 origin, are major problems, adversely affecting government efficiency.
 The Government prohibits political parties and tribal or local groupings. Partici-
 pation in elections is mandatory, and all candidates are approved by the Revolution-
 ary Committees. Candidates may not be merchants, contractors, tribal advocates, of-
 ficials of the pre-1969 government, or persons who have been "attacked" by the revo-
 lution.
 In theory, political participation is guaranteed by the grassroots People's Commit-
 tees, which send representatives annually to the national General People's Congress
 (GPC). In practice, the GPC is a rubber stamp which approves all recommendations
 made by Mr. Qadhafi.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The regime prohibits the establishment of independent human rights organiza-
 tions. The Government created the Libyan Arab Human Rights Committee in May
 1989. However, there are no reports of any activities by the Committee.
 The regime does not respond substantively to appeals from Amnesty International
 (AD on behalf of detainees. In 1994 the regime described Al as a tool of Western
 interests and dismissed its work as neocolonialist. AI representatives last visited
 Libya in 1988.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Both law and traditional Islamic attitudes restrict women's rights. How-
 ever, Mr. Qadhafi has led efforts to improve the status of women and expand their
 access to educational and employment opportunities. Women may serve in the mili-
 ta RL"information is available on the extent to which violence against women is a
 problem in Libya.
 Children.-The Government has subsidized education and medical care, improv-
 ing the welfare of children in the past 25 years. However, declining revenues and
 general economic mismanagement have led to cutbacks, particularly in medical
 services. Some tribes located in remote areas still practice female genital mutilation,
 which is usually performed on young girls.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Arabic-speaking Muslims of mixed Arab and
 Berber ancestry make up 97 percent of the population. The principal non-Arab mi-
 norities are Berbers and blacks. There are frequent allegations of discrimination
 based on tribal status, particularly against Berbers in the interior and Tuaregs in
 the south. In the past, Mr. Qadhafi sought unsuccessfully to ensure that Berbers
 married only non-Berbers, presumably in an effort to erode their tribal identity.
 See Section 6.e. on the expulsion since 1990 of thousands of foreign workers, prin-
 cipally black Africans, under circumstances that have appeared discriminatory.
 People With Disabilities.-No information is available on the Government's efforts
 to assist people with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers do not have the right to establish or join
 unions of their own choosing. Workers may join the sole official trade union orgam-
 zation, the National Trade Unions' Federation, which was created in 1972. The Fed-
 eration is administered by the People's Committee system. The Government pro-
 hibits foreign workers from joining unions.
 The law does not guarantee the right to strike. There have been no reports of
 strikes by Libyan workers in years. In a June 1992 speech, Mr. Qadhafi affirmed
 that workers have the right to strike but added that strikes do not occur because
 the workers control their enterprises.
 The official trade union organization plays an active role in the International Con-
 federation of Arab Trade Unions and the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity. It exploits international trade union contacts to engage in propaganda efforts
 on behalf of the regime. The Arab Maghreb Trade Union Federation suspended the
 membership of Libya's trade union organization in 1993. The suspension followed
 reports that Mr. Qadhafi had replaced all union leaders, in some cases with loyal
 followers without union experience.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining does not
 exist in any meaningful sense because the labor law requires that the Government
 must approve all agreements.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-In a 1992 report, the International
 Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts stated that "persons expressing
 certain political views or views ideologically o pposed to the established political, so-
 cial, or economic system may be punished with penalties of imprisonment * * * in-
 volving * * * an obligation to perform labor." That statement accurately describes
 the situation in 1994. The same report noted that ublic employees may be sen-
 tenced to compulsory labor "* * * as a punishment for breaches of labor discipline
 or for participation in strikes even in services whose interruption would not endan-
 ger the life, personal safety, or health of the whole or part of the population." The
 Government has informed the ILO that legislation has abolished these provisions,
 but it has not submitted any corroborating evidence to the ILO.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of children is 18. Education is compulsory to age 15.
 
 
 1143
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The work force is about 1,120,000 workers,
 with an additional 1.2 million foreign workers, in a population of 4.4 million. There
 is a legally mandated minimum wage, which appears inadequate to afford a worker
 and fanily a decent standard of living. Wages, particularly in the public sector, are
 frequently months in arrears. The International Monetary Fund noted that a wage
 freeze imposed in 1981 remains in effect and has seriously eroded real income.
 The legal maximum workweek is 48 hours. The labor law defines the rights and
 duties ofworkers, including matters of compensation, pension rights, minimum rest
 periods, and working hours. Labor inspetrs are assigned to inspect places of work
 or compliance with occupational health and safety standards. Certain industries,
 such as the petroleum sector, try to maintain standards set by foreign companies.
 The labor law does not accordequality of treatment to foreign workers. Fori
 workers may reside in Libya only for the duration of their work contracts. They are
 subject to arbitrary preses, such as changes in work rules and contracts, and
 have little option but to accept such changes or to depart the country. Foreign work-
 ers who are not under contract enjoy no protection.
 In the spring of 1990, the Government expelled thousands of black African work-
 ers claiming they were in Libya illegally. Chadians, Nigerians, Nigeriens, Malians,
 and Ghanaians were detained for varying lengths of time and returned destitute to
 their countries. Press reports in several of these countries have carried unsubstan-
 tiated accounts of the mistreatment of these workers by Libyan authorities prior to
 their expulsion. At least 16 black African workers reportedly disappeared, and 1
 Malian was reportedly killed. In late 1993, Mr. Qadhafi called for the expulsion of
 most of the 25,000 Thai workers in Libya, in apparent retaliation for the Thai Gov-
 ernment's decision to remove approximately 200 Thai workers from the Tarhunah
 chemical weapons project. However, the regime took no action against the Thai
 workers in 1994.
 In September Mr. Qadhaft called for the expulsion of Palestinian workers, main-
 taining that establishment of a Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho elimi-
 nated Libya's obligation to care for the "homeless." In 1994 the regime did not
 renew the contracts of some Palestinian workers whose work contacts had expired.
