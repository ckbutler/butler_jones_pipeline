 ETHIOPIA
 Ethiopia continued its transition from a unitary to a federal system of govern-
 ment. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi leads the Government of the Federal Demo-
 cratic Republic of Ethiopia (GFDRE), which was elected in 1995 to replace a transi-
 tional government established in the aftermath of a long and brutal civil war. Most
 opposition groups boycotted the elections, and candidates affiliated with the domi-
 nant party within the transitional government, the Ethiopian Peoples' Revolution-
 ary Democratic Front (EPRDF), won a landslide victory in national and regional
 elections. Although observers judged the elections to be generally free and fair, they
 cited irregularities. The principal faction within the EPRDF remains Prime Minister
 Meles' Tigray Peoples' Liberation Front (TPLF). The judiciary is weak and overbur-
 dened, but continued to show signs of independence.
 Federal regions, largely organized along ethnic lines, are increasingly autono-
 mous, having greater local control over fiscal and political issues. However, the rela-
 tionship between the central Government and local officials, and among various ju-
 diciaries, has not yet been finalized. A history of highly centralized authority, great
 poverty, civil conflict, and unfamiliarity with democratic concepts combine to com-
 plicate the implementation of federalism. The Federal Government has considerable
 difficulty in protecting constitutional rights at the local level, especially when local
 authorities are unwilling or unable to do so. Local administrative, police, and judi-
 cial systems remain weak in many regions.
 Responsibility for internal security continued to-shift from the military forces to
 the police and local militia in most regions. Military forces conducted low-level oper-
 ations against the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), the Somalia-based Al'ittihad ter-
 rorist organization, and elements of the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF),
 although there was less of this activity than in 1997. In response to the movement
 of Eritrean forces into territory previously administered by Ethiopia and the result-
 ing outbreak of hostilities, the military forces engaged in hostilities with the Eri-
 trean armed forces. The national police organization is subordinate to the Ministry
 of Justice. Some local officials and members of the security forces committed human
 rights abuses.
 The economy is based on smallholder agriculture, with more than 85 percent of
 the estimated population of almost 61.7 million living in rural areas under very poor
 conditions. Per capita gross national product is estimated at $125 (875 birr). Real
 economic growth in 1998 was 6 percent. Coffee accounts for about 60 percent of ex-
 port revenues. The Government continued to implement an internationally sup-
 ported economic reform program designed to liberalize the economy, attract foreign
 investment, and bring state expenditures into balance with revenues.
 Serious problems still remain in the Government's human rights practices; al-
 though the Government made efforts to improve its record in a few areas, its record
 worsened significantly in others. Security forces sometimes beat or mistreated de-
 tainees, and arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens. These problems persisted de-
 sp it government efforts to improve the security forces' human rights practices
 through increased training. Prisons are seriously overcrowded, and prolonged pre-
 trial detention remains a problem. Crackdowns early in the year on suspected OLF
 activists resulted in the detention of approximately 100 Oromos who were held in-
 communicado for several days for allegedly assisting OLF activities. In response to
 the movement of Eritrean forces into territory previously administered by Ethiopia
 and the resulting outbreak of hostilities, the Government abrogated due process and
 detained and deported Eritreans and Ethiopian citizens of Eritrean origin. By year's
 
 
 148
 end, a total of 45,000 such persons of an estimated total population of up to 400,000
 had left Ethiopia for Eritrea; the vast majority were deported, although a small
 number left the country voluntarily to join family members who were deported. Al-
 though prompted by national security considerations, the sudden expulsions raised
 fundamental concerns regarding arbitrary arrest and detention, forced exile, the
 forcible separation of families, nationality issues, and the hardship and financial
 losses suffered by those who were detained or expelled. The judiciary lacks sufficient
 staff and funds, which limits its ability to provide citizens with the full protection
 provided for in the Constitution. In response, the Government sought to strengthen
 the judiciary; it trained additional civil and criminal judges and assigned them to
 regional courts and dismissed many others in an effort to eliminate judicial malfea-
 sance. The Supreme Court introduced new rules, applicable to the entire court sys-
 tem, to limit the practice of carrying over cases from one session to the next, thereby
 speeding up the provision of justice. In a significant action, the Government re-
 leased All Amhara People's Organization (AAPO) Chairman Dr. Asrat Woldeyes in
 December. Asrat was permitted to travel abroad for medical treatment. The Federal
 Prosecutor's Office suspended pending charges of treason against Asrat. The Gov-
 ernment infringes on citizen's privacy rights. The law regarding search warrants is
 widely ignored.
 The Government restricts freedom of the press and continued to detain or im-
 prison journalists. The number of journalists detained or imprisoned on any given
 date fluctuated from a high of 22 to a low of 13 at year's end. Most were accused
 or convicted of inciting ethnic hatred, committing libel, or publishing false informa-
 tion in violation of the 1992 Press Law. Some journalists continued to practice self-
 censorship. Nevertheless, the private press is very active and often critical of the
 Government. Although the Government has not banned any newspaper or publica-
 tion, the publication of some newspapers was suspended temporarily by the arrest
 or detention of editorial staff. On at least one occasion the Government limited free-
 dom of assembly. While freedom of association increased, the- Government still im-
 poses limits on this right. The registration process for nongovernmental organiza-
 tions (NGO's) is slow and tedious, but measurably improved during the year. Many
 NGO's that had long been unsuccessful in their efforts to register were registered
 in 1998. Nevertheless, the Government continues to refuse the registration of some
 NGO's. On at least one occasion local authorities interfered with religious freedom.
 The Government restricted freedom of movement. Societal discrimination and vio-
 lence against women and abuse of children remained problems; female genital muti-
 lation is widespread despite active governmentsupport for groups opposed to the
 practice. There were instances in which young girls were so  and forced to work
 as prostitutes. Societal discrimination against disabled persons is a problem. Ethnic
 conflicts and the fighting with Eritrea displaced a large number of persons. Child
 labor is a problem.                                                        I
 The Governments Special Prosecutor's Office (SPO) continued conducting the
 trials of persons accused of committing crimes under the brutal Marxist regime
 (1974-91) of Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam. Charges have been brought against
 5,198 persons. Many of those accused were held in detention for more than 6 years
 without formal charge. All have now been indicted and arraigned, and the testimony
 of victims continues to be heard in open court. However, more than half of those
 accused were not in custody and were charged in absentia.
 In May the Government took a step towards carrying out the constitutional re-
 quirement to establish a human rights commission and office of the ombudsman by
 convening an international conference for this purpose.,
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed reports of
 extrajudicial killings by government security forces, although there were
 unconfirmed reports from the Oromiya region. Violent encounters between police
 and armed opposition groups decreased significantly in 1998.
 As the result of a border conflict that began in June, Eritrea and Ethiopia ex-
 changed artillery fire and engaged in air attacks that led to numerous civilian cas-
 ualties. In June Ethiopian forces bombed the Asmara airport in Eritrea, killing one
 Eritrean civilian.
 In late August and early September, 50 children died in a refugee camp due to
 a lack of medical treatment (see Section 2.d.). In December police shot and killed
 a prisoner when he attempted to escape.
 An investigation into the 1997 death of teacher Wako Tola while in police custody
 revealed that he died of kidney disease. There has been no investigation into the
 
 
 149
 1997 deaths of three men suspected in an OLF attack, but the Government stated
 that the three men died in a shoot-out with police. The November 1997 arrests of
 three confessed OLF terrorists for deadly bomb attacks against the Tigray hotel and
 the Blue Tops restaurant in Addis Ababa and the Mekonnen hotel in Dire Dawa
 in which several persons were killed were followed by arrests of groups of individ-
 uals allegedly involved in planning the attacks. In November 1997, the Federal Po-
 lice arrested 17 alleged supporters of the OLF. A total of 31 Oromo activists and
 suspected OLF members were arraigned on various terrorist and weapons' posses-
 sion charges in December 1997.
 In 1997 the Federal High Court in Addis Ababa began the arraignment and pros-
 ecution of 5,198 persons formally charged with genocide and other war crimes, in-
 cluding extrajudcial kiings, under the previous regime. For example, in January
 the SF0 charged Major Melaku Tefera, former administrator of Gondar province,
 with genocide and crimes against humanity involving the mass slaughter of 1,000
 persons during the 1977-78 Red Terror campaign. A state prosecutor told the court
 that Me   "had killed or ordered the klling of 691 opposition members. He also
 was charged with "exterminating 411 persons for minor offenses, including theft."
 Of the 5,198 persons charged, 2,246 were in detention, while the remaining 2,952
 were charged in absentia. At year's end, witnesses were being heard and evidence
 taken in the ongoing trials.
 Banditry remained a serious problem in a few parts of the country. Bandits, often
 heavily armed, killed civilians, police and soldiers during robberies and attempted
 robberies. Most evidence suggests that their motives were primarily economic.
 In June Eritrean forces bombed the Ethiopian town of Mekele and killed 47 civil-
 ians, including children. In June and again in November, Eritrean forces fired artil-
 lery shells at the Ethiopian town of Adrigat, killing six persons and wounding sev-
 eral others.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports of disappearances per-
 petrated by the Government. The Ethiopian Teachers Association claims that five
 of its members disappeared; however, the claim is difficult to substantiate.
 In 1997 the Federal High Court in Addis Ababa began the arraignment and pros-
 ecution of 5,198 persons charged with genocide and other war crimes under the pre-
 vious regime, including the disappearance of 14, 209 persons. Of the 5198 persons
 charged, 2,246 were in detention, while the remaining 2,952 were charged in
 absentia. At year's end, witnesses were being heard and evidence taken in the ongo-
 ing trials.
 Several disappearances during the year were attributed to terrorist organizations.
 In March the ONLF claimed res ponsibility for the kidnaping of a foreign tourist,
 who was held for several day beore being released. In June six unknown persons
 kidnaped employees of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) who
 were working in the Ogaden region. They were released in July.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits the use of torture and mistreatment of prisoners; how-
 ever, there were numerous credible reports that security officials sometimes beat or
 mistreated detainees. There were reports that the president of the Ethiopian Teach-
 ers' Association, Dr. Taye Woldesemayat, was kept handcuffed in his cell for long
 periods and denied access to adequate medical care. Tesfaye Deressa and Solomon
 Nemera of the private newspaper Urjii reportedly were beaten, and there were
 unconfirmed reports that Nemera also was handcuffed for long periods. Government
 media published occasional reports of officials who were jailed or dismissed for
 abuse of authority and violations of human rights. The Government stated that it
 would improve its human rights record and continued to remove and jail corrupt
 or abusive officials. The Government enlisted donors to-provide additional police
 training to combat this problem.
 Prison overcrowding remains a serious problem. Prisoners often are allocated less
 than 21.5 square feet of sleeping space in a room that may contain up to 200 per-
 sons, and some prisoners must sleep outdoors. Prison food is adequate, but prison
 conditions are unsanitary and access to medical care is not reliable. Prisoners typi-
 cally are permitted daily access to prison yards, which often included working
 farms, mechanics' shops, etc. Visitors are permitted, and many prisoners receive
 regular deliveries of food and other supplies from family members. Prison letters all
 must be written in Amharic, making outside contact difficult for non-Amharic
 speakers; however, this restriction is not enforced. Female prisoners are housed sep-
 arately from men, and rape does not appear to be a problem.
 Approximately 1,200 civilian residents of Eritrean origin and 166 prisoners of war
 captured in fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea were housed first at a military
 cam   n Fiche, 2 hours from the capital, and then at Bilate camp, some 6 hours
 of Addis Ababa (see Section 1.d.). The Government allowed the ICRC access
 
 
 150
 to the detainees on a regular basis. Once the detainees were moved to the Bilate
 camp, the Government also permitted foreign diplomatic observers to visit and to
 speak with the prisoners. While conditions generally were described as Spartan but
 adequate, an international team of observers that visited Bilate camp in July found
 that there was not enough food, that many persons slept without blankets or mats,
 that medical care was rudimentary, and that sanitation was poor. According to
 international observers, conditions at Bilate improved as the year progressed. There
 were credible reports that detainees received physical punishment for infractions of
 camp rules. There was an unverified report from a student who claimed to have
 been detained at the Fiche camp and stated that abuse of detainees is routine and
 that detainees are beaten after they talk to ICRC officials. In late August and early
 September, 50 children died in a refugee camp due to a lack of medical treatment
 (see Section 2.d.).
 The army sometimes used military camps for the temporary detention and inter-
 rogation of OLF fighters and alleged OLF supporters. These camps are located near
 Goba in Bale zone, Oromiya.
 The Government permits independent monitoring of prison conditions, military
 camps, and police stations by the ICRC and sometimes by diplomatic missions. The
 ICR8 had routine access to regional prisons, civilian detention facilities, and police
 stations throughout the country, although the Government did not grant the I CRC
 permission to visit federal prisons on a regular basis. The ICRC has restricted ac-
 cess to military detention facilities in eastern Ethiopia, where suspected OLF fight-
 ers are held.
 There -were frequent diplomatic visits to some prominent detainees held by the
 SPO for alleged, war crimes, or for allegedly plotting violent insurrection, including
 former Derg housing ministry official and governor of Sidamo, Abera Yemane-Ab,
 1968 Olympic marathon winner Mamo Wolde, former Addis Ababa University Presi-
 dent Dr. Alemayehu Tefera, Ethiopian Teachers' Association (ETA) secretary gen-
 eral Dr. Taye Woldesemayat, editor-in-chief of Uriji newspaper Tesfaye Deressa, and
 AAPO founder and personal physician to two former heads of state, Professor Asrat
 Woldeyes. None of the six reported abuse while in prison, although other prisoners
 reportedly were beaten. International observers, among them a delegation from the
 European Parliament, also were granted access to prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and both the Criminal
 and Civil Codes prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, but the Government does
 not always respect these rights in practice.
 Under the Criminal Procedure Code, -any person detained must be charged and
 informed of the charges within 48 hours and, in most cases, be-offered release on
 bail. Those persons believed to have committed serious offenses may be detained for
 15 days while police conduct an investigation, and for additional 15-day periods
 while the investigation continues. Some offenses, such as murder and treason, are
 not bailable. In practice, and especially in the outlying regions, authorities often de-
 tain persons without a warrant, frequently do not charge them within 48 hours,
 and-if persons are released on bail-never recall them to court. Over 10,000 crimi-
 nal suspects remained in detention without charge, most of whom were accused of
 participating in armed actions by the OLF or the ONLF. Often these lengthy deten-
 tions are due to the severe shortage, and limited training of judges, prosecutors, and
 attorneys, as well as to longstanding traditional practices.
 Federal and regional authorities arrested ad detained more than 1,500 persons
 without charge or trial for activities allegedly in support of armed opposition groups.
 The vast majority of these incidents took place in the Oromiya andSomali regional
 states. In typical cases, security forces arrested and held these persons incommuni-
 cado for several days or weeks before eventually releasing them. Observers report
 that with the decrease of armed actions by opposition groups, incidents of detention
 have declined, although more than 10,000 persons allegedly associated with armed
 opposition groups remain in detention. Some 93 OLF fighters arrested in 1994 re-
 main in detention.
 'From February to April, 34 Oromos were arrested, often without warrants, and
 held incommunicado. Along with 31 Oromos arrested in November 1997, they were
 tried in closed sessions for alleged terrorist activities. Their verdicts still were pend-
 ing at year's end. In April security forces sealed the Oromo Human Rights League's
 office because of alleged connections with the OLF, confiscated documents, and de-
 tained league member and prominent local attorney Bekele Nadi for 2 days of ques-
 tioning. Bekele Nadi has not been detained subsequently.
 Although the OLF is an illegal organization due to its refusal to renounce violence
 and accept the Constitution, simple membership is not necessarily cause for arrest.
 OLF members travel abroad without hindrance. However, the Government draws a
 distinction between the OLF rank-and-file membership and its leadership.
 
 
 151
 The authorities arrested five journalists and editors associated with the opposition
 newspaper Urii in October and November 1997. The arrests of the journalists oc-
 curred without warrants, and the detainees were held incommunicado for up to a
 month. Four of the detainees, after being held for almost 4 months, were charged
 with involvement in terrorist activities and violating the Press Law. They remained
 in detention at year's end. One detainee was charged with violating the Press Law,
 but was released on bail in December (see Section 2.a.). In January the authorities
 detained four journalists from the influential Amharic private newspaper Tohia and
 kept them in jail for 6 months. In July authorities detained three journalists of the
 private weekly Nishan for 2 months (see Section 2.a.).
 In September three Ethiopian Teacher's Association executive council members
 were detained without charge for 2 months (see Section 2.a.). They were subse-
 uently released.
 f the 5,198 persons charged with genocide and other war crimes under the pre-
 vious regime, some had spent 6 years in pretrial detention (see Sections l.a. and
 I.e.).
 In 1997 the SPO removed the parliamentary immunity of two EPRDF Members
 of Parliament, arrested them, and indicted them for war crimes. The Federal Sports
 Commissioner was arrested because of his affiliation with the previous regime's
 "reign of terror." Their trials, as well as the trials of Olympic marathon champion
 Mamo Wolde and former Addis Ababa University President Alemayehu Tefera, were
 ongoing at year's end. The trial of Dr. Taye Woldesmayet, ETA president, began in
 1997 but was ongoing at year's end. Dr. Woldesmayet was indicted for sedition for
 alleged involvement in an underground terrorist organization.
 Opposition groups allege that some of the persons detained by the SPO, as well
 as some others, are held for political reasons. The Government denies that it holds
 persons for political reasons.
 Approximately 1,200 civilian residents of Eritrean origin and 85 Eritrean ex-
 change students were detained following the outbreak of hostilities between Ethio-
 pia and Eritrea. More than 50 of the students were subsequently released and de-
 ported to Eritrea, but over 30 remained in detention at year's end. The Government
 justified these detentions for reasons of national security. A total of 166 prisoners
 of war captured in fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea also were detained.
 Exile is illegal, and the Constitution provides that Ethiopian nationals shall not
 be deprived oftheir nationality against their will. However, since the outbreak of
 conflict with Eritrea, the Government had detained and deported thousands of per-
 sons with links to Eritrea or of Eritrean origin on national security grounds. he
 Government asserted that these were not Ethiopian citizens, and had been involved
 in actions detrimental to the security of Ethiopia. Moreover, many of these persons
 had Ethiopian documentation. The Government actions raised serious issues of due
 process, as there were no preliminary hearings to determine the merits of the depor-
 tations, no right to counsel was provided to detainees, and detainees had only a very
 circumscribed opportunity to register protest. In addition, the issue of the national-
 ity of Eritrean-origin Ethiopians has never been settled since the independence of
 Eritrea in 1993. Heads of households were taken without warning, detained, and
 often deported via bus within less than 48 hours, sometimes leaving behind children
 with no family member to look after them. Remaining family members were given
 arbitrary deadlines to sell property, and sometimes were subjected to departure
 taxes-based on estimated annual income and unpaid balances on government bank
 loans. The Government apparently attempted to intimidate persons of Eritrean
 background. For example, in June the Government executed an Eritrean business-
 man, Jamil Yasin Mohamed. While Mohamed was convicted of killing Major Gen-
 eral Hayelom Araya, the timing of this execution, the first legal execution since
 1991, was seen by many as a warning to Eritreans in Ethiopia and a morale booster
 for the Ethiopian military. Some Ethiopians of Eritrean origin, a number of whom
 had never even been to Eritrea, attempted to leave Ethiopia by means other than
 the deportation bus, but routinely were denied exit visas and often had their Ethio-
 pian passports confiscated. There were reports that those deported included elderly
 persons and children. By year's end, a total of 45,000 Eritreans and Ethiopian citi-
 zens of Eritrean origin of an estimated population of up to 400,000 had left Ethiopia
 for Eritrea; the vast majority were deported, although a small number left the coun-
 try voluntarily to join family members who were deported (see Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, it is weak and overburdened. Although the federal and regional
 courts continued to show signs ofjudicia independence, in practice severe shortages
 of adequately trained personnel in many regions, as well as serious financial con-
 straints, combine to deny most citizens the full protections provided for in the Con-
 stitution.
 
 
 152
 Consistent with the Constitution, the Government continued to decentralize and
 restructure the judiciary along federal lines with the establishment of courts at the
 zonal (county) and regional (state) levels. The federal High Court and federal Su-
 preme Court adjudicate cases involving federal law, transregional issues, and na-
 tional security and hear both original and appeal cases. The regional judiciary is
 increasingly autonomous; with district (Woreda), zonal, high, and supreme courts
 mirroring the structure of the federal judiciary. The Government has delegated
 some of the war crimes trials to the supreme courts in the regions where the crimes
 allegedly were committed.
 The Government continued a sweeping overhaul of the military justice system.
 The Government relies on foreign assistance to train officers and noncommissioned
 officers in topics including judicial and nonjudicial punishment, human rights, and
 the conduct of soldiers during military operations.
 The Constitution provides that persons arrested have the right to be released on
 bail. However, in May regional authorities arrested the president and two Supreme
 Court judges of the Gambella regional Supreme Court for defying a regional govern-
 ment order to deny bail to former regional officials charged with corruption. The
 judges subsequently were released due to intervention from the Federal Govern-
 ment.
 Authorities detained more than 1,500 persons without charge, especially in the
 Oromiya and Somali, regions, for supposed involvement with the OLF and the
 ONLF, but-ultimately released many without an appearance before a judge (see-Sec-
 tion 1.d.). Such cases often reflect arbitrary actions on the part of local officials, but
 also result from an overburdened and cumbersome judicial system marked by a
 shortage of trained and competentprosecutors and judges.
 Regional offices of the federal Ministry of Justice monitor local judicial develop-
 ments, but the federal judicial presence in the regions is limited. Anecdotal evidence
 suggests that some local officials interpret decentralization to mean that they no
 longer are accountable to any higher authority, even within their own regions. For
 example, there were reports that police officers disregarded decisions of the federal
 Supreme Court, and instances when police approached several judges until they
 found one aould issue an arrest warrant or remand a case with little or no evidence.
 To remedy the seve       r      ienced staff in the judicial system, the Govern-
 ment continued to identify and traln lower court judges and prosecutors, although
 officials acknowledge the pay scale offered must be increased significantly to attract
 the required numbers of competent professionals. Senior government officials
 charged with judicial oversight estimate that the creation of a truly independent
 and skilled judicial apparatus would take decades. The Government has welcomed
 foreign financial and technical assistance to accelerate this process.
 Pending passage by regional legislatures of laws articular to their region, all
 judges are gudedexclusively by the federal proceduradcand substantive codes.
 According to the Constiion, accused persons have the right to a public trial by
 an ordinary court of law within a reasonable time after having been charged. Ac-
 cused persons have the right to be represented by legal counsel of their choice. In
 practice, however, lengthy pretrial detention is common, closed proceedings oc-
 curred, and at times, detainees were allowed little or no contact with their legal
 counsel. The Public Defender's Office provides legal counsel to indigent defendants,
 although its scope remains severely limited, especially with respect to SPO trials.
 The law does not allow the defense access to prosecutorial evidence before the trial.
 The Constitution provides legal standing to some preexisting religious and cus-
 tomary courts and gives federal and regional legislatures the authority to recognize
 other courts. By law, both parties to a dispute must agree before a customary or
 religious court may hear a case. Shari'a (Islamic) courts may hear religious and fa-
 ily cases involving Muslims. In addition, some traditional courts still function. Al-
 though not sanctioned by law, these courts resolve disputes for the majority of citi-
 zens who live in rural areas and who generally have little access to formal judicial
 systems.
 The SPO was established in August 1992 to create an historical recor of the
 abuses during the Mengistu government and to bring to justice those criminally re-
 sponsible for human rights violations. The Federal High Court has considered the
 cases of 2,658 defendants accused of genocide, war crimes, and aggravated homicide.
 Trials began in 1994 and continue; however, the 3-year-long process is subject to
 frequent and lengthy adjournments. Court-appointed attorneys, sometimes with in-
 adequate skills and experience, represent many of the defendants, following claims
 that they could not afford an adequate defense. The Government also is trying 2,952
 persons in absentia, including the former dictator colonel Mengistu Hale Mariam,
 who is now in exile in Zimbabwe. All the defendants in custody appeared before
 court in 1998. These cases were still in progress at" year's end, and no defendant
 
 
 153
 had been released on bail. Legal observers expect relatively few additional cases to
 be brought, with many defendants charged and tried collectively in each instance.
 On September 10, the Government announced the release of 33 SPO defendants for
 lack of evidence.
 On December 27, the Government released AAPO chairman Professor Asrat
 Woldeyes, who was convicted in 1994 of conspiracy and incitement to violence and
 sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment, and permitted him to travel abroad for medical
 treatment. The Federal Prosecutor's Office suspended all pending charges against
 him. Asrat had been hospitalized for diabetes, vision loss in his right eye, a recur-
 ring heart condition, high blood pressure, and hypertension.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires judicial search warrants but, in practice, they seldom are obtained outside
 Addis Ababa.
 There were unconfirmed reports that in certain rural areas local officials use
 threats of land redistribution to enforce support for the ruling coalition.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and the 1992 Press Law pro-
 vide for the freedom of speech and of the press; however, the Government used legal
 and other mechanisms to restrict these rights in practice. The Government contin-
 ued to prosecute journalists and editors for publishing articles that violated the
 Press Law, and some journalists practiced self-censorship. Nonetheless, the private
 press was very active and often published articles extremely critical of the Govern-
 ment.
 The Government uses provisions of the Press Law concerning publishing false in-
 formation, inciting ethnic hatred, and libel to justify the arrest of journalists. The
 number of journalists detained or imprisoned on any given date fluctuated from  13
 to 22; at year's end, 13 journalists remained in detention.
 In January the authorities detained four journalists from the influential Amharic
 private newspaper Tobia and kept them in jail for 6 months. Only one, the editor-
 in-chief, was charged. The authorities arrested five journalists and editors of the
 Oromo-controlled private weekly "Urjii" in October and December 1997 for allegedly
 abusing their free speech rights. Four of the detainees, Urjii editors Tesfaye
 Deressa, Solomon Nemera and Alemu Tolossa and publisher Garomo Bekele, after
 being held for almost 4 months, were charged with involvement in terrorist activi-
 ties, and violations of the Press Law. They remained in detention at year's end. One
 detainee, Urjii Deputy Manager Waqshum Bacha, was charged with violations of
 the Press Law, but was released on bail in December (see Section 2.a.). Authorities
 detained three journalists of the private weekly Nishan in July, allegedly for an edi-
 torial that cautioned against propaganda against Eritreans. All three were released
 in September.
 However, despite the threat of legal action, the private press still is very active.
 Many private newspapers continue to publish false information, unsubstantiated
 stories, and harsh antigovernment articles without any official sanction. The Gov-
 ernment has not banned any newspaper or publication. However, the newspapers
 Ethop, Wenchiff, and Tobia were forced to interrupt their publication because of the
 arrest of the bulk of their staff.
 A major step by the Government in providing access to information was the estab-
 lishment of the new Office of the Government Spokesperson soon after the conflict
 with Eritrea broke out in June. The Spokesperson started distributing press re-
 leases to the Ethiopian news agency, foreign embassies, foreign news agencies, and
 other international organizations. The Government continued to bar some private
 newspapers and news organizations from attending government briefings and press
 conferences, and most government officials still refuse to meet with private journal-
 ists.
 Although most private newspapers support the Government regarding the conflict
 with Eritrea, the private press remains confrontational and continues to report that
 government forces or regional officials commit human rights abuses. Most private
 press accounts are unsubstantiated and extremely difficult to verify.
 Citizens are generally free to discuss publicly any topic they choose. A number
 of groups critical of the Government held press conferences and public meetings
 without retribution. However, authorities disrupted an ETA seminar in August by
 sealing ETA offices, although the meeting continued unimpeded at another location.
 On September 17, reportedly acting without a warrant, police ordered ETA acting
 general secretary Shemelis Zewdie and two executive board members to open sealed
 offices and surrender documents. When the three refused to cooperate, they were
 detained for over 2 months.
 
 
 Because of an 85 percent illiteracy rate and extreme poverty, only about 1 percent
 of citizens regularly read any newspaper or magazine, and citizens outside Addis
 Ababa have extremely limited access to the print media. About 34 weekly and 2
 fortnightly newspapers appear regularly. Nearly all private newspapers as well as
 the state newspapers are printed at one of the state-owned printing presses, but
 there were no reports of problems printing any newspapers or magazines.
 Foreign journalists continued to operate freely and often wrote articles critical of
 government policies. They or their local affiliates were granted greater access to
 government officials than were local journalists. In January the Ministry of Infor-
 mation imposed new regulations requiring foreign journalists to apply for visas 2
 weeks before travel and requiring work permits and evidence of training for foreign
 correspondents. In response to criticism, the regulations were rescinded a month
 later.
 While much of the private press continues to lack professionalism in its reporting,
 some print media are developing into more responsible publications. Others are ac-
 tually opposition newsletters that often purvey unsubstantiated criticism of the Gov-
 ernment. Several are tied to distinct ethnic groups, especially Amhara and Oromo,
 yet severely criticize the Government for being ethnocentric. Newspapers critical of
 government leaders and their policies are widely available in the capital, but scarce
 elsewhere.
 Radio remains the most influential medium in reaching those who live in rural
 areas. The Press Law allows for private radio stations, but the only operating non-
 governmental radio stations are Radio Fana, a station controlled by the ruling
 EPRDF coalition, and the Mekele Voice of Tigray. The Government operates the sole
 television station. Ownership of private satellite receiving dishes, facsimile ma-
 chines, and modems is permitted. Internet access is unrestricted, but private sat-
 ellite transmission uplinks are not allowed.
 The official media, including broadcast, wire service, and print media, are legally
 -autonomous and responsible for their own management and partial revenue genera-
 tion, although they continue to receive government -subsidies. Government reporters
 practice self-censorship but at times have questioned official policies. The Govern-
 mens press and information department acts as an official spokesperson and imple-
 mented a 1996 information policy, which guides contacts among government, the
 press, and the public.
 Academic freedom is respected. In general, however, political activity is not en-
 couraged on university campuses. Despite government assurances that the Addis
 Ababa University would not be affected by the conflict with Eritrea, the institution
 dismissed nine Ethiopian academics of Eritrean origin. In addition the authorities
 detained approximately 82 Eritrean exchange students early in the hostilities; some
 30 of the students remained in detention in Bilate on grounds that they had re-
 ceived military training and would be conscripted into the Eritrean army if released.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly; however, while the Government generally permitted
 groups to assemble, on at least one occasion it interfered with this right. In August
 authorities disrupted an ETA seminar by sealing the association's offices (see Sec-
 tion 2.a.). Organizers of large public meetings or demonstrations must notify the
 Government in advance and obtain a permit. Permits appear to be granted rou-
 tinely.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association and the right to engage in
 unrestricted peaceful political activity; however, the Government limits this right in
 practice. The Government changed its procedures for registration of NGO's in 1996,
 but a number of problems regarding NGO's remain unresolved. The NGO registra-
 tion process remains slow and tedious, but improved during the year. Many NGO's
 that had long been unsuccessful in their efforts were registered, including the Ac-
 tion Professionals for the Advancement of People. Primary registration responsibil-
 ity rests with the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), which conducted a public review of
 draft comprehensive written procedures for NGO registration on September 24. The
 Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO), which the Government asserts is pri-
 marily a political organization, has not been granted registration as an NGO, yet
 operated freely. The Ethiopian Free Press Journalist's Association also has experi-
 enced problems registering as an NGO. Authorities closed the offices of the Oromo
 Human Rights League (OHRL) in April, on the grounds that that some OHRL board
 members wished to use the organization as a front for the OLF. Some members of
 the OHRL were detained and questioned about OLF involvement (see Section 1.d.).
 Board members denied any connection to the OLF. The OHRL had been operating
 without a license, but it had fulfilled the prerequisites for licensing and had been
 waiting for over a year to get a license (see Sections 1.d. and 4).
 
 
 The Government requires political parties to register with the National Election
 Board (NEB). Parties that do not participate in two consecutive national elections
 are subject to deregistration. There are about 60 organized political parties. Of
 these, eight are national parties and the remainder operate only in limited areas.
 Opposition Council of Alternative Forces for Peace and Democracy (CAFPD) offi-
 cial Dr. Beyene Petros complained that local officials in the Southern Peoples' region
 blocked CAFPD candidates from registering to compete in December 29, 1997 dis-
 trict elections. Although an investigation by the NEB discounted many of these alle-
 gations, the federal Government began a series of constitutional awareness con-
 erences for local officials. The opposition AAPO is registered with the NEB yet its
 activists often complain that the Government restricts their ability to campaign for
 popular support.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, includ-
 ing the right of conversion; although the Government generally respects this right
 in practice, on occasion local authorities disrupted religious services. There have
 been instances of conflict among religious groups, most noticeably between Orthodox
 Christians, Pentecostals, and Evangelicals. In most interreligious disputes, the Gov-
 ernment maintains neutrality and tries to be an impartial arbitrator. However, in
 February, despite generally good relations with the Government, Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses reported that regional officials in Tigray disrupted religious services, which
 they termed illegal meetings, and arrested and briefly detained some 50 believers.
 Authorities in Tigray also sought to prevent Jehovah's Witnesses from proselytizing.
 The Government decided that Jehovah's Witnesses of Eritrean origin, who might
 face religious persecution in Eritrea, were not to be subject to deportation. Unlike
 in past years, there were no complaints by Pentecostals and Evangelicals that the
 police failed to protect them adequately during instances of interreligious conflict.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement, including the right
 of domestic and foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation; however, the Govern-
 ment restricted these rights in practice. In principle, citizens can and do freely
 change their residence or workplace. However, after the outbreak of the border con-
 flict with Eritrea, Eritreans and Ethiopian citizens of Eritrean-origin were subjected
 to detention and deportation to Eritrea. By year's end, a total of 45,000 such persons
 of an estimated population of up to 400,000 had left Ethiopia for Eritrea; the vast
 majority were deported, although a small number left the country voluntarily to join
 family members who were deported (see Section 1.f.). Passports of Eritrean-origin
 Ethiopian citizens routinely were confiscated. The Government stated that it took
 these actions in response to security concerns.
 The law requires citizens and residents to obtain an exit visa before departing the
 country. However, in the case of Eritrean-origin Ethiopian citizens who feared de-
 portation, exit visas were extremely difficult to obtain after the outbreak of the bor-
 der conflict with Eritrea.
 The Government of Israel opened an office in Gondar to assist approximately
 3,000 Falashas (Ethiopian Jews) from the Quara area near the Sudan border who
 were in the process of immigrating to Israel. Over 8,000 Feles Mora (Ethiopians who
 claim that their ancestors were converted forcibly from Judaism to Christianity)
 have also expressed an interest in immigration to Israel. Such cases are handled
 under provisons of Israeli law pertaining to family reunification.
 As a result of the border dispute with Eritrea, more than 188,000 persons were
 forced to flee their homes in northern Ethiopia. The Government has presented re-
 lief and rehabilitation proposals for these internally displaced persons to bilateral
 donors and NGO's. From late July to early August, ethnic conflict in the south-cen-
 ter of the country displaced approximately 160,000 persons, but they were resettled
 in their homes when the situation improved later in the year (see Section 5).
 The law includes provisions for the granting of refugee or asylee status in accord-
 ance with the provisions of the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Ref-
 ugees and its 1967 Protocol. The Government treats asylum seekers fairly and co-
 operates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees and returning citizens.
 There were no reports of the forced expulsion of individuals having a valid claim
 to refugee status; however, early in the year there was a major roundup of Sudanese
 refugees residing in urban areas. Before they were moved to refugee camps along
 the Sudanese border, the refugees were detained temporarily under sometimes over-
 crowded conditions, which in one instance provoked unrest in a detention facility re-
 sulting in a death. In late August and early September, 50 children died in a refu-
 gee camp due to diarrheal disease and lack of medical treatment. Measures were
 taken in early November to improve medical care at the facility.
 
 
 156
 Ethiopia, in cooperation with the UNHCR, continues to provide first asylum to ap-
 proximately 270,000 refugees, mostly from Sudan and Somalia. There are up to
 8,000 Djiboutian Afar asylum seekers in the country, but they have not been grant-
 ed refugee status. Negotiations began in 1997 between the Government and the
 UNHCR concerning their status and were ongoing at year's end.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised the right to vote for a national government for the first time
 in 1995. However, most opposition groups chose to boycott the elections, although
 opposition participation was widely believed to be possible. Boycotting parties
 claimed that the Government impeded their ability to participate in the political
 process. Concerted efforts by foreign governments to promote dialog and political
 reconciliation between the Government and several key opposition groups leading
 up to the elections were not successful. Nevertheless, observers organized by foreign
 donor governments, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and a coalition of do-
 mestic NGO's judged the elections to be generally free and fair, although they cited
 numerous irregularities. The boycott was one factor that led to an overwhelming vic-
 tory by -candidates of the better-funded and better-organized EPRDF over can-
 didates of the relatively weak and poorly organized opposition parties and independ-
 ent candidates. By-elections were held in mid-June with minimal opposition partici-
 pation. Several opposition parties, including the Oromo National Congress, success-
 fully registered with the National Electoral Board.
 Political participation remains closed to a number of organizations that have not
 renounced violence and do not accept the Government as a legitimate authority.
 These groups include Medhin, the Coalition of Ethiopian Democratic Forces, the
 Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party, the Oromo Liberation Front, some elements
 of the Ogaden National Liberation Front, and several smaller Somali groups.
 Neither law nor practice restricts the participation of women or minorities in poli-
 tics. While 'women's status and political participation are greater than ever, women
 are represented minimally in the Council of Ministers and among the leadership of
 all political organizations. Only 1 of the 15 members of the Council of Ministers is
 a woman; 2 other women hold ministerial rank; and a number of others hold senior
 positions. There are only 13 women among the 545 members of the lower House of
 Peoples' Representatives; in the upper house, the House of Federation, 7 of 108
 members are women, including the speaker. Among the 23 judges on the federal
 High Court, 6 are women, and there are 2 women on the Supreme Court.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights organizations include the Ethiopian Human Rights and Peace Cen-
 ter, the Ethiopian Congress for Democracy, the Ethiopian Women's Lawyers Asso-
 ciation, the Ethiopian Human Rights League, the Inter-Africa Group, and Hundee.
 These groups are engaged primarily in civic and human rights education, legal as-
 sistance, and trial monitoring. During a national conference in December, female
 journalists formed the Ethiopian Women's Media Association, which seeks to pro-
 mote women and women's issues in the media. With foreign assistance, the Confed-
 eration of Ethiopian Trade Unions began a program of democracy and human rights
 education. The Ethiopian Human Rights Council, a self-proclaimed human rights
 monitoring organization, continues to operate without legal status as an NGO be-
 cause the Government considers some of its activities as primarily political. The
 Government closed the OHRL in April, alleging that it was a front for the OLF (see
 Sections 1.d. and 2.b.).
 The ICRC conducts regular visits to detention centers throughout the country (see
 Section 1.c.). In August the ICRC began to escort Eritrean-origin deportees during
 their walk across "no man's land," the distance from the deportation bus stops at
 the Ethiopia border into Eritrea. The Government also invited the ICRC, foreign
 diplomats, and international NGO's to visit centers where detained Eritreans were
 gathered prior to deportation, and permitted diplomats to visit Eritrean-origin de-
 tainees in Bilate prison camp.
 Delegations from Human Rights Watch/Africa, the Committee to Protect Journal-
 ists, Rapporteurs Sans Frontieres, Amnesty International, Education International,
 the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights, and various international labor organi-
 zations visited during the year. Representatives from these organizations held sub-
 stantive discussions with a number of senior government officials, including Prime
 Minister Meles. The Government continues to encourage international human rights
 groups and foreign diplomats to observe the war crimes trials that began in 1994.
 
 
 157
 The Government hosted an international conference on the establishment of a
 human rights commission and office of ombudsman on May 18-22, and participants
 included a number of prominent international human rights advocates. The con-
 ference represented a step towards the implementation of the constitutional require-
 ment to establish a human rights commission and office of the ombudsman and an
 attempt to bolster human rights awareness among government officials and the gen-
 eral public. Opposition parties and domestic and international human rights organi-
 zations did not participate, in some instances because they were not invited, but
 they were expected to participate in the next phase of the process.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all persons are equal before the law. The law pro-
 vides that all persons should have equal and effective protection without discrimina-
 tion on grounds of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, na-
 tional or social origin, wealth, birth or other status. Hiowever, the Government has
 not yet put fully into place mechanisms for the effective enforcement of these protec-
 tions.
 Women.-Culturally based abuses, including wife beating and marital rape, are
 pervasive social problems. While women have recourse to the police and the courts,
 societal norms and limited infrastructure inhibit many women from seeking legal
 redress, especially in remote areas. Social practices obstruct investigations into rape
 and the prosecution of the rapist, and many women are not aware of their rights
 under the law.
 The Constitution provides for the equality of women; however, these provisions
 are often not applied in practice. Although women played a prominent role (includ-
 ing service in combat) during the civil war, in practice women do not enjoy equal
 status with men. The law considers men and women as equal, but tradition and cul-
 tural factors place the husband as head of the household. All land belongs to the
 State. However, land reforms enacted in March 1997 stipulate that women may ob-
 tain government leases to land. Discrimination is most acute in rural areas, where
 85 percent of the population lives. In urban areas, women have fewer employment
 opportunities than men do, and the jobs available do not provide equal pay for equal
 work. To further enhance the status of women, the Government formally adopted
 a National Program of Action in 1997. The program seeks to expand educational
 and work opportunities for women, improve women's access to health care, and edu-
 cate women about certain unhealthy traditional practices such as early marriage.
 Children.-The Government has encouraged the efforts of domestic and inter-
 national NGO's that focus on children's social, health and legal issues. However, the
 Government has limited ability to support efforts to provide improved health care
 and basic education. Despite efforts by the Government to increase the number of
 schools, there are not enough schools to accommodate the country's youth, and less
 than 30 percent of children actually attend school; many do so in shifts.
 The societal abuse of young girls continues to be a serious problem. The great ma-
 jority of girls undergo some form of female genital mutilation (FGM), which is wide-
 ly condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and psy-
 chological health. Reports place the percentage of women and girls who have under-
 gone FGM at between 73 and 90 percent. Clitorectomies typically are performed 7
 days after birth, and the excision of the labia. Infibulation, the most extreme and
 dangerous form of FGM, is performed at any time between the age of 8 and the
 onset of puberty. The law does not specifically prohibit FGM, although it is officially
 discouraged, and the Government has been very supportive of the National Commit-
 tee on Traditional Practices in Ethiopia, which is dedicated to eradicating FGM. The
 Government also is working to discourage the practice of FGM through education
 in public schools. In September Orthodox and Muslim leaders criticized publicly the
 practice of FGM.
 The Constitution defines the age of consent as 15 for females and 18 for males.
 Nevertheless, early childhood marriage- is common in rural areas, with girls as
 young as age 9 being party to arranged marriages. Especially in the Afar region of
 eastern Ethiopia, young girls continue to be married to much older men, but this
 traditional practice is coming under greater scrutiny and criticism. The maternal
 mortality rate is extremely high, due in part to food taboos for pregnant women,
 poverty, early marriage, and birth complications related to FGM, especially
 infibulation.
 There are thousand of street children living in Addis Ababa. These children beg,
 sometimes. as part of a gang, or work in the informal sector in order to survive (see
 Section 6.d.). Government and privately run orphanages are unable to handle the
 number of street children, and older children often abuse younger children. Due to
 
 
 severe resource and financial constraints, abandoned infants often are overlooked or
 neglected at-hospitals and orphanages. There are credible reports that children are
 occasionally maimed or blinded by their "handlers" in order to raise their earnings
 from begging.
 Child prostitution continues to be a problem. There were many press reports of
 the large-scale employment of children, especially underage girls, as hotel workers,
 barmaids, and prostitutes in resort towns and truckstops south of Addis Ababa. Ac-
 cording to the head of the Labor and Social Affairs Office of East Shoa zone, chil-
 dren are being bought or stolen from the countryside by "child vendors" and sold
 to bar and liquor store owners in Shashemene and Nazareth. The going price for
 a child is reportedly about $36. Young girls are working as dancers, barmaids, and
 prostitutes in the town of Shashemene. There are also credible reports that poor
 rural families sell their young teenage daughtrs to hotel and bar owners on the
 main truck routes. Social workers note that these girls are prized because their cli-
 ents believe that they are free of sexually transmitted diseases. The unwanted ba-
 bies of these young girls usually are abandoned at hospitals, police stations, welfare
 clinics, and adoption agencies. Some families send their unemployed, out-of-school,
 underage daughters to work in Middle Eastern countries as house servants and
 nannies, some of whom are kept in sexual bondage (see also Sections 6.c. and 6.d.).
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution stipulates that the State shall allocate
 resources to provide rehabilitation and assistance to the physically and mentally
 disabled. However, limited government resources restrict action in these areas. The
 Amhara Development Association operates a project to provide vocational training
 to disabled war veterans in Bahir Dar. The Tigray Development Association has es-
 tablished a similar center in Mekele. The Government has not yet put into place
 mechanisms to enforce a 1994 law mandating equal rights' for the disabled. The
 Government does not mandate access to buildings or government services for per-
 sons with disabilities, 'and people with minor disabilities sometimes complain of job
 discrimination. An official at the Government's Rehabilitation Agency estimated
 that, partly as a result of the long civil war, there are more than 5 million disabled
 persons in the population.
 Religious Minorities.-Despite the country's broad level of religious freedom and
 tolerance for established faiths, there have been instances of open conflict among
 the religious groups, most noticeably between Orthodox Christians and Pentecostals.
 Although there were no reported instances of physical conflict among religious
 roups during the year, there continued to be interreligious tension and criticism.
 In most sections of the country, Orthodox Christians and Muslims participate in
 each others religious observances and there is a level of tolerance for intermarriage
 and conversion in certain areas, most notably in Welo. Longstanding Evangelical
 Protestant denominations, particularly the Lutheran Mekane Yesus church, provide
 social services such as health care and education to nonmembers as well as mem-
 bers. However, newer faiths encounter problems. Jehovah's Witnesses and
 Pentecostals sometimes have encountered overt opposition from the public. Early in
 the year Jehovah's Witnesses encountered difficulties in holding meetings and pros-
 elytizing in a handful of communities in the highly Orthodox Christian region of
 Tigray, where local officials arrested some members of Jehovah's Witnesses and
 warned them not to hold prayer sessions. On two occasions in 1997, Orthodox Chris-
 tians disrupted Pentecostal revivals in Debr'e Zeit and Arba Minch, apparently in-
 cited by Orthodox clergy. Orthodox members inflicted injuries and destroyed prop-
 erty before police intervened to restore order. While some Pentecostals have com-
 plained in the past that the police did not do enough to protect them, most observers
 assert that the Government strictly enforces the constitutional right to freedom of
 religion, and that the police strive to maintain impartiality in all interreligious dis-
 putes. Muslims and Orthodox Christians complain about proselytizatibn by
 Pentecostals and Jehovah's Witnesses. Muslims complain that some Pentecostal
 preachers disparage Islam in their sermons.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There are more than 80 ethnic groups. Al-
 though many of these groups have influenced the political and cultural life of the
 country, Amharas and Tigrayans from the northern highlands have played a domi-
 nant role. Some ethnic groups such as the Oromos, the largest single group, were
 subjugated during the 19th century. In an attempt to address ethnic concerns, the
 Government has established a federal system with political boundaries drawn
 roughly along major ethnic lines. With federalism, for example, citizens of the
 Oromiya region now have greater say over their own affairs and resources. Primary
 school students are taught in their local languages, consistent with the Constitution.
 Ethnic conflicts erupted in some remote areas. There were reports of conflict be-
 tween the Nuer and the Anuak in Gambella region. Near the border between the
 Oromo and Southern Peoples' regions, the July 22 murder of a ruling coalition offi-
 
 
 159
 cial touched off interethnic fighting between the Gudji Oromos and the Geddeo in
 villages around Hagare Mariam. According to credible sources, 22 of the 88 kebeles
 (municipalities) in the Hagare Mariam district were damaged badly. Fleeing villag-
 ers were housed temporarily in schools or village halls. In September the Govern-
 ment began repatriating an estimated 160,000 displaced persons to the villages from
 which they had fled, and all had reportedly returned by year's end.
 The military services continued their efforts to recruit ethnic minorities at all lev-
 els. All new recruits are screened as potential officer candidates, and those who
 qualify are offered officer training. Seven of the military's nine generals are non-
 Tigrayans.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Only a small percentage of the population is in-
 volved in wage labor employment, which is largely concentrated in ban areas. Ap-
 proximately 85 percent of the work force live in the countryside and are engaged
 in subsistence farming.
 The Constitution and the Labor Law provide most workers with the right to form
 and join unions and engage in collective bargaining, but oniy about 300,000 workers
 are unionized. In general, employees of the civil and security services (where most
 wage earners are found), judges, and prosecutors are not alowed to form unions.
 Workers who provide an "essential service" are not allowed to strike. Essential serv-
 ices include a large number of categories such as air transport, railways, bus serv-
 ice, police and fire services, post and telecommunications, banks, and pharmacies.
 There is no requirement that unions belong to the Confederation of Ethiopian
 Trade Unions (CETU), which was established in 1993, decertifled in December 1994
 because of internal management and political disputes, and officially reestablished
 and recertified in 1997. CETU includes eight federations organized by industrial
 and service sector rather than by region.
 CETU complained that members of the Government's privatization authority be-
 lieved that labor did not have to be consulted regarding the potential effects on the
 work force caused by parastatal privatization or sales. In April a faction aligned
 with the Government tried to form a new industrial federation of banking andin-
 surance trade unions with new leadership, but it was unable to gather support for
 replacing thepresent federation.
 The Labor Law stipulates that a trade organization may not act in an overtly po-
 litical manner. The Labor Law explicitly gives workers the right to strike to protect
 their interests, but it also sets forth restrictive procedures that apply before a legal
 strike may take place. These apply equally to an employer's right to lock out work-
 ers. Strikes must be supported by a majority of the workers affected. The Labor Law
 prohibits retribution against strikers. Both sides must make efforts at conciliation,
 provide at least 10 days' notice to the Government, include the reasons for the ac-
 tion, and in cases already before a court or labor board, the party must provide at
 least a 30-day warning. If an agreement between unions and management cannot
 be reached, the Minister of Labor may refer th e Cto arbitration by a Labor Rela-
 tions Board (LRB). The Government has established LRB's at the national level and
 in some regions. The Minister of Labor and Social Affairs appoints each LRB chair-
 man, and the four board members include two each from trade unions and employer
 groups. Some efforts to enforce these regulations are made within the formal indus-
 trial sector. There were no strikes during the year.
 Independent unions and those belonging to CETU are e ento affliate with and
 participate in international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected under the Labor Law and under the Constitution, and it is practiced freely
 throughout the country. Collective bargaining agreements concluded between 1975
 and the promulgation of the 1993 Labor Law are covered under the 1975 Labor
 Code and remain in force. Labor experts estimate that more than 90 percent of
 unionized workers are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Wages are nego-
 tiated at the plant level. The law prohibits antinion discrimination by employers
 against union members and organizers. Ther ar e grievance procedures for hearings
 on allegations of discrimination brought by individuals or unions. Employers found
 guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union
 activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution proscribes slav-
 ery, which was officially abolished in 1942, and involuntary servitude. The Criminal
 Code specifically prohibits forced labor, but it can be used by court order as a puni-
 tive measure. The Criminal Code does not apply to children age 15 or younger.
 Forced or compulsory labor by children is illegal. There were no reports of slavery
 
 
 within Ethiopia; however, thousands of young girls were reportedly sold into forced
 prostitution (see Section 5). There also were numerous anecdotal accounts of young
 persons, especially girls, being sent by their families into involuntary servitude in
 the Middle East to work as house servants and nannies, some of whom are kept
 in sexual bondage. There is reportedly a network of sex smugglers based in the tour-
 ism and import-export sectors who are heavily involved in soliciting potential cli-
 ents, recruiting young girls, arranging travel, and fabricating counterfeit work per-
 mits, travel documents, and birth certificates (see Sections 5 and 6.d.).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Under the
 Labor Law, the minimum age for wage or salary employment is 14 years; special
 provisions cover children between the ages of 14 and 18 years, including the prohibi-
 tion of night work or hazardous work. Forced or compulsory labor by children is ille-
 gal. However there are reports that children are sent into involuntary servitude
 abroad, and that children are stolen from the countryside, sold to bar and liquor
 store owners, and forced to work as prostitutes (see Sections 5 and 6.c.). Childen
 may not work more than 7 hours per day; work between the hours of 10 p.m. and
 6 a.m.; work on public holidays or rest days; or perform overtime work. While au-
 thorities make some efforts to enforce these regulations within the formal industrial
 sector, social welfare activists, civic organizers, government officials, and entre-
 preneurs agree that child labor is pervasive throughout the country, especially in
 the informal sector. Large numbers of children of all ages tend animals and work
 in fields outside most government regulatory control in the countryside, or work as
 street peddlers and beggars in the cities. The Government disputes the existence of
 child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage in the private sec-
 tor. However, since 1985 a minimum wage has been set and paid to public sector
 employees, by far the largest group of wage earners. This public sector minimum
 wage is about $25 (175 birr) per month, which is insufficient to provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. According to the Office of the Study of
 Wages and Other Remuneration, a family of five requires a monthly income of $61
 (439 birr).
 The legal workweek, as stipulated in the Labor Law, is 48 hours, consisting of
 6 days of 8 hours each, with a 24-hour rest period. However, in practice, most em-
 ployees work a 40-hour workweek, consisting of 5 days of 8 hours each.
 The Government, industry, and unions negotiate to set occupational health and
 safety standards. However, the Inspection Department of the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs enforces these standards ineffectively, due to a lack of human and fi-
 nancial resources. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous sit-
 uations without jeopardy to continued employment.
