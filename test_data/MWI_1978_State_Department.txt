 MALAWI
 Malawi is a one-party state in which all effective
 political power is held by the Life President, rr. H.
 Kamuzu Banda. Malawi's history since gaining inde-
 pendence in 1964 has been marked by human rights vio-
 lations. These have included prolonged detention
 without charges, exclusion from the political process
 through expulsion from the country's only party, and
 deprivation of employment. In early 1977, however,
 the political atmosphere generally improved, with the
 release of nearly 2,000 people held in detention; only
 an estimated 25-30 are still held. Most if not all of
 the expelled or suspended party members have since
 been reinstated. Treatment by the Government of
 Jehovah's Witnesses is markedly improved, although
 limitations on their activities continue to be imposed.
 Memories of past political repression undoubtedly con-
 tribute to an atmosphere of political intimidation,
 even if current practices are more liberal.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not condoned by the Government, and there is
 no substantiated evidence that it is applied. Although
 earlier reports were probably true that Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses were beaten and some killed in the early 1970s,
 it appears that such incidents have not recurred since
 1975-76 when an understanding was reached between the
 Government and the Jehovah's Witnesses that the latter
 would cease their proselytizing. On the other hand,
 there have been a few reports that Jehovah's Witnesses
 have been beaten in recent years by local villagers who
 resent continued proselytizing by the Jehovah's Witnes-
 ses. In these instances the Jehovah's Witnesses do not
 appear to have recourse to the Government authorities.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 
 (108)
 
 
 Malawi prisons are adequate. Food is poor and only a
 bare minimum is provided; however, a serious attempt is
 made to allow exercise and occasional showers. There
 have been no reports of cruel'or degrading treatment in
 the prisons during the past few years.
 Among the nearly 2,000 detaineees released in 1977, few
 of the former civil servants, teachers and university
 staff have been permitted to return to their jobs. On
 the other hand there .is no evidence the Government pre-
 vents former detainees from obtaining private employ-
 ment.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrests, made possible under the Public
 Security Regulations, have been considerably reduced.
 Exceptions to this involve a few Jehovah's Witnesses
 who are in prison for having abused the understanding
 on proselytizing and one individual linked to the case
 of former Minister of State, Albert Muwalo, who was
 tried for treason and sentenced to death in early 1977.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Individuals arrested and charged with criminal offenses
 are normally dealt with promptly and fairly. Legal
 counsel and a fair public trial are available to all
 criminal and civil defendents. In political cases,
 however, there is no assurance of an open public trial,
 or of a trial of any kind.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home appears to occur far less fre-
 quently now than in former years. In the past several
 months no new cases have come to the attention of the
 Department of State.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 
 
 ,,President Banda's fourteen-year administration has had
 as its basic goal the provision of adequate food,
 clothing and shelter to the Malawians. Malawi is today
 more than self-sufficient in food, and the availability
 of clothing and shelter has increased substantially.
 The Government's education and health policies have
 become increasingly progressive over the past two
 years. Educational facilities at all levels have grown
 impressively. Although health care is still inadequate
 overall, it is more widely available as a result of its
 inclusion in the new nationwide Rural Development
 Program.
 Nevertheless, there are serious economic inequalities
 in Malawi, and high level officials take advantage of
 their public position to enrich themselves, mainly
 through agricultural enterprises. Instances of
 official corruption are not widespread, and breaches of
 the public trust are dealt with promptly.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Censorship is all pervasive and is designed to elimi-
 nate dissent. Individuals arriving in Malawi, includ-
 ing diplomats (except Chiefs of Mission), are subject
 to a thorough baggage search for prohibited or objec-
 tionable publications and other materials. Films and
 books must be cleared by the censors. Malawi radio
 (there is no television) and the press are controlled
 by the Government. Articles and editorials are
 written in accordance with very general guidelines
 established by the Office of the President. While
 there is no legal restriction on speech, no one may
 safely criticize the President, the Party or Government
 policies. Moreover, Malawians are openly encouraged to
 report to party officials any instances of misbehavior,
 presumably including such criticism. Similarly, there
 is no legal restriction on assembly but in fact no
 
 
 group can meet, without risking reprisal, for any rea-
 son that might be construed to be political except
 under the auspices of the Malawi Congress Party, the
 sole political party. Trade union activity is legal,
 but is closely supervised and restricted by govern-
 mental and administrative action.
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution
 and restrictions have been applied only to the
 Jehovah's Witnesses, a group whose difficulties with
 the Government may be viewed more in a political and
 social rather than in a religious context. The
 Jehovah's Witnesses are constrained because of their
 unwillingness to pay taxes and because many Malawians
 reportedly resent their active proselytizing. Al-
 though the Jehovah's Witnesses are technically banned,
 they are officially permitted to remain in their
 villages and to observe their religious practices so
 long as they do not disturb other Malawians with their
 proselytizing. Many of those in detention reportedly
 did not respect this accommodation.
 President Banda has endeavored over the past fourteen
 years to create a unified country out of Malawi's
 numerous tribes and linguistic groups. He appears to
 have instilled a sense of nationality, thereby effect-
 ively eliminating centrifugal tendencies. He has
 sought regional balance in his cabinet and the party
 hierarchy as well as in the development of the-country.
 In 1975 President Banda personally.directed that by
 March 31, 1978, Asians could live only in the cities of
 Blantyre, Lilongwe or Zomba. This decision was taken
 to spur Malawian participation in retail business
 throughout the country, then dominated by Asians.
 President Banda stated that the Asians did not have a
 long-term future in Malawi. Accordingly, many Asians
 have left. However, those remaining in these three
 cities are an important factor in the commercial life
 of the country, and they apparently are not being
 harassed by the Government.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration

 There is no apparent restriction on movement within
 Malawi, especially since most all of those expelled or
 suspended from the Party in the past have been rein-
 stated and are no longer restricted to their villages.
 Foreign travel for civil servants requires clearance
 from the Office of the President. With only a few
 exceptions, those with legitimate reason for travel
 appear able to obtain a passport without difficulty.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Only indigenous Africans may join the Malawi Congress
 Party, and only members of the Party may seek election
 to the Parliament. Moreover, those Party members who
 have been detained, imprisoned or at any time were
 suspended or expelled from the Party may not be candi-
 dates. Malawi held its first Parliamentary election by
 universal suffrage in June 1978. Candidates ran un-
 opposed in about one-third of the constituencies, but
 many of the better-known political figures had to run
 against one or more candidates. Two ministers in the
 previous Government were defeated. In the past,
 President Banda had selected the members of Parliament
 from among the candidates nominated by the respective
 constituencies. In the recent election, the voters
 made the selection; Banda screened the list of candi-
 dates, but according to a reliable report, he did not
 eliminate anyone.
 Women appear to be relatively prominent in party
 activities. A few won Parliamentary seats in the June
 1978 election. There has been one woman cabinet
 minister, and two or three have served as Parliamentary
 secretaries or deputy ministers. Women appear to have
 equal access to all educational institutions, and those
 employed appear to receive the same salaries and wages
 as men in similar positions. Few women hold senior
 positions in either the civil service or the private
 sector, however.
 The labor movement in Malawi is dominated by the Malawi
 Congress Party. Labor disputes are never reported,
 probably because the Ministry of Labor acts to resolve
 them peaceably and promptly.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-government Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Investigation into human rights violations would prob-
 ably not be permitted in Malawi. Over the past year
 numerous foreign journalists have been permitted into
 Malawi. Most if not all who have sought to enter ap-
 pear to have been granted visas. None apparently
 sought to investigate human rights violations although
 their reporting mentioned the mass detentions of the
 past and the fact that most detainees had been re-
 leased.
