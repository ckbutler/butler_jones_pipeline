 EGYPT
 Egypt is a republic with a strong presidency and a
 recently established multiparty political structure.
 The existing system concentrates power in the hands
 of the president. President Sadat's liberalization
 policies in the political, economic and social spheres
 of life were largely maintained in 1980, but applica-
 tion of these reforms in the political sphere was uneven.
 Martial law, in force since 1967, was rescinded in May
 (although a state of emergency was reimposed in the
 western desert region as a result of tensions on the
 Libyan border). In the wake of several serious clashes
 between Copts and campus-based Islamic fundamentalists,
 the government took action to protect the Coptic minority
 and required the registration of university Islamic so-
 cieties. In the economic sphere, despite the uneven
 application of heavy subsidies of basic food commodities,
 the poorest people have been insulated to a degree from
 inflation as the government has endeavored to guarantee
 affordable basic goods and services.
 The People's Assembly adopted a controversial Ethics
 Law (Qanun al-Ayb), which gives the Socialist Prosecu-
 tor broad powers to defend "social values." The Assembly
 also passed laws which placed political parties and the
 press under the control of the new "Shura" or consulta-
 tive council. The Shura acts as an advisory board to
 the People's Assembly and the Executive, but does not
 have a legislative function. Elections to this council
 were dominated by President Sadat's National Democratic
 Party; opponents of the regime accused the government
 of unfair electoral practices in some districts.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is forbidden by Article 42 of the Egyptian on-
 stitution and by law. Citizens who allege that they
 have been tortured have the right to redress in the
 courts; information gained through torture or mistreat-
 ment cannot be used against the individual. In the
 single allegation of torture known to have been made
 in 1980, the court ordered an investigation based on
 the prisoner's physical appearance. He recently was
 released from custody. It appears that his release re-
 sulted from insufficient evidence rather than from
 alleged maltreatment by the police.
 
 
 964
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment.
 The Egyptian constitution and laws prohibit these
 forms of punishment, and no allegations to that
 effect have been reported in 1980.
 c. Disappearances
 There were no known cases of secret arrests or
 clandestine detention by officials or quasi-
 official security forces in 1980.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are forbidden by
 law. Arrests are made after lengthy investigations,
 and arrested persons are charged with violations of
 specific laws. Preventive detention is not prac-
 ticed in Egypt. Arrested persons enjoy the right
 of habeas corpus.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Egyptian law guarantees due process,public trial and
 equal treatment before the law. Persons accused of
 espionage or violations of military security, how-
 ever, are tried by military courts in trials usually
 closed to the public. In 1980, the Ethics Law
 created state security courts, which have been
 charged with the protection of "national unity" and
 given jurisdiction over crimes associated with the
 supply of goods and pricing irregularities. The
 Ethics Law also established "Courts of Values" under
 the jurisdiction of the Socialist Prosecutor to try
 persons accused of crimes against "social values.-
 The Courts of Values (seven members) and the Supreme
 Court of Values (nine members) draw a majority of
 their members from a pool of judges assigned to the
 various civil and criminal courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom against arbitrary invasion of the home is
 guaranteed by the Egyptian constitution (Article 44).
 Police must obtain a warrant for arrest, search or
 seizure from the Attorney General before taking
 action. The warrant, however, need not specify the
 charges against the individual nor list the specific
 material being sought during the search. The police
 can seize such material during the search and pre-
 sent it as evidence during the trial. The courts
 have at times dismissed cases when they consider
 warrants to have been issued without sufficient
 evidence. Government officials who violate this
 law are also subject to criminal penalties.

 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfill-
 ment of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter,
 Health Care and Education
 In May, President Sadat reiterated that the primary
 task of the government is to deal with the concerns
 of Egypt's poorer classes who have felt the pinch
 of inflation increasingly in recent years. Since
 1952, the government has made an effort to spread
 the benefits of economic growth evenly through
 guaranteed employment programs and such market in-
 tervention mechanisms as food subsidies (which total
 more than $2 billion in the current fiscal year, or
 about 20 percent of national income) and price con-
 trols. The government recently took initiatives to
 deal with Egypt's housing problems. Population
 growth, estimated at nearly 3.0 percent annually,
 has strained the capacity of Egypt's construction
 sector to keep pace with demand, especially for low-
 cost housing. Education and health services are free
 and available to the majority of Egyptians.
 Basic commodities, especially foodstuffs, are dis-
 tributed at affordable prices to Egyptian urban and
 rural consumers, and Egypt ranks high in per capita
 caloric intake among developing nations. Egypt's
 per capita income remains low ($400 in 1979), but it
 is rising steadily. Income in Egypt is more evenly
 distributed than in many developing countries and
 strict laws limiting the size of land holdings attempt
 to guarantee that both income and production opportu-
 nities are equitable in rural areas.
 Despite the government's leading role in the economy,
 efforts to liberalize the economy and encourage the
 growth of the private sector have been maintained.
 Egypt's economy has experienced sustained real growth
 of approximately 8 percent per year in the last five
 years. A large percentage of the increased revenues
 flowing to the government in the last few years is
 being spent on programs to help the poor. An in-
 creased effort in 1980 was a response to widespread
 concerns that inflation had seriously eroded the pur-
 chasing power of the average Egyptian and that the
 benefits of recent economic growth were not reaching
 the poorer people. While some private entrepreneurs
 may have benefitted disproportionately from the pri-
 vate sector's greater role in economic development,
 the government has taken steps to ensure that the
 poor are insulated from inflation and that basic com-
 modities and services are available at affordable
 prices. As a result, needed fiscal and budgetary
 reforms to attack the roots of inflation have been
 pursued only reluctantly.
 
 
 966
 Extra-legal payments for services, both in the private and
 public sectors, are a fact of life in Egypt. Usually petty,
 they can sometimes be substantial. This pervasive practice
 has a debilitating effect on the economy, although it is often
 condoned as being necessary for many Egyptians to maintain
 minimal standards of living. The government has sought to
 curb the practice. Bribery charges have been filed against
 a number of former government officials, and the government
 has made it clear that it will prosecute all cases which it
 considers merit such action.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion   and
 Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of speech (Article 47),
 press (Articles 47 and 48), religion (Article 46), and
 assembly (Article 54). Although the government does not
 directly control the print media (as it does radio and
 television), it exercises major influence on the press. The
 government appoints and can dismiss all editors of government-
 owned publications, which include all the daily newspapers.
 Under provisions of a new press law, the "Shura" or consulta-
 tive council has responsibilities for supervision of the
 press through its ownership of 51 percent-of all non-party
 newspapers and magazines and majority representation in
 institutional assemblies.
 Constraints on editorial freedom are more often self-imposed
 by journalists than by the result of outright censorship.
 All journals, whether partisan or publicly owned, are
 expected to consider the "national interest" in choosing
 what to publish. Nevertheless, in 1980, opposition journals
 on both the left and right have published increasingly strong
 criticism of government policy. The Socialist Labor Party's
 Al Shaab, however, was obliged to cease publication temporarily
 last -spring because of alleged problems of newsprint avail-
 ability and price. A 1978 law remains in force granting the
 government authority to ban publication of newspapers and
 magazines that it deems violate the national interest.
 The government has criticized Egyptian journalists who publish
 anti-regime articles in foreign newspapers. Such critics
 who return to Egypt may face prosecution under the recently
 enacted Ethics Law.
 According to the constitution, Egypt is an Islamic
 state which guarantees freedom of religious expres-
 sion. In May, President Sadat declared that he con-
 siders himself the Muslim leader of an Islamic state
 
 
 967
 in which freedcus of other religions are protected.
 The Ethics Law contains a provision, directed at
 communists and atheists, declaring it a crime to
 advocate ideologies conflicting with religion.
 This provision of the law has not yet been tested
 in the courts.
 Intercommunal disturbances erupted this year be-
 tween Coptic Christians and campus-based Islamic
 fundamentalists, mainly in upper Egypt. Following
 these clashes, President Sadat accused the Coptic
 leadership of activities incompatible with clerical
 status. President Sadat coupled this criticism of
 the Coptic leadership with a strong denunciation of
 sectarianism, pledging that the government would not
 tolerate communal strife, and the government has re-
 quired Islamic societies to register with the Ministry
 of Social Affairs. Although instances of discrimina-
 tion against Copts exist and intercommunal incidents
 occur from time to time, there is no evidence of of-
 ficially inspired or sanctioned acts of discrimina-
 tion against the Copts or other religious minorities.
 The large Coptic minority continues to participate
 fully in the life of the country.
 With the abolition of martial law, limitations on
 the right of assembly have been lifted.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Egypt is guaranteed except
 for travel in well-defined military districts. Except
 for limitations affecting male Egyptians who have not
 completed their military service, freedom of travel
 and emigration are guaranteed. Normalization agree-
 ments defined procedures for travel between Egypt and
 Israel. Egypt has a liberal policy on political
 asylum. The extradition of political refugees is pro-
 hibited by law.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Political organizations and parties are permitted,
 except those-based on religious or class lines.
 (This restriction prohibits communist and Islamic
 societies from organizing as legal political par-
 ties.) The People's Assembly has 392 members, of
 whom 352 are elected. Ten are appointed by the
 President, and 30 elected seats are reserved for
 women.   President Sadat's National Democratic
 Party (NPD) controls the People's Assembly, with
 over 300 seats. The new Shura has 210 members,
 140 elected under a system in which the majority
 party takes all elected seats. As a result, the
 NPD also controls the Shura.
 
 
 968
 Adoption of the electoral list system for the council
 was a point of controversy in Egypt this year and led
 to a boycott of the election by two of the three oppo-
 sition parties. Despite the abolition of martial law
 in May, the government, in response to concerns about
 opposition activities (particularly on the part of the
 left), pressed for enactment of the Ethics Law and
 establishment of new state security courts. Perceived
 threats from communists and leftists also led to a num-
 ber of arrests: 30 alleged communists were arrested in
 April and 49 in October for conspiring against the re-
 gime. These cases are now in the courts. In October,
 at defense request, the Supreme State Security Court
 postponed consideration of cases against those arrested
 in April and allowed two defendants to travel abroad.
 Despite restrictions and periodic arrests, opposition
 activity continued throughout the year. In February,
 June and July, an opposition coalition called the
 "National Front" issued public statements attacking
 the government's foreign and domestic policies. The
 bar association and the opposition parties also mobi-
 lized against the early drafts of the new Ethics Law,
 criticizing the draft bill for infringing on human
 rights. These criticisms forced the government to re-
 vise the bill substantially before submitting it to
 the People's Assembly.
 Women enjoy relatively high status in Egypt. They vote,
 may volunteer for non-combat duty in the armed forces,
 engage in economic activities outside the home, and
 exercise other rights of citizenship. Women are well-
 represented in medicine, law and education. All recent
 cabinets have included one woman and most ministries
 have at least one woman at the undersecretary level.
 President Sadat has continued to support implementa-
 tion of a 1979 decree revising the personal status law
 for the Muslim community to give women important rights
 in the areas of child custody, divorce and child support.
 Practical effects of this decree have yet to be deter-
 mined by actual court decisions. Despite these advances,
 women still suffer some discrimination, particularly in
 rural areas and within more traditional communities.
 The organized trade union movement has about 2.5-3 mil-
 lion members. Independence and freedom of action of
 labor unions have increased modestly in recent years.
 Several trade unions have taken the initiative to
 broaden their international labor links by affiliating
 with the International Trade Secretariats. Most in-
 dustry in Egypt is partially government-owned. Conse-
 quently, trade union influence in the government has
 helped union leaders in negotiating with these indus-
 tries and with regard to labor and economic legislation
 
 
 969
 in the People's Assembly. The government has some
 influence in identifying candidates for positions
 of leadership in the labor movement. Final selec-
 tion among such candidates is determined by elec-
 tion. Workers do not enjoy the right to strike.
 Occasional wildcat strikes have occurred in recent
 years, however.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-government Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The government permits visits by international groups
 wishing to investigate human rights concerns in Egypt.
 Official and non-official delegations participate in
 international meetings on human rights. There are
 several Egyptian human rights groups, but their
 focus is directed at human rights problems outside
 Egypt. As indicated in their 1980 report, represen-
 tatives of Amnesty International monitor human rights
 concerns in Egypt, and Amnesty International observers
 attended part of a trial before the Supreme State
 Security Court in November 1979.
