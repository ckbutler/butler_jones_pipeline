 MALI
 Mali's governing Military Committee of National Liberation
 (CMLN) has pledged a return to civilian government in
 1979. This plan, now in the process of implementation,
 calls for the entry into full force in mid-1979 of the
 Constitution approved in 1974 and for the development
 of a new comprehensive, (i.e., single) political party
 based on participatory meetings under the auspices of
 the (CMLN) in all parts of the country. The Constitution
 accepts the definition of human rights in the Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights, but current law gives the
 military government the authority to override these
 rights in the national interest.
 A schism in the CMLN led to an attempted military coup
 in February 1978 which was foiled by President Traore.
 Four members of the CMLN and 37 military and security
 officers were arrested and charged with conspiring to
 frustrate the return to civilian rule and to set up a
 "fascist dictatorship". In October 1978, the alleged
 plotters were tried before an eleven-man special court
 of state security. According to reports, the trial
 sessions which extended over three days were public and
 fair. Two defendants received death sentences; 25
 other defendants were convicted on lesser charges and
 fourteen were acquitted.
 President Traore and the CMLN have demonstrated a
 genuine commitment to their stated goal of greater
 respect for human rights. The Government continues to
 support a policy of national reconciliation, and
 developments in the political field during the past
 year suggest that considerable progress has been made
 in that area. For example, shortly before the coup
 attempt, the CMLN had released all political prisoners
 being held in Mali. This action along with recent
 public trials of the conspirators appears to indicate
 the Malian Government's intention to re-establish the
 democratic process in that country. While violations
 of human rights occur, they are exceptions to the rule
 (114)

 rather than pervasive or systematic.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There are no reports of the use of torture and there
 are Constitutional guarantees against its practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are no reports of such treatment in Mali, nor are
 there any reports of deprivation of life. The Malian
 Constitution guarantees the integrity of the person.
 There are persistent but unsubstantiated reports of
 political prisoners working alongside convicted felons
 under harsh conditions in a salt mine.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are uncommon, but
 they do occur on occasion in connection with "political
 offenses."
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees this right, and it is
 usually observed in practice. The recent public trial
 of the coup plotters appears to indicate the CMLN's
 intention to uphold this guarantee.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There is some evidence of infrequent house-to-house
 searches, usually in the context of some specific
 -political incident.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 
 
 116
 Mali's GQvernment is committed to the goal of economic
 development and a better quality of life, and its
 policies are focused on responding to the needs of the
 poor. According to UN estimates, Mali ranks among the
 three or four poorest nations of the world. Mali has
 an estimated population of 5.9 million and an estimated
 per capita income of $90. Economic development
 programs are aimed at improving the living conditions
 of the country's overwhelmingly rural agricultural and
 nomadic population, but increased concern over the
 problems of the urban population and the social
 problems created by the drought has recently been
 reflected in governmental statements. Concentration of
 wealth is not pronounced in Mali. However, the dis-
 locations that attended the drought deepened the
 poverty of the nomads and subsistence cultivators in
 the north of the country and allowed some in Bamako to
 enrich themselves.
 During the 1970-73, drought instances of corruption
 involving diversion of commodities and misappropriation
 of funds were noted by almost all foreign aid donors.
 President Traore has sought by repeated warnings and
 periodic disciplining of wayward government officials
 to control the problem. One byproduct of the aborted
 February coup was the removal from high office of some
 officials well-known for their avarice and exploitation.
 Corruption on a smaller scale still exists, however,
 and impedes the proper allocation of national resources
 and utilization of assistance from abroad.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Only the ruling Military Committee may permit organized
 political activity. In private, Malians freely criticize
 their Government and society. However, the Government
 controls all public expressions of opinion and allows
 no challenge or criticism of its authority. Nonetheless,
 President Traore has coopted some youth groups and
 labor organizations to aid in identifying the political
 
 
 117
 and administrative institutions which Mali will need
 when it returns to civilian rule.
 Malians are free to assemble for religious, social
 and professional purposes. Missionaries report that
 religious freedom is more widespread than at any other
 time in Malian history. The new Malian Constitution,
 scheduled to come into full force in 1979, would enable
 election by universal suffrage of a president and
 national assembly. Efforts are being made to give the
 nascent political party, the Democratic Union of the
 Malian People, a broad, popular base. Evidence
 to date suggests that the Government is determined to
 ensure that promised popular participation in the
 formation of local constituent units of the new political
 party is carried out. To this end, the CMLN is expected
 to elicit the support of Mali's powerful trade unions,
 particularly the National Union of Malian Workers, the
 country's largest labor organization. Mali's unions
 have a heritage of democratic activism and can be
 expected to play an important role in the re-establish-
 ment of the democratic process in Mali. This, too,
 holds true for Mali's influential women's organization,
 the National.Union of Malian Women, which works closely
 with the CMLN. This organization is also expected to
 play a crucial part in the democratic process when Mali
 returns to civilian rule.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement within Mali is generally unrestricted
 although travelers between cities are subject to
 frequent police checks which are allowed by law. The
 present military government added to its popularity by
 removing most barriers to foreign and internal travel
 introduced by the predecessor Modibo Keita regime.
 There are no barriers to emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Constitution would guarantee various freedoms and
 rights as well as equality under the law for all
 citizens. It is difficult to judge how effectively
 these constitutional safeguards will be applied. The
 
 
 118
 deliberate pace of progress toward return to civilian
 rule is generally thought to reflect some ambiguity
 within the Military Committee over the extent of reform
 desirable. Elements opposed to restoration of civilian
 rule apparently participated in the unsuccessful
 coup attempt against President Traore in February 1978.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no independent, outside investigations
 of alleged human rights violations in Mali, nor have
 any requests for such investigation been made, to the
 knowledge of the Department of State. Amnesty Inter-
 national in 1977 called attention to the continued
 detention of several officials of the Keita Regime,
 ousted in 1968. In January 1978, these officers were
 released from prison by the CMLN.
