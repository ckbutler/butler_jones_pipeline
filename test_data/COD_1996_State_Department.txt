 ZAIRE
 After 31 years of authoritarian rule, President Mobutu Sese Seko is generally con-
 sidered to remain in control of the Government, although his poor health and pro-
 longed absence from the country signaled a significant decline in his authority. A
 Sovereign National Conference (CNS) in 1992 formulated a new constitution and en-
 acted legislation establishing a transitional government, directly challenging
 Mobutu.
 Following a turbulent contest for political leadership in the ensuing 2 years be-
 tween the governments of Etienne Tshisekedi and Faustin Birindwa, Mobutu allies
 and opposition leaders in 1994 passed a Transitional Act, creating a transition con-
 stitution and a Combined Transitional Parliament, the High Council of the Repub-
 lic-Transitional Parliament (HCR-PT). In 1994 the HCR-PT elected Leon Kengo Wa
 Dondo as Prime Minister. A lawsuit contesting the legality of the election was set
 aside in September, but continuing political challenges and the protracted transition
 have left the Kengo Government with little effective authority. In 1995 the HCR-
 PT extended the transition period and scheduled new elections for mid-1997.
 The HCR-Pr officially installed a National Election Commission (NEC) in April,
 which established an electoral calendar providing for a constitutional referendum
 and national elections in 1997. The HCR-PT approved the draft constitution in Oc-
 tober for approval by popular referendum.
 President Mobutu's authority rests on his control of key security forces, which in-
 clude the Civil Guard, a police force with paramilitary and antiterrorist capabilities,
 and the 7,000-member Special Presidential Division (DSP). Both remain under the
 command of Mobutu loyalist generals. There exist, in addition, the regular armed
 forces and a gendarmerie. The security forces suffer from major discipline problems
 due to irregular pay and a lack of trained commissioned and noncommissioned offi-
 cers. Members of all the security forces committed numerous and serious human
 rights abuses.
 Most sectors of the economy have been contracting since the late 1970's, and in
 the 1990's the decline accelerated. Production and incomes have fallen steadily, as
 the modern sector has virtually collapsed. Physical infrastructure has suffered seri-
 ous damage, financial institutions have collapsed, and human capital has signifi-
 cantly eroded. Annual per capita national income is estimated at $115. Subsistence
 activities, a growing informal sector, corruption, and widespread barter characterize
 much of the economy. The insolvent public sector cannot provide even basic public
 services, and foreign economic assistance is limited, pending the 1997 elections.
 Amid a general atmosphere of economic and personal insecurity, the Government
 continued to tolerate and commit serious human rights abuses. Security forces con-
 tinued to commit numerous human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings,
 torture, looting, and arbitrary detention. In general, the authorities did not punish
 the perpetrators, and the problem of impunity remained.
 Most prison conditions remain life threatening. Large scale military pillaging
 largely stopped in 8 of the 11 regions when the Government met most military pay-
 rolls. Extensive pillaging occurred, however, in North and South Kivu and Haut
 Zaire as the Zairian Armed Forces (FAZ) fled advancing rebels.
 Citizens were not able to vote to change their government in multiparty elections.
 Prolonged pretrial and extrajudicial detention is a problem. The judicial system was
 not independent and was plagued by corruption, lack of due process, lack of re-
 sources, and many other problems. It remained largely ineffective as a deterrent or
 corrective force to human rights abuses. Security forces continued to violate citizens'
 rights to privacy. Although freedom of expression continued to increase, and was
 particularly evident in the proliferation of independent newspapers, authorities
 sought to limit freedom of speech and the press. Military and civilian security forces
 detained or arrested journalists, editors, and newspaper vendors. The authorities
 permitted some political demonstrations to proceed unhindered, but at other times
 the police or Civil Guard intervened, using intimidation, violence and arrests. The
 Government and security forces restricted freedom of movement. Discrimination
 against women, ethnic minorities, and Pygmies occurred. Violence against women
 is seldom punished.
 Severe, lethal ethnic conflict in eastern Zaire resulted in many deaths. The contin-
 ued refugee presence resulting from the 1994 influx from Rwanda exacerbated exist-
 ing tensions and contributed to a revolt by Banyamulenge ethnic Tutsis and other
 groups, which many observers conclude was supported by Rwanda and Uganda.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Security forces, including police, are
 alleged to have committed over 100 killings during the year although precise esti-
 mates are unavailable. Given the administrative and security breakdown through-
 out the country and the often anecdotal nature of the accounts of these killings, it
 was often difficult to determine whether these killings were committed for political,
 monetary, personal or law enforcement reasons. The Zairian Association for the De-
 fense of Human Rights (AZADHO), a respectd human rights group based in
 Kinshasa, reported 102 cases of extrajudicl killing fr te year. Reports often
 linked security forces to killings and random acts of robbery or extortion. For exam-
 ple, the local press in Kinshasa in August reported that a soldier shot and killed
 a merchant in the central market because she refused to pay for protection; the sol-
 dier was not arrested or charged with a crime. Only rarely have there been reports
 that civil or military authorities made inquiries into such incidents. In the east,
 interethnic conflicts led to many deaths (see Section 1.g.)..
 Persons incarcerated in the country's prisons are reportedy beaten by prison offi-
 cials, while other prisoners die of illness or starvation (see Section 1.c.).
 In July 1995, m a particularly egregious example of extrajudicial killing, civil
 guards used lethal force to put down an unauthorized demonstration in Kinshasa
 y the Unified Lumumbist Party (PALU), led by Antoine Gizenga. Human rights
 monitors stated that there were 14 deaths, including a soldier, 54 others were seri-
 ously wounded. The Government claimed, however, that there were four deathsplus
 one soldier killed by the protesters. Gizenga was detained for several days and re-
 leased on bail. He reportedly was charged with organizing an unauthorized dem-
 onstration and possessing an M-16 assault rifle which authorities claimed was
 found in his house. Military forces attacked Gizenga's home and raped and killed
 a member of his family immediately after the 1995 incident. The military services
 launched official inquiries into the incident in August 1995 but failed to make public
 any results. The charges were dropped on February 29.
 In several cases, notably in the interior, citizens responded to military aggression
 in kind, sometimes killing soldiers. On February 15, for example, Goma residents
 killed a soldier whom they believed had earlier murdered a civilian. In Kinshasa
 in July, a group of citizens destroyed a courthouse after a gendarme working there
 shot and killed a taxi driver for refusing him free transportation. There are no re-
 ports that the gendarme was ever tried or sentenced for the crime. There were
 extrajudicial killings of Zairian officials by Banyamulenge rebels and their allies in
 the Kivus in November (see Section 1.g.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were several reported cases of disappearances, although
 the number appears to be down from previous years. As in the past, some of these
 disappearances may have been criminal, rather than political, in nature. Security
 forces regularly hold alleged suspects in secret detention for varying periods of time
 before acknowledging that they are actually in custody. The most frequent accounts
 describe unidentified assailants who abduct, threaten, and often beat their victims
 before releasing them. Journalists and opposition party members claim that they
 are targets for such actions. Patrick Shotsha On'oto, a youth leader who had been
 periodically harassed by uniformed personnel since participating in the 1992 Chris-
 tian Students' March, disappeared m April 1995 after giving a lecture on the role
 young people should play in elections. His whereabouts remain unknown. In
 Kisangani a human rights nongovernmental organization (NGO), Friends of Nelson
 Mandela, reported the disappearance of Damadu Mbula, exact date unknown.
 Mbula has not been located. Mbula Kwete, a journalist based in Kinshasa, dis-
 appeared in September. According to a local newspaper, Kwete had been sought by
 the authorities for some time due to his political beliefs.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law forbids torture, security forces and prison officials routinely dis-
 regard this prohibition, often beating prisoners in the process of arresting or interro-
 gating them. In March in Bunia, in the region of Haut Zaire, according to the Na-
 tional League for Free and Fair Elections (LINELIT), a local NGO, two members
 of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) were arrested and tortured
 by members of the Civil Guard because of their political activities. AZADHO re-
 ported in August that two members of the government tax collectors' union were ar-
 rested and tortured for requesting an audit of the Director General of Taxation.
 AZADHO reported torture marks on the bodies of the two unionists. An American
 citizen was arrested in May and again in August. Akerele's mother, a Zairian, is
 a declared candidate for President. On beth occasions, police beat Akerele; the sec-
 ond time police shaved his head and inscribed the letters "p.m." He was never
 
 
 309
 charged with any crime. Several other released prisoners claim to have been struck,
 kicked, whipped, and suspended upside down for long periods of time. The authori-
 ties, including the judiciary, rarely investigate claims of torture, despite their preva-
 lence. Members of all the security forces routinely prey on civilians, generally with-
 out official rebuke. They continued to commit many criminal infractions, including
 robbery, extortion, and looting.
 Conditions in most of the 220 known prisons and places of detention remain life
 threatening. There are no precise numbers of prisoners; however, AZADHO reports
 that there are 1,067 prisoners in the Makala and Ndolo prisons in Kinshasa. The
 Government does not acknowledge any responsibility to furnish prisoners food or
 medical supplies. Prison facilities are grossly inadequate; living conditions are harsh
 and unsanita, and prisoners are poorly treated. The system has severe shortages
 of funds, medical facilities, food, and trained personnel. Overcrowding and corrup-
 tion are widespread. Reports of prisoners being tortured, beaten to death, deprived
 of food and water, or dying of starvation are common. Prisoners are wholly depend-
 ent on personal resources of family or friends for their survival. Inmates at Makala
 Centra Prison in Kinshasa sleep on the floor without bedding and have no access
 to sanitation, potable water, or adequate health care. Even in Makala's best-
 equipped ward, over 100 white collar criminals share one latrine. Tuberculosis, red
 diarrhea, and other infectious diseases are rampant. Although authorities have not
 targeted women for abuse, rapes occur. Of the 50 women in Makala Prison in Au-
 gust 5 were accompanied by children under the age of 5 years. Political prisoners
 are held in a separate ward and are allowed little, if any, direct contact with visi-
 tors. On December 27, 1995, the Minister of Justice issued an order prohibiting the
 use of 25 of the 73 detention centers in the region of Kinshasa following a Judicial
 Commission's report that these     facilities were  in  "an  advanced  state  of
 unhealthiness incompatible with human dignity." Makala Central Prison was not
 listed among the 25 prisons prohibited from use. In August, 20 of these prisons were
 reportedly still being used.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), religious organizations,
 and local human rights organizations report that they have regular access to prisons
 nationwide. In some cases, however, the unpublicized creation of unofficial detention
 sites by the civil and military authorities circumvents their access to all prisoners
 and detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite legal provisions governing arrest
 and detention procedures, the security forces were responsible for numerous cases
 of arbitrary arrest and detention.
 Under the law, serious offenses (those punishable by more than 6 months' impris-
 onment) do not require a warrant for a suspect's arrest. Only a law enforcement offi-
 cer with "judicial police officer" status is empowered to authorize arrest. This status
 is also vested in senior officers of the security services. The law instructs security
 forces to bring detainees to the police within 24 hours. The law also provides that
 detainees must be charged within 24 hours and be brought within 48 hours before
 a magistrate, who may authorize provisional detention for varying renewable peri-
 ods.
 In practice, these provisions are rarely followed. Gendarmes and civil guards com-
 monly detain civilians without any legal authority. The security forces-especially
 those carrying out the orders of any official who can claim authority-use arbitrary
 arrest to intimidate outspoken opponents and journalists. Charges are rarely filed,
 and the political motivation for such detentions are often obscure. When the au-
 thorities do press charges, the claims that they file are sometimes contrived or reci-
 tations of archaic colonial regulations.
 Estimates of political detainees are unreliable due to detention in clandestine lo-
 cations and military facilities. The practice of detaining people for their political
 views declined from past years.
 Political detainees are typically held incommunicado, sometimes in unofficial de-
 tention sites, with irregular or no access to legal counsel. Newspaper journalist
 Sumalii Kilue, arrested and released in February by the military forces, was never
 charged with a crime.
 On Ma 3, the authorities in North Kivu released Malira Kabuya, Byamungu
 Kahima, Ndasimwa Malira, and Bonane (Hunde ethnic group). They were never
 charged, and there was no action on the part of the authorities to investigate their
 severe mistreatment by the police.
 Authorities detained five individuals on different occasions in incidents related to
 the outbreak of hostility in the Kivus. Political opposition members Willy Mishiki
 and Joseph Olenga Nkoy were detained for, respectively, inciting student dem-
 onstrations and for criticizing the Government's handling of the Kivu crisis. Both
 were released on December 13.
 
 
 310
 Three members of the local NGO La Voix des Sans Voix, including the organza-
 tion' president Floribert Cheyeba, were detained for having inquired about te web-
 fare of prisners of war; authorities released the three on November 2.
 Corrupt local officials routinely use detention as a means of extortion, arresting
 people on fabricated charges, releasing them only after payment of a "fee.
 Of the 1,067 detainees accounted for in Makala and Ndolo Prisons in August,
 more than 75 percent had yet to come before a judge, although many had spent as
 long as 2 years in prison.
 The Transitional Act specifically forbids exile, and there were no known cases.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Despite prvisions for independence in the Transi-
 tional Act, the judiciary is not independent of the executive branch, and the latter
 can and does manipulate it.
 Civil and criminal codes are based on Belgian and customary law. The legal sys-
 tem includes lower courts, appellate courts, the Supreme Court, and the Court of
 State Security. There is a separate system of military tribunals with an appeals
 structure that parallels that of civilian courts. Decisions from the military tribuinals
 may be appealed to the Supreme Court. Charges of misconduct against senior gov-
 ernment officials must be filed directly with the Supreme Court. .
 The Transitional Act provides for the right to a speedy public trial, the presump-
 tion of innocence, and lega counsel at all stages of proceedings. Defendants have
 the right to appeal in all cases except those involving national security, armed rob-
 bery, and smuggling, all of which are adjudicated by the court of state security. The
 law provides for court-appointed counsel at state expense in capital cases, in all pro-
 ceeding before the Supreme Court, and in ot     he   n requested by the court.
 In practice, the authorities ignore these protections.
 Aderence to established legal procedures varies considerably, and fair public trial
 is rare. Corruption is pervasive, particularly among magistrates, who are verypoor-
 ly and intermittently paid and are poorly trained. The judicial system is  rther
 hobbled by major shortages of personnel, supplies, and infrastructure. Defendants
 never meet their counsel or do so only after months of detention and interrogation.
 Cases are heard only when the defendant or plaintiffs pay all court costs, including
 salaries, a situation that routinely results in corruption.
 Judicial officials assigned to remote areas in the country in some cases either re-
 fused to assume their pests or  from them in ethnic purification campaigns, par-
 ticularly in Maniema and Shaba. As a result, local authorities usurped judicial pro-
 ceeding in some p arts of the country.
 Thee are eno reliable statistics on the number of political prisoners, but the trend
 of incarcerating people for their political views was down from past years. There
 were no reported cases of individuals formally accused, tried, and imprisoned for po-
 litical beliefs.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Secu-
 rity forces routinely ignore the Transitional Act provisions for the inviolability of the
 home and of private correspondence. They inore the requirement for a search war-
 rant, entering and searching homes at will. In January, for example, four civil
 guards entered the home of Denis Wathum without a warrant, detained him at a
 military precinct, and asked for money. He was later released.
 The threat of rape, sometimes perpetrated by uniformed persons, restricts the
 freedom of movement at night for women in many neighborhoods. Groups of citizens
 have implemented neighborhood watch programs, but women in many parts of
 Kinshasa do not leave their homes at night.
 Elements of the DSP and Civil Guardhave reportedly been used to intimidate pri-
 vate businesses for the commercial gain of individuals. For example, the DSPin
 1995 intervened in a private commercial dispute between a foreign-owned company
 and a local competitor owned by one of Mobutu's closest associates, and in Septem-
 her a house owned by the central bank was seized. Members of the armed forces
 are employed as security guards and enforcers. The Kengo Government strongly
 supports the contractual rights of foreign investors and has sought, albeit unsuc-
 cessfully in most cases, to curtail arbitrary interference by elements of the military
 forces. Uniformed personnel routinely interfere with daily business activities, espe-
 cially those of the informal economy. Currency vendors are particularly at risk and
 remain subject to repeated robberies by uniformed assailants. In February and in
 November soldiers robbed several currency vendors in downtown Kinshasa's Wall
 Street district. They were never charged or brought to trial.
 Citizens are free to join or refrain from participating in an political party. How-
 ever, opposition party members complain that they are followed or harassed by
 troops loyal to the President. In July Christian Badibangi, a member of the radical
 opposition, was shot and wounded by unknown persons in his home. No one has
 been charged. Citizens widely assume that the Government monitors mail and tele-
 
 
 311
 phone communications. The Government does not restrict access to foreign publica-
 tions.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The July 1994 influx and protracted presence of refugees and former Rwan-
 dan soldiers aggravated longstanding conflicts between Zairian groups, and violent
 ethnic clashes, described as ethnic cleansing, took place in North Kivu in several
 subregions north of Coma in February. Also, ambiguities in Banyarwanda (peoples
 of Rwandan origin) legal status, caused by conflicting laws that bestow and then re-
 yoke citizenship, further inflamed tensions, especially with the prospect of
 multiparty elections. In the Masisi region of North Kivu almost all ethnic Tutsi citi-
 zens were forced out of the country due to fear of ethnic violence and are now refu-
 gees in Rwanda. Hutus were the dominant ethnic group in the Masisi region until
 October. These violent ethnic clashes in eastern Zaire included widespread human
 rights abuses, despite the deployment of additional Zairian troops to the region in
 February and March. These tribal conflicts encouraged ethnic groups in the region
 to engage in violent attacks against other tribes. Violence, or the threat of violence
 was carried out by Hutu, Hunde, Nande, and other Zairian ethnic groups, some of
 which formed bands of youth to terrorize the ethnic minority Tutsi. From February
 to October, more than 1,000 people were reported killed in the Masisi region as a
 result of fighting between the Banyarwanda and indigenous ethnic groups.
 In October a rebellion nominally led by the ethnic Tutsis in South Kivu resulted
 in open warfare and the expulsion of Hutu refugees from the immediate area of the
 refugee camps in North and South Kivu, and loss of life of all sides (see Section
 2.4.). The rebellion expanded in November and December, and many observers con-
 cluded that the rebellion was supported by Rwanda and Uganda. Rebels have been
 accused of massacring segments of the refugee population, of summarily executing
 business people who did not comply with rebel directives, and of killing  oltical
 leaders closely associated with the Government. Tutsi led rebels reportedly mas-
 sacred 500 men at a camp for Rwandan refugees and Zairian displaced prsons
 south of Bukavu in November. A Bukavu Catholic bishop was executed,  legedly
 by the FAZ for a public statement supporting Banyamulenge rights. The Catholic
 archbishop of Bukavu was murdered, apparently by the rebels.
 In contrast, there were no reports of violence against Kasaians living in Shaba
 since the expulsion of 1992. Th~e last groups of displaced Kasaians forced to flee
 Shaba were resettled in July 1995.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Transitional Act provides for freedom of ex-
 pression as a fundamental civil right. However, while the press and the public can
 exercise freedom of expression  uhe    open  tan bre   the transition began
 in April 1990, in practice the Government-notably those elements loyal to the
 President-continues to restrict freedom of speech and the press to a considerable
 extent.
 Newspaper publishers are required to de ssit copies of each issue with the Min-
 istry of Information prior to publication. The Government continued arbitrarily to
 intimidate, harass, and detain journalists and other media officials for publishing
 controversial articles. On September 17, Ladi Luya, the editor of La Palmares, a
 roopposition newspaper, was arrested for publishing an article speculating on the
 President's health, He was released on September 28. In March the Minister of In-
 formation suspended the publishing of two newspapers because of an article enti-
 tled, "The Financial and Budget Mismanagement of the Zairian Armed Forces."
 Their publisher, Bonsanje Yema, was held briefly in detention but is now free.
 Though the two newspapers are still banned, Bonsanje is publishing a newspaper
 under a different title. In August the Governor of Hat Zaire banned the NGO
 LINELIT from having access to the government owned radio and television stations.
 They are still banned. Several church radio stations in Kisangani and Bunia (Haut
 Zaire) have been banned from broadcasting any nonreligious programs. In some
 cases, government and military authorities have targeted media reporters and offi-
 cials for extortion purposes.
 The principal means of communication with the public are radio and television,
 both of which remain under presidential control. Although there is no specific policy
 prohibiting opposition access to radio and television, opposition parties complain
 that they are unable to gain access to such media.
 n December 1995, the Parliament passed a new press law after consultations
 with media representatives, but the President refused to sign it and sent tof legisla-
 tion back to Parliament for reconsideration. However, on June 22, President Mobutu
 signed the law into effect. While the law deals mainly with media administrative
 
 
 312
 issues, it also codifies the law in libel cases and requires journalists to reveal
 sources "when required by the law."
 In principle academic freedom is provided for in the Transitional Act. However,
 in the past when teachers and academic staff have organized to protest their sala-
 ries and working conditions, they were met with repression.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Transitional Act upholds
 the right to assemble and associate. The full exercise of the right of assembly is sub-
 ordinate to the maintenance of "public order." The Government requires all organiz-
 ers to apply for permits, which are granted or rejected at its discretion. In some
 cases, the Government uses this power to discriminate against political opponents,
 and has revived a 1959 colonial ordinance to justify banning public meetings. The
 Government allowed several groups, including the radical opposition, to hold several
 large gatherings, the last one on July 26, during which security forces exercised re-
 straint. Nevertheless, in other instances security forces repressed unauthorized po-
 litical and other demonstrations, sometimes violently (see Section l.a.). On July 19,
 several UDPS members of the opposition who tried to hold a banned march were
 arrested and tortured. Dieudonne Nyengele was detained for almost a month but
 was released on August 16. NGO's in Bunia reported that opposition political par-
 ties' rallies were usually banned by regional authorities. (Bunia was in rebel hands
 at year's end.)
 he Government requires that NGO's and political parties register with the Min-
 ister of Justice, but there have been no reported cases in which an organization has
 been refused registration.
 c. Freedom of-Religion.-The Transitional Act provides for freedom of religion, and
 the Government respects this provision in practice, with the reservation that the ex-
 pression of this right neither disturb public order nor contradict commonly held
 morals. There is no legally established or favored church or religion.
 A 1971 law regulating religious organizations grants civil servants the power to
 establish and dissolve religious groups. Although this law restricts the process for
 official recognition, officialry recognized religions are free to establish places of wor-
 ship and to train clergy. Many recognized churches have external ties, and foreign
 nationals are allowed to proselytize. The Government generally does not interfere
 with foreign missionaries. Many missionaries, however, report that local security
 forces and government authorities often demand money for alleged taxes and that
 they are never given receipts for the sums paid. There has been no known persecu-
 tion of Jehovah s Witnesses or any other groups for practicing their faith in recent
 years. The Jehovah's Witnesses, formally unbanned in 1993, were permitted to con-
 struct a headquarters in Kinshasa.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Transitional Act allows for freedom of movement, but the Govern-
 ment, and in particular the security forces acting independently, often restrict this
 freedom. All citizens, refugees, and permanent residents are nominally required to
 carry identity cards. However, the Government has not officially issued identity
 cards since 1987 when it invalidated the old ones, then banned the new ones. Con-
 sequently, some citizens carry both cards, while other citizens have none. Security
 forces erect checkpints at airports, ferry ports, and roadblocks, usually to extort
 money from travelers. Passports and exit permits are available in principle to all
 citizens but often at exorbitant cost from corrupt officials. Women must have the
 permission of their husbands to apply for a passport (see Section 5).
 The Government provides first asylum. Zaire housed nearly 1 million Rwandan
 Hutu refugees, mostly 1994 first asylum cases, along its densely populated eastern
 border until a revolt, led by Banyamulenge ethnic Tutsis and other groups, led to
 the November repatriation of the majority of the refugees.
 The Government cooperated with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) who estimated that there were also approximately 150,000 Burundi Hutu
 refugees located in the area. Extreme regional insecurity and open warfare between
 ethnic Tutsis, Hutu extremists, and Zairian security forces, prompted the United
 Nations and donor nations to request a military operation in the region of the Kivus
 in November. Plans for such an operation were suspended after the majority of the
 refugees in the Kivu camps returned to Rwanda.
 The 1,500 members of the Zairian camp security contingent troops (CZSC) from
 the Special Presidential Division generally performed their duties well in the camps
 throughout the year. However, cross-border violence rendered the overall refugee se-
 curity situation unstable, and refugees were subject to extortion, robbery, and sex-
 ual abuse. The UNHCR reported that rapes in and outside the refugee camps were
 on the rise since January. There were reported abuses by the former Rwandan mili-
 tary forces located in the camps, by civilian refugees, and by local Zairians. The
 Kengo Government removed some intimidators from the refugee camps throughout
 
 
 313
 the year. Most of the Rwanda Hutu hardliners, however, remained and moved deep-
 er into Zairian territory following the massive return of refugees to Rwanda in No-
 vember.
 Zaire is a signatory to the 1951 U.N. Convention and its 1967 Protocol related
 to the treatment of refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Transitional Act mandates the right of citizens to change their government,
 but citizens have not been able to exercise this right by voting in multiparty elec-
 tions. President Mobutu, who in 1990 promised democratic reform, continued to im-
 pede democratic progress through his control over key parts of the state apparatus,
 especially the military forces, and by distracting factions of the political opposition,
 often with spurious promises. In the process the President exacerbated party ma-
 neuvering and poitical posturing in the HCR&-PT and reinforced Tshisekedi s and
 the radical opposition's intransigence in Parliament. Despite these impediments the
 Parliament passed implementing legislation establishing a National Electoral Com-
 mission (NE-C) to conduct a nationwide census, register voters, publish a list of can-
 didates, and supervise eventual elections. On January 1, the 1CR-Pr broke the
 deadlock over the question of the NEC's membership. In October the HCR-PT com-
 pleted its deliberations on the draft constitution and implementing legislation for
 the referendum. President Mobutu promulgated the draft constitution in late De-
 comber.
 There are no official restrictions on the participation of women or minorities in
 politics. However, in practice, there are few women or Muslims in senior positions
 in the Government or in political parties. In the new cabinet established December
 24, there is one female minister. A U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) study on women
 reported that there were 38 women in the HCR-PT of a total membership of 739.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While the Government rarely responds to human rights accusations, it permits a
 number of effective human rights organizations to operate, including AZADHO,
 LINELIT, and the Voice of the Voiceless. These organizations investigate and pub-
 lish their findings on human rights cases, largely without government restriction.
 The Government acknowledged AZADHO's 1995 report of human rights abuses, al-
 though it disagreed with the group's figures.
 The security forces continued occasionally to harass and intimidate human rights
 monitors, although there were fewer NGO reports of this activity than in 1995. The
 Government permitted international organizations to visit and discuss abuses; the
 ICRC was allowed to visit prisons on a regular basis.
 In December the U.N. Human Rights Comission established a two-person field
 office in Kinshasa, with a mandate to assess human rights conditions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Transitional Act forbids discrimination based on ethnicity, sex, or religious
 affiliation, but the Government made little headway in advancing these provisions.
 Societal discrimination remained an obstacle to the advancement of certain groups,
 particularly women, Muslims, and the Pygmy (Batwa) ethnic group.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women, including rape, is believed to be com-
 mon, but there are no known government or NGO statistics on the extent of this
 violence. Rape is a crime in Zaire, but the press rarely printed articles about specific
 incidents of violence against women or children. When the press reports a rape, it
 is generally as a consequence of some other crime, but rarely because of the act of
 rape itself. AZADHO listed only three reported rapes in 1996. The police rarely in-
 tervene in domestic disputes, and local NGO's dealing with women a issues stated
 that they were unaware of any Kinshasa court cases this year involving rape or
 spousal abuse.
 Despite constitutional provisions, women are relegated to a secondary role in soci-
 ety. They comprise the majority of primary agricultural laborers, and small-scale
 traders and are almost exclusively responsible for childrearing. In the nontradi-
 tional sector, women commonly receive less pay for comparable work. Only rarely
 do they occupy positions of authority or high responsibility. A UNICEF study on
 women in Zaire reported that only 85 of the country's approximately 600 lawyers
 are women. Women also tend to receive less education than men. The UNICEF
 study reported that, as of 1995, 14 percent of children between the ages of 10 and
 14 had never been to school. Ranked by sex for this age rup, 17.8 percent of girls
 had never attended school, compared with 10 percent for boys.

 Women are required by law to obtain their spouse's permission before engaging
 in routine legal transactions, such as selling or renting real estate, opening a bank
 account, accepting employment, or applying for a passport (see Section 2.d.). A 1987
 revision of the Family Code permits a widow to inherit her husband's property, to
 control her own property, and to receive a property settlement in the event of di-
 vorce. In practice, sometimes consistent with customary law, women are denied
 these rights. Widows are commonly stripped of all possessions-as well as their de-
 pendent children-by the deceased husband's family. Human rights groups and
 church organizations are working to combat this custom, but there is generally no
 government intervention or legalrecourse. Women also are denied custody of their
 children in divorce cases, but they retain the right to visit them. Polygyny is prac-
 ticed although it is illegal. Children of polygynous unions are legally recognized, but
 only the first wife is legally recognized as a spouse.
 Children.-Government spending on children's programs is nearly nonexistent.
 Most schools, for example, only function in areas where parents have formed co-
 operatives to pay teachers' salaries.
 There are no documented cases in which security forces or others target children
 for specific abuse, although children suffer from the same conditions of generalized
 social disorder and widespread disregard for human rights that affect society as a
 whole. These conditions sometimes render parents unable to meet their children's
 basic human needs.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is not widespread, but
 it is practiced on young girls among isolated groups in the north.
 People With Disabilties.-The law does not mandate accessibility to buildings or
 government services for the disabled. There are some special schools, many with
 missionary staff, that use private funds and limited public support to provide edu-
 cation and vocational training to blind and physically disabled students.
 Indigenous People.-Societal discrimination continued against the Pygmy (Batwa)
 population of less than 10,000. Although citizens, Pygmies living in remote areas
 took no part in the political process.
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The last official census was taken in 1984.
 It is estimated that the population is now 45 to 50 million, and comprises more than
 200 separate ethnic groups. Four indigenous languages have national status. French
 is the language of government, commerce, and education. Members of President
 Mobutu's Ngbandi ethnic group are disproportionately represented at the highest
 levels of the military   and intelligence  services. Violent clashes between
 Banyamulenge ethnic Tutsis and other ethnic groups and government security
 forces in the North and South Kivu regions led to open warfare, ethnic cleansing,
 and loss of life (see Section 2.d.). Rwandan and ethnic Tutsis elsewhere in Zaire,
 notably in major urban centers like Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, and Kisangani, were
 targeted for harassment, systematic theft at their homes and businesses, andphys-
 ical abuse following the outbreak of hostilities in the Kivus. Hundreds were forced
 to flee the country.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Transitional Act and other legislation permit all
 workers except magistrates and military personnel to form and join trade unions.
 Before 1990 the law required all trade unions to affiliate with the National Union
 of Zairian Workers (UNTZA), the sole recognized labor confederation and which also
 formed part of Mobutu's Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR) party. When
 political pluralism was permitted in April 1990, UNTZA disaffiliated itself from the
 MPR an reorganized under new leadership chosen through elections deemed fair
 by outside observers. Although UNTZA remains the largest labor federation, almost
 100 other independent unions are now registered with the Labor Ministry and two
 other large federations are active. Some of these are affiliated with political parties
 or associated with a single industry or geographic area.
 The law recognizes the right to strike;however, legal strikes rarely occur since
 the law requires prior resort to lengthy mandatory arbitration and appeal proce-
 dures. Labor unions have not been able to defend effectively the rights of workers
 in the deteriorating economic environment. In July and August, several government
 employees were arrested and released several times for being members of the Soli-
 darity trade union. Illegal general, sector, and other strikes, often called by political
 parties and not necessarily organized by unions, occur despite their illegality. The
 law prohibits employers or the Government from retaliating against strikers, but it
 is rarely enforced.
 In November 1995, the International Labor Organization Committee on Freedom
 of Association (CFA) cited Zaire for serious violations of the principles of freedom
 
 
 of association on the basis of complaints arising from events between mid-1993 and
 March 1995. The CFA expressed "deep concern7 about "arrests, detentions, and tor-
 ture of trade unionists, acts of reprsson against demonstrators, the hampring of
 trade union activities, and acts of antiunion discrimination, including the dismissal
 of officials, prohibition of union meetings in the health services, refusal to register
 trade unions, creation of trade unions by the authorities, and the Government s re-
 fusal to negotiate with representative trade unions." The CFA regretted the Govern-
 ment's failure to respond to these allegations and called on it to make restitution
 where possible and to desist from such actions in the future. Trade unions report
 that in 1996 the Government did not officially stop this type of harassment.
 Unions may affiliate with international bodies. The UNTZA participates in the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity, and the Central Union of Zaire is affili-
 ated with the World Confederation of labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to bargain collectively, and an agreement between the UNTZA and the employers
 association provided for wages and prices to be jointly negotiated each year under
 minimal government supervision. This system, which functioned until 1991, broke
 down as a result of the rapid depreciation of the currency. While collective bargain-
 ing still exists in theory, continuing hyperinflation has encouraged a return to pay
 rates individually arranged between employers and employees.
 The collapse of the formal economy has also resulted in a decline in the influence
 of unions, a tendency to ignore existing labor regulations, and a buyer's market for
 labor. The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, although this regulation
 is not strongly enforced by the Ministry of Labor. The law also requires employers
 to reinstate workers fired for union activities. In the public sector, the Government
 sets wages by decree; public sector unions act only in an informal advisory capacity.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and such labor is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 18 years. Employers may legally hire minors between the ages of 14
 and 18 with the consent of a parent or guardian, but those under 16 may work a
 maximum of 4 hours per day; those between the ages of 16 and 18 may work up
 to 8 hours. Employment of children of all ages is common in the informal sector and
 in subsistence agriculture. Neither the Ministry of Labor, which is responsible for
 enforcement, nor the labor unions make an effort to enforce child labor laws. Larger
 enterprises do not commonly exploit child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Most citizens are engaged in subsistence agri-
 culture or commerce outside the formal wage sector. The minimum wage, last ad-
 justed by government decree in 1990, is irrelevant due to rapid inflation. Most work-
 ers rely on the extended family and informal economic activity to survive. The maxi-
 mum legal workweek (excluding voluntary overtime) is 48 hours. One 24-hour rest
 period is required every 7 days.
 The Labor Code specifies health and safety standards, and, while the Ministry of
 Labor is officially charged with enforcing these standards, its efforts to do so re-
 mained insufficient. There are no provisions in the Labor Code permitting workers
 to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without penalty.
