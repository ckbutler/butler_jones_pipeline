 HAITI
 Haiti is ruled by a President-for-Life, Jean-Claude Duvalier,
 who inherited power from his father. Francois Duvalier, in 1971
 and has ruled since then with the assistance of a small circle
 of advisors. Since its independence in 1804, Haiti's political
 history has been one of authoritarian rule characterized by
 periods of political instability and human rights abuses.
 Although the violence which characterized the rule of Francois
 Duvalier has been reduced by his son, major human rights
 shortcomings continue in Haiti. Freedom of speech, press, and
 association is restricted by the Government, and due process
 guarantees relating to judicial procedures are frequently
 disregarded. The President has continued to call on the large
 number of Haitians abroad to return home without fear, a call
 which has been responded to only slowly.
 Haiti remains the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere.
 Although Western countries have increased their assistance to
 Haiti, and the Government has instituted tax and budgetary
 reforms, the bulk of the people remain desperately poor.
 Haiti is constitutionally a republic with executive authority
 vested in the President. The legislature is a unicameral
 chamber with members elected for six-year terms. The judicial
 system is not independent of the executive branch. In
 practice, all government power is concentrated in the
 Presidency. The President has the right to dissolve the
 legislature and to rule by decree during the nine months of the
 year that the legislature is not in session. Haiti's small
 standing army and its militia--the Volunteers for National
 Security--play no direct role in government affairs.
 In 1983 a new Constitution was adopted which proclaimed
 Jean-Claude Duvalier President-for-Life and gave him the right
 to name a successor. Adoption of the Constitution resulted in
 the dissolution of the legislature and paved the way for
 legislative elections, which are scheduled to be held in early
 1984.
 Municipal elections, Haiti's first since 1946, were held
 throughout the country in 1983. Although virtually all
 candidates were loyal Duvalierists, most elections were
 contested. The Government, nevertheless, prevented the small
 opposition Haitian Christian Democratic Party of Sylvio Claude
 from presenting candidates in the municipal elections. Five
 individuals associated with Claude who were arrested in May
 were not released until after the elections in August. Claude
 himself, in hiding for most of 1983, was arrested in October
 and held in what the Government claimed was "protective
 custody" until his release in December. The police arrested
 more than 12 members of Claude's party as well as members of
 his family on various anti-Government and conspiracy charges
 but subsequently released most of them.
 After bombs exploded at several locations in Port-au-Prince
 early in 1983, police arrested nine men suspected of being
 associated with exile groups. Although most have been
 released, three suspects remain in detention without having
 been charged with any offense.
 In summary, human rights abuses continued to occur in Haiti in
 1983, although President Jean Claude-Duvalier has eliminated
 the killings and disappearances which took place under his
 
 
 601
 father. The Government continued, however, occasionally to
 arrest persons arbitrarily and to beat and torture some. The
 opposition has been severely restricted, but some independents
 were elected to municipal office in the first elections held
 since 1946, and legislative elections have been announced for
 1984.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 A bomb blast in downtown Port-au-Prince on New  rs Day left
 between three and 10 people dead. Political leaflets found at
 the scene belonged to the Hector Riobe Brigade, an exile group
 which had been involved in previous terrorist attacks in Haiti
 in 1982. A night watchman was killed when bombs exploded in
 March at an automobile dealership in which the Duvalier family
 has an interest. A bomb also exploded at the offices of the
 Government newspaper. No group has been linked to or has
 claimed credit fot these last two incidents. Arbitrary
 killings by army officers were reported in two cases; in one,
 the officer was held for a court-martial, and in the other the
 officer was transferred to a different post. In both cases the
 acts were not political in nature.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances in 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Several cases of torture of detained persons were reported in
 1983. A Catholic layman and radio broadcaster, Gerard
 Duclerville, was held for six weeks and was severely beaten.
 Under pressure from clergy and local and international human
 rights groups, Duclerville was released prior to the March 1983
 visit to Haiti by Pope John Paul II. In September, Jocelyn
 Claude, daughter of opposition leader Sylvio Claude, was
 arrested by the police and held for more then 48 hours. Upon
 her release, Jocelyn said that she had been tortured and bore
 marks of cigarette burns on her legs and bruises on her head.
 The Government denied responsibility.
 Interrogations of individuals arrested for political and
 nonpolitical crimes were sometimes accompanied by threats and
 beatings. One person arrested for questioning as part of a
 political investigation reported that a mild electric shock was
 applied to her hands. However, this practice is not believed
 to be widespread. An American citizen arrested on marijuana
 charges said that he had been threatened and forced to remain
 naked in his cell prior to being transferred to the national
 penitentiary. In rural Haiti local police and militia are
 reported to detain and treat arrestees arbitrarily at times,
 without respect for the judicial procedures set forth under
 Haitian law.
 
 
 602
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Throughout 1983, the Government arrested and held without
 charge a number of people suspected of involvement with
 anti-Government exile organizations or with the only opposition
 political party. Following several bomb blasts early in the
 year, nine men were arrested. Some were held over six months
 without being charged, although only three remained in
 detention at the end of the year. The Christian Democratic
 Party of Sylvio Claude faced constant harassment by security
 police in 1983. Although five individuals associated with it
 were arrested in May for conspiring against the state, the
 Government never filed charges and released them following
 municipal elections in August. International observers
 considered that the five had been arrested to prevent the
 party's participation in the municipal elections. Sylvio
 Claude, who had gone into hiding and was himself arrested in
 October, was released in December. His home remained under
 surveillance and he was not allowed to leave the premises.
 In Cap Haitien, the country's second largest city, a radio
 broadcaster was ordered arrested in September for voicing
 opinions on the air which did not conform with official
 government policy. When he announced his impending arrest over
 the airwaves, a crowd of citizens attempted to protect him from
 the police. After several hours of confrontation the
 broadcaster was arrested, questioned, and then released.
 Likewise, in Port-au-Prince, the publisher of a
 semi-independent weekly news journal was temporarily detained
 after publication of an article which speculated about
 successors to President Duvalier. Following much international
 publicity linking the Haitians to Acquired Immune Deficiency
 Syndrome (AIDS), the government arrested and questioned at
 least 50 suspected homosexuals. Although all were released
 without charges, an American manager of a homosexual
 establishment was summarily expelled from Haiti.
 Expulsion of people whom the Government believes pose possible
 security threats has long been a practice in Haitian politics
 and was employed against Yves Medard, a writer and film maker,
 who was arrested after he returned to Haiti from Mexico. While
 Medard was held in prison for one month, his family took refuge
 in a foreign embassy. In October Medard and his family were
 allowed to travel to France. An American missionary was
 expelled following an incident in which he was alleged to have
 struck the daughter of a high military official during a
 traffic dispute, a charge he was not given the opportunity to
 refute.
 Although Haitian law requires the securing of a warrant to make
 an arrest except in circumstances such as hot pursuit, the law
 also allows police to hold suspects for 48 hours before
 presenting them before a judge. The judge may order the
 accused released or allow the person to be held for further
 investigation. In cases related to state security, suspects
 are often held more than 48 hours without presentation before a
 judge.
 Charges against a suspect are often announced just prior to the
 trial. Persons charged with serious offenses are afforded
 legal counsel. However, a client does not have a right to meet
 with his or her counsel until immediately before the trial.
 
 
 603
 Preventive detention has been practiced by the Government, most
 noticeably in cases related to political opposition activities
 and to state security matters..
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Haitian judiciary is legally a separate institution but it
 does not operate completely independently of the executive
 branch. Defendants have the right to appeal their convictions.
 At present, there are 40 to 50 prisoners who have not been
 tried, including political prisoners and terrorists. Since the
 Government continues to withhold full information on prisoners,
 it is difficult to estimate with accuracy the number of
 political prisoners. Those prisoners on whom information is
 available include members of the Haitian Christian Democratic
 Party, three persons suspected of terrorism with the Hector
 Riobe Brigade exile organization, and eight others who have
 been held for over a year after allegedly crossing the border
 from the Dominican Republic with anti-government intentions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 For internal security, a large national militia supplements the
 internal security functions of the police, who are military
 personnel, and the regular military forces. The militia, known
 .as the Volunteers for National Security, is present throughout
 the Haitian countryside. In addition to maintaining order, the
 militia serves as an informer system and reports on possible
 threats to the regime.
 While there is no systematic interference with the right of
 privacy or the sanctity of the home, police sometimes enter
 homes to arrest people without warrants. In one case, the
 police damaged a factory and a home looking for evidence of a
 crime. Warrants were not secured prior to the searches.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Includingt
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are restricted despite the fact
 that these freedoms are provided for in the Haitian
 Constitution. The 1980 press code requires that all
 publications be submitted to Government censors for review 72
 hours in advance of publication; that journalists, including
 foreigners, be accredited by the Ministry of Information; and
 that no material critical of the President or his family be
 published. Since the Government expelled several well-known
 journalists in 1980, the press has not challenged the
 Government's policy.
 In 1983 the Government arrested the publisher of a
 semi-independent weekly for speculating on the President's
 choice of a successor, based on the authority granted to the
 President by the 1983 Constitution. In another incident,
 police briefly detained a broadcaster for criticizing
 Government policy.
 There are several pro-Government newspapers in addition to the
 official daily. Sylvio Claude's party intermittently publishes
 a semiclandestine newsletter and has accused the Government of
 harassment such as the seizure of mimeograph equipment.
 
 
 604
 Cultural organizations in Haiti, such as theater groups,
 exercise self-censorship and avoid criticism of the Government.
 Although foreign publications and news broadcasts are received
 in Haiti, publications critical of the Government, such as
 those published by Haitian exile organizations overseas, are
 not permitted to be imported. Publications entering Haiti for
 general distribution are reviewed and, on occasion, censored or
 withheld.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Haitian law requires that organizations be registered with the
 Government and that meetings of 20 or more people receive
 Government approval. In December 1983 the Government stated
 that this law does not apply to labor unions or
 confederations. Despite constitutional provisions guaranteeing
 the right of citizens to form political parties, the
 restriction on the freedom to associate effectively inhibits
 the creation or functioning of organizations not desired by the
 Government.
 Approximately 12 small unions, essentially company unions,
 exist under the auspices of the Ministry of Social Affairs.
 Less than one percent of Haitian workers are members of unions,
 and union influence has diminished since the expulsion in 1980
 of leaders of the only national trade union confederation, the
 autonomous Haitian Workers' Central. The Ministry plays a
 direct role in resolving all labor disputes. In December 1983
 the Government publicly reaffirmed the right of unions to form
 labor federations and confederations. It also affirmed their
 right to affiliate with international trade union
 organizations. The right to strike is severely restricted in
 practice. In late October 1983, in its response to the
 International Labor Organization, the Government committed
 itself, in cooperation with the Government of the Dominican
 Republic, to take positive steps to overcome abuses and improve
 the conditions of Haitian sugar cane workers in the Dominican
 Republic.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholicism is the official religion. Voodoo, the local
 religion, is widely practiced. All other religions are freely
 practiced, and there is no religious discrimination.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government does not generally restrict travel within Haiti,
 although a network of checkpoints exists throughout the
 country. In one case, an independent legislative deputy was
 prevented by military authorities from entering his district
 during municipal elections in March, and several supporters of
 Sylvio Claude who were released from detention in August must
 register with the local prefecture and receive specific
 authorization to travel outside their local communities.
 Immigration officials maintain a list of persons who may not
 enter or leave the country for political or security reasons.
 In 1982, and again in 1983, the President called on Haitians
 overseas to return to Haiti. Some prominent Haitians have
 returnedl however, others in exile have refused to return in
 the absence of a guarantee of their safety. In January 1984,
 
 
 605
 Gregoire Eugene, in exile in New York since 1980, was refused
 the required return visa to Haiti where he was considering
 participating in the legislative elections announced for
 February.
 Illegal emigration from Haiti remained a significant problem in
 1983. The number of Haitians leaving by boat increased in
 1983, as compared to 1982, probably because of worsening
 economic conditions, hunger, and drought in rural areas. In
 accordance with the bilateral agreement between the United
 States and Haiti of September 1981, all Haitians interdicted at
 sea by the U.S. Coast Guard were returned to Haiti after
 individual screenings by U.S. immigration officers determined
 that none had a claim to refugee status. None of those
 interviewed after their return have reported mistreatment as a
 result of their attempt to emigrate. In accordance with the
 bilateral agreement, the Haitian Government has not prosecuted
 these people for departing without proper documentation, a
 violation of Haitian law. However, the Government has arrested
 several of the returnees suspected of organizing the escape
 attempts, as well as-other returnees found with illegal drugs
 in their possession.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Haiti is ruled by a President-for-Life. Jean-Claude Duvalier,
 the ninth Haitian President-for-Life, inherited power from his
 father in 1971 and has ruled since with the assistance of a
 small circle of advisors. The legislature, which was
 essentially powerless and followed the lead of the executive
 branch, dissolved itself after approving a new Constitution in
 August 1983. This provides for elections for a new legislature
 in early 1984.
 Municipal elections, the first since 1946, were held in 1983
 throughout Haiti. Although a number of slates of candidates
 contested the elections, in many cases the voter registration
 procedure was reported to have been manipulated by the
 candidate already in power. Independent mayors were elected in
 Cap Haitian and Lea Cayes. the second and third largest
 cities. In Port-au-Prince, however, where the incumbent mayor
 received over 90 percent of the vote, there were charges that
 the supporters of his opponent had not been allowed to
 register. Participation In the elections was widespread among
 the peasantry, but few persons in the middle and upper classes
 voted.
 The only opposition political party remaining from the 1980
 Government repression of political activists has been harassed
 continually by security police, and it was assumed without
 question that all participants in the municipal elections were
 loyal to both the Government of Haiti and President Duvalier.
 The Government has not allowed the creation of new political
 parties or other opposition groups.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Haitian Government cooperation with outside governmental and
 non-governmental organizations concerning human rights matters
 fluctuated during 1983. Groups from the Lawyers' Committee for
 
 
 606
 International Human Rights and Americas Watch were permitted to
 visit individuals detained for political reasons. At other
 times, the Government did not reply to requests to visit
 political detainees.
 A National Human Rights Commission created in 1982 has played a
 small role in human rights matters. The organization will
 accept individual complaints when made according to procedures
 it has established but does not appear to investigate these
 complaints. An independent Human Rights League affiliated with
 the International Federation of the Rights of Man has existed
 since 1979 but was not very active during 1983. One of its
 members, an attorney who had represented Sylvio Claude, was
 arrested by the authorities in May and released in August.
 Haiti is sensitive to its human rights image, although real or
 perceived security threats take precedence, as shown by the
 arrest and beating of Gerard Duclerville, a Catholic radio
 broadcaster, less than three months before the Pope's scheduled
 visit to Haiti. Duclerville was released before the Pope
 arrived. The Government participates in international and
 regional human rights bodies, though it has not taken an active
 role.
 The Government permitted the visit of a group belonging to the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) to investigate the
 treatment of Haitian cane cutters who work in the Dominican
 Republic under an agreement between the two goverments. The
 organization's report, which criticized Haitian Government
 practices concerning the employment of Haitians in the
 Dominican Republic, was initially rejected by the Haitian
 Government. However, in its response to the ILO in late
 October 1983, the Government committed itself to undertake
 steps to improve the situation of Haitian workers in the
 Dominican Republic with regard to recruitment practices and
 living and working conditions.
 Amnesty International, in its 1983 report covering the
 situation in 1982, expressed concern about the continued
 detention without trial of political prisoners, allegations of
 mistreatment of detainees, and alleged disappearances.
 Freedom House, in its 1983 report, concluded that Haiti
 remained among the "least free" with respect to political
 rights. In the area of civil liberties, Haiti was one step
 above "least free" in the comparative ranking. It continued to
 be described as a "not free" nation.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Haiti has a small elite and a growing middle-class in
 Port-au-Prince which control most of the wealth of the country,
 while 80 percent of the rural population and more than half of
 the urban population exist below the absolute poverty line.
 Haiti's population is estimated to be 5.6 million, with over 1
 million in the greater Port-au-Prince area. Haiti suffers from
 a lack of natural resources and a terrain which is 70 percent
 mountainous. In addition, erosion of the topsoil resulting
 from the destruction of the forest cover on the hillsides and
 the frequent droughts and floods in various parts of the island
 have lowered agricultural production and the personal income of
 
 
 607
 peasant families. Coffee, essential oils from vetiver, and
 mangoes are the primary agricultural exports. Most farming is
 done on small plots, owned by peasant families and subdivided
 through inheritance over generations. This results in
 inefficient agricultural practices.
 The Government has endorsed the development of agricultural
 cooperatives to improve productivity and the access to market
 of farmers in remote areas. Food imports are necessary, and
 even with them Haitians receive only 92 percent of their
 caloric supply requirements. More than 60 percent of children
 under five suffer from some malnutrition, and nearly 10 percent
 of these are characterized as seriously malnourished.
 Most industrial employment is limited to Port-au-Prince, where
 assembly factories have created 40,000 jobs over the past 10
 years. However, the worldwide recession reduced these
 employment figures. With a minimum daily wage of $2.64, it is
 likely that additional foreign business will begin to do
 business in Haiti as the world economic situation improves.
 Infant mortality is estimated at 110 per 1,000 live births
 nationally. Life expectancy at birth is 53 years and has not
 increased significantly over the past decade. The population
 growth rate is presently estimated at two percent a year.
 Education is open to all; however, opportunities in rural areas
 are limited, and even in Port-au-Prince the expenses parents
 must incur for registration, uniforms, and books limit
 attendance. Many students never attend school or leave at an
 early age for economic reasons. A new program sponsored by the
 U.N. Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization is
 introducing Creole, the native language, into the elementary
 school curriculum. It is estimated that 62 percent of children
 had access to schooling in 1978, but less than four percent of
 those who started elementary school finished 12 years of
 schooling. In 1978, the adult literacy rate was estimated at
 23.3 percent, with the male literacy rate at 28.7 percent and
 the female literacy rate at 18.40 percent.
 A law implemented in 1982 improved legal rights for women in
 Haiti. However, women hold few positions in government.
 Opportunitites for women in the private sector remain limited
 largely as a result of traditional attitudes.
 Efforts are continuing with the aid of international donor
 organizations to improve the availability of potable water in
 both rural and urban areas. In 1976 only :0 percent of the
 urban population and seven percent of the rural population had
 access to safe water, for a national average of 14 percent.
 Per capita income in Haiti is approximately *300 per year,
 although in some rural areas it is closer to $100. Such
 extreme poverty has caused massive migration from Haiti,
 particularly over the last decade. Foreign remittances, which
 are estimated at *80 million per year, are a crucial element of
 survival for many Haitian families.
