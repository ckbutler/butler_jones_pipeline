 BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a longstanding, multiparty democracy. Constitutional power is
 shared between the President, Sir Ketumile Masire, and the 44-member popularly
 elected lower house of Parliament. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party (DP)
 continued to dominate the National Assembly, holding 31 of 44 seats. The opposition
 Botswana National Front (BNF) holds the remaining 13 seats. In October 1994, the
 President was reelected in free and fair elections for a third 5-year term. The Gov-
 ernment respects the constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary.
 The civilian Government exercises effective control over the security forces. The
 military, the Botswana Defense Force (BDF), is responsible for external security.
 The Botswana National Police (BNP) are responsible for internal security. Members
 of the security forces occasionally committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is market oriented with strong encouragement for private enter-
 prise. Steady diamond revenues and effective economic and fiscal policies resulted
 in continuing growth, although the economy grew at a relatively modest annual rate
 of 4.5 percent following a downturn from 1991 to 1993. Per capita gross domestic
 product was approximately $3,000 in 1996. Over 50 percent of the population is em-
 d n the informal sector, largely subsistence farming and animal husbandry.
 url poverty remains a serious problem, as does a widely skewed income distribu-
 tion.
 The Constitution provides for citizens' human rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects those rights in practice. Despite some continuing problems, Bot-
 swana's overall human rights record has been consistently positive since independ-
 ence. There were credible reports that the police sometimes mistreated criminal sus-
 pects in order to coerce confessions. Women continued to face legal and societal dis-
 crimination, and violence against women is a continuing problem. Some Batswana,
 including groups not numbered among the eight "principal tribes" identified in the
 Constitution because they live in remote areas, still do not enjoy full access to social
 services and, in practice, are marginalized in the political process. In many in-
 stances the judicial system did not provide timely fair trials due to a serious backlog
 of cases. Trade unions continued to face some legal restrictions, and the Government
 did not always ensure that labor laws were observed in practice.
 The Government continued to address human rights problems in 1996. Par-
 liament ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
 Against Women (CEDAW) and adopted a national policy on women in July. How-
 ever, the Government's plan announced in September 1995 to construct a separate
 detention facility for asylum seekers whose refugee claims have been rejected has
 been delayed pending resolution of a dispute between two government ministries
 over how improvements to the property will be made. The facility is now referred
 to by the Government as the Center for Illegal Immigrants. Until the Center is com-
 pleted, refused asylum seekers continue to be detained in prison. Refugees and asy-
 lum seekers refused under Botswana's "first country of origin" policy are housed at
 Dukwe Refugee Camp.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings. However, in February six members of the military intelligence unit of the
 BDF were implicated in the death of a man who died while under interrogation
 about stolen vehicles and computers. An alleged witness, who claimed that he had
 also been assaulted, charged that he saw the officers suffocate the deceased with
 a plastic bag.
 In a case related to a violent student protest in early 1995, the 12-year sentence
 of a riot police officer convicted of murdering a man who apparently had no connec-
 tion with the demonstrations was reduced at a February hearing.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Puntshment.-
 The Constitution explicitly forbids torture, inhuman, and degrading treatment or
 punishment. The authorities generally respect this prohibition in practice and, in
 some cases, have taken disciplinary or judicial action against persons responsible for
 abuses. However, instances of abuse do occur. While coerced confessions are inad-
 missible in court, evidence gathered through coercion or abuse may be used in pros-
 ecution. There were credible reports that police sometimes used intimidation tech-
 niques in order to obtain evidence or elicit confessions. In the past police sometimes
 suffocated criminal suspects with a plastic bag. There was one such allegation in
 1996 (see Section L.a.). In general, however, beatings and other forms of extreme
 
 
 physical abuse remained rare.In June the Government filed unlawful rioting and as-
 sault charges against several students who had been detained and released follow-
 ing violent student demonstrations in February 1995. Some of the students had al-
 leged police assault when initially detained.
 In January a district customary court sentenced nine young men to six strokes
 each on the buttocks for common nuisance. In October the House of Chiefs adopted
 a motion to request the Government to reinstate corporal punishment in the form
 of flogging across the back rather than the buttocks as is currently permitted. The
 House of Chiefs is an advisory body only.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, although overcrowding
 is a problem. Women in custody are placed in the charge of female officers. The Gov-
 ernment permits visits by human rights monitors after a detailed inquiry procedure.
 The Government neither forcibly repatriates nor deports failed asylum seekers,
 but it has incarcerated them alongside convicted felons. Asylum seekers refused
 under Botswana's "first country of origin" policy, who through mid-1995 were incar-
 cerated, are now housed at Dukwe refugee camp, which is funded by the United Na-
 tions High Commissioner for Refugees (  CR) with sup port from the Government
 (see Section 2.d.). Asylum seekers who do not qualify as refugees are detained in
 prison. The Government's plan to build a dedicated facility for refused asylum seek-
 ers, announced in September 1995, has been delayed pending resolution of a dispute
 between two ministries over how improvements to the property are to be made. The
 facility, to be called the Center for Illegal Immigrants, will be administered jointly
 by the Department of Prisons and Rehabilitation with the Immigration Department,
 which will assist with processing asylum and immigration requests.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Constitution "every person in
 Botswana" is entitled to due process, the presumption of innocence, and freedom
 from arbitrary arrest. The authorities respected these guarantees in practice. Sus-
 pects must be informed of their legal rights upon arrest, including the right to re-
 main silent, to be allowed to contact a person of their choice, and generally to be
 charged before a magistrate within 48 hours. A magistrate may order a suspect held
 for 14 days through a writ of detention, which may be renewed every 14 days. Most
 citizens charged with noncapital offenses are released on their own recognizance;
 some are released with minimal bail. Detention without bail is highly unusual, ex-
 cept in murder cases, where it is mandated. Detainees have the right to hire attor-
 neys of their choice.
 Poor police training and poor communications in rural villages make it difficult
 for detainees to obtain legal assistance, however, and authorities do not always fol-
 low judicial safeguards. The Government does not provide counsel for the indigent,
 except in capital cases, and there is no public defender service. Two nongovern-
 mental organizations (NGO's-the University of Botswana Legal Assistance Center
 and the Botswana Center for Human Rights--provide cost free legal services, but
 their capacity is limited. Constitutional protections are not applied to iliegal immi-
 grants, although the constitutionality of denying them due process has not been
 tested in court.
 Following student demonstrations in February 1995 (see Section 1.c.), police de-
 tained and then released several hundred persons. In June the Government brought
 charges of unlawful rioting and assault against some of those who had been de-
 tained and released. This sparked renewed, although peaceful, student demonstra-
 tions. The Attorney Generals Office has reviewed the charges and evidence and has
 decided to prosecute. Hearing dates had not been set by year's end.
 The Government does not use exile for political purposes.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this prevision  practice.The judiciary consists
 of beth a civil court (including magistrates' courts, a High Court, and a Court of
 Appeal) and a customary (traditional) court system. The law provides for the right
 to a fair trial. The civil courts remained unable to provide for timely, fair trials in
 many cases, however, due to severe staffing shortages and an accumulated backlog
 of pending cases. The courts are making a major effort to clear this backlog, espe-
 cially in murder cases.
 Most trials in the regular courts are public, although trials under the National
 Security Act (NSA) may be held in secret. As a rule, courts appoint public defenders
 only for those charged with capital crimes (murder and treason). Those charged with
 noncapital crimes are often tried without legal representation if they cannot afford
 an attorney. As a result, many defendants may not be informed of their rights in
 pretrial or trial proceedings.
 Implementation of the 1994 Anticorruption Act assuaged earlier concerns that it
 would weaken the defendant's constitutional presumption of innocence.
 
 
 Most citizens encounter the legal system through the customary courts, under the
 authority of a.traditional leader. These courts handle minor offenses involving land,
 marital, and property disputes. In customary courts the defendant does not have
 legal counsel and there are no precise rules of evidence. Tribal judges, appointed
 by the tribal leader or elected by the community, determine sentences, which may
 be appealed through the civil court system. The quality of decisions reached in the
 traditional courts varies considerably. In communities where chiefs and their deci-
 sions are respected, plaintiffs tend to take their cases to the customary court; other-
 wise, people seek justice from the civil courts.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the protection of privacy and the security of the person,
 and government authorities generally respect these rights.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, both individual and corporate, and the Government respects this right in prac-
 tice. Botswana has a long tradition of vigorous, candid, and unimpeded public dis-
 course.The independent press is small, but lively and frequently critical of the Gov-
 ernment and the President. It reports without fear of closure or censorship. Concern
 has been expressed, however, that charges recently filed against a journalist may
 have an intimidating effect. In October the journalist was accused of violating a law
 that prohibits disclosure of the names of persons being investigated by the Direc-
 torate on Corruption and the Economic Crime Unit. However, a magistrate's court
 dismissed the charges on November 1. No further charges were brought either
 against the journalist or the reporter's two editors and the independent newspaper's
 coowners and publishers, who had been implicated at one point in the case.
 The Government also subsidizes a free daily newspaper which depends heavily on
 the official Botswana Press Agency (BOPA) for its material. The broadcast media
 remain a governiment monopoly, with radio the most important medium of informa-
 tion in this highly dispersed society. Radio Botswana follows government policies
 and draws most of its stories from BOPA. Opposition leaders have access to the
 radio, but they complain-with some justification-that their air time is signifi-
 cantly limited. There are no privately owned radio or television stations, but there
 is a semilegal television station broadcasting to viewers in the capital city. Inde-
 pendent radio and television from neighboring South Africa are easily received.
 On occasion the Government has taken steps, under loosely defined provisions of
 the NSA, to limit publication of national security information.
 Academic freedom is not restricted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no barriers to domestic and international travel or migration.
 Citizenship is not revoked for political reasons.The Government cooperates with the
 UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Botswana has
 maintained a policy of considering resettlement requests only from refugees from
 contiguous countries. The Government has, however, permitted failed asylum seek-
 ers to remain in the country either at the Dukwe Refugee Camp or in jail. There
 were no confirmed reports of forced return of persons to a country where they feared
 persecution. Refugees and asylum seekers refused under Botswana's "first country
 of origin" policy are housed at Dukwe Refugee Camp until they are resettled or re-
 patriated. New arrivals considered by the Government to be illegal immigrants are
 detained in prison until the Government's plan to construct a separate facility, an-
 nounced in September 1995, has been completed. The plan, which is in the design
 stage, has been delayed pending resolution of a dispute between two ministries over
 how improvements to the property will be made.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal adult (21 years of age) suffrage. The Bot-
 swana Democratic Party continued to dominate Parliament following the October
 1994 elections, ensuring the reelection of BDP leader Sir Ketumile Masire as Presi-
 dent. The opposition Botswana National Front, the only opposition party to win
 seats, increased its representation from 3 to 13 seats.The House of Chiefs, an advi-
 
 
 sory upper chamber of Parliament with limited powers, is constitutionally restricted
 to the eight "principal tribes" of the Tswana nation. Consently, other groups
 (e.g., the Basarwa "bushmen," Herero, Kalanga, Humbukush, Baoi, or Lozi) are not
 represented there. Given the limited authority of the House of Chiefs, the impact
 of excluding other groups of Botswana citizens is largely symbolic, hut it is viewed
 as important in principle by some non-Setswana speakers. Members of the National
 Assembly are required to be able to speak English. This restriction has never been
 challenged in court.
 In practice, women are underreprsented in the political process. Although women
 constitute just over 50 percent of the population, there are only 4 women among the
 44 members of the National Assembly, and only 2 women in the Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of H-uan Rights
 Domestic and international human rights groups operate without government re-
 striction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Govern-
 ment officials are generally cooperative and responsive to such inquiries.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cudl Status
 The Constitution and Penal Code forbid discrimination on the basis of ethnicity,
 nationality, or creed, but do not address discrimination based on sex. These provi-
 sions are implemented in practice by the government authorities.
 Womnen.-Violene against women, primarily beatings, remains a serious problem.
 Under customary law and in ommon rural practice men have the right to chastise"
 their wives. Statistics are believed to underromert the levels of abuse against
 women. Police are rarely called to intervene in cases of domestic violence, and there
 were no court cases related to domestic violence in 1996. Spousal abuse is beginning
 to receive increased attention both from the media and from local human rights
 groups.
 Women in Botswana do not have the same civil rights as men. However, one im-
 portant step was the Government's accedence to the Convention on the Elimination
 of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). In addition a national
 policy on women was adopted in July following consultations among the Govern-
 ment, NGO's and the private sector. The plan identifies six critical areas of concern,
 prioritized as follows: 1) women and poverty, 2) women and powersharing and deci-
 sionmaking, 3) education and training of women, 4) women and health, 5) the girl
 child, and 6) violence against women.
 A number of other laws, many of which are attributed to traditional practices, re-
 strict civil and economic opportunities for women. A woman married in "common
 prperty" is held to be a legal minor, requiring her husband's consent to buy or sell
 property, apply for credit, and enter into legally binding contracts. Women have,
 and are increasingly exercising, the right to marriage "out of common property," in
 which case they retain their full legal rights as adults. Polygyny is stillegal under
 traditional law and with the consent of the first wife, but it is rarely practiced. In
 October the Government solicited bids fcnsa      to review existing laws al-
 leged to discriminate against women.
 Well trained urban women enjoy growing entry level access to the white collar job
 market, but the number of opportunities decreases sharply as they rise in seniority.
 Discrimination against women is most acute in rural areas where women work pri-
 marily in subsistence agriculture.
 A number of women's organizations have emerged to promote the status of
 women. The Govern ment has entered into a dialog with many of these groups.
 While some women s rights groups reportedly felt that the Government has been
 slow to respond concretely to their concerns, women's NGO's say that they are en-
 couraged by the direction of change, and by the increasingly collaborative relation-
 ship with government authorities. Within the Ministry of Labor and Home Affairs,
 the Women's Affairs Unit, which is charged with handling women's issues, was up-
 graded to a division. Plans to make it a separate department had not yet been im-
 plemented.
 Children.-The Government provides 7 years of education for children. The rights
 of children are addressed in the Constitution and the 1981 Children's Act. Under
 the act Botswana has a court system and social service apparatus designed solely
 for juveniles. There is no societal pattern of abuse against children.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not discriminate on the basis of
 physical or mental disability, although employment opportunities for the disabled
 remain limited. The Government does not require accessibility to public buildings
 
 
 and public conveyances for people with disabilities, and the NGO community has
 only recently begun to address the needs of the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Tswana majority, of which the Constitu-
 tion recognizes eight principal tribes, has a tradition of peacefully coexisting with
 "minor" tribes. Each of the eight principal tribes is represented in the advisory
 House of Chiefs, while the other groups are permitted only a subchief, who is not
 a member of the House. Other than the lack of schooling in their own language and
 representation in the House of Chiefs, Botswana's Bantu minorities and nonindige-
 nous minorities, such as the white and Asian communities, are not subject to dis-
 crimination. However, the nomadic Basarwa remain marginalized; they have lost ac-
 cess to their traditional land and are vulnerable to exploitation. Their isolation, ig-
 norance of civil rights, and lack of representation in local or national government
 have stymied their progress.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of associa-
 tion. In practice all workers, with the exception of government employees, are free
 to join or organize unions of their own choosing. Government workers may form as-
 sociations that function as quasi-unions but without the right to negotiate wages.
 The industrial or wage economy is small, and unions are concentrated largely in the
 mineral and to a lesser extent in the railway and banking sectors. There is only one
 major confederation, the Botswana Federation of Trade Unions (BFTU), but there
 are no obstacles to the formation of other labor federations.
 Unions are independent of the Government and are not closely allied with any
 political party or movement. Unions may employ administrative staff, but the law
 requires elected union officials to work full time in the industry the union rep-
 resents. This severely limits union leaders' professionalism and effectiveness and
 has been criticized by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU).
 The law also severely restricts the right to strike. Legal strikes are theoretically
 possible after an exhaustive arbitration process, but in practice none of the countrs
 strikes to date has been legal.
 Unions may join international organizations, and the BFTU is affiliated with the
 ICFTU. The Minister of Labor must approve any affiliation with an outside labor
 movement, but unions may appeal to the courts if an application for affiliation is
 refused.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 collective bargaining for unions that have enrolled 25 percent of a labor force. In
 reality only the mineworker unions have the organizational strength to engage in
 collective bargaining, and collective bargaining is virtually nonexistent in most other
 sectors.
 Workers may not be fired for union-related activities. Dismissals may be appealed
 to labor officers or civil courts, but labor offices rarely do more than order 2-months'
 severance pay.
 Botswana has only one export processing zone-in the town of Selebi-Phikwe-
 which is subject to the same labor laws as the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically for-
 bids forced or compulsory labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Although education is not compul-
 sory, the Government provides 7 years of free education to every child, and most
 children in Botswana take advantage of this opportunity. Only an immediate family
 member may employ a child 13-years-old or younger, and no juvenile under 15 years
 may be employe in any industry. Only persons over 16 years may be hired to per-
 form night work, and no person under 16 years is allowed to perform hazardous
 labor, including in mining. District and municipal councils have child welfare divi-
 sions which are responsible for enforcing child labor laws. Because research on the
 issue of child labor is limited, it is difficult to state whether child labor laws are
 effectively enforced. Child labor is not perceived to be a significant problem in Bot-
 swana. The high level of primary and junior school attendance, coupled with the
 Government's policy of increasing the number of schools so as to accommodate more
 puiis for a greater number of years is a good indicator of dedication in principle
 and practice to deterring child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.--The minimum monthly wage for full-time labor
 increasedby $4.60 (16 Pula) in 1996 to $82 (286 Pula), which isless than 50 percent
 of what the Government calculates is necessary to meet the basic needs of a family
 of five. (Because of exchange rate changes, the dollar value of the minimum wage
 declined compared to 1995.) The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing the
 minimum wage, and each of the country's districts has at least one labor inspector.
 
 
 The Ministry of Labor began developing a small number of potential cases to take
 to the Industrial Court, but none had been brought before the Court by year's end.
 Formal sector jobs almost always pay well above minimum wage levels. Informal
 sector employment, particularly in the agricultural and domestic service sectors
 where housing and food are included, frequently pay below the minimum wage. The
 Ministry of Labor recommends a monthly minimum wage of $92.60 (250 pula) for
 domestics, but this is not mandatory. Illegal immigrants, primarily Zambians and
 Zimbabweans, are easily exploited as they would be subject to deportation if they
 filed grievances against employers.
 Botswana law permits a maximum 48-hour workweek, exclusive of overtime
 which is payable at time and a half for each additional hour. Most modern private
 and public sector jobs are on the 40-hour workweek.
 Workers who complain about hazardous conditions cannot be fired. The Govern-
 ment's institutional ability to enforce its workplace safety legislation remains lim-
 ited, however, by inadequate staffing and unclear jurisdictions between different
 ministries. Nevertheless, worker safety is generally provided for by employers, with
 the occasionally notable exception of the construction industry.
