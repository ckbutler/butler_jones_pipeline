 MEXICO
 Since the close of the 1910 revolution, Mexico has ex-
 perienced rapid economic and social development with
 political stability, though the high rate of economic
 growth has slowed since 1975. Although there are no
 sizable opposition parties, the dominant Revolutionary
 Institutional Party _(PRIJ is a'channel for considerable
 political pirticipation and debat-e...
 The Constitution, laws and much of the political dis-
 course consistently affirm or reflect social justice
 and equality as basic ideals of the Revolution. In-
 dividual rights are generally respected in practice.
 Human rights violations have occurred, as noted
 below, but are not condoned by the Government of
 Mexico as public policy. Also noted below are at-
 tempts by the Government to reduce such violations.
 Mexico has a'good human rights record in international
 affairs, with traditional support for the persecuted
 of other countries and with frequent participation
 in multilateral approaches to human rights problems.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Government policy condemns the use of torture. However,
 cases of psychological and physical police abuse are
 reported. Such abuses are believed to occur most often
 in-the-period immediately following arrest, especially
 during interrogation. There are fewer instances of
 such reports under the current administration;
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Conditions in mapy Mexican jails are poor due to
 overcrowding, primitive sanitary conditions and
 , inadequate diet. The United States has conducted
 negotiations with Mexico with respect to jailed
 American citizens, most of whom have been held on
 drug charges. Repatriations under an agreement.
 to transfer prisoners began in late 1977.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Mexican citizens are guaranteed the right of
 amparo, a Constitutional protection provided
 against "coercive and abusive acts of authority.4
 Incidents of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment
 occur most frequently in the area of criminal law.
 Arbitrary arrests and detentions of suspected sub-
 versives have been charged on occasion by civil
 rights groups and by the press. .While the evidence
 is not conclusive, it gives rise to a reasonable
 presumption that all legal guarantees may not have
 been fully applied in some of those cases. The
 Mexican Government has consistently denied reports
 that it holds political~prisoners, and in 1977
 invited Amnesty International to visit the country.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials are the norm. However, guaran-
 tees like those in the U.S. to protect the rights of
 prisoners during pre-arraignment interrogations
 are not part of the Mexican system. -In addition,
 qualified legal counsel is expensive and often
 unobtainable for criminal cases. It is widely be-
 lieved that suspected terrorists have occasionally
 been killed instead of being brought to trial, and
 there are occasional reports in the press of sus-
 picious disappearances. But there is no conclusive
 evidence of such human rights violations.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There are indications that Mexican police on a few
 occasions during 1977 have invaded the homes or
 business places of suspects vithout appropriate
 judicial orders.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfill-
 ment of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter,
 Health Care and Education
 The Echeverria Administration (1970-1976) expanded
 government services affecting shelter, health care,
 education and food. The degree to which these in-
 creased services have reached the poorest 20% of
 the population is difficult to determine, but the
 needs of the poor are still great. Because of the
 
 22-145 0 - 78 - 13
 
 
 high population growth rate, the rapid increase
 in spending for social services has not ensured an
 increase in per capita benefits. Furthermore,
 the poorest segments of Mexico's population are
 those.living in remote rural areas where-socinl
 services are minimal. The Lopez Portillo Govern-
 .ment's 1978 budget reflects concern about un-
 employment and skewed income distribution pro-
 .blems..
 Although specific cases and magnitudes are-dif-
 ficult to document, the belief is widespread
 that corruption in Mexico diverts significant
 resources from the poor. The Lopez Portillo
 Government is prosecuting several cases of
 past government corruption and the President
 has spoken openly of the need to combat corrup-
 tion as a serious social problem.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press,
 Religion, and Assembly
 Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are
 respected in Mexico. Limited only by a media
 tradition of avoiding direct criticism of an
 incumbent President, Mexicans openly complain
 about the government and can read any author.
 A wide range of ideas is found in the media and
 intellectual circles. There are no restrictions
 on the practice of religion. There are restrictions
 on church ownership of property and political par-
 ticipation by the clergy is prohibited by the
 Constitution. There are few restrictions on
 freedom of assembly: for example, demonstrations
 and marches require permits, which normally are
 granted.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Mexican citizens may travel anywhere and emigrate
 freely.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 
 
 A notable feature of the electoral process is
 that the Mexican political system is dominated
 by one party. Within the ruling political
 party and the government, however, there is
 give and take, wide ideological variation,
 and serious concern for the economic and social
 needs of the country. Several minority parties
 are active. Individual citizens are free
 to join the PRI or the minority parties and to
 participate in their activities. Congress has
 recently approved proposals which facilitate the
 registration of additional parties and provide for
 broadened representation of opposition parties in
 the lower house.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 Intdrnational and Non-Governmental Investi-
 gation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Mexico has a.good international human rights
 record, and has traditionally welcomed the per-
 secuted of other countries and supported multi-
 lateral approaches to human rights problems.
 Mexico has been generally cooperative with -in-
 ternational bihman .Zights groups. Mexico's
 Foreign Secretary informed the 1977 OAS General
 Assembly that the Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission would be welcome to visit Mexico.
 Mexican officials also expressed willingness
 to receive representatives of Amnesty Interna-
 tional.
 The Amnesty International Remort 1977 discussed
 human rights violations in Mexico at some length.
 Amnesty believes there may still be as many as
 100 to 200 political prisoners there, though the
 Mexican Government has presented evidence that
 *the prisoners in question are charged with or
 convicted of common crimes. The 1977 Report
 state. that some of the recommendations made
 by Amnesty in 1976 had been implemented by the
 Mexican authorities (e.g., the release of prisoners
 detained for long periods without trial), but that
 other problems, such as use of torture by federal
 and state personnel"to extract confessions, still
 cause concern.
