 FINLAND
 Finland is a constitutional republic and a multiparty,
 parliamentary democracy. Executive power is vested in the
 President. The Cabinet, consisting of the Prime Minister and
 16 ministers who are responsible to Parliament, works with the
 President in governing the country. Legislative power is held
 by the unicameral Parliament. Judicial power is exercised by
 an independent judiciary, including the Supreme Court and
 Supreme Administrative Court.
 The security apparatus is controlled by elected officials and
 supervised by the courts.
 Finland has a mixed economy with state-owned, privately owned,
 and publicly owned companies. Citizens are free to pursue
 their legitimate private interests, hold private property, and
 engage in economic activity without government interference.
 During 1991, there were no reported violations in Finland of
 fundamental human rights. Members of national minorities and
 women enjoy the same economic and political rights as all other
 citizens.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Killing for political motives by the Government or opposition
 political organizations is not known to occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearances, abduction, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment is provided for by law and is respected in
 practice. By law, prisoners must be treated justly with
 respect for their human dignity and without distinction on the
 basis of race, sex, language, nationality, religious or
 political conviction, social position, wealth, or any other
 grounds.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment or exile is
 provided for in law and respected in practice. Police may hold
 a suspect for up to 7 days without charge. The suspect has
 access to a lawyer during that time. Once arrested, the
 accused must be given a court hearing within 8 days in a city
 or within 30 days in rural areas. The State pays legal fees
 for indigent defendants.
 Circumstances surrounding the arrest are subject to judicial
 review at the time the accused is brought to trial. If found
 to have been innocent of the crime charged, the accused may
 apply to the same court for civil damages, and the arrest is
 deemed invalid.

 Bail does not exist as such in Finland. While those accused of
 serious crimes must by law remain in custody, those charged
 with minor offenses may be released on personal recognizance at
 the court's discretion. Preventive detention is authorized
 only during a declared state of war for narrowly defined
 offenses, such as treason, mutiny, and arms trafficking.
 Supervisory personnel from the Ministry of Justice and the
 Ministry of the Interior as well as the Parliamentary Ombudsman
 and the Chancellor of Justice have authority to enter prisons
 and to order the release of prisoners held without charges.
 There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to fair public trial is provided for by law and
 respected in practice. Finnish citizens and aliens legally
 residing in Finland have the right to effective counsel. The
 law provides that charges must be clearly stated and that
 civilians may not be tried by military courts except in time of
 war.
 Local courts may decide to conduct a trial behind closed doors
 in juvenile, matrimonial, and guardianship cases, or when
 publicity would offend morality or endanger the security of the
 State. In national security cases, the judge may withhold from
 the public any or all information pertaining to charges against
 individuals, verdicts, and sentencing. Sanctions may be
 imposed if such information is made public. Provisional
 tribunals are constitutionally prohibited.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy and the sanctity of the home, including
 prohibition of eavesdropping and mail tampering, are provided
 for by law and respected in practice. The police are not
 allowed to tap telephones under any circumstances, a
 restriction they find hampers their ability to deal with drug
 cases. Senior police officials rather than judges have the
 authority to issue search warrants; there is no indication that
 this power is abused. The police are subject by law to
 judicial scrutiny.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press is provided for in the
 Constitution and respected in practice. There have been no
 reports of abuse or legal decisions restricting freedbm of the
 press. The press occasionally exercises restraint in treating
 issues deemed potentially harmful to the national interest but
 is under no compulsion from the Government to do so. Full
 academic freedom exists.
 Until recently, there existed a consensus at the highest levels
 of Government and the media that the press would exercise
 restraint in reporting anything that might cause problems with
 the Soviet Union. Recent events in the U.S.S.R. have
 effectively ended this form of self-censorship. A law remains
 on the books allowing the Government to censor films for foreign
 policy reasons. In practice, this has usually meant that anti-
 Soviet World War II movies could not be shown. Some politicians
 have called for the repeal of the censorship law.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is provided for by
 the Constitution. Public demonstrations require prior
 notification to the police. The Government encourages voluntary
 organizations and subsidizes private groups formed to achieve
 public purposes. They are permitted to maintain relations with
 other international groups in both East and West,
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 Finland has two state religions: Lutheran and Eastern Orthodox.
 Taxes are collected by the Government from church members to
 support churches belonging to these religions. Other
 denominations and religions enjoy unrestricted freedom of
 worship. About 88 percent of the population belonged to the
 Lutheran Church in 1991.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Finns are free to travel within the Nordic countries--Finland,
 Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland-without passports and
 need not apply for exit visas for travel to other countries.
 No restrictions have been placed on emigration or repatriation.
 The granting of political asylum is a matter of considerable
 public debate, especially because of increasing numbers of
 asylum seekers. In 1990, 2,725 applied for asylum (compared to
 174 in 1989); the largest groups in 1991 were Yugoslavs, Soviet
 citizens, Somalis, and Turks. The Government states that it
 grants asylum in accordance with the standards of the 1951 U.N.
 Convention and the 1967 Protoccl and not to people wishing to
 escape economic hardship.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Finland is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy in which all
 citizens over the age of 18 elect their representatives from
 among multiple lists of candidates, representing a wide spectrum
 of political ideologies. The country has the longest tradition
 of women's suffrage in Europe (since 1906> and there are at
 present 77 women representatives (of a total of 200) in
 Parliament and 7 female ministers (of a total of 17) in the
 Cabinet.
 Elections to Parliament take place every 4 years, as do
 municipal elections. At present, there are nine political
 parties in Parliament, of which four form a non-Socialist
 coalition, headed by a Center Party Prime Minister.
 Presidential elections are held every 6 years. In July
 legislation was passed providing for direct presidential
 elections beginning in 1994.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several organizations in Finland monitor human rights
 performance, including the Finnish Red Cross, the government-
 sponsored Equality Council, and the Women's Rights Union. A
 Finnish Helsinki Watch Group was established in 1985 but has
 not been very active lately. In conjunction with the Swedish-
 language University in Turku, a Human Rights Institute was
 
 
 1107
 
 FINLAND
 founded in 1985 with the stated purpose of conducting human
 rights research, performing studies, and distributing
 information on human rights. Finland participates actively in
 international human rights 6rganizations and has not been the
 subject of an international investigation of alleged human
 rights'violations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, education, and health care- are available to all
 inhabitants without discrimination. Lapps, who constitute.less
 than one-tenth of 1 percent of the population, benefit from
 legal provisions protecting minority rights and customs.
 The government-established Council for Equality coordinates and
 sponsors legislation to meet the needs of women as workers,
 mothers, widows, and retirees. In 1985 Parliament passed a
 comprehensive equal rights bill which ensured equal treatment
 for women in the workplace and a bill which permitted women to
 retain their maiden name after marriage as their only surname.
 The Government's Equality Ombudsman monitors compliance with
 regulations against sexual discrimination. Of 152 complaints
 to the Ombudsman in the first half of 1991, violation of the
 law was established in 17 cases.
 The law provides stringent penalties for violence against
 women; it is vigorously enforced by the police and the courts.
 The first shelter for female victims of violence was opened 10
 years ago. The Union of Shelter Homes has 12 shelter homes,
 while municipalities and other communities support 50 similar
 units all over the country. The Government Statistics Office
 estimates that 12,000-14,000 police calls each year result from
 domestic violence, probably less than half of the number of
 actual incidents.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unions are constitutionally guaranteed the right to
 organize, assemble peacefully, and strike--rights which are
 respected in practice in both the public and private sectors.
 Trade unions enjoy a protected status and play an important
 role in political and economic life. About 85 percent of the
 work force is organized. Of the four major labor
 confederations, the 1-million-member mostly blue-collar
 confederation, the Central Organization of Finnish Trade Unions
 (SAK), dominates the trade union movement.
 The three other central organizations cover white-collar,
 professional, and technical employees. The four confederations
 divide along jurisdictional rather than political lines. All
 trade unions are democratically organized and managed and are
 independent of the Government. The majority of the SAK is
 closely associated with the-Social Democratic Party, which its
 unions helped to create. There is also a significant minority
 faction aligned with the Left Alliance, comprising various
 leftist groups and the old Communist party. The trade unions
 engage freely and actively in Nordic and international labor
 activities. The right to strike was exercised 455 times in
 1990, according to government statistics; 1991 statistics were
 not yet available.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively exists in law
 and practice and is exercised extensively.
 Finland is a highly organized society in which over 80 percent
 of both workers and employers are members of trade unions and
 employers' collective bargaining associations. With very few
 exceptions, collective agreements since 1968 have been based on
 incomes policy agreements between central employees' and
 employers' organizations and the State. The central agreement
 covers the general level of wage and salary increases, other
 terms of employment, and a "social policy package" which
 provides for vacation, holidays, sick pay, maternity and
 paternity leave, travel costs, taxes, and rents. Workers are
 effectively protected against antiunion discrimination, which
 is prohibited by law. Finland has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition-of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by the Constitution
 and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Sixteen-year-olds may work a full 8-hour day. Children between
 ages 14 and 16 may do "light" work for up to 6 hours a day, or
 36 hours a week, during school vacations only. Finland has
 compulsory education legislation, and child labor laws are
 effectively enforced by health and safety authorities.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no legislated national minimum wage, although all
 employers--including nonunionized employers--are required to
 meet the minimum wages agreed to in collective bargaining
 agreements in their industrial sector. These minimum wages are
 sufficient to provide a worker and his family a decent standard
 of living. The standard legal workweek must not exceed 40
 hours; in practice, most contracts call for a workweek of about
 37-38 hours.
 Finland's national occupational health and safety laws are both
 strict and comprehensive. They are effectively enforced by
 government inspectors and actively monitored by the unions.
