 EOUATORIAL GUINEA
 The present leadership of Equatorial Guinea took power in
 1979, establishing a military Government after overthrowing
 the tyrannical dictatorship of Francisco Macias Nguema, which
 had caused the murder or exile of one-third of the country's
 population. In 1982 the national Constitution was adopted,
 national and local assemblies were chosen, and the Government
 was officially declared to be civilian. The Government has
 been headed since the coup by President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo,
 who was reelected (as the sole candidate) in August 1989 for a
 7-year term. Obiang established in 1986 the country's sole
 legal political party, the Democratic Party of Equatorial
 Guinea (DPEG). The party, made up mostly of Fang tribe
 members from Rio Muni, the continental province of the
 country, controls the Government without viable opposition.
 Police and internal security forces are responsible for the
 preservation of public order. They are augmented by the 300-
 to 500-man presidential guard unit provided by Morocco. The
 majority of human rights abuses has historically been caused
 by the civilian police and internal security forces.
 Equatorial Guinea is one of the poorest nations in the world.
 Most of the population (an estimated 350,000, a figure
 rejected by the Government of Equatorial Guinea as too low)
 live by subsistence agriculture, fishing, and hunting, with
 per capita annual income approximately $300. The small wage
 economy, based on cocoa, lumber, and coffee, was devastated by
 the death or exodus of thousands of trained and educated
 citizens during the Macias years. Recent years have seen the
 emergence of a very small middle class. The country's recent
 inclusion in the West Africa franc currency zone has helped
 create greater fiscal integrity and an improved investment
 climate. Foreign aid is crucial to development, and
 Equatorial Guinea receives substantial assistance, with Spain,
 the previous colonial power, and France as the key donors. In
 1989 France, Spain, and the Soviet Union announced that they
 would forgive portions of the country's debts.
 Despite modest progress in the economic sphere and in human
 rights, political rights of all kinds, including speech and
 assembly, continued to be tightly restricted in Equatorial
 Guinea in 1989. Police brutality remained a significant
 problem, although reports of harsh treatment of illegal
 foreign workers declined. On occasion the President
 intervened personally to resolve cases involving human rights,
 most recently in October when senior police officers were
 convicted of using excessive force against detainees,
 including a World Bank contractor. The Government sought
 advice and technical assistance from Western countries on
 improving the prisons.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No such killings were reported in 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances in 1989.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In its public statements, the Government appeared to make a
 serious commitment to reduce the use of torture and other
 cruel treatment in 1989. However, harsh and abusive police
 interrogation and punishment methods continued in 1989,
 notably in two -well-documented cases of abuse. In February
 several Equatoguineans who had' broken into an expatriate's
 home were arrestbd and tortured by police for several days.
 When they gave the police the names of their accomplices, the
 latter were subsequently tortured also. The methods of
 physical torture used against these men included beatings,
 electric shock, and binding of limbs.
 In a second case in September, a British subject on contract
 with the World Bank accompanied several Equatoguinean friends
 to the police station when the latter were taken in for
 disorderly conduct. When he protested to the police about the
 four female companions being tied up and bludgeoned on the
 feet, the police commissioner had him tied up and severely
 beaten in the'same manner.  When the international community
 registered strong complaints, the Presidency apologized for
 the incident. In mid-October, after a public trial, the
 police officers responsible were convicted and sentenced to
 several months in prison to be followed by assignment to lower
 ranking positions. However, at the end of the year, one of
 the officers was not in prisoh but rather under house arrest.
 It was unclear whether the sentence had been carried out
 against'the other officer.
 In contrast to the past, there were few reports in 1989 of
 arbitrary police beatings of illegal Nigerian, Cameroonian, or
 Ghanaian workers.
 Prison conditions continue to be extremely harsh, with basic
 amenities unavailable. In 1989 the Government expressed an
 interest in improving jail conditions and in arranging
 training-for police personnel, and expressed willingness to
 invite international organizations to inspect prison
 conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Despite constitutional provisions, there was little
 enforcement of the rights of a person in detention to be
 charged or released within a certain period of time, to have
 access to a lawyer, or to be released on bail. Arbitrary
 arrests by security forces or police have been commonplace,
 often on spurious charges in order to extort money. Many
 detainees are held incommunicado.
 The number of political detainees beld at the end of 1989 was
 not known.
 In 1989 there were no known cases of persons being exiled for
 political reasons. There are a number of political exiles in
 Spain. In 1988 Jose Luis Jones Dougan, the leader of an
 opposition party in exile, returned and was arrested 2 months
 later. He was subsequently sentenced to a long prison term
 but apparently in December 1988 was released and permitted to
 return to Spain. According to Amnesty International's 1989
 Report, Dougan's efforts to gain recognition for his political
 party were apparently considered to constitute a form of
 treason. Another returned exile, Jose Primo Esono Mica, was
 
 
 106
 EOUATORIAL GUINEA
 arrested and convicted with Dougan in 1988. Esono Mica's
 30-year sentence was subsequently reduced to 15 years.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is a formal court structure, with the Supreme Court at
 the apex, and also military and customary (tribal) court
 systems. Tribal laws and customs are honored in the formal
 court system when not in conflict with national law. The
 tribunal provided for in the Constitution to decide
 constitutional issues has never been established. Under the
 Constitution, military tribunals hear all capital cases
 (civilian and military). The death penalty has not been
 carried out for several years. There is no separation between
 the executive and the judiciary, and Supreme Court justices
 serve at the pleasure of the President.
 There was no progress in 1989 in efforts to reform the legal
 system. The nation's mixture of traditional (tribal) law,
 military law, and Spanish rules and procedures combine to
 produce an inconsistent system of justice. There is no
 concept of due process, and appellate proceedings are
 nonexistent; the executive branch acts with little respect or
 understanding for judicial independence. Laws are frequently
 enacted by decree without any public announcement, excepting
 an occasional brief mention on government radio. Defendants
 who are unable to afford legal counsel stand little chance of
 acquittal. The fact that few lawyers (approximately 20) in
 the country depend on their connections to the Government
 raises questions about the impartiality of the defense their
 clients might receive. Unless represented by counsel, those
 arrested in Equatorial Guinea usually have no way of knowing
 if the offense they have been charged with is bona fide.
 The Government in 1989 continued to maintain that it holds no
 political prisoners. However, several persons, including
 Esono Mica, remained in prison at the end of 1989.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were fewer reports in 1989 of arbitrary interference
 with privacy, including pressures by authorities to join the
 sole political party and to participate in "spontaneous"
 government-sanctioned celebrations. Persons deemed suspicious
 are sometimes placed under surveillance, and there is a
 general belief that telephone conversations are monitored
 routinely, although correspondence remained sacrosanct.
 Search warrants are not normally used, even though they are
 required by the Constitution.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Open public criticism of the Government is not tolerated. In
 the past, the press has consisted-of sporadic government
 bulletins. In late 1989, the first regular printing of a
 newspaper was started, initiated by the Spanish Government.
 While criticism of the Government did not appear in the paper,
 it highlighted the need for a more open forum, one less
 focused on government statements.
 Both the television and radio stations are government
 entities, whose broadcasting is almost solely government
 
 
 107
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 propaganda. Nevertheless, entertainment programming,
 including relatively recent movies and American television
 shows dubbed in Spanish, appeared in 1989. There was
 discussion early in the year of the Government establishing a
 film censorship board to reduce the number of violent movies
 from the West being shown. Radio propaganda was somewhat
 reduced in 1989 to accommodate African and American pop
 music. The Government strictly controls the publication,
 importation, and distribution of articles critical of the
 Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Despite constitutional provisions guaranteeing these freedoms,
 the Government's firm position is that opposition political
 organizations and assemblies will not be tolerated. Private
 nonpolitical groups, such as professional organizations,'
 churches, and sports groups require government approval.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 With one'exception, freedom -of religion was generally
 respected. Jehovah's Witnesses, originally banned from the
 country in 1985, and harassed in 1986 and 1987, are still
 prohibited. Foreign clergy and missionaries continue to play
 an active role in educational development, and all
 denominations are allowed to participate in charitable as well
 as religious activities-. Christianity, mainly Catholicism, is
 the predominant religion. In general, active proselytizing by
 Protestant-denominations is discouraged, but conversions are
 permitted.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration,, and Repatriation
 There were no explicit restrictions on travel within the
 country. There are restrictions on travel abroad, including
 lengthy delays in obtaining passports. Many Equatoguineans
 leave the country without formal documentation for both
 economic and political reasons. A large number reside in
 Spain, France, Cameroon, and Gabon. While third-country
 African workers sometimes must resort to bribery to obtain
 legal registration, even the formerly enslaved Nigerians
 enjoyed virtual freedom to work add travel in 1989. With
 regard to repatriation, President Obiang in 1989 told the
 Equatoguinean expatriate community, many of whom had voiced
 fear of repression, that they were welcome to return to the
 country without any restrictions. Few returned in 1989 since
 they.enjoy a higher standard of living abroad than they would
 in Equatorial Guinea. Also, the treatment of several
 political exiles in 1988 underscored the Government's
 determination to prevent any political role for persons with
 views in opposition to the Government's (see Section l.d.).
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people of Equatorial Guinea do not have the right to'
 change their government by democratic means. President Obiang
 was reelected President in 1989 as the sole legal candidate.
 Cristino Seriche Bioko, a Bubi, has held the office of Prime
 Minister since 1982. Following the recent presidential
 elections, Seriche was given the responsibility for
 coordinating the administration of about half the government
 ministries. Only members of the DPEG may hold public office,
 
 
 108
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 and the party controls the selection of all candidates. It is
 uncertain whether all adults must pay party dues; in 1989 it
 appeared that only government employees and employees of large
 business establishments, i.e., those in the wage economy, must
 do so.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In 1989 the Government showed greater willingness to interact
 with international human rights organizations. The Government
 publicly expressed the need to end human rights abuses. As
 far as is known, the Government, after permitting an Amnesty
 International (AI) mission to visit in 1988, did not respond
 to AI's memorandum of November 1988 concerning unfair military
 trials.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although the law calls for equal treatment for all, tribal
 groups are not always granted the same rights and privileges.
 The Fang (lans, of which President Obiang is a member,
 dominate all aspects of government, the military, and social
 life. Discrimination against the Bubi, Fernandino, and
 Playero clans is consistent, whether in the granting of
 political office or the approval of academic scholarships.
 Women are confined largely to traditional roles, especially in
 agriculture. A large majority of the population is
 polygynous, and this has also contributed to the secondary
 status in society given to women. Educational opportunities
 are extremely limited for women. According to doctors in
 hospitals, violence against women is not widespread, and abuse
 of children is equally rare. The Government has not addressed
 violence as an issue; it looks to the Ministry for the
 Promotion of Women to advance the interests of women in
 Equatoguinean society. According to the medical community,
 female circumcision is not practiced in Equatorial Guinea.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association'
 Equatoguineans do not have the right of free association. In
 the small wage economy, no labor organizations exist, although
 there are a few cooperatives with limited power. Strikes are
 prohibited by law. Equatorial Guinea has been a member of the
 International Labor Organization since 1981 but has ratified
 neither Convention 87 on Freedom of Association nor Convention
 98 on the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Equatorial Guinea has no legislation regarding these rights,
 and there is no evidence of collective bargaining by any
 group. There are no export processing or free trade zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor and slavery are prohibited by law. During 1989
 no cases of forced or compulsory labor were reported. While
 work roundups used to be routinely organized against third-
 
 
 109
 EOUATORIAL GUINEA
 country Africans, forced labor of this type was restricted in
 1989.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age for employment is 16, but there is no
 enforcement of this law. As in most of Africa, children at a
 much earlier age assist families with traditional agricultural
 production and sales.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is only a small industrial sector in the country. Most
 salaried employment is provided by the Government,
 construction companies, businesses providing retail goods and
 services, and the plantation agricultural sector. In 1989
 Equatorial Guinea had a statutory minimum wage of
 approximately $35 per month, which was not adequate to provide
 a decent living for-a worker and family. The average monthly
 wage was.about $70 for the small percentage of the population
 that had regular'salaried employment, most of whom were
 required:to supplement this income with other-income or
 farming in order to provide a decent living-for themselves and
 their families. By law, working-conditions included a maximum
 48 hours workweek with a full day of rest each week plus
 regularly scheduled national holidays. Occupational-health
 and safety.standards do not exist. There was no effective
 monitoring of work hours or labor conditions-outside the
 Government.
