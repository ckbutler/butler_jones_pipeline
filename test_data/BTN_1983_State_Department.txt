 BHUTAN*
 Bhutan is a Buddhist kingdom of some 18,000 square miles,
 bordering India and China, with a population of around 1.4
 million. During the rule (1952-72) of King Jigme Dorji
 Wangchuck, Bhutan began to emerge from centuries of medieval
 seclusion and progressed towards a more representative
 political system. Although the King retained strong executive
 powers, he created several important institutions such as the
 National Assembly (1953), the Royal Advisory Council (1965),
 and the Council of Ministers (1968) to provide broader
 participation in the Government. Serfdom was abolished, land
 reform was introduced, codification of laws was begun, and the
 judiciary was separated from the executive. The present
 monarch, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, has continued Bhutan's social
 and political evolution. Bhutan maintains diplomatic relations
 with India, Bangladesh, and Nepal  (relations between Bhutan
 and Nepal, established in 1983, are handled by the two
 countries' New Delhi embassies), and is a member of the United
 Nations with U.N. representation in New York. While Bhutan is
 a sovereign and independent nation, under a 1949 treaty it has
 agreed to be guided in the conduct of its foreign affairs by
 India.
 There has been little apparent change in the human rights
 situation in Bhutan since 1982.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There was no evidence of killings or political violence in
 Bhutan during 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 There was no evidence of disappearances at the hands of
 Bhutanese officials or others during 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Representatives of the Dalai Lama have alleged in the past that
 some members of the Tibetan exile community in Bhutan have been
 subjected to arbitrary arrest and torture. There has been no
 independent verification of this allegation.
 There is no evidence of cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment
 or treatment. Bhutanese society, largely agrarian and
 traditional, is peaceful and enjoys a very low crime rate.
 Punishment for most crimes ranges from fines to imprisonment.
 Mutilation was outlawed in 1965.
 *Bhutan and the United States do not maintain formal diplomatic
 relations, and American officials rarely travel there.
 Information on Bhutanese practices in connection with human
 rights matters is, therefore, neither readily available nor
 complete.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no special or preventive detention in Bhutan, and
 arrests can be made only under legal authority.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Bhutan has no written constitution; instead, justice is
 administered under traditional law, which is in the process of
 codification and revision. Approximately 25 percent of
 Bhutan's population is of Nepalese origin. In ethnic Nepali
 areas, traditional Hindu law is administered. Buddhist norms
 are applied in other regions. While the country's legal system
 does not provide for juries or the right to be represented by
 legal counsel, trials are generally expeditious and public;
 qualified observers report that they conform to the local
 population's concept of impartiality and justice. A separate
 judiciary was established in 1968 which provides for local,
 district, and national courts with original and appellate
 jurisdiction. Final appeals may be made to the King.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There are no written guarantees for privacy in the Bhutanese
 system, but tradition has bolstered the concept. In practice,
 the Government does not intervene arbitrarily or unreasonably
 in the lives of the people.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a.       Freedom of Speech and Press
 The only publications currently produced in Bhutan are a weekly
 and a monthly government journal. India has agreed to assist
 Bhutan in constructing a radio transmitter for a national radio
 station. Indian and other foreign newspapers and publications
 are allowed free access. Criticism of the King, a hereditary
 monarch, is permitted in the National Assembly, but civil and
 political liberties are not guaranteed in a written
 constitution.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 No written guarantees of these freedoms exist, but Bhutanese
 generally enjoy the freedom of peaceful assembly and
 association.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although Buddhism is the state religion, members of other
 faiths, mainly Hindus of Nepali origin, enjoy freedom of
 worship.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Bhutan for Bhutanese
 citizens and no bar on emigration or foreign travel.
 Permanent residence for Nepalis and Indians in Bhutan (except
 those in government service) is restricted to the southern hill
 region. Bhutan traditionally has welcomed refugees and exiles
 from other countries in the region. Some 4,000 Tibetan
 refugees sought refuge in Bhutan after 1959, joining
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 78
 
 
 1224
 approximately 2,000 Tibetans already in the country.
 Because it perceived threats to national security resulting from
 the Tibetan refugees' lack of allegiance to Bhutan, the
 Bhutanese Government required in 1979-80 that the Tibetans
 either accept Bhutanese citizenship or face expulsion. When
 India and other countries initially refused to accept the
 Tibetans, Bhutan's policy raised the possibility of forcible
 repatriation. However, the Government decided not to carry out
 its threat. Of the approximately 4,500 Tibetans in Bhutan in
 1979, 1,000 accepted Bhutanese citizenship; 1,500 were settled
 in northern India; and the remainder stayed in Bhutan without
 obtaining citizenship. The Government of Bhutan has assured the
 Tibetans who accept citizenship that they will always be free to
 return to their homeland.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 There are no political parties in Bhutan, and- their formation
 appears to be discouraged. The 150-member National Assembly is
 made up of 100 members elected on a limited franchise (heads of
 family in Hindu areas, village headmen in Buddhist regions), 10
 elected by the organization of lamas (Buddhist leaders), two
 elected by the business community, and the remainder appointed
 by the King. Though the King's executive powers dominate in the
 Government, the Assembly enacts laws, approves senior
 appointments, and advises the King on matters of national
 importance. It also provides a forum for ventilating grievances
 and rectifying cases of maladministraton. The King cannot veto
 legislation passed by the National Assembly, although he can
 refer bills back to it for further consideration. Local
 administration is carried out by centrally appointed government
 officials. Villages, however, have the traditional right to
 elect their own headmen, who form the lowest rung of the
 administrative hierachy.
 Section 4 Government Attitudes Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 As far as is known, no international agency or group has either
 sought or been denied entry into Bhutan to investigate alleged
 violations of human rights. Amnesty International does not
 report on Bhutan; Freedom House calls the country "partly
 free." No non-governmental human rights groups are known to
 exist in Bhutan.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The vast majority of Bhutan's population is illiterate and
 rural, following traditional agricultural and pastoral pursuits
 in a largely barter economy. Virtually all families own enough
 land to feed and clothe themselves adequately by local
 standards. While poverty exists in remote areas, the
 destitution sometimes found in other parts of the subcontinent
 is absent in Bhutan. The Government has set land taxes low
 enough not to burden even small landholders. It has abolished
 the traditional and substantial payment in kind by local
 populaces to monastic organizations. Under successive five-year
 development plans begun in 1961, Bhutan has improved its
 agriculture, roads and freight ropeways, communications,
 education, and health.
 Although comprehensive economic and social statistics do not
 
 
 1225
 exist, World Bank and U. S. Agency for International Development
 figures give some indication of Bhutan's development over the
 last 20 years. Bhutan is one of the world's least developed
 nations, with an annual per capita income in 1980 of only $83
 and a ratio of calorie supply for consumption (relative to
 nutritional requirements) of 90.1 percent (in 1977). Life
 expectancy at birth has risen from 36 years (in 1960) to over 44
 years (in 1980). The infant mortality rate in 1983 stood at 127
 per 1,000 live births. Estimated net annual population increase
 fell slightly in 1983 to 2.2 percent (it was 2.3 percent in
 1980). Smallpox has been eradicated, and programs have been
 launched to control malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, and goiter.
 Bhutan receives some financial and technical assistance through
 the United Nations Development Program and the Colombo Plan.
 Primary education is free, and higher level students often
 receive free board and lodging. Although primary school
 enrollment quadrupled between 1960 and 1979, the ratio to the
 population at large was still only 11 percent in 1979, and boys
 tend to outnumber girls by about two to one. Adult literacy
 stood at only 5 percent in 1970.
 There are few social and economic indicators available to serve
 as a statistical basis for discussion of the status of women in
 Bhutanese society. Under Bhutanese law, no distinction is made
 between the status of men and women. The general impression
 given by the literature on Bhutan suggests that the society and
 economy are relatively egalitarian.
