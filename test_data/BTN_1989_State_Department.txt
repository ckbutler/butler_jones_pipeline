 BHUTAN*
 Bhutan has been ruled since 1907 by the Wangchuck dynasty of
 hereditary monarchs. Isolated in the Himalayas between India
 and Tibet, the small Kingdom (about the combined size of
 Vermont and New Hampshire, with a population of about 1.5
 million) has been able to escape external domination since the
 10th century. It was not until the rule of King Jigme Dorji
 Wangchuck (1952-72) that a Bhutanese ruler took steps to move
 the Kingdom from centuries of medieval seclusion toward a more
 representative political system and a better integrated, more
 productive economy. Although he retained strong executive
 powers, the King created several important institutions,
 including the National Assembly (1953), the Royal Advisory
 Council (1965), and the Council of Ministers (1968), to
 provide broader participation in the Government. The King,
 however, still plays the predominant role in decisionmaking.
 Serfdom was abolished, land reform introduced, laws codified,
 and the judiciary separated from the executive. There is no
 written constitution or bill of rights. The present monarch,
 Jigme Singye Wangchuck, has been in power since 1974 and has
 continued Bhutan's social and political evolution, although
 progress has been seriously handicapped by the Kingdom's
 limited administrative capacity and resources.
 Internal security is maintained by the Royal Bhutan Police.
 It is assisted by the Royal Bhutan Army, which consists of
 8,000 lightly armed men.
 Bhutan remains, at least in terms of national income
 statistics, the poorest country in South Asia, with a per
 capita income half that of its neighbor India; this figure is
 deceptive, however, since the largely rural population grows
 much of its own food. Bhutan remains one of the most
 traditional and least developed countries in the world. The
 large majority of the population is illiterate and rural,
 living on subsistence agriculture and pastoral pursuits in a
 largely barter economy. Economic growth takes second place to
 self-sufficiency in national policy objectives. Over the past
 several years, Bhutan has successfully reduced its almost
 total economic dependence on India. It continues to restrict
 access by the outside world in the hope of minimizing the
 spread of foreign influences. This has not been completely
 successful, however, as a large majority of the development
 labor is foreign. The number of tourists is strictly limited
 to 3,000 a year. The Bhutanese have closed Buddhist
 monasteries to tourism to maintain the "religious purity" of
 those shrines.
 Knowledgeable Bhutanese report no major violations of human
 rights in 1989. Although the Government is still essentially
 autocratic, most observers agree that Bhutan suffers few of
 the problems of disaffection and repression that afflict many
 third world countries undergoing more rapid change. The
 Government is concerned about the dangers of ethnic strife and
 has adopted policies that encourage ethnic integration.
 *Bhutan and the United States have not exchanged diplomatic
 representatives, and U.S. officials travel there
 infrequently. Since few scholars have published studies on
 the contemporary Bhutanese polity or society, information on
 Bhutanese practices which bear on human rights is neither
 readily available nor complete.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no known political or other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There was no evidence of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. Serious crimes are still rare,
 although reportedly there has been a trend toward more
 criminal activity in recent years with the growth of a foreign
 labor force in the country, widening economic disparities, and
 greater contact with foreign cultural values. Mutilation was
 outlawed in 1965.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no special or preventive detention, and arrests can
 be made only under legal authority. As far as is known, exile
 is not employed as a form of punishment.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Criminal cases and a variety of civil matters are adjudicated
 under an 18th century legal code revised in 1957. Familial
 questions are resolved according to the traditional religious
 norms of the two major religious groups in the country.
 Buddhist law governs the majority of Bhutanese, and Hindu law
 is applied in areas where persons of Nepali origin predominate.
 The Kingdom's legal system does not provide for juries, the
 right to be represented by legal counsel, or due process in
 the Western sense. However, trials are public and are usually
 carried out expeditiously. There are generally no prosecuting
 or defense attorneys because the number of lawyers in the
 country is insufficient to serve in these capacities. Judges,
 appointed by and accountable to the King, are responsible for
 all aspects of a case, including investigation, filing of
 charges, prosecution, and judgment of the defendant. A
 separate judiciary was established in 1968 which provides for
 local, district, and national courts with original and
 appellate jurisdiction. Final appeals may be made to the King.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There are no written guarantees of privacy, but tradition has
 bolstered the concept. In practice, the Government does not
 generally intervene arbitrarily or unreasonably in the lives
 of the people. Buttressing the nation's traditional culture,
 however, is a priority for the Government. In 1989, by royal
 decree, the wearing of national dress was made compulsory for
 all citizens in order to preserve and promote the Kingdom's
 unique identity. Bhutanese found violating the decree are
 
 
 1361
 BHUTANi
 fined $10 or sentenced to jail for a week. From all reports,
 the decree is not being rigorously enforced.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 With an adult literacy rate of around 12 percent, Bhutan's
 population is relatively unaffected by the print media. The
 Government's weekly newspaper is the country's only regular
 publication. Indian and other foreign newspapers and
 publications are distributed without apparent government
 control. Bhutan has no television. In 1989 the Government
 ordered the dismantling of all television antennas to prevent
 the people from watchinq foreign programs. The government
 radio station broadcasts for 3 hours daily in the four major
 national languages. Criticism of the King is permitted in the
 National Assembly but not in the public media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 While no written guarantees of these freedoms exist, Bhutanese
 generally enjoy the freedom of peaceful assembly and
 association. There are no private voluntary social, communal,
 or economic associations and no professional or trade
 organizations. For a discussion of freedom of association as
 it applies to labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Buddhism is the state religion of Bhutan. The Government
 subsidizes monasteries and shrines and provides aid to about
 half of the Kingdom's 12,000 monks. The monastic
 establishment enjoys statutory representation in the National
 Assembly and Royal Advisory Council and is an influential
 voice on public policy. Citizens of other faiths, who are
 mainly Hindus of Nepali origin, enjoy freedom of worship. In
 an effort to encourage national cultural integration, the King
 has declared major Hindu festivals to be national holidays,
 and the royal family participates in them. Foreign
 missionaries may live in Bhutan if they have some other
 functional capacity, but they are not permitted to proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Bhutan for all Bhutanese
 citizens and no bar on emigration or foreign travel. For many
 years, Bhutanese traveled little inside or outside the
 Kingdom, but the recent construction of roads and the
 establishment of air links with New Delhi,' Calcutta, Dhaka,
 Kathmandu, and Bangkok have encouraged travel. A policy
 introduced in the 1950's, which prohibited the exiled leaders
 of an outlawed Nepali-Bhutanese political party from returning
 to the country, has been liberalized to allow them to return.
 Since 1986, Bhutan has been conducting a drive to identify
 people without work permits. In this process, about 1,000
 foreigners have been expelled from the Kingdom, of which over
 900 were largely Nepalis with some Bangladeshis; 93 were
 Indians. The Indian press reported in 1989 that the number of
 establishments run by Indian nationals in Bhutan is gradually
 declining with the termination of their trading licenses.
 
 
 1362
 Bhutan traditionally has welcomed refugees and exiles from
 other countries in the region. Some 6,000 Tibetans sought
 refuge in Bhutan in 1959, joining approximately 4,000 Tibetans
 already in the country. Because it perceived threats to its
 national security from the Tibetan refugees' suspected lack of
 allegiance to Bhutan, the Government required in 1979-80 that
 they either accept Bhutanese citizenship or face expulsion. A
 considerable number sought refuge in India. Those Tibetans in
 Bhutan who accepted Bhutanese citizenship have been assured by
 the Government that they will be free to return to their
 homeland. The Government decided not to carry out its threat
 to deport those who did not apply for Bhutanese citizenship.
 It is government policy not to accept new refugees from Tibet,
 although a handful of refugees have come across the oorder
 since the imposition in March of martial law there.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The citizens of Bhutan do not have the right to change their
 government. Bhutan is a traditional monarchy, with sovereign
 power vested in the King. It is a highly elitist system, with
 decisionmaking centered in the palace and involving only a
 small number of officials in the civil and religious
 establishments. Although the present King and his father have
 endeavored to integrate women and southerners (Nepali ethnics)
 into the body politic, the system is still dominated by the
 male members of an aristocracy of Tibetan Buddhist ancestry.
 Political parties do not exist, and their formation is
 discouraged. Local administration is carried out by centrally
 appointed government officials. Villages, however, have the
 traditional right to elect by consensus their own headmen, who
 form the lowest rung of the administrative hierarchy. The
 Government is in the process of administrative decentralization
 as a means of bringing the administration of the country
 closer to the people and giving them a more direct role in
 governance. When the King is touring outlying districts of
 the Kingdom (which he does frequently), any citizen can flag
 down his car and present an aide with a written petition,
 which is assured an official response.
 The 150-member National Assembly is composed of 105 members
 elected by limited franchise (heads of family in Hindu areas,
 village headmen in Buddhist regions), 12 elected by the
 monastic establishment, and 33 high-level officials of the
 government administration appointed by the King. Its
 principal functions are to enact laws, approve senior
 appointments in the Government, and advise the King on matters
 of national importance.  It also provides a forum for
 presenting grievances and rectifying cases of
 maladministration. Voting is by secret ballot, with a simple
 majority needed to pass a measure.
 The King cannot formally veto legislation passed by the
 Assembly, but he can refer bills back to it for further
 consideration. The Assembly occasionally has rejected the
 King's recommendations or delayed their implementation, but
 the King-has-always had enough influence to persuade the
 Assembly to approve any legislation he considers essential or
 to withdraw any proposed legislation he opposes. Government
 officials may be questioned by the body, and ministers can be
 forced to resign by a two-thirds vote of no confidence.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international agency or group is known to have sought entry
 into Bhutan to investigate human rights conditions. No
 nongovernmental human rights groups are known to exist in
 Bhutan, nor do human rights appear to be a subject of domestic
 political debate.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 In contrast with some of its neighbors, Bhutan has not
 developed either a rigid caste system or customs which
 sequester or disenfranchise women. Boys tend to outnumber
 girls by about two to one in primary school, and seven to one
 at secondary level, but family land is divided equally between
 sons and daughters. Bhutanese traditionally place girls in a
 lower status than boys because of their lesser importance to
 the family economy. Girls receive poorer nutrition and lesser
 medical attention than boys. The disparity between the higher
 mortality rates of female versus male infants has resulted in
 an overall ratio in the population of 97.2 females per 100
 males, one of the lowest in the world.
 The sexes mix relatively freely, marriages can be arranged by
 partners themselves as well as by their parents, and divorce
 is common. A man is allowed by law to have three wives, but
 polyandry is not sanctioned. Legislation has been enacted in
 recent years making marriage registration compulsory and
 favoring women in matters of alimony. Although violence
 against women is known to occur, no information is available
 on its extent. In 1989 some 10 percent of the persons
 employed by the various government ministries and departments
 were women.
 Potentially the most divisive issue in Bhutan is.'how to
 accommodate the large (estimated at 20-30 percent) segment of
 the population of Nepali Hindu origin. The country's Buddhist
 majority has long been concerned about being outnumbered by
 immigrants from Nepal, as occurred in neighboring-Sikkim. In
 the past, the Government responded to this concern by tightly
 limiting immigration and restricting residence and employment
 of the Nepali population to the southern part of the country.
 More recently, the Government has liberalized its policy
 toward the Nepali minority. The Government now encourages
 intermarriage, educates some students in regions other than
 their own, and gives higher priority to economic development
 of the south. By law, southerners may own land and establish
 business in the north and vice versa, but reportedly it is
 sometimes still difficult for non-Buddhist Bhutanese (except
 government officials) to buy property in Buddhist areas.
 More and more young Bhutanese of Nepali origin are entering-
 public economic and administrative bodies, and laws concerning
 land tenure and taxation in the south are being liberalized.
 Although the language of instruction is English, there is a
 requirement that Dzongkha, the language of the western
 highlands, be taught in all schools, and this requirement is
 said to disadvantage students from other areas. In general,
 however, the Government appears to be sensitive to the
 problems of national integration and is attempting to
 eliminate the factors which, in the past, led some Nepali
 Bhutanese to describe themselves as second-class citizens.
 
 
 1364
 Families with ties to the palace and senior levels of the
 Government are strongly favored in their access to state
 scholarships for foreign education. Nevertheless, the King is
 making a serious effort to draw qualified persons from a
 broader range of social and ethnic backgrounds into the
 prestigious civil bureaucracy. Among the non-Drukpa (ruling
 elite) officials is the Minister of Trade, who is of Nepalese
 origin.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unionism is not permitted and Bhutan has no labor
 unions. Bhutan is not a member of the International Labor
 Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no collective bargaining nor legislation addressing
 labor-related issues pertaining to the small industrial work
 force, which makes up less than 1 percent of the population.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 As far as is known, there is no law prohibiting forced or
 compulsory labor but it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There are no laws governing the employment of children.
 However, children are not employed in industrial labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 As noted above, there is no legislation addressing labor
 issues. There is no legislated minimum wage, standard
 workweek, or health and safety standards. The shortage of
 labor in Bhutan is such that the larger industrial firms, all
 of which were established relatively recently, are organized
 along modern lines and incorporate a considerable amount of
 labor-saving technology. No industrial plant employs more
 than 60 to 70 workers, and most of these are guest workers
 from Nepal. Apart from a few larger plants, the entire
 industrial sector consists of home-based handicrafts and some
 60 privately owned, small or medium-scale factories producing
 consumer goods.
