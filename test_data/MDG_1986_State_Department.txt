 MADAGASCAR
 Madagascar is governed by a President, a National Popular
 Assembly, both elected by direct universal suffrage, and a
 Supreme Revolutionary Council chosen by both the President and
 the National Assembly. President Didier Ratsiraka has broad
 constitutional powers, and his position is further
 strengthened by the influential role played by his political
 party, AREMA, which holds an overwhelming majority in the
 National Popular Assembly. The President's role has evolved
 in recent years into that of a power broker among various
 competing interests. Elections are actively contested within
 the controlled political framework sanctioned by the
 Government. This framework permits political activity by only
 the seven parties making up the National Front for the Defense
 of the Revolution. However, the political orientation of the
 seven parties ranges from moderate and pro-Western to
 pro-Soviet. Vigorous debate in 1985-86 National Popular
 Assembly sessions, negative votes by opposition parties, and
 an unprecedented vote against a presidential proposal (to
 establish a national business school) provide evidence that
 the Assembly is becoming less of a "rubber stamp"
 organization. The President chairs the Supreme Revolutionary
 Council which is composed of political and regional leaders
 and representatives of the military forces. The Council
 approves basic policy and guidelines, convenes and adjourns
 the National Assembly, and passes laws when the Assembly is
 not sitting.
 The Malagasy internal security system is composed of the urban
 police force and the National Gendarmerie, which has
 jurisdiction in the provinces. On occasion, the National
 Peoples' Army has also been used for internal security
 purposes.
 The Malagasy Constitution adopted in 1975 made "socialism" the
 State's political philosophy. This led to the nationalization
 of a major portion of the economy. The private sector was
 reduced to a secondary, albeit still important, role. The
 economy subsequently deteriorated as production declined,
 foreign debt rose, and unemployment grew, especially among the
 youth (60 percent of the population is under age 25).
 However, in recent years the Government instituted economic
 reform measures, and agricultural production has increased.
 Fundamental liberties and individual rights are guaranteed by
 the Malagasy Constitution. However, several of these rights,
 such as freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, are
 restricted in practice. Rights such as the inviolability of
 the home and due process, may also be disregarded in cases
 involving state security. Fighting in recent years between
 paramilitary and vigilante youth groups has led to a number of
 deaths and considerable property destruction.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were recurring rumors of politically motivated
 killings. In May 1986, the Minister of Defense, his Secretary
 General, and the Director of the OMNIS (the military office of
 strategic industries), were killed in a plane crash along with
 eight other people. While there is no evidence that the plane
 
 
 175
 MADAGASCAR
 was sabotaged, the Government launched an official inquiry
 into the matter, the findings of which have yet to be
 published. Amnesty International in its 1986 Report (covering
 1985) called on the authorities to investigate the death of
 Father Sergio Sorgone, a Roman Catholic priest, who may have
 been killed for political reasons by members of the T.T.S., a
 paramilitary youth group which supports the Government, as
 well as the deaths of four other priests who may have been
 victims of political killings.
 In 1986 there was no further violence involving members of the
 T.T.S. and the "kung-fu" movement. In December 1984, street
 fights between kung-fu martial arts enthusiasts and
 government-sponsored youth groups escalated into a riot. When
 the victorious kung-fu groups then began to play a vigilante
 role in Antananarivo's poorer districts and began to represent
 a threat to the State, the Government responded in August 1985
 by attacking kung-fu headquarters. The kung-fu adherents
 responded with attacks on outlying gendarmerie posts and an
 army camp. In their suppression of the kung-fu threat, the
 military entered some homes without court orders and ransacked
 them, shot some suspects on sight, and arrested others without
 formal charges. The official count of 20 dead, 31 wounded,
 and 208 arrested compares with reports from credible sources
 of 50 people killed and 300 arrested.
 b. Disappearance
 Despite one press report, there were no confirmed cases of
 politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture, and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 While there were no documented cases of physical torture
 occurring in Madagascar, some organizations in the security
 apparatus have a reputation for ruthless methods, notably the
 state secret police. The kung-fu prisoners have allegedly
 suffered from very cruel treatment while in detention. There
 have also been credible reports of the alleged use of torture
 by the armed forces in the Government's campaign against
 outlaw bandits in Madagascar's southwest.
 Malagasy prisons are overcrowded and increasingly inhumane in
 terms of living conditions. A prison built to hold 500
 prisoners in Antananarivo is said to have 1,500 occupants.
 Some prisoners are not fed regularly, medical care is not
 provided, infections are commonplace, prisoners rarely have
 the opportunity to wash, and clothing is not provided. The
 death toll rises significantly among prisoners during the cold
 winter months.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In a normal criminal case, the accused must be charged or
 released within 3 days of arrest. Defendants in ordinary
 criminal/civil cases are generally charged formally within the
 specified time frame, and, upon being charged, are allowed to
 obtain a lawyer. Counsel is readily available, and
 court-appointed counsel is provided for indigents.
 Persons suspected of activity against the State may be legally
 detained incommunicado for 15 days, subject to indefinite
 extension if considered necessary by the Government. In the
 
 
 176
 MADAGASCAR
 past, certain defendants involved in coup-plotting cases were
 detained without being brought to trial for periods ranging
 from 20 months to over 5 years. Such extended periods of
 pretrial detention are exceptions and are usually limited to
 cases involving national security.
 At the end of 1986 there were 36 kung-fu members still being
 held in Arivonimamo prison with no trial planned or
 scheduled. One detainee is a woman.
 Forced labor is not practiced in Madagascar.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Malagasy Constitution provides for an independent
 judiciary and, in practice, the judiciary seems to function
 without outside influence from the executive.
 The judiciary has three levels of trial courts: lower courts
 for civil and criminal cases carrying limited fines and
 sentences, a Court of Appeals which includes a Criminal Court
 for cases bearing sentences of 5 years or more, and a Supreme
 Court. The judiciary also has a number of special courts
 designed to handle specific kinds of cases under the
 jurisdiction of the higher courts. A High Constitutional
 Court, with a totally separate and autonomous status, watches
 over the constitutionality of laws, decrees, and ordinances
 and ensures the legality of elections. A High Court of
 Justice, charged with prosecuting malfeasance in the
 government, is provided for in the Constitution but has never
 come into existence. A Military Court has jurisdiction over
 all cases involving national security.
 A trial date and court have not yet been announced for the
 36 kung fu adherents who remain in prison. The trial could
 take place in either the Military Court or the Criminal Court
 of the Court of Appeals.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The State does not generally intervene in nonpolitical aspects
 of the lives of the people. The home is inviolable under
 Malagasy law, and intrusions into an individual's residence,
 except in political or sensitive cases, must be made under the
 authority of a search warrant. Although government economic
 policies limit the choices open to an individual, the Malagasy
 may make their own decisions, without government coercion or
 interference, in such matters as changing jobs or residence,
 marriage, having children, and joining permitted political
 parties or social organizations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Private citizens have limited freedom to criticize government
 officials and policies without fear of arrest by the local
 authorities, but such criticism must be carefully worded.
 Direct criticism of the President or the "Socialist
 revolution" is not tolerated.
 Madagascar has one of the highest literacy rates in Africa,
 and Malagasy citizens attach great importance to the press.
 
 
 177
 MADAGASCAR
 What is printed in the newspaper often has an impact on the
 nation's policy-making apparatus. Critical examination of a
 range of policy issues such as economic management,
 transportation, and education can be found in the media.
 However, censorship is prescribed by the Government and
 executed by the Ministry of Interior. Copies of the daily
 newspapers are submitted to the censors prior to printing.
 When censorship is enforced, the newspapers leave blank those
 columns where the offending articles would have appeared.
 There is one government owned newspaper. The two major
 independently owned newspapers are Madagascar Matin and Midi
 Madagasikara. Several other dailies and weeklies are
 published by party groups and independent publishers,
 including the outspoken and candid Catholic newspaper, La
 Croix. The Government owns the radio and television stations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of assembly and association are restricted.
 Permits are required to hold public meetings and can be denied
 by the Government if officials believe that the meeting poses
 a threat to the State or endangers national unity. Persons
 and groups belonging to parties of the National Front are
 permitted to organize and assemble. Nevertheless, since
 political activity by groups outside the National Front is
 prohibited, dissenting political opinion is limited.
 Although the right to organize labor unions is recognized,
 unions do not play a major role either politically or
 economically. The labor force of 4.9 million is mostly
 agrarian, and union labor accounts for less than 5 percent of
 the total. Unions are permitted to strike and conduct
 substantive wage negotiations, but because of the depressed
 economy, strikes have been few, and trade unions have been
 relatively quiescent. Most unions are affiliated with
 National Front Parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government is secular and there is no official religion.
 There is no discrimination on the basis of religious
 affiliation, and persons are free to follow the faith of their
 choice. Missionaries and clergy are generally permitted to
 operate freely, and the Government has so far made no effort
 to restrain Christian churches which have become more active
 in criticizing government policies. Over half of the
 population is either Catholic or Protestant, with the
 remainder following traditional Malagasy religious beliefs or
 other faiths.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government has imposed no restriction on travel within the
 country. Official approval must be obtained for trips outside
 the country, but there has been only one known instance in
 which approval was denied due to the person's political
 views. Foreign travel is impeded by the difficulty in
 obtaining foreign currency. The Malagasy franc is not
 convertible abroad, and the Government limits the amount of
 hard currency that can be obtained for foreign travel. There
 is no refugee population in Madagascar.

 MADAGASCAR
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 The electorate's choice is constrained by the nature of the
 political system, since the only political parties allowed to
 operate in Madagascar are those which are members of the
 National Front. However, there exists a range of ideological
 and policy views among the seven Front parties, and within
 this spectrum there are viewpoints represented that are at
 odds with the policies of the administration. Thus, the
 electoral process does give the voters a chance to choose
 among candidates expressing differing views in local and
 regional elections, as well as in the National Assembly and
 presidential campaigns. The 137 members of the national
 Assembly are elected by universal suffrage for 5-year terms.
 The last election was in 1983. The electoral process,
 although not completely free from irregularities, has been
 essentially straightforward in recent elections. The
 political system in Madagascar also reflects a considerable
 degree of regional balance.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not cooperated with groups wishing to
 investigate alleged human rights violations and has denied
 visas to Amnesty International representatives. When the
 President's opponent in the 1982 election campaign called for
 supervision of the elections by Amnesty International, the
 President rejected the proposal as being in derogation of
 national sovereignty. In the absence of private human rights
 groups, the Christian churches in the country have taken the
 lead in advocating human rights. Although the Government is
 sensitive to criticism emanating from this quarter, it has not
 officially responded to questions or criticisms from the
 churches or any other group.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There appears to be no practice of institutional or systematic
 discrimination on the basis of ethnic grouping or sex in
 Madagascar. Although there are numerous indigenous ethnic
 groups, the society is relatively homogenous due to a common
 language and a tendency for disparate cultures to draw
 together in an island environment. However, ethnic Indian,
 Chinese, and French communities have experienced some
 resentment from the Malagasy mainly because of their success
 in commerce. These groups have occasionally been the target
 of local government policies favoring Malagasy nationals.
 Madagascar has what is essentially a matriarchal society, and
 a highly visible role for women has long been recognized as an
 integral part of the country's sociological framework. Women
 have a lengthy tradition of involvement in high-level
 political activity, and currently women are members of the
 Cabinet, the Supreme Revolutionary Council, and the National
 Assembly. Women are also very active and play major roles in
 the various political parties. Women have a prominent role in
 the business and economic life of the country, with many of
 them managing or owning business concerns or filling
 management positions in state industries. Education at all
 levels is open to women. However, women in rural areas and
 
 
 179
 MADAGASCAR
 among the poor face a greater degree of hardship. In addition
 to the responsibilities associated with child rearing and
 household management, economic necessity forces these women to
 engage in farm labor or other similar activities. These
 conditions stem more from socioeconomic factors than from a
 discriminatory bias against women in Malagasy society.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Malagasy Work Code and its enforcing legislation describe
 the working conditions required for employees. The Code
 describes a child as any person, regardless of sex, under the
 age of 18. The minimum age for employment is 14, but the use
 of child labor is prohibited in those areas where there is
 apparent and imminent danger. There is a 44-hour workweek in
 nonagricultural and service industries. There are also
 provisions for holiday pay, sick and maternity leave, and
 insurance. The Work Code has rules concerning building
 safety, machinery and moving engines, operational safety, and
 sanitation standards. It appears that in practice, the rules
 and regulations of the Code are adhered to by employers and
 are enforced by the authorities.
