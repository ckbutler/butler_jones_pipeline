 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Israel 1 is a parliamentary democracy with a multiparty system and free elections.
 There is no constitution; a series of "basic laws" provide for fundamental rights. The
 legislature, or Knesset, has the power to dissolve the Government and limit the au-
 thority of the executive branch. Likud Party leader Benyamin Netanyahu is Prime
 Minister and heads a center-right coalition government. The judiciary is legally
 independent but, in practice, it usually acquiesces with the Government's position
 in security cases.
 Since its founding in 1948, Israel has been in a state of war with most of its Arab
 neighbors. It concluded a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and with Jordan in 1994.
 1The human rights situation in the occupied territories is discussed in the annex appended
 to this report.

 As a result of the 1967 War, Israel occupied the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East
 Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. The international community does not recognize
 Israel's sovereignty over any part of the occupied territories. Throughout its exist-
 ence, Israel has experienced numerous terrorist attacks.
 An historic process of reconciliation between Israel and its neighbors began with
 the Madrid Conference in 1991 and continued with the September 1993 signing of
 the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles (DOP). In September 1995, Israel
 and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed the Interim Agreement on
 the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which provided for the election and establish-
 ment of a Palestinian self-governing authority, transfer of civil authority, Israeli re-
 deployment from major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank, security
 arrangements, and cooperation in a variety of areas. In January Israel and the PLO
 concluded the Hebron Agreement, which established security arrangements for the
 withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian-populated areas of Hebron, and set
 out a road map for mutual implementation of other Interim Agreement commit-
 ments. However, in March Israel began construction in the Har Homa/Jebel Abu
 Ghanaim neighborhood of east Jerusalem and on March 7 announced a minimal
 first-phase further redeployment of its forces from the occupied territories. At the
 same time the Palestinian Authority (PA) slackened security cooperation. A suicide
 bombing in Tel Aviv on March 21 was followed by two more in Jerusalem on July
 30 and September 4; 24 persons were killed and hundreds were injured. As a result
 of these developments, negotiations on Interim Agreement implementation issues
 were broken off between March and October, and the two parties had not agreed
 to resume final status talks at year's end.
 Internal security is the responsibility of the General Security Service (GSS)-
 (Shin Bet, or Shabak), which is under the authority of the Prime Minister's office.
 The police are under the authority of the Minister of Internal Security. The Israel
 Defense Forces (IDF) are under the authority of a civilian Minister of Defense. The
 IDF includes a significant portion of the adult population on active duty or reserve
 status and plays a role in maintaining internal security. The Foreign Affairs and
 Defense Committee in the Knesset reviews the activities of the IDF and the GSS.
 Members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 - Israel has an advanced industrial economy, and citizens enjoy a high standard of
 living, with a per capita income of $17,000. Unemployment among citizens rose to
 7.6 percent by mid-1997 but was substantially higher in the country's peripheral re-
 gions and among lower-skilled workers. Along with rapid economic growth in recent
 years, there has been a tendency toward increasing income inequality. The long-
 standing gap in levels of income between Jewish and non-Jewish citizens continues.
 Regional income disparities a ppear to be growing, with unemployment in some
 areas reaching more than double the national average. Israel's heavy reliance on
 foreign workers, principally from Asia and Eastern Europe, represents a growing
 economic and social issue. Such workers are generally employed in agriculture and
 the construction industry and constitute about 10 percent of the labor force. Since
 the implementation of an economic stabilization plan in 1985, Israel has moved
 gradually to reduce state intervention in the economy. The Netanyahu Government
 is committed to market-oriented structural reforms, especially deregulation and
 rapid privatization of the economy. In 1997 the Government successfully privatized
 Israel's largest bank and continued the process of privatizing and deregulating the
 telecommunications sector. Despite the Government's continued dominant role in
 the economy, individuals generally are free to invest in private interests and own
 property. The Government owns 78 percent of the country's land area, and as a mat-
 ter of policy it does not sell land. The Government, its entities, and the Jewish Na-
 tional Fund, (an organization established in 1897 for the purchase and management
 of land for the Jewish people) own 93 percent of the country's land area. As a matter
 of policy, the Government and its entities do not sell land. The Jewish National
 Fund has a statute prohibiting sale or lease of land to non-Jews (although excep-
 tions are sometimes made), foreigners are allowed freely to purchase or lease land
 in the remaining 7 percent of Israel.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, who enjoy a
 wide range of civil and other rights. Israel's main human rights problems have aris-
 en from its policies and practices in the occupied territories and from its fight
 against terrorism. The redeployment of the IDF from most major Palestinian popu-
 lation areas in the West Bank in December 1995, and its previous withdrawal from
 Gaza and Jericho, have significantly reduced the scope of these problems.
 Nonetheless, there continued to be problems in some areas. Security forces abused
 Palestinians suspected of security offenses. During the year, the High Court of Jus-
 tice heard 46 abuse-related cases (almost all asking for an injunction to halt the tor-
 ture of a specific individual). In no case did the High Court issue an injunction pro-
 
 
 1464
 
 hibiting the use of "moderat physica pressure." The Government continues to de-
 tain without charge numerous Palestinians. Detention and prison conditions, par-
 ticularly for Palestinian security detainees held in Israel, in some cases do not meet
 minimum international standards. However, new legiatition took effect in May that
 set tighter limits on the length and grounds for pretrial detention. During the year,
 discussion continued on proposed legislation to define the basis for and limits of
 GSS activities after a 1996 version was-widely criticized by human rights groups
 and legal exports because it authorized the Government to use force during interro-
 gation. and to issue secret guidelines defining the methods of interrogation. The re-
 vise& legislation, which had not been formally submitted to the. Knesst by year's
 end, omits this clause. Although there continues to be- no. explicit legal basis for the
 ,use of 'special- measures," i.e., force during interrogation, the Government justifies
 .such practices as -necessary in "special-cirumstances" when thought necessaiy to
 save lives in the fight against terrorism.
 The-Government responded to terrorist and security incidents. by periodically
 tightening existing restrictions on 'movement across borders with the West Bank
 and Gaza-and betweeaPalestinian Authority-controlled areas inside the West Bank,
 detaining hundreds of Palestinians without-charge and' demolishing the homes of
 some suspected terrorists and their families in he ccupiedbterrri ghtes.
 The Government took steps to address discrimination and violence against
 women, although the Attorney General's decision not to file charges against a
 Knesset        r      d of abusing his-wifew wfe asuwidelycriticized in the media by
 women's groups and human rights advocatinue espite  overnment pledges to elim-
 .nate the wide social and economic gap between Israel s Arab and Jewish citizens,
 there was little progress in thie direction: Israel's Arab minority continues to suffer
 from institutionalized discrimination and does not share fully in the rights granted
 to, and the obligations imposed on, Jewish citizens.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.--There were no reports of political
 killings by government forces. In September Israeli agents in Amman, Jordan failed
 in an attempt tokill the- political  director of the extremist group Illamas. One Pal-
 estinian was beaten to death while in government custody.
 Extremist alestinian groups carried out three suicide bombings in Tel Aviv and
 Jerusalem as part of a concerted effort to derail the. Israeli-Palestinian peace proc-
 ess. These-included a March 21 attack in a TeLAviv cafe that killed 3 persons and
 wounded 48, a July 30 attack in a crowded Jerusalem market that killed 16 persons
 'and wounded 178, and" a September 4 attack in a Jerusalem pedestrian mall that
 killed 5 persons and wounded 181.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although laws and administrative regulations prohibit the physical abuse of detain-
 ees, they are frequently not enforced in security cases. The GSS was responsible for
 the-widespread abuse of Palestinians suspectedof security offenses. The head of the
 GSS is empowered by government regulation to authorize security officers to use
 "moderate physical and psychological pressure" (which includes violent shaking)
 while interrogating detainees. These practices often led to excesses (for further -
 formation see Section 1.c. in the annex).
 Despite repeated challenges, the High Court of Justice has avoided ruling on the
 legality, of the practices of "shaking" and other forms of coercion. The Government
 claims that these practices are justified as "special measures" to be used in "special
 circumstances" in the fight against terrorism. During the year, the High Court of
 kustice heard 46 abuse-related cases (almost all asking for an injunction to halt the
 btrture of a specific individual). In addition, the High Court dropped numerous cases
 before beginning~formal hearings when the GSS announced that it no longer needed
 to use "special measures." Human rights groups believe that the great majority of
 cases alleged to involve torture do not reach the court. In some cases, the High
 Court of Justice issued injunctions prohibiting the use of certain forms forphysical
 pressure after hearing evidence presented in secret by the GSS and not made avail-
 able to defense attorneys; however, according to Israeli human rights advocates and
 legal exprts, it routinely lifted them at the reuest of the GSS. In no case did the
 High Court overrule a 0S5 decision to use "moderate physical pressure." According
 to 5l records released to his attorney, Ahma Abu Hamed, who was arrested on
 April 14, was hooded and shackled to a low chair in a painfully contorted position
 for almost 13 hours over a period of 31 days, inciuding 4 hours over 12 days after
 he confessed to membership in, and acting on behalf of, an illegal organization. Ac-
 
 
 1465
 
 cording to the same GSS records, Abu Hamed was subjected to "shaking" six sepa-
 rate times, including twice after his confession. In addition, Abu Hamed was de-
 prived of sleep for extended periods of time. His attorney appealed to the High
 Court on June 1 for an injunction to halt these methods of interrogation. On June
 2, the Court declined to hear the case after the GSS announced that it was no
 longer using force in the interrogation.
 Asam Halman was detained without charge on July 25, and his attorney was de-
 nied permission to meet with him until July 28. Halman alleged that during his in-
 terrogation he was hooded, shackled to a low chair in a painfully contorted position,
 and forced to listen to loud music for extended periods of time. He also alleged that
 he was allowed to sleep for less than 5 hours over a 4-day period, and that his hand-
 cuffs were overly tightened, causing great pain and an infected wound. On July 30,
 Halman's attorney asked the High Court of Justice for an injunction to prevent the
 GSS from using torture. On the same day, the attorney was informed that the GSS
 would stop using force in the interrogation. Halman was subsequently released
 without charge on August 21.
 Conditions vary in incarceration facilities in Israel and the occupied territories,
 which are administered by the Israeli Prison Service (IPS), the Israel Defense
 Forces (mDF), or the national police. IPS prisons, which generally house Israeli citi-
 zens convicted of common crimes, usually meet minimum international standards.
 Generally, IPS inmates are not subject to physical abuse by guards, food is ade-
 quate, and prisoners receive basic necessities. nmates receive mail, have television
 sets in their cells, and receive regular visits. Prisoners receive wages for prison work
 and benefits for good behavior. Many IPS prisons have drug treatment, educational,
 and recreational programs. The IPS has established an investigatory committee to
 look into charges of violence by guards against inmates.
 Since the closure in 1995 of the main IDF detention camps in the occupied terri-
 tories, all security detainees (i.e., those detained and held without charge by secu-
 rity forces) from the occupied territories who are held for more than a few days are
 transferred to facilities within Israel. Security detainees in 1997 were usually held
 in IDF camps in Israel, but also in IPS facilities and in special sections of police
 detention facilities. Prisoners incarcerated for security reasons are subject to a dif-
 ferent regimen, even in IPS facilities. They are often denied certainprivileges given
 to prisoners convicted on criminal charges. Security detainees include some minors.
 Detention camps administered by the IDF are limited to male Palestinian detainees
 and are guarded by armed soldiers. The total number of Palestinian prisoners and
 administrative detainees held by Israel, approximately 3,800 at the beginning of the
 year, fell to 3,565 by year's end. The number of administrative detainees (held with
 neither charge nor trial) varied between 293 and 573 during the year, and stood at
 382 at year's end. Some of these detainees have been held for periods exceeding 2
 years.
 Conditions in IDF detention camps have been criticized repeatedly over the years.
 Conditions at the Russian Compound in Jerusalem (which houses a combination of
 security and common-law prisoners and detainees) were criticized as "not fit to serve
 as lock-up" by the High Court of Justice President Aharon Barak after an August
 visit to the facility. Conditions in other IDF facilities improved in some respects,
 with inmates given more time for exercise outside their cells. Nevertheless, rec-
 reational facilities remain minimal, and there are strict limitations on family visits
 to detainees. Visits were prevented for long periods during closures of the borders
 with Gaza and the West Bank.
 Conditions at some national police detention facilities can fall below minimum
 international standards. Such facilities are intended to hold criminal detainees prior
 to trial but often become de facto prisons. Those held include some security detain-
 ees and some persons who have been convicted and sentenced. Inmates in the na-
 tional police detention facilities are often not accorded the same rights as prisoners
 in the IPS. Moreover, conditions are worse in the separate facilities for security de-
 tainees maintained both in police facilities and in IPS prisons.
 In 1996 the Government began a reform program for the country's detention fa-
 cilities. Thus far, improvements in prison conditions have been limited in scope, and
 dilapidation and overcrowding (the latter aggravated by the closure of IDF detention
 facilities in the occupied territories in 1995) are still problems. New legislation that
 took effect during the year provided for: The right to live in conditions that would
 not harm the health or dignity of the detainee; access to adequate health care; the
 right to a bed for each detainee; and access to exercise and fresh air on a daily
 basis. While the legislation is a positive step, authorities expect implementation to
 require time and additional resources; there was little immediate improvement in
 1997.
 
 
 1466
 Children's rights groups have expressed particular concern over the separate sec-
 tions of holding facilities set aside for the detention of children. Overcrowding, poor
 physical conditions, lack of social workers, and denial of visits by parents are among
 the key problems. In addition to'some Israeli minors held in criminal cases, there
 are juveniles among Palestinian detainees. Children's rights activists have rec-
 ommended the construction of a separate detention facility for children.
 All incarceration facilities are monitored by various branches of the Government,
 bymembers of the Knesset, and by the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (IRC) and other human rights groups. While monitoring is judged to be effective
 overall, in some instances human rights groups and diplomatic officials were denied
 timely access to specific detainees, usually Palestinians held without charge or trial
 for alleged security offenses (see Section 1.d. of the annex).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest of citi-
 zens, and the Government generally observes this prohibition. Defendants are con-
 sidered innocent until proven guilty and have the right to writs of habeus corpus
 and other procedural safeguards. However, a 1979 law permits detention without
 charge or trial, which is used in security cases. The Minister of Defense may issue
 a detention order for a maximum of 1 year. Within 24 hours of issuance, detainees
 must appear before a district judge who may confirm, shorten, or overturn the
 order. If the order is confirmed, an automatic review takes place after 3 months.
 Detention orders were confirmed in all cases during the year. Detainees have the
 right to be represented by counsel and to appeal detention orders to the High Court
 of JusticeD however, the security forces may delay notification of counsel with the
 consent of a judge. According to human rights groups and legal exprts, there were
 cases in which a judge denied the Government the right to delaynotification of
 counsel. At detention hearings, the security forces may withhold evidence from de-
 fense lawyers on security grounds. The Government may also seek to renew admn-
 istrative detention orders: However, the security servies must tshowtcause" for on-
 tinued detention, and, in some instances, individuals were released because the
 standard could not be met.
 In felony cases, a districtcourt judge may postpone for 48 hours the notification
 of arrest to the detainee's attorney. The postponement may be extended to 7 days
 by the Minister of Defense onnational security grounds or by the police inspctor
 general to conduct an investigation. Moreover, a judge may postpone notification f r
 up to 15 days in national security cases.
 New legislation took effect in 1997, defining more narrowly the grounds for pre-
 trial detention and reducing to 24 hours the length of time a person may be held
 without charge. Children's rights activists have recommended separate legislation to
 -define when and how a child may- be arrested and how long children may be de-
 tained.
 Most of the protections afforded by law are not extended to Palestinian. detainees,
 who. fall underthe-jurisdiction of military law even- if they are detained in Israel.
 -With IDF redeployment on the West Bank, -detention centers there were closed in
 1995. As a result, all Palestinian detainees held for longer than 1 or 2 days are in-
 carcerated in Israel (see Section 1.d. Of the. annex).
 The Government detains 80 non-Palestinian Arabs. This total is a- mixture of com-
 mon prisoners, administrative detainees, and security, detainees. The Government
 continues to deny ICRC access to two Lebanese citizens,. Sheikh Mustafa-Dirani
 (held without charge since 1994) and Sheikh Obeid (held without charge -since
 1989). These two cases appear linked to government efforts to obtain information
 on Israeli military personnel believed to be prisoners of war or missing in Lebanon.
 In addition, the Government detains 19 other Lebanese citizens without charge, in-
 cluding. 11 -who have completed- prison sentences of up to 10 years but are still being
 held without charge.
 The law prohibits forced exile of citizens, and there is no indication that the Gov-
 ernment engaged in such practices.
 . e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law.,provides for an independent judiciary,
 and the Government respects this provision in practice. In practice, however, the ju-
 diciary usually acquiesces to the Government's position in security cases. The judici-
 ary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 The judicial- system is omposed of civil, military, religious, labor relations, and
 administrative courts, with the High Court of Justice (Supreme Court) at the apex.
 The High Court of Justice is an appellate court. Each of the cited courts, including
 the High Court of Justice, have appellate courts or jurisdictions.
 The law provides for the right to a hearing with representation by counsel, and
 authorities observe this right in practice. A planned regional and national system
 of public defenders operated by the Ministry of Justice was inaugurated in 1996
 
 
 1467
 
 with the opening of a Tel Aviv office, although that office has suffered serious budg-
 et shortages.
 All nonsecurity trials are public except those in which the interests of the parties
 are deemed best served by privacy. Cases involving national securit may be tried
 in either military or civil courts and may be partly or wholly closedto the public.
 The Attorney General determines the venue in such cases. The prosecution must
 justify closing the proceedings to the public. Adult defendants have the right to be
 represented by counsel even in closed proceedings but may be denied access to some
 evidence on security grounds. Convictions may not be based on any evidence denied
 to the defense. Nevertheless, in the 1995 case of Mohammed Salah, he was denied
 access to some evidence, but it is not clear that he was convicted on the basis of
 that evidence.
 The legal system often hands out far stiffer punishments to non-Jewish persons
 than to Jewish citizens. For example, human nghts advocates claim that Palestin-
 ians and Arab Israelis convicted of murder usually receive life sentences, while Jew-
 ish Israelis often receive significantly shorter sentences. To the extent that Palestn-
 ians are tried in Israeli courts, they receive harsher punishments than Jewish Isre-
 lis. Noam Freidman, a Jewish extremist who lightly wounded six Palestinians after
 opening fire in a crowded Hebron market on January 1, had charges against him
 dropped after a military court ruled that he was not mentally fit to stand trial. This
 ruling was reached despite a decision by a psychiatric board that he was mentally
 competent to stand trial. On February 11, Israel released 30 Palestinian women
 prisoners, 5 of whom were serving sentences for murder or for being an accomplice
 to murder, as part of the accord on Hebron redeployment. On October 1, Sheikh
 Ahmed Yassin, founder of the HAMAS movement, was released by Israel from a
 maximum security prison and flown to Jordan.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-A1-
 though privacy of the individual and the home are generally protected by law, au-
 thorities sometimes interfere with mail and monitor telephone conversations. In
 criminal cases, the law permits wiretapping under court order; in security cases, the
 order must be issued by the Ministry of Defense. Under emergency regulations, au-
 thorities may open and destroy mail on security grounds (see Section 1.f. of the
 Annex).
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Israeli forces and the Israeli-sponsored South Lebanese Army (SLA) and
 Hizballah (and to a lesser extent the Lebanese army) engaged in a recurring cycle
 of violence in southern Lebanon. Hizballah attacked SLA forces and Israeli troops
 deployed on Lebanese soil. Hizballah (and possibly armed Palestinian groups) also
 launched rocket attacks against northern Israel. Israeli forces conducted repeated
 air strikes and artillery barrages on Hizballah, Lebanese army, and Palestinian po-
 sitions inside Lebanon.
 An undetermined number of Lebanese civilians were killed in south Lebanon;
 however, the total was lower than in 1996, primarily due to the April 26, 1996 un-
 derstanding between Israel and Lebanon, which commit the two sides to end the
 targeting of civilians or the launching of attacks from civilian-pepulated areas.
 Politically motivated killings continued as Palestinian extremists sought to dis-
 rupt the Israel-Palestinian peace process. On March 21 a suicide bomber killed 3
 Israelis and wounded 48 in an attack on a Tel Aviv cafe. On July 30, two suicide
 bombers killed 16 persons and wounded 178 in an attack on a Jerusalem market.
 On September 4, 3 suicide bombers killed 5 persons and wounded 181 in an attack
 on a Jerusalem pedestrian shopping mall (see Section 1.g. of the Annex).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of the press, and
 the Government generally respects this right in practice. The law authorizes the
 Government to censor any material reported from Israel or the occupied territories
 regarded as sensitive on national security grounds. A new censorship agreement
 signed in 1996 between the Government and media representatives continues the
 trend to broaden liberalization of Israel's censorship regime. The agreement pro-
 vides that military censorship is to be applied only in cases involving national secu-
 rity issues that have a near certainty of harming Israel's defense interests, and it
 now applies to all media organizations in Israel, including local and Arabic-language
 newspapers. All media organizations can appeal the censor's decision to the High
 Court of Justice. Moreover, a new clause abolishes the right of the censor to shut
 down a newspaper for a censorship violation and eliminates the ability of the office
 of the censor to appeal a decision against it. News printed or broadcast abroad may
 
 
 1468
 be reported without censorship, which permits the Israeli media to run censored sto-
 ries by attributing them to foreign sources.
 Emergency regulations prohibit anyone from expressing support for illegal organi-
 zations. On occasion in the past, the Government has prosecuted persons for speak-
 ing or writing on behalf of terrorist groups. No such cases were filed in 1997.
 -Individuals, organizations, the press, and the electronic media freely debate public
 -issues and criticize government officials and policies.In October the High Court of
 Justice upheld the conviction for sedition of two members of the extremist- Jewish
 Zo Artsenu movement. For the most part, however, the Attorney General, while con-
 demning hate speech, has concluded that such speech cannot be prosecuted.
 All newspapers are privately owned and managed. Newspaper licenses are valid
 only for Israel; separate licenses are reuired to distribute publications in areas in
 the occupied territories still under Israel s authority.
 Directed by a government appointee, the quasi-indepndent Israel Broadcast Au-
 thority (IRA) controls television Channel 1 and Kol Israel radio, both major sources
 of news and information. Six cable companies operate under franchises granted by
 - government councils. oPrivately-owned Channel 2 Television, the first commercial
 .television channel, is operatedby three franchise companies. There are 13 private
 - radio outlets'. The Second.Television and Radio Authority, a public body, supervises
 -both Channel 2 and-the regional radio-stations.
 The Government respects-academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the right
 of assembly, and the Government.generally respects this provision in practice.
 The law provides for the right of association,, and the Government generally re-
 spects this provision in practice. After the Hebron massacre in 1994, the Cabinet
 invoked the 1948 Ordinance for the Prevention of Terror -to ban-the ultranationalist
 Kach and Kahane Chai organizations, a ban that remains in effect. The decision
 stipulates imprisonment for anyone belonging to, or expressing support for, either
 organization.
 . c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for freedom ofreligion, and the Govern-
 nent generally respects this right. Approximately 81 percent of citizens are Jewish.
 Muslims, Christians, Druze, and members of other- religions make up the. remaining
 -19-percent..Each-recognized religious community has legal authority over its mem-
 bers in matters of marriage and divorce. Secular courts have primacy overquestions
 of inheritance,- but parties, -by mutual agreement, may bring cases to religious
 courts. Jewish and Druze families may ask--forsome family status matters, such as
 alimony and child custody in divorces, to be -adjudicated in civil courts as an alter-
 native to religious courts. Christians may only ask that child custody and child sup-
 port be adjudicated in civil courts, while Muslims have no recourse to civil courts.
 Legislation passed in 1996 allows the rabbinical courts to sanction either party who
 is not willing to grant a divorce.
 Many citizens object to the Orthodox Jewish religious authorities' exclusive con-
 trol over marriage, divorce, and burial, whether Jews are Orthodox or not. These
 authorities do not recognize marriages or conversions to Judaism performed in Is-
 rael -by Conservative or Reform rabbis. These issues have been a -source of sharp
 division within.society, particularly in recent years, as thousands of Jewish immi-
 -grants from the former Soviet Union have brought with them family members not
 recognized as Jewish by Orthodox authorities.
 A~arge number of Jews who wish to be married in secular or non-Orthodox reli-
 gious ceremonies do so abroad.,The Ministry of Interior recognizes such marriages.
 The Government provides greater financial support to institutions in the Jewish
 sector to those in the non-Jewish sector, i.e., Muslim, Christian, and Druze. For ex-
 ample, only 2 percent of the Ministry of Religious Affairs budget goes to the non-
 Jewish sector, despite the fact that Muslims, Christians, and Druze constitute 19
 percent of the population. The High Court of Justice heard a case in February alleg-
 ing that this constitutes discrimination. The Court refused to rule on the case m
 1997 and suggested that the petitioners refile the case after the passage of the 1998
 -budget, which the petitioners ave done.
 Missionaries are allowed to proselytize, although Mormons are specifically prohib-
 ited from doing so by mutual agreement between the Church of Jesus Christ of the
 Latter-Day Saints and the Government. A 1977 anti-proselytizing law prohibits any-
 one from offering or receiving material benefits as an inducement to conversion, but
 the law has not been applied for several years. A bill that would impose even more
 stringent restrictions on proselytizing, including banning the distribution of written
 materials encouraging conversions, was presented to the Knesset in 1997 but was
 not expected to be approved.
 Jehovah's Witnesses have suffered both threats and attacks, apparently by ultra-
 Orthodox groups. Jehovah's Witnesses complain that despite police investigations,
 
 
 1469
 no perpetrators have been prosecuted. A March 8 attack on a Jehovah's Witnesses
 meetinghouse in Lod caused extensive property damage.
 The Government has recognized only Jewish holy places under the 1967 Protec-
 tion of Holy Sites law, therefore denying government funding for the preservation
 and protection of Christian, Druze, Muslim, Baha'i, and other religious sites. A Jan-
 uary challenge to this practice led the Ministry of Religious Affairs to agree to con-
 sider funding requests for non-Jewish sites.
 A 1995 High Court of Justice ruling allows small numbers of Jews under police
 escort to pray on the Temple Mount, which is the site of two Muslim holy places
 and also the location of the First and Second Jewish Temples.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice for citizens, except with regard to military or security zones or in in-
 stances where citizens may be confined by administrative order to their neighbor-
 hoods or villages. In 1996 rabbinical courts asserting jurisdiction over divorce cases
 refused at least two visiting U.S. citizens permission to depart the country until
 their cases were tried. While both men managed to depart Israel, their cases remain
 open (see Section 5). The Government continued to restrict the movements of two
 Jewish settlers living in the occupied territories who belonged to extremist Kach or
 Kahane Chai groups, through the use of administrative orders issued by the IDF
 central command (see Section 2.d. of the Annex). The Government prevented an ad-
 ditional three members of a Jewish ultranationalist organization from entering the
 occupied territories.
 Citizens are free to travel abroad and to emigrate, provided they have no out-
 standing military obligations and are not restricted by administrative order. In 1997
 the Government again permitted Muslim citizens over 30 years of age to perform
 the religious pilgrimage to Mecca, but it denied permission to Muslim citizens under
 30 years of years of age on security grounds. The Government asserts that travel
 to Saudi Arabia, which is still in a state of war with Israel, is a privilege and not
 a rit.
 The Government welcomes Jewish immigrants, their families, and Jewish refu-
 gees, on whom it confers automatic citizenship and residence rights under the Law
 of Return. This law does not apply to non-Jews or to persons of Jewish descent who
 have converted to another faith. Other than the Law of Return, which applies only
 to Jews, and the family reunification statutes, which mainly apply to Arabs who fled
 Israel in 1948-49, Israel has no immigration law that provides for immigration to
 Israel, or for p.litical asylum. The law does allow individuals to live in Israel as
 permanent residents.
 The issue of first asylum did not arise in 1997. The Government cooperates with
 the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humani-
 tarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The law provides citizens with the right to change peacefully their government,
 and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections
 held on the basis of universal suffrage for adult citizens. The last national elections
 were held in May 1996, when voters elected the Prime Minister by direct ballot for
 the first time.
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy, with an active multiparty system in which
 a wide range of political views are represented. Relatively small parties, including
 those whose primary support is among Israeli Arabs, regularly win seats in the
 Knesset. Elections are by secret ballot.
 While there are no legal impediments to the participation of women and minori-
 ties in government, they are underrepresented. Women hold 9 of 120 Knesset seats,
 compared with 11 female members in the previous Knesset. There are 11 Arab and
 1 Druze in the new Knesset, compared with 7 and 2 prior to the May 1996 election;
 most represent parties deriving their support largely or entirely from the Arab com-
 munity. Of the Knesset's 12 committees, 2 (including the Committee on the Status
 of Women) are chaired by a woman, and another is chaired by the Druze member
 of the legislature. There is one woman in the Cabinet, and no Arab or Druze min-
 isters or deputy ministers. Three women, but no Arab or Druze citizens, serve on
 the 14-member High Court of Justice.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 
 
 1470
 cials generally cooperate with investigations. However, the Government withheld its
 cooperation from the U.N. Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affect-
 ing the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied
 Territories. The-Special Committee reported in October that the Government did not
 respond to its communications. In 1996 Human Rights Watch activist. Bashar
 Tarabieh was detained, held without charge, physically abused, and then released
 without charge.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, or marital status. The law
 also prohibits discrimination by both government and nongovernmental entities on
 the basis of rae, religion, political beliefs, and age.- Local human rights groups are
 concerned that resources for implementing those laws, or mechanisms for their en-
 forcement, are sometimes lacking.
 Women.-There continued to be action, bth in and out of government, to deal
 with the issue of violence against women in Jewish and Arab communities. The
 Government has allocated funds for a special campaign to combat such violence.
 Groups that focus on domestic violence include a committee established by the Min-
 istry of Labor and Social Affairs that includes Jewish and Arab nongovernmental
 organizations (NGO's) as well as government representatives, and a coalition of
 human rights organizations. Approximately 23 women were killed by their hus-
 bands or other male relatives during the year. Women's organizations protested an
 October decision by the Attorney General not to press charges against a Knesset
 member accused of abusing his wife. According to the most recent estimates, some
 200,000 women suffer from domestic violence each year, and some 7 percent of these
 are abused on a regular basis.
 Arab human rights advocates also have formed a coalition to raise public aware-
 ness of so-called family honor killings, a term commonly used for the murder of a
 female by a male relative for alleged misconduct. At least 9 of the 23 women killed
 in 1997 were killed in family honor cases.
 The Government supports 10 shelters for battered women, including 1 exclusively
 for Arab women and 1 for both Arab and Jewish women. Women's rights advocates
 consider this number inadequate.
 According to the 1991 Domestic Violence law, a district or magistrate court may
 prohibit access by violent family members to their property. Women's groups cooper-
 ate with legal and social service institutions to provide women's rights education.
 While sentences handed down to men convicted of rape have increased in recent
 years, women's rights activists argue that the penalties are not sufficiently harsh.
 Civil rights groups also expressed concern about an increased incidence of phys-
 ical attacks by Jewish religious extremists, particularly in Jerusalem, against
 women whom they consider to be immodestly dressed in public.
 Women's advocacy groups report that women routinely receive lower wages for
 comparable work, are promoted less often, and have fewer career opportunities than
 their male counterparts. In 1996 the Equal Pay Law, which required employers to
 pay male and female workers equal wages for equal work, was replaced by new leg-
 islation that redefines compensation to include important side benefits, and allows
 for class action suits. An amendment to the-social security law allowed housewives
 some access to the nation's social security pension system.
 Legislation in 1993, reinforced by a 1994 ruling of the High Court of Justice, has
 increased the percentage of women on the boards of two-thirds of government-owned
 companies. However, their numbers remain low overall. One study reported that in
 1996 women made up more than 30 percent of the boards in only 39 of 118 govern-
 ment-owned companies.
 The adjudication of personal status law in the areas of.marriage and divorce is
 left to religious courts, where Jewish and Muslim-women are subject to restrictive
 interpretations of their rights (see Section 2.c.). Legislation passed in 1995 broad-
 ened the civil sanctions made available to rabbinical courts in cases where a wife
 has ample grounds for divorce-such as abuse-but the husband refuses to agree.
 In some cases, however, rabbinical courts have failed to invoke these sanctions. In
 some cases where a wife has failed to agree, a husband has been allowed to re-
 marry; this permission is not given to wives. Such imbalances have been used by
 husbands to extort concessions from their wives in return for agreeing to divorce.
 Rabbinical courts may exercise jurisdiction over non-Israeli persons present in Is-
 rael. In two cases during the year, U.S. citizens were barred legally from leaving
 Israel as a result of divorce proceedings. Although both men managed to depart the
 country, their cases remain open.
 
 
 1471
 Religious law can be even more restrictive for Muslims: Some Islamic law courts
 have held that Muslim women may not request a divorce, but that women may be
 forced to consent if a divorce is granted to a man.
 Jewish women are subject to the military draft but have been barred from combat
 positions. In response to a High Court of Justice ruling, the Israeli Air Force since
 1996 has permitted women to enter pilot training. This would qualify them for com-
 bat aviation positions, though none has completed the training successfully to date.
 Children.-The Government is committed to the rights and welfare of children.
 However, resources are sometimes insufficient to put that commitment into practice,
 particularly for low-income families. Education is compulsory to the age of 15, or
 until the child reaches the 10th grade, whichever comes first. Government min-
 istries, children's rights groups, and members of the legislature often cooperate on
 children's rights issues. The Government provides an extensive health care program
 for children. There is a broad network of mother and child clinics, which provide
 prenatal care as well as postnatal follow-up.
 The Government has legislated against sexual, physical, and psychological abuse
 of children and has mandated comprehensive reporting requirements. Although
 there has been a sharp increase in reported cases of child abuse in recent years,
 activists believe that this is largely due to increased awareness of the issue rather
 than a growing pattern of abuse. There are now five shelters for children at risk.
 The Ministry of Justice formed a committee with police and NGO representatives
 that is attempting to assess the scope of child prostitution. Children's rights activ-
 ists estimate that there may be several hundred prostitutes among the nation's chil-
 dren, and they warn that the phenomenon is unlikely to be eradicated until the so-
 cial problems that give rise to it-including child abuse and schools that give up
 too readily on dropouts-are addressed.
 NGO's in the field of children's welfare concentrate their efforts on public edu-
 cation, on promoting the concept of children's rights as citizens, on improving legal
 representation for minors, and on combating the problems of poverty, which are
 most notable for the Bedouin children of the south. There has been concern about
 the children of the country's growing population of foreign workers, many of them
 in the country illegally. Children of such families, believed to number in the thou-
 sands, exist in a legal and social limbo, without access to schools or adequate health
 services.
 Privately funded children's rights information centers have been established in
 some communities, and the Government assists in funding additional centers in
 other cities.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government provides a range of benefits, including
 income maintenance, housing subsidies, and transportation support for disabled per-
 sons, who comprise about 10 percent of the population. Existing antidiscrimination
 laws do not prohibit discrimination based on disability, and these citizens continue
 to encounter difficulties in areas such as employment and housing. A law requiring
 access for the disabled to public buildings is not widely enforced. There is no law
 providing for access to public transportation for people with disabilities. A 1996 law
 extended disability assistance for deaf children from the age of 14 to maturity.
 Religious Minorities.-Tensions between secular and religious elements of Israeli
 society grew in 1997. The non-Orthodox Jewish community in particular has com-
 plained of discrimination and intolerance. A kindergarten operated by the Reform
 community in Mevasseret Ziyyon was firebombed in August. A police investigation
 has not uncovered any suspects.
 In June Jewish militant Tatyana Suskin put up posters in Hebron that depicted
 the Prophet Mohammed as a pig, triggering riots by Arab residents of the city. On
 December 30, a Jerusalem court convicted Suskin of committing an act of racism
 and trying to offend religious feelings. She was sentenced to 2 years in prison.
 In civic areas where religion is a determining criterion, such as the religious
 courts and centers of education, non-Jewish institutions routinely receive less state
 support than their Jewish counterparts. The status of a number of Christian organi-
 zations with representation in Israel has heretofore been defined by a collection of
 ad hoc arrangements with various government agencies. Several of these organiza-
 tions seek to negotiate with the Government in an attempt to formalize their status.
 National fRacial lEthnic Minorities.-The Government does not provide Israeli
 Arabs, who constitute 19 percent of the population, with the same quality of edu-
 cation, housing, employment, and social services as Jews. In addition, government
 spending is far lower in predominantly Arab areas than in Jewish areas. Govern-
 ment efforts to close the gaps between Israel's Jewish and Arab citizens have re-
 sulted in an estimated 160 percent increase in resources devoted to Arab commu-
 nities between 1992 and 1996. Nevertheless, significant differences remain. Israeli-
 Arab organizations have challenged the Government's "Master Plan for the North-
 
 
 1472
 
 ern Areas of Israel," which listed as priority goals increasing the Galilee's Jewish
 population and blocking the territorial contiguity of Arab villages and towns, on the
 grounds that it discriminates against Arab citizens.
 Relative to their numbers, Israeli Arabs are underrepresented inmhe student bod-
 ies and faculties of most universities and in higher level professional and business
 ranks. Well-educated Arabs are often unable to find jobs commensurate with their
 level of education, with Arab Ph.D.'s-suffering�he greatest problems. A small num-
 ber.of Israeli Arabs have risen to responsible positions in.The civil service, generally
 -in the Arab departments of government ministries. In 1994 a civil service commis-
 sion 3-year affirmative action program to expand that number, but it has had only
 modest results. The Government has allocated only very limited'resources to enforce
 landmark 1995 ,legislation prohibiting discrimination in employment.
 . In practice, Israeli Arabs are not allowed to work in companies :with defense con-
 tracts or in security-related fields. The Israeli Druze and Circassian communities
 ,are subject to the military draft, and although some have refused to serve, the over-
 whelming majority accept service willingly. Some Bedouin and other Arab citizens
 who are not subject to the draft serve voluntarily. Those not subject to the draft
 have less access than other Israelis to those social and economic- benefits for which
 military service is. a prerequisite or anadvantage, such as housing, new-household
 . subsidies, and government or security-related industrial employment. Under a 1994
 government policy decision, the social security child allowance for parents who did
 not-serve in the military-and did not attend-a Yeshiva (including Arabs) was in-
 creased to equal the allowance of those who had done so.
 Israeli Arab groups allege that many employers use the prerequisite of military
 service to avoid hiring non-Jews. For example, a Haifa employment agency ran ads
 seeking Arabic-speaking telephone operators and listed military service as a pre-
 requisite. An Israeli Arab group noted that there was no clear justification for this
 requirement, and it threatened to file a civil suit under a law prohibiting employ-
 ment discrimination, and defining requirements unrelated to actual wor as dis-
 - criminatory- At year's end, the employment agency agreed to change the advertise-
 ment and run it again.
 The Government has yet to fulfill its commitment to resolve the legal status of
 unrecognized Arab villages. Eight villages have been recognized since 1994, but
 nearly a hundred more, of varying size and with a total population of nearly 70,000
 people, remain in limbo. Such villages have none of the infrastructure, such as elec-
 -tricity. provided.to reognized villages and towns. Private efforts have supplied some
 with water. In June residents of unrecognized villages petitioned the High Court of
 Justice to order the Government to list their place of residence as their address on
 their identity cards and as their mailing address. In the .Negev, a government pro-
 Sgram to provide housing for thousands of Bedouin in seven concentrated settlements
 has been criticized as likely to aggravate the severe poverty there and disrupt the
 indigenous culture.
 Arab children make up about a quarter of Israel's public school population, but
 government resources for them are not equal to those for Jewish children. Many
 schools in Arab communities are dilapidated and overcrowded, lack special edu-
 - cation services and counselors, have poor libraries, and have no sports facilities.
 Arab groups also note that the public school curriculum stresses Israel's Jewish cul-
 ture and heritage.
 Israeli-Arab students also are not eligible to participate in a special education pro-
 gram to provide academic assistance to students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
 A petition was filed with the High Court of Justice in May charging that the Min-
 istry of Education's refusal to provide this program to Israeli-Arab students was dis-
 criminatory. The Court reognized the petitio n's merit by ordering the Attorney
 SGeneral's-office to respond to the petition. The Attorney General's office agreed that
 -the policy constituted impermissible discrimination but asked for 5 years to expand
 the program to Israeli-Arab students. The petitioners rejected this proposal as being
 too slow. The Court formed a special committee to study the problem.
 Unresolved problems of many years' standing also include claims by Arab groups
 that land expropriation for public use has affected the Arab community dispropor-
 tionately; that Arabs have been allowed too little input in planning decisions that
 affect their schools and municipalities; that mosques and cemeteries belonging to
 the Islamic Waqf (religious endowment) have been unjustly expropriated for public
 use; and that successive governments have blocked the return of persons displaced
 in the early years of Israel's history to their homes. The Government has yet to
 agree with the pre-1948 residents of the northern villages of Bir Am and Ikrit, and
 their descendants, regarding their long-time demand to be allowed to rebuild their
 houses; in the meantime, permission has been given to Jewish settlements to in-
 crease their land holdings in the disputed areas.

 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers may join and establish labor organizations
 freely. Most unions belong to Histadrut (the General Federation of Labor in Israel),
 or to a much smaller rival federation, the Histadrut Haovdim Haleumit (National
 Federation of Labor.) These organizations are independent of the Government.
 Histadrut members democratically elect national and local officers, and officials of
 its affiliated women's organization Na'amat, from political party lists of those al-
 ready in the union. Plant or enterprise committee members are elected individually.
 During the year, the Histadrut administration continued its drastic reshaping of
 the labor federation, with further reductions in staff and services, as Histadrut
 shifted its concentration to those areas directly related to employment. At year's
 end, membership-which once reached 1.65 million people-stood at to about
 650,000.
 The right to strike is exercised regularly. Unions must provide 15 days' notice
 p or to a strike unless otherwise specified in the collective bargaining agreement.
 However, unauthorized strikes occur. Strike leaders-even those organizing illegal
 strikes-are protected by law. If essential public services are affected, the Govern-
 ment may appeal to labor courts for back-to-work orders while the parties continue
 negotiations. There were a number of strikes in beth public and private sectors dur-
 ing the year by employees protesting the effects of pivatization. Worker dismissals
 and the terms of severance arrangements were often the central issues of dispute.
 The September general strike was of 1 day duration; the December general strike
 lasted 6 days.
 Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip who work in Israel may not join
 Israeli trade unions or organize their own unions in Israel. Palestinian trade unions
 in the occupied territories are not permitted to conduct activities in Israel (see Sec-
 tion 6.a. of the annex). However, nonresident workers in the organized sector are
 entitled to the protection of Histadrut work contracts and grievance procedures.
 They may join, vote for, and be elected to shop-level workers' committees if their
 numbers in individual establishments exceed a minimum threshold. Palestinian par-
 ticipation in such committees is minimal.
 Labor laws apply to Palestinians in East Jerusalem and to the Syrian Druze liv-
 ing on the Golan Heights.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Israeli workers fully exercise
 their legal rights to organize and bargain collectively. While there is no law specifi-
 cally prohibiting antiunion discrimination, the law against discrimination could be
 cited to contest discrimination based on union membership. No antiunion discrimi-
 nation has been reported.
 Nonresident workers may not organize their own unions or engage in collective
 bargaining, but they are entitled to be represented by the bargaining agent and pro-
 tected by collective bargaining agreements. They do not pay union membership fees,
 but are required to pay a 1 percent agency fee, which entitles them to union protec-
 tion by Histadrut's collective bargaining agreements. The Ministry of Labor may ex-
 tend collective bargaining agreements to nonunionized workplaces in the same in-
 dustrial sector. The Ministry of Labor also oversees personal contracts in the unor-
 ganized sectors of the economy.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor. Neither citizens nor nonresident Palestinians working in Israel are
 subject to this practice. Civil rights groups charge that unscrupulous employers
 often take advantage of illegal workers lack of status (see Section 6.e.) to hold them
 in conditions amounting to involuntary servitude. The Government specifically pro-
 hibits forced child labor, and it does not occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Children
 who have attained the age of 15 years, and who are liable to compulsory education
 under the compulsory education law, may not be employed unless they work as ap-
 prentices under the apprenticeship law. Notwithstanding these provisions, children
 who are 14 years old may be employed during official school holidays. Employment
 of those 16 to 18 years of age is restricted to ensure time for rest and education.
 There are no reliable data on illegal child workers. They are concentrated among
 Israel's Arab population and its newest Jewish immigrants. Illegal employment is
 found primarily in urban, light-industrial areas. Children's rights groups have called
 for more vigorous enforcement of child labor laws, combined with a parallel effort
 to deal with the causes of illegal child labor. The Government specifically prohibits
 forced child labor, and it does not occur (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Legislation in 1987 established a minimum
 wage at 45 percent of the average wage, calculated periodically and adjusted for cost
 
 
 1474
 of living increases. At year's end, the minimum wage stood at at-out $620 (rou hly
 2,100 new Israeli shekels) per month. The minimum wage is often supplementel by
 special allowances and is generally sufficient to provide workers and their families
 with an acceptable standard of living. Union officials have expressed concern over
 enforcement of minimum wage regu ations, particularly with respect to employers
 of illegal nonresident workers, who sometimes pay less than the minimum wage.
 By law the maximum hours of work at regular pay are 47 hours a week, 8 hours
 per day, and 7 hours on the day before the weekly rest, which must be at least 36
 consecutive hours and include the Sabbath. By national collective agreements, the
 private sector established a maximum 45-hour workweek in 1988. The public sector
 moved to a 5-day, 42V2 hour workweek in 1989, while the military adopted it in
 1993.
 Employers must receive a government permit to hire nonresident workers from
 the occupied territories, certifying that no citizen is available for the job. All Pal-
 estinians from the occupied territories are employed on a daily basis and, unless
 they are employed on shiftwork, are not authorized to spend the night in Israel. At
 the end of the year, the Government was considering a change in this prvision to
 allow Palestinian workers to remain overnight for a week at a time. Palestinians
 without valid work permits are subject to arrest.
 Nonresident workers are paid through the Employment Service of the Ministry
 of Labor, which disburses wages and benefits collected from employers. The Min-
 istry deducts a 1 percent union fee and the workers' required contributions to the
 National Insurance Institute (NII), the agency that administers the Israeli social se-
 curity system, unemployment benefits, and other benefits. Despite these deductions,
 Palestinian workers are not eligible for all NII benefits. They continue to be insured
 for injuries occurring in Israel and the bankruptcy of a-worker's employer. They do
 not have access to unemployment insurance,. general disability payments, low-in-
 come supplements, or child allotments. By contrast Israeli settlers in the occupied
 territories who work in Israel have the-same benefits as other Israeli workers. The
 International Labor Organization (ILO). has long criticized this inequality in entitle-
 ments. The Government-agreed to transfer the NII fees collected from Palestinian
 workers to the Palestinian Authority, which is to assume responsibility for all the
 pensions and social benefits of Palestinians working in Israel. Implementation of
 this change is still under way.
 Along- with union representatives, the Labor Inspection Service -enforces labor,
 health, and safety standards in the workplace, although resource constraints affect
 overall enforcement. Legislation protects the employment rights- of safety delegates
 elected or appointed -by the workers. In cooperation with management, these dele-
 gates are responsible for the safety and health of the workplace. Workers do not
 -have the legal right to remove- themselves :from dangerous work situations without
 jeopardy to continued employment. However, collective bargaining agreements pro-
 vide some workers with recourse through the work site labor committee. Any worker
 may challenge unsafe work practices through government oversight and legal agen-
 cies.
 There was increased public debate over the role in the workplace-and society of
 foreign -workers, who are estimated to number 200,000 or more, perhaps half of
 them undocumented and illegally employed. The majority of such -workers come
 from eastern Europe and southeast Asia, and most are employed in the construction
 and agricultural sectors. The law does not allow such workers citizenship or perma-
 nent residence in Israel. As a result, they and their families live in a legal and so-
 cial limbo. Government deportations of such workers take place without benefit of
 due process.
 THE OCCUPIED. TERRITORIES (INCLUDING AREAS SUB-
 JECT TO THE JURISDICTION 'OF THE- PALESTINIAN
 AUTHORITY)
 Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, and East Jerusalem
 during the 1967 War. The West Bank and Gaza Strip are now administered to vary-
 ing extents by Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA). Pursuant to the May 1994
 Gaza-Jericho agreement and the September 1995 Interim Agreement, Israel trans-
 ferred most responsibilities for civil government in the Gaza Strip and parts of the
 West Bank to the PA, including responsibility for education, culture, health, tour-
 ism, taxation, social welfare, statistics, local government, insurance, commerce, in-
 dustr, fuel, gas, agriculture, and labor. Israel continues to retain responsibility in
 the West Bank and Gaza Strip for external security, foreign relations, the overall
 
 
 1475
 security of Israelis, including public order in the Israeli settlements, and certain
 other matters. Negotiations on the final status of the occupied territories as well as
 of Jerusalem, borders Israeli settlements, refugees, and other matters began in May
 1996 but were immediately adjourned and have not been resumed. According to the
 timetable set out in the 1993 Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles, the interim pe-
 riod is to conclude in May 1999.
 In addition to most of the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, which was turned over
 to the PA in May 1994, Israel began rdeploying its forces in the West Bank and
 turning over major towns and villages to the PA in late 1995. Pursuant to the In-
 terim greement and the "Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron," concluded
 on January 15, Israel also redeployed its forces in Hebron. Israel continues to con-
 trol some civil functions and is responsible for all security in portions of the occupied
 territories categorized as Zone C, which includes the Israeli settlements. The PAhas
 jurisdiction over civil affairs and shares security responsibilities with Israel in areas
 known as Zone B, and the PA has control over civil affairs and security in Zone A.
 The PA also has jurisdiction over some civil affairs in Zone C. Accordingly, this re-
 port discusses the policies and practices of both the Israeli Government and the PA
 in the areas where they exercise jurisdiction and control.
 Israel continues to exercise civil authority in some areas of the West Bank
 through the Israeli Ministry of Defense's Office of Coordination and Liaison, known
 .by the Hebrew acronym MATAK, which replaced the now defunct Civil Administra-
 tion (CIVAD). The approximately 150 000 Israeli settlers living in the West Bank
 and Gaza Strip are subject to Israeli 1aw and are better treated by Israeli authori-
 ties than are Palestinians. The body of law governing Palestinians in the Israeli-
 controlled portions of the territories derives from Ottoman, British Mandate, Jor-
 danian, and Egyptian law, and Israeli military orders. In Palestinian- controlled
 areas, laws and regulations promulgated by the PA are also in force. The United
 States and the international community considers Israel's authority in the occupied
 territories to be subject to the Hague Regulations of 1907 and the 1949 Geneva Con-
 vention Relating to the Protection of Civilians in Time of War. The Israeli Govern-
 ment considers the Hague Regulations applicable and states that it observes the Ge-
 neva Convention's humanitarian provisions.
 In January 1996, Palestinians chose their first popularly elected government in
 democratic elections, which were generally well- conducted. The 88-member Council
 and the Chairman of the Executive Authority were elected. The PA also has a cabi-
 net of 20 appointed ministers who oversee 23 ministries. PA Chairman Yasir Arafat
 continues to dominate the affairs of government and to make major decisions. Most
 senior government positions in the PA are held by individuals who are members of,
 or loyal to, Arafat's Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
 The Council meets regularly and discusses a range of issues significant to the Pal-
 estinian people and the development of an open, democratic society in the Gaza
 Strip and West Bank. Pursuant to the agreements signed between the PLO and Is-
 rael, the PA has full or partial control over most major Palestinians population cen-
 ters in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
 Israeli security forces in Israeli-controlled parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
 consist of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF); the General Security Service (GSS or
 Shin Bet); the Israeli National Police (INP); and the paramilitary border police. Is-
 raeli military courts try Palestinians accused of committing security crimes in Is-
 raeli-controlled areas. Members of the Israeli security forces committed human
 rights abuses.
 The Palestinian Police Force (PPF) was established in May 1994 and includes the
 Palestinian Public Security Force; the Palestinian civil police; the Preventive Secu-
 rity Force (PSF); General Intelligence Service, or Mukhabarat; the Palestinian Pres-
 idential Security Force; emergency services and rescue; and the Palestinian Coastal
 Police. Other quasi-military security organizations, such as military intelligence,
 also exercise law enforcement powers. Palestinian police are responsible for security
 and law enforcement for Palestinians and other non-Israelis in PA-controlled areas
 of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli settlers in the occupied territories are not
 subject to PA security force jurisdiction. Members of the PA security forces commit-
 ted human rights abuses.
 The economy of the West Bank and Gaza Strip is small, poorly developed, and
 highly dependent on Israel. According to U.N. estimates, Palestinian per capita
 gross national product (GNP) fell by 36 percent between 1992 and 1996 due prin-
 cipally, but not entirely, to Israeli restrictions on the free movement of people and
 products into Israel. These restrictions imposed for lengthy periods following terror-
 ist attacks are collectively referred to as "closure." The economy relies on agri-
 culture, services, and to a lesser extent, light manufacturing. Many West Bank and
 Gaza workers are employed at day jobs in Israel and Jerusalem, making their em-
 
 
 1476
 ployment vulnerable to disruption due to tightened closures. In the wake of terrorist
 mns in March, July, and September, Israel tightened the existing closure, vir-
 tually sealing off the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Israel, prohibiting most travel
 between towns and villages within the West Bank (an "internal" closure), denying
 Palestinian workers access to jobs in Israel, and hampering the flow of goods and
 people between Israel and the Occupied Territories. The 'internal closure" was lifted
 in each case after about 2 weeks. The "tightened closures" of Gaza and the West
 Bank followed a pattern of being eased after a period, but lasted longer, and were
 enforced more strictly than in previous years.
 There were some improvements in the human rights situation in the Occupied
 Territories. However, both Israel and the PA were responsible for serious human
 rights abuses.
 Two militant groups, the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAM)S) and the Pal-
 estine Islamic Jiad (PIJ), continued to try to undermine the authority of the PA
 and halt progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace precess by killing Israeli ciVilians
 in a number of deadly suicide bombing attacks in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The most
 serious incident occurred on July 30 when two suicide bombers attacked an open
 air produce market in Jerusalem. Sixteen persons were killed, including 1 US. citi-
 zen; 178 were injured. On September 4, three suicide bombers attacked a crowded
 Jerusalem pedestrian mall, killing 5 people, including a 14-year-old American girl;
 181 were injured. On March 21, a suicide bomber attacked an outdoor cafe in Tel
 Aviv. The blast killed 3 Israelis and injured 48, including a 6-month-old child.
 In the aftermath of the terrorist bombings, Israeli authorities arrested hundreds
 of Palestinians suspected of affiliation with extremist Islamic opposition groups, to
 obtain information on further terrorist attacks. Israeli security forces abused, and
 in some cases tortured, Palestinians suspected of security offenses. In May an al-
 leged HAMAS activist from the West Bank village of Surif, Omar Ghanimat, was
 allowed to testify in open court about such torture, and to show his cuts and bruises
 to the Israeli and Arabic press.
 Israel also tightened its existing closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, sealing
 off the occupied territories from Israel and imposing an "internal closure.' When it
 was discovered that a terrorist cell based in Surif was responsible for the March
 21 cafe bombing in Tel Aviv, Israel imposed a targeted closure on the village (13,000
 'residents were unable to leave the town). During the 7 weeks of the closure resi-
 dents were also under a curfew (i.e., they were unable to leave their homes except
 during designated hours to purchase household necessities). Israeli authorities de-
 molished six homes of suicide bombers; four in the village of Surif and two in the
 village of Assira Shamaliyya. In the-latter village, two other homes were perma-
 nently sealed by fillingithem with concrete from floor to ceiling. Israel also imposed
 a targeted closure on the northern West Bank village of Assira Shamaliyyah in Sep-
 tember, when it determined that four of the five suicide bombers in the Jerusalem
 attacks were from that town.
 There was one credible report that on February 25, an Israeli undercover unit,
 operating in the village of Hizma, shot and killed a Palestinian. Israeli officials ac-
 knowledged that the unit acted in a negligent manner without prior planning;, how-
 ever, the members of the unit received only administrative reprimands. In a second
 incident, an Israeli undercover unit shot and killed a youth on April 30 in Ras Al
 Amud. The unit was investigating alleged terrorist attacks when a skirmish broke
 out and the youth was killed. There has been a marked decrease in this kind of ac-
 tivity by Israel in the past 2 years. There were also credible reports from human
 rights groups that Israeli authorities continue to abuse and torture Palestinian de-
 tainees and prisoners. In May a Palestinian prisoner undergoing treatment at a Je-
 rusalem hospital was beaten to death by Israeli police and private hospital security
 guards. The Israeli Government investigated the incident, but has not revealed the
 results. Prison conditions are poor, and Israeli authorities arbitrarily arrest and de-
 tain persons. Prolonged detention, limits on due process, and infringements on pri-
 vacy rights remained problems.
 PA security forces committed a number of serious human rights abuses during the
 year. Seven detainees died in prison; the PA acknowledged that two died after being
 tortured. One was tortured by Military Intelligenceipersonnel in February, and the
 other by members of the Presidential Security Force in June. The other detainees
 died after suffering medical emergencies, and it remains unclear whether the PA
 provided prompt medical attention.
 In the wake of the three terrorist bombings in 1997, PA security forces made
 fewer mass arrests than in the past, and there were fewer complaints of human
 rights abuses. PA authorities arrested approximately 200 people on suspicion of in-
 volvement in terrorist activity. PA security forces subjected some of the detainees
 to torture and repeated beatings. Although the PA claims to respect its citizens'
 
 
 1477
 ht to express themselves freely, the PA limited freedom of speech and the press.
 PA continued to harass, detain, and abuse journalists. PA harassment has lead
 many Palestinian commentators, reporters, and critics to practice self-censorship.
 Fati Sobh, a prominent university professor, and Daoud Kuttab, a well-known jour-
 nalist who criticized the PA, were both imprisoned without charge during the year
 and Sobh was tortured. PA prison conditions are very poor. PA security forces arbi-
 trarily arrest and detain persons. Prolonged detention and lack of due process are
 problems. The courts are inefficient, lack staff and resources, and do not ensure fair
 and expeditious trials. PA security forces infringed on the right to privacy, and there
 were reports that the PA placed some limits on the freedom of association. Discrimi-
 nation against women andthe disabled is a problem.
 In March Israel began constructing a controversial housing project at Har Homa!
 Jebel Abu Ghanaim on the southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem. The move sparked
 demonstrations by angry Palestinians throughout the spring. However, unlike the
 demonstrations that followed the 1996 opening of the controversial tunnel in Jerusa-
 lem's old city, these demonstrations did not result in violence between Israeli and
 PA security forces. The demonstrations did result in charges that Israeli security
 forces, in several instances, used excessive force against Palestinian protesters. Dur-
 ing the year, 10 Palestinian demonstrators, including a deaf and mentally-impaired
 14-year-old boy in Gaza and an 8-year-old boy in Bethlehem, were killed in incidents
 involving the IDF's use of both live ammunition and rubber-coated metal bullets.
 No Israeli civilians or security personnel were killed or seriously wounded by dem-
 onstrators.
 Israeli settlers continued to harass and threaten Palestinians in the West Bank
 and Gaza Strip. For example, on January 1, a settler in the IDF reserve opened fire
 on a crowded Hebron market place, injuring nine Palestinians. In 1996 settlers
 killed three Palestinians. After two separate stonethrowing incidents in April, three
 Palestinians were shot by settlers near Ramallah and Hebron. In general settlers
 are not prosecuted for these crimes and rarely serve prison sentences even when
 convicted of a crime.
 In November an unidentified gunman shot two Jewish religious students in Jeru-
 salem, killing one and seriously wounding the other.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In February members of a 3-man Is-
 raeli undercover unit, disguised as Arabs, entered the Palestinian village of Hizma
 north of Jerusalem. Villagers detected the unit, and during the subsequent alterca-
 tion 57-year-old Mohammed Abdel Aziz al Hilu was shot and beaten. His death was
 attributed to the beating and delayed medical treatment for the gunshot wound to
 his leg. Three other Palestinians were wounded, one seriously, during the incident.
 A senior IDF officer attributed the incident to a miscalculation by the commander
 who sent the unit to the village without sufficient backup. The spokesman said that
 the unit acted in a negligent manner, without prior organized planning. According
 to the IDF, three officers received a reprimand for the way in which the training
 exercise was prepared and "internal measures" were taken against the force com-
 mander, including prohibiting him from holding future command positions. The Is-
 raeli investigation did not include interviews with any Palestinian eyewitnesses.
 In another incident, an Israeli undercover unit shot and killed 17-year-old Samer
 Jawdat Shweiki in Ras Al Amud on April 30 during a skirmish that broke out when
 unit was investigating alleged terrorist attacks.
 Although there are credible reports of other Israeli undercover activity in PA
 areas, there were no other reports of death. The number of Palestinian deaths at-
 tributed to Israeli undercover units in 1996 (one) and 1997 (two) is a marked de-
 crease from the trend in earlier years.
 Israeli authorities acknowledge that undercover units conduct operations among
 Palestinians wanted for investigation, but claim that such units observe the same
 rules of engagement as other IDF units. They also claim that all killings and allega-
 tions of misbehavior by undercover units are investigated fully. However, the inves-
 tigations rarely lead to serious punishment. The IDF does not readily announce the
 findings of its investigations.
 One Palestinian was beaten to death while in Israeli government custody.
 On May 21, Khalil Abu Daiya, a Palestinian prisoner who was being treated for
 medical problems, died in Israeli custody. An Israeli pathologist conducted an au-
 topsy and concluded that Abu Daiya had been beaten to death. Israeli officials con-
 tend that Abu Daiya, who was being guarded while in an Israeli hospital for medical
 treatment, attacked those guarding him, and that the force needed to restrain him
 
 
 1478
 caused his death. Abu Daiya's hands and feet were cuffed to a bed at the time of
 the beating, according to accounts given by hospital  rsonnel. The autopsy revealed
 deep cuts on Abu Daiya's wrists and an   . Abu  aiya's family requested an in-
 quiry be carried out by an Israeli magistrate's court. That inquiry was not concluded
 by year's end.
 Members of the Israeli security forces killed four Palestinians at military check-
 points and roadblocks inside the occupied territories. In these cases, Israel stated
 that the individuals were shot after failing to obey orders to halt or after trying to
 attack the soldiers manning the checkpoints. For example, on April 1, a Kamel Sidqi
 A1-Zaru was shot by the IDF after getting out of his car and trying to run away
 from a checkpoint near Kiryat Arba. On July 13, Israeli border police shot 17-year-
 old Ashraf Al Jaber at a checkpoint in Beit Sahour. On July 29, Israeli security
 forces shot 19-year-old Mua'di Alaune, when in fled a checkpoint near Nablus,
 claiming that he had tried to stab a border police officer. Palestinian Jimmy
 Kanawati, was shot and killed by border police on November 22 after failing to stop
 at the Bethlehem checkpoint.
 During the year, violent clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli
 security forces resulted in 10 Palestinian deaths. IDF regulations permit the use of
 both rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition only when a soldier's life is
 in immediate danger, to halt fleeing suspects, to disperse a violent demonstration,
 or to fire on an "individual unlawfully carrying firearms." According to policy, sol-
 diers should direct fire at the legs only and may fire at a fleeing suspect only if they
 believe that a serious felony has occurred and they have exhausted other means to
 apprehend the suspect. It is forbidden to open fire in the direction of children or
 women, even in cases of severe public disorder, unless there is an immediate and
 obvious danger to a soldier's life. However, Israeli soldiers and police sometimes
 used live ammunition or rubber-coated metal bullets, which can be lethal, in situa-
 tions other than when their lives were in danger and sometimes shot suspects in
 the upper body and head. On March 29, a Palestinian was shot and killed by the
 IDF during demonstrations in Ramallah protesting the Israeli construction on Har
 Homa. On April 1, an off-duty PA police officer was killed at a demonstration out-
 side of Nablus. Two Palestinians were shot and killed when IDF forces fired rubber-
 coated metal bullets in Hebron during April 8 demonstrations sparked by news of
 Israeli settlement expansion.
 On April 27, a 20-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed near Hebron after an
 IDF patrol fired live ammunition at youths throwing stones. A 14-year-old Palestin-
 ian boy was severely wounded during a June protest in Rafah over Israeli settle-
 ment expansion, when a rubber-coated metal bullet fired by an IDF member struck
 him in the head.
 In July a deaf and mentally-impaired Palestinian youth died after being struck
 in the heart by IDF fire, as Israeli security forces attempted to quell a violent dem-
 onstration near Morag settlement in the Gaza Strip. A Palestinian human rights or-
 ganization charged that the IDF used live ammunition; an IDF spokesman stated
 that the boy was hit by a rubber-coated metal bullet meant to be fired at the leg.
 On July 21, a 13-year-old Hebron youth died of a gunshot wound to the head dur-
 ingclashes with IDF troops on July 11
 On August 14, a 16-year-old Hebron youth died of wounds inflicted during clashes
 with IDF troops on July 4.
 On November 11, IDF soldiers killed an 8-year-old Palestinian boy with a rubber-
 coated metal bullet during demonstrations at Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem. The IDF
 says that soldiers were trying to disperse adult demonstrators and that the child
 was accidentally hit in the head. Credible eyewitnesses at the scene said that they
 saw only 9- to 12-year old boys demonstrating at the site, that no IDF lives were
 threatened by the rock- and bottle-throwing youths, and that the children were flee-
 ing when the IDF fired upon them.
 Another victim of the September 1996 rioting at the Ramallah checkpoint, Yasser
 Abdul Ghani Abdul Rahim, died from injuries on February 6.
 During 1997 two Palestinians died in PA custody, after being tortured. In 1996
 two Palestinians who died in PA custody also were tortured. In the most egregious
 case, Yusif Baba, who was being held without charge in Nablus, died on January
 31 after being tortured by PA Military Intelligence officials. Baba's autopsy showed
 contusions from repeated blows to the head, rope burns around his head and feet,
 cigarette burns on the right shoulder, and burns caused by an electrical instrument
 on many parts of his body. The PA admitted that Baba had been tortured to death,
 but never charged any of the security officials involved with a crime.
 On June 30, 28-year-old Nasser Abed Radwan from the Gaza Strip was killed in
 detention while being held without charge by PA Presidential Security (Force 17).
 Force 17 authorities told Radwan's family that he banged his head on the wall, but
 
 
 1479
 a PA autopsy concluded that Radwan had been tortured to death. A PA military
 court sentenced three of the Force 17 bodyguards involved to death and three others
 to prison terms ranging from 6 months to 5 years. The wife of Hakim Qamhawi,
 who died in PA custody in June, told the press that his.body showed signs of torture
 (see Section 1.c.).
 In April five undercover members of the Palestinian Intelligence Service shot and
 killed a Palestinian woman outside of Ramallah when the vehicle she was riding
 in failed to heed the agents'signal to stop. In a subsequent trial, a PA court con-
 victed the five security officials involved of causing a death through negligence. The
 intelligence official who fired the shot that kilIed the women was sentenced to 5
 years in prison, the commander of the unit was sentenced to a 1-year prison term
 for failing to maintain discipline among his unit, the three other men in the unit
 were sentenced to 2 months each for failing to prevent a crime.
 On May 5, PA Justice Minister Freih Abu Middein announced that the death pen-
 alty would be imposed on anyone convicted of ceding "one inch" to Israel. Later that
 month, two Arab land dealers were killed. Farih Bashiti, a real estate dealer from
 Jerusalem who was accused of selling land to Jews, was found dead in Ramallah.
 Two persons were arrested in the case. In another incident, Harbi Abu Sara was
 shot and killed in Ramallah 8 days after Bashiti's body was found. PA officials deny
 any involvement in the killings. The PA has arrested and continues to hold several
 suspected land dealers for violating the Jordanian law (in force in the West Bank),
 which prohibits the sale of land to foreigners.
 In early January, Israel released Nahum Koorman, an Israeli settler charged with
 kicking a Palestinian boy to death in 1996 for throwing stones at his car, after 8
 months in detention. Koorman is awaiting trial. In 1996 settlers killed three Pal-
 estinians.
 On November 20, an unidentified gunman shot two Jewish religious students in
 Jerusalem, killing one and seriously wounding the other. The Israeli investigation
 into the case is ongoing, but no suspects have been arrested at year's end.
 A security court sentenced the principal killers of two Israeli settlers, Etta Tsur
 and her 12-year-old son Ephraim, (killed on December 11, 1996) to 25 years' impris-
 onment and an accomplice to 15 years' imprisonment.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 attributed to the Israeli security services. In November an Israeli court convicted
 Palestinian Preventive Security officer Moussa Mustafa of abducting a suspected
 Arab informer for Israel from Jerusalem, torturing him, and holding him for 5
 months (see Section 1.c.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Israeli security forces abuse, and in some cases torture, Palestinians suspected of
 security offenses. There continue to be a high number of complaints of mistreatment
 and torture during interrogution, especially from Palestinians suspected of belonging
 to Islamic groups. Interrogation sessions are long and severe, and solitary confine-
 ment is used frequently for long periods. The GSS systematically uses interrogation
 methods that do not result in detectable traces of mistreatment of the victims, or
 which leave marks that disappear after a short period of time. Common interroga-
 tion practices include hooding; forced standing or squatting for long periods of time;
 prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures; tying or chaining the detainee in con-
 torted and painful positions; blows and beatings with fists, sticks, and other instru-
 ments; coniement in small and often filthy spaces; sleep and food deprivation; and
 threats against the detainee's life or family. Israeli interrogators continued to sub-
 ject prisoners to violent "shaking," which in at least one past case resulted in death.
 In May an alleged HAMAS activist Omar Ghanimat was allowed to show his cuts
 and bruises to the Israeli High Court. In June the Court rejected Ghanimat's plea
 to halt the use of physical pressure.
 In 1987 the Israeli government-appointed Landau Judicial Commission con-
 demned torture but allowed for the use of "moderate physical and psychological
 pressure" to secure confessions and obtain information. In addition, although the Is-
 raeli Penal Code prohibits the use of force or violence by a public official to obtain
 information, the GSS chief is permitted by law to allow interrogators to employ
 "special measures" that exceed the use of_"moderate physical and psychological pres-
 sure" when it is deemed necessary to obtain information that could potentially save
 Israeli lives in certain "ticking bomb" cases. The GSS first permitted interrogators
 "greater flexibility" in applying the guidelines shortly after a bus bombing in Tel
 Aviv in October 1994 that killed 22 Israelis. The Government has not defined the
 meaning of "greater flexibility" or what might constitute a "ticking bomb" case. At
 roughly quarterly intervals, the Government has approved the continued use of
 "special measures." On August 22, Israel's ministerial committee on GSS interroga-
 tions authorized the continued use of "special measures," including shaking.
 
 
 1480
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) declared in 1992 that such
 practices violate the Geneva Convention. Human rights groups and attorneys chal-
 enged the use of "special measures," especially shaking, before the Israeli High
 Court a number of times during the year. In each case the court either rejected the
 petition or ruled in favor of tht GSS.
 Israeli authorities maintain that torture is not condoned but acknowledge that
 abuses sometimes occur and are investigated. However, the Government does not
 generally make public the results of such investations. Israel has conducted two
 official investigations into the 35 complaints received in 1997.
 In 28 of the cases, Israeli athorities determined that findings did not justify any
 steps to be taken. Seven complaints are still being investigated.
 Most convictions in security cases before Israeli courts are based on confessions.
 A detainee may not have contact with a lawyer until after interrogation, a process
 that may last days or weeks. The Government does not allow ICRC representatives
 access to detainees until the 14th day of detention. This prolonged incommunicado
 detention contributes to the likelihood of abuse. Detainees sometimes claim in court
 that their confessions are coerced, but judges rarely exclude such confessions. It is
 likely that some Palestinian detainees failto make complaints either from fear of
 retributiort or because they assume that such complaints would be ignored. Of the
 35 complaints filed during the year, there were no known cases in which a confes-
 sion was disqualified because of improper means of investigation or interrogation.
 Israeli authorities also frequently treat Palestinians in an abusive manner at
 checkpoints. Two Palestinians were shot and killed at checkpoints (see Section L.a.).
 The human rights group B'tselem reported that severe beatings often occur when
 Israeli border police deal with Palestinians. Dozens of incidents have been reported
 of excessive beatings and unjustified abuse. In some cases, victims were denied med-
 ical attention after being beaten. Israeli authorities investigated and punished the
 perpetrators. B'tselem believes that the steps taken were insufficient to deter fur-
 ther incidents. In March a border police officer was demoted and sentenced to a 3-
 week military prison term, and another was confined for 3 weeks for beating two
 Palestinian children in Hebron who had cursed them. In April two border police offi-
 cers were dismissed for abusing a 17-year-old Palestinian after he refused to obey
 the officers demand to remove rocks from the road near Surif. Four other border
 police officers are being investigated for dragging a Palestinian behind their jeep
 near Bethlehem. Israeli security forces assigned to checkpoints often act capriciously
 in honoring permits and travel passes held by Palestinians.
 Prison conditions in Israeli facilities are poor, according to credible human rights
 lawyers. Facilities are overcrowded, sanitation is poor, and medical care is inad-
 equate. Palestinian inmates held strikes and protests in support of a number of
 causes and to protest prison conditions throughout the year. Palestinians in Israeli
 risons also held several strikes to protest being held in administrative detention
 detention without trial), lack of.visits by family members or lawyers, and to protest
 abuse by prison officials.
 Israel permits independent monitoring of prison conditions, although human
 rights groups and diplomats sometimes encounter difficulties gaining access to spe-
 cific detainees.
 Israeli settlers have continued to harass and threaten Palestinians in the West
 Bank and Gaza Strip. On January 1, a settler in the IDF reserve opened fire on
 a crowded Hebron market place, injuring nine Palestinians. On April 7, two Pal-
 estinians were shot by settlers after a stonethrowing incident near Ramallah. The
 settlers were questioned but never charged over the incident. On April 8, a yeshiva
 student in Hebron shot a Palestinian after a stone throwing incident; the student
 was never charged with a crime. In general settlers are not prosecuted for these
 crimes and rarely serve prison sentences even when convicted of a crime.
 In November an Israeli court convicted a Palestinian security official of abducting
 and torturing a suspected Arab informer for Israel. The court sentenced Moussa
 Mustafa, a member of the Palestinian Preventive Security Service, to 5 years' im-
 prisonment. Mustafa took the suspected informer by force from Jerusalem to a PA
 compound in Jericho, where he was held for 5 months and tortured.
 PA security forces reportedly abused, and sometimes tortured, Palestinian detain-
 ees. Such abuse generally took place after arrest and during interrogation. The PA
 does not prohibit by law the use of force or torture against detainees. In 1995 the
 Gaza Civil Police commander issued to police officers in the West Bank and Gaza
 a directive forbidding torture during interrogation and directing the security forces
 to observe the rights of all detainees. However, the directive does not have the force
 of law; Palestinian security officers have not been issued formal guidelines on the
 proper conduct of interrogations.
 
 
 .1481
 PA security officials abuse prisoners by hooding, beating, tying in painful posi-
 tions, sleep and food deprivation, threats, and burning detainees with cigarettes and
 hot instruments. International human rights monitoring groups have documented
 widespread arbitrary and abusive conduct by the PA. Gaza University professor
 Fathi Sobh reported that he was subjected to torture by sleep deprivation, being
 forced to stand for long periods, and being shackled.
 During the year seven Palestinians died in PA custody, two after being tortured
 (see Section L.a.). In 1996 two of the -four Palestinians who died in PA custody also
 were tortured. In December the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group
 (PHRMG) reported that the PA has not sufficiently investigated deaths in custody.
 The PHRMG added that the PA has tried to cover up incidents by claiming that
 several deaths were the result of heart attacks or suicides. In mid-June Hakam
 Qthamhawi died while in PA General Intelligence custody in Jericho. PA officials said
 that Qashawi ommitted suicide and diedon the way to the hospital, but his wife
 told the press that his body showed signs of torture. A PA forensic expert stated
 that Qahawi died of a heart attack. No official autopsy was conducted.
 Prison conditions in PA facilities are very poor. Facilities are overcrowded and di-
 lapidated. Food and clothing for prisoners is inadequate and must be supplemented
 by donations from families and humanitarian groups. Paletinian inmates held peri-
 odic strikes and prtests throughout the year n support of a number of causes and
 to protest prison conditions.
 In January Fayez Qamsieh died while in the custody of PA Military Intelligence
 in Bethlehem. The PA claimed that Qamsieh, who had a histo   of heart trouble,
 died of a heart attack. Docto observing the autopsy on behalf of Qamsieh's rel-
 atives agreed that he died of a heart- attack, but bruises on his body suggest that
 mistreatment may have triggered his death. There were complaints that Qamsieh
 had not received prompt medical attention. The PA said that it would investigate
 this charge, but has never published the results of its investigation.
 Sami Abed Rabbo, held- in Saraya prison in Gaza without charge, died on July
 4, also under the custody of-PA General Intelligence. Family members were told he
 died of a heart attack. Despite demands from human rights groups for an official
 autopsy, there has been no official response. The PHRMG stated that his death does
 not appear to be the result of torture or denial of medical treatment, his lengthy
 illegal detention may have contributed to his illness (liver disease and mental ill-
 ness).
 On October 14, Ibrahim Al-Sheikh died of a heart attack while serving a prison
 sentence in Nablus for involvement in a murder. On November 9, Nafea Mardawi
 died in a Nablus prison also of an apparent heart attack. He was serving a sentence
 for selling land illegally to Israelis. Human rights gups concur that both men had
 preexisting medical conditions that support the PA's assertion that they died of
 heart attacks. However, concerns linger that the prisoners were not provided the
 most prompt or thorough preventive medical care.
 The PA permits independent monitoring of its prisons, although human rights
 groups and lawyers encountered difficulties arranging visits or gaining access to
 specific detainees. Pursuant to an agreement signed in September 1996, the ICRC
 conducts prison visits but can be denied access to a detainee for 14 days. If abuses
 occur, they frequently happen during this 2-week period.
 In December West B       Intelligence (Mukhabarat) Chief Tawfiq Tirawi lifted a
 6-month ban on visits to Mukhabarat prisons by representatives of the Palestinian
 Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment (LAWE). Tirawi
 promised to appoint a special liaison officer to coordinate relations with human
 rights groups.
 Ihere were a number of attacks on Israelis during the year. For example, in No-
 vember an unidentified gunman shot two Jewish religious students in Jerusalem,
 killing one and seriously wounding the other.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Any Israeli policeman or border guard
 may arrest without warrant a person who has committed, or is suspected of having
 committed, a criminal or security offense in the occupied territories, except for areas
 under exclusive PA control.
 Israeli soldiers also may arrest without warrant Palestinians and hold them for
 questioning for the same reasons. Most of these arbitrary arrests and detentions are
 or alleged security offenses. Persons arrested for common crimes are usually pro-
 vided with a statement of charges and access to an attorney and may apply for bail.
 However, these procedures are sometimes delayed.
 Israeli authorities issue special summonses for security offenses. Israeli Military
 Order 1369 stipulates a 7-year prison term for anyone who does not respond to a
 special summons delivered to a family member or posted in the MATAK office near-
 est the suspect's home address. Bail is rarely available to those arrested for security
 
 
 1482
 offenses. Although Israeli law does not allow Israelis between the ages of 13 and
 16 to be tried as adults, Israeli courts treat Palestinians over the age of 12 as
 adults.
 Israeli authorities may hold persons in custody without a warrant for 96 hours;
 they must be released unless a warrant is issued. Prearraignment detention can last
 up to 11 days for Palestinians arrested in the occupied territories and up to 8 days
 for minors and those accused of less serious offenses. Authorities must obtain a
 court order for longer administrative detentions-up to 6 months from the date of
 arrest. At hearings to extend detention for interrogation purposes, detainees are en-
 titled to be represented by counsel, although the defense attorney is often not al-
 lowed to see or hear the evidence against his client. Detainees are either released
 at the end of the court-ordered detention or sent to administrative detention if they
 are not indicted. If there is an indictment, a judge may order indefinite detention
 until the end of the trial. Israeli regulations permit detainees to be held in isolation
 during interrogation. Detainees have the right to appeal continued detention.
 Alth~ough a detainee generally has the right to onsult with a lawyer as soon as
 poss ible, in security cases authorities may delay access to counsel for up to 15 days.
 Higher-ranking officials or judges may extend this period. Access to counsel is rou-
 tinely denied while a suspect is being interrogated, which sometimes can last sev-
 eral weeks. Authorities must inform detainees of their right to an attorney and
 whether there are any orders prohibiting such contact.
 A number of factors hamper contacts between lawyers and their clients in Israeli
 prison and detention facilities. Israel's policy of transferring detainees from the oc-
 cupied territories to prisons in Israel, makes visits of lawyers and family members
 difficult, and in some cases, impossible. Israeli authorities have been known to
 schedule appointments between attorneys and their detained clients, only to move
 the clients to another prison prior to the meetings. Authorities reportedly use such
 tactics to delay lawyer-client meetings for as long as 90 days. Palestinian lawyers
 also have trouble traveling to see their clients during Israeli-imposed closures. Is-
 rael does not allow Palestinian attorneys who do not have East Jerusalem identity
 cards and licenses issued by the Israeli Bar Association or by an official Israeli gov-
 ernmental body such as MATAK to visit detainees in Israeli prisons.
 Israeli authorities claim that they attempt to post notification of arrest within 48
 hours. Nevertheless, Palestinian suspects are often kept incommunicado for longer
 than 48 hours. Even if an arrest becomes known, it is often difficult to get informa-
 tion on where a detainee is being held or whether he has access to an attorney. Pal-
 estinians generally locate detained family members through their own efforts. Pal-
 estinians can check with a local ICRC office to determine whether it has information
 on the whereabouts of a family member. A senior officer may delay for up to 12 days
 notification of arrest to immediate family members, attorneys, and diplomatic offi-
 cials. A military commander may appeal to a judge to extendthis period in security
 cases for an unlimited time. Israeli district military commanders may order admin-
 istrative detention for up to 6 months without formal charges, but the original de-
 tention order may be extended indefinitely.
 At the end of the year, there were 382 Palestinians in administrative detention
 in Israel, compared with 270 at the end of 1996. A total of 138 Palestinian adminis-
 trative detainees have been imprisoned for over a year, without being officially
 charged of any wrongdoing; 45 of them have been held for more than 2 years. There
 are 40 children below the age of 16 being held in administrative detention.
 Many Palestinians under administration detention during the past 2 years have
 had their detention orders renewed repeatedly without meaningful chance of appeal.
 Evidence used at hearings for administrative detentions is secret and unavailable
 to the detainee or his attorney. During hearings to appeal detention orders, the de-
 tainee and defense lawyer are required to leave the courtroom when secret evidence
 is presented. Israeli authorities maintain that they are unable to present evidence
 in open court because doing so would compromise the method of acquiring the evi-
 dence. Detainees may appeal detention orders, or the renewal of a detention order,
 before a military judge, but their chances for success are very limited. During the
 year, there were no successful appeals requesting the cancellation of administrative
 detention orders.
 At year's end, 3,565 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were incarcerated in Is-
 raeli prisons, military detention centers, and holding centers, a decrease from 3,800
 in 1996. The Israeli Government routinely transfers Palestinians arrested in Israeli-
 controlled areas of'the occupied territories to facilities in Israel, especially Megiddo
 military detention center near Afula.
 Families, human rights organizations, and lawyers have encountered barriers try-
 ing to gain access to Palestinian detainees and prisoners held in facilities in Israel
 as a result of closures of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Family access to Palestin-
 
 
 1483
 
 ian prisoners held in Israeli jails has improved slightly improved in 1997 compared
 with the sharp decline in 1996. Only parents and female family members are al-
 lowed to visit relatives in facilities in lrael. Male family members between 16 and
 40 years of age and family members with security records are barred from visiting.
 The transfer of prisoners between facilities also makes it difficult for families, law-
 yers, and human rights organizations to locate and visit detainees. Due to travel
 restrictions, the ICRC suspended' its family visits program to detainees in Israeli
 prisons several times during the year.
 Israeli security forces conducted several mass arrests of Palestinians in response
 to acts or threats of violence against Israelis. Israel arrested 87 Palestinians sus-
 pected of affiliation with terrorist groups after suicide bombings in March, July, and
 September. Of these, more than 66 were still being held in administrative detention
 atyear's end.
 Israel did not forcibly deport any Palestinians from the occupied territories in
 1997.
 The PA does not have a uniform law on administrative detention, and security
 officials do not always adhere to the existing laws in the WestBank and Gaza Strip.
 Laws applicable in Gaza, which are not observed in the West Bank, stipulate-that
 detainees held without charge be released within 48 hours. These laws allow the
 Attorney General to extend the detention period. to a maximum of 90 days during
 investigations. Human rights organizations and the PA Ministry of Justice assert
 that PA security officials do not always adhere to this regulation. Prevailing law in
 the West Bank allows a suspect tobe.detained for 24 hours before being charged.
 The Attorney General can extend the detention period.
 PA authorities generally permit prisoners to receive visits from family members,
 attorneys, and human rights-monitors, except for prisoners held for alleged security
 offenses. PA security officials are not always aware that lawyers have a right to see
 their clients. In principle detainees may notify their families of their arrest, but this
 is not always permitted.
 PA security services have overlapping or unclear mandates that often complicate
 the protection of human rights. Under existing law in the West Bank, only the PA's
 civil "police force is authorized to make arrests. In practice all security forces are
 known to detain people at various times. The operating procedures and regulations
 -for conduct of PA security. personnel in the various services are not well developed
 and have not yet been made fully available to the public.
 There-are many detention facilities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip adminis-
 tered by the overlapping PA security services, a situation that complicates the Abil-
 ity of families, lawyers, and even the Ministry of Justice to track detainees' where-
 abouts. Security services including Preventive Security, General Intelligence, mili-
 tary intelligence, and the coast guard have their own interrogation and detention
 facilities. In general these services do not, or only sporadically,-inform families of
 a relative's arrest. Most PA security officers remain ignorant of proper arrest, deten-
 tion, and interrogation proceduresas well as basic human rights standards. Human
 rights groups continue to provide basic human rights training to PA security serv-
 ices. During 1997 human rights groups provided training to representatives of all
 the PA security servies, including the PA military intelligence service. In 1997
 more than 60 P A security officials participated in human rights courses, bringing
 the total number of security officials who have graduated from. human rights
 courses to almost 700, according to human rights groups.
 PA security forces continued to arrest arbitrarily and, detain journalists, profes-
 sors, political activists, and human rights advocates, who, criticized the PA, includ-
 ing journalist Daoud Kuttab  and university professor Fahti Sobh,(see Sections 1.c.
 and 2.a.).
 I PA-security services in Gaza and the West Bank arrested dozens of Palestinians
 in. the wake of the three 1997 suicide bombing attacks, a more targeted campaign
 than in past years. The majority of arrests were conducted without warrants; most
 of those arrested in these campaigns remain in detention without being charged.
 Human rights organizations estimate that the PA has held approximately 120
 people for more than a year without charge, and the total humber of Palestinians
 in PA jails reached 725 by November.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Palestinians accused by Israel of security offenses
 in Israeli-controlled areas of the occupied territories are tried. in Israeli military
 courts. Security offenses are broadly defined and may include charges of political ac-
 tivity, such as membership in outlawed organizations. Charges are brought by mili-
 tary prosecutors. Serious charges are tried before three-judge panels; lesser offenses
 are tried before one judge. Defendants have the right to counsel and to appeal ver-
 dicts to the Court of Military Appeals, which may accept appeals based on the law
 applied in the case, the sentence, or both. The right of appeal does not apply in all
 
 
 1484
 cases and sometimes requires court permission. The Israeli military courts rarely
 acquit Palestinians of security offenses, but sentences are sometimes reduced on ap-
 peal.
 Trials are sometimes delayed for several reasons: Witnesses, including Israeli
 military or police officers, do not appear; the defendant is not brought to court; files
 are lost; or attorneys fail to appear, sometimes because they have not been informed
 of the trial date or because of travel restriction� on Palestinian lawyers. These
 delays add pressure on defendants to plead guilty to minor offenses; if they do, an
 "expedited" trial may be held, in which a charge sheet is drawn up within 48 hours
 and a court hearing scheduled within days.
 By law most Israeli military trials are public, although access is limited. Dip-
 lomats are allowed to attend military court proceedings involving foreign citizens,
 but there have been delays in gaining admission. Most convictions in military courts
 are based on confessions.
 Evidence that is not available to the defendant or his attorney may be used in
 court to convict persons of security offenses. There is frequently no testimony pro-
 vided by Palestinian witnesses either for or against Palestinians on trial. Israeli au-
 thorities maintain that this is due to the refusal of Palestinians to cooperate with
 the authorities. Physical and psychological pressures and reduced sentences for
 those who confess can induce security detainees to sign confessions. Confessions are
 usually spoken in Arabic but translated into Hebrew for the record because, authori-
 ties maintain, many Israeli court personnel speak Arabic but few read it. Palestin-
 ian detainees seldom read Hebrew and therefore often sign confessions that they
 cannot read.
 Crowded facilities and poor arrangements for attorney-client consultations in pris-
 ons hinder legal defense efforts. Appointments to see clients are difficult to arrange,
 and prison authorities often fail to produce clients for scheduled appointments.
 Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip accused of security and ordinary
 criminal offenses are tried under Israeli law in the nearest Israeli district court. Ci-
 vilian judges preside, and the standards of due process and admissibility of evidence
 are governed by the laws of Israel, not military occupation decrees. Settlers con-
 victed in Israeli courts of crimes against Palestinians regularly receive lighter pun-
 ishment than Palestinians convicted in Israeli courts of similar crimes against ei-
 ther Israelis or other Palestinians.
 The PA inherited a court system based on structures and legal codes predating
 the 1967 Israeli occupation. The Gaza legal code derives from British Mandate law,
 Egyptian law, and PA directives and laws. Pre-1967 Jordanian law applies in PA-
 controlled areas of the West Bank. Bodies of law in the Gaza Strip and West Bank
 have been substantially modified by Israeli military orders. According to the DOP
 and the Interim Agreement, Israeli military decrees issued during the occupation
 theoretically remain valid in both areas and are subject to review pursuant to spe-
 cific procedure. The PA states that it is undertaking efforts to unify the Gaza and
 West Bank legal codes, but in 3 years little progress has been made.
 The court system in general is recovering from years of neglect; many of the prob-
 lems predate PA jurisdiction. Judges and staff are underpaid and overworked and
 suffer from lack of skills and training; court procedures and record-keeping are ar-
 chaic and chaotic; and the delivery of justice is often slow and uneven. The ability
 of the courts to enforce decisions is extremely weak, and there is administrative con-
 fusion in the appeals process.
 The PA Ministry of Justice appoints all civil judges for 10-year terms. The Attor-
 ney General, an appointed official, reports to the Minister of Justice and supervises
 judicial operations in both the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
 In 1995 the PA established state security courts in Gaza and the West Bank to
 try cases involving security issues. Three military judges preside over each court.
 A senior police official heads the state security court in Jericho, and three judges
 preside over it. There is no right of appeal, but verdicts may be either ratified or
 repealed by the PA Chairman, Yasir Arafat. The PA Ministry of Justice has no ju-
 risdiction over the state security courts, which appear to be subordinate only to the
 Chairman of the PA. In 1997 PA security courts sentenced 14 defendants: 3 received
 death sentences, bringing the total number of Palestinians sentenced to death to 13.
 To date none of these death sentences has been carried out; Chairman Arafat has
 not commuted any death sentences.
 The PA usually ignores the legal limits on the length of prearraignment detention
 of detainees suspected of security offenses. Defendants are often brought to court
 without knowledge of the charges against them or sufficient time to prepare a de-
 fense. Defendants are typically represented by court-appointed lawyers. Court ses-
 sions often take place on short notice in the middle of the night and without lawyers
 present, all violations of defendants' right to due process. If some instances, secu-
 
 
 1485
 rity courts try cases, issue verdicts, and impose sentences in a single session lasting
 several hours.
 Palestinian Attorney General Fayez Abu Rahme- acknowledged that at least 100
 political prisoners are being held by the PA.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With -Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Israeli
 military authorities in areas of the West Bank under their control may enter private
 Palestinian homes and institutions without a warrant on security grounds when au-
 thorized by an officer of the rank of lieutenant colonel. In conducting searches, the
 IDFrhas forced entry and has sometimes beaten occupants and destroyed property.
 Israeli authorities say that forced entry may. lawfully occur only when incident to
 an arrest and when entry is resisted. Authorities. say that beatings and arbitrary
 destruction of property during searches are punishable violations of military regula-
 tions, and that compensation is due to victims in such case. The Israeli Government
 states that it does not keep-consolidated information on the claims against the Min-
 istry of Defense for damages resulting from IDF actions.
 Israeli security forces may demolish or seal the home (owned or rented) of a Pal-
 estinian suspected of terrorism without trial..The decision to seal or demolish a Pal-
 estinian's-house is made by several high-level.Israeli officials, including the Coordi-
 .nator of the MATAK (formerly CIVAD) and the Defense Minister. Residents of
 houses ordered demolished have 48 hours to appeal to the--area commander; a final
 appeal may.be made to the Israeli High Court. A successful appeal generally results
 in the conversion of a demolition order to sealing. After a house is demolished, mili-
 tary authorities prohibit the owner from rebuilding or removing the rubble. Israelis
 suspected of terrorism are subject to Israeli-law and do not face the threat of home
 demolition.
 Israeli authorities destroyed eight Palestinian homes in 1997, compared with
 eight in 1996, and one -in 1995. In Surif four homes were demolished. In Assira
 Shamaliyya, two homes were demolished and two filled with concrete.
 Since 1994 the Israeli Government has allowed owners to apply to regional mili-
 tary commanders for permits to rebuild or unseal homes closed or demolished due
 to security offenses committed by themselves or a family member after their re-
 lease-or the release of their family member-from prison. In 1997 the Israeli Gov-
 ernment did not allow any homes to be rebuilt or unsealed. In 1996-the Israeli Gov-
 ernment allowed one home to be unsealed.
 In the Gaza Strip and PA-controlled areas of the West Bank, the PA requires the
 Attorney General to issue warrants for entry and searches of private property.
 These requirements are frequently ignored by Palestinian security services. PA po-
 lice have searched homes without consent. of their owners. In, some cases, police
 have forcibly entered premises and destroyed property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Israeli Government generally respects free-
 dom of speech in the occupied territories but prohibits public expressions of support
 for Islamic extremist groups, such as HAMAS and other groups dedicated to the de-
 struction of Israel. Continuing a policy it began in 1994, the Israeli Government
 enerally did not enforce its prohibition on the display of Palestinian political sym-
 bols, such as flags, national colors, and graffiti, acts that are punishable by fines
 or imprisonment.
 Overall, Israeli censorship of specific press pieces continued to be low. Israeli au-
 thorities continue to monitor the Arabic press based in Jerusalem for security-relat-
 ed issues. Military censors review Arabic publications for material related to the
 public order and security of Israel. Reports by foreign journalists are also subject
 to review by Israeli military censors for security issues, and the satellite feed used
 by many foreign journalists is monitored.
 Israel often closes areas to journalists when it has imposed a curfew or closure.
 Israeli authorities have denied entry permits to Palestinian journalists traveling to
 their place of work in Jerusalem during closures of the territories.
 The IDF requires a permit for publications sold in the occupied territories still
 under its control. Publications may be censored or banned for anti-Semitic or anti-
 Israeli content. Possession of banned materials is punishable by a fine and impris-
 onment. In 1997 Israel refused to allow publications, including newspapers, into the
 Gaza Strip during closures.
 Israeli-imposed closures also severely disrupted the operations of West Bank and
 Gaza universities, colleges, and schools during the year. Educational institutions in
 the West Bank and Jerusalem closed for periods of time as a result of internal clo-
 sures in the West Bank. Significant numbers of students and staff could not travel
 to the schools from neighboring towns and villages. Gaza students experience dif-
 ficulty obtaining permits to attend West Bank universities.
 
 
 1486
 The PA has a generally poor record on freedom of expression and freedom of the
 press, although it professes to tolerate varying political views and criticism. In gen-
 eral PA authorities do not permit criticism of Yasir Arafat or his policies or style
 of government. Press freedom in PA-controlled areas is subject to a 1995 Press Law
 that does not adequately protect the press. PA security services further stifle the
 independence of the press by periodically harassing or detaining media members.
 PA officials imposed restrictions on the press in several instances, including closing
 some opposition newspapers. In May PA security officials detained Palestinian-
 American journalist Daoud Kuttab for over a week. He was never charged but came
 to the attention of the PA when he broadcast a Palestinian Council session that dis-
 cussed PA corruption.
 The PA has authority over all levels of education in the West Bank and Gaza
 Strip. PA security services in the Gaza Strip arrested prominent university profes-
 sor Fahti Sobh in July after he allegedly asked students, as a final exam question,
 what they would do about PA corruption. Sobh reported that he was subjected to
 torture. He did not pay a fine. He faces a fine up to approximately $7,000 (5000
 Jordanian dinars) if he is apprehended again. This detention was the only instance
 of PA interference in academic freedom during the year.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Israeli military orders ban
 public gatherings of 10 or more persons without a permit. Since the 1993 signing
 of the Declaration of Principles, Israel has relaxed enforcement of this rule except
 in cases of Palestinian demonstrations against land seizures or settlement expan-
 sions.
 Private Palestinian organizations are required to register with the Israeli authori-
 ties in areas under Israeli control, though some operate without licenses. The au-
 thorities permit Palestinian charitable, community, professional, and self-help orga-
 nizations to operate unless their activities are viewed by Israeli authorities as a se-
 curity problem. Israeli authorities have forced some Palestinian organizations in
 East Jerusalem to close because of alleged links to the PA.
 The PA does not impose restrictions on freedom of assembly, although it does re-
 quire permits for rallies, demonstrations, and large cultural events. These permits
 are rarely denied. In Gaza police approval is required for "political" meetings at sev-
 eral specific large meeting halls. Written permission is also required for buses to
 transport passengers to attend political meetings. In West Bank cities, the PA re-
 quires permits for outdoor rallies and demonstrations and prohibits calls for vio-
 lence, a display of arms, and racist slogans, although this is not always enforced.
 There were periodic complaints during the year from Palestinian political parties,
 social and professional groups, and other NGO's that the PA tried to limit their abil-
 ity to act autonomously.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Israeli Government respects freedom of religion and
 does not ban any group or sect on religious grounds. It permits all faiths to operate
 schools and institutions. Religious publications are subject to the publications laws
 (see Section 2.a.). In 1997 the IDF temporarily closed at least five mosques in the
 course of investigating communities in which terrorist suspects were believed to be
 operating.
 The PA does not restrict freedom of religion. There are periodic credible allega-
 tions that a small number of Muslim converts to Christianity are subject to societal
 discrimination and sometimes harassment by PA officials. The PA investigates such
 complaints. There was no pattern of PA discrimination and harassment against
 Christians.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Occupied Territories, Foreign Travel, Emigra-
 tion, and Repatriation.-Israel requires that all West Bank and Gaza residents ob-
 tain identification cards to qualify for permits to enter Israel and Jerusalem. How-
 ever, Israel often denies applicants permits with no explanation, and does not allow
 effective means of appeal. Palestinian officials with VIP passes, including PA cabi-
 net officials and members of the Palestinian Council, were subjected to long delays
 and searches at Israeli checkpoints in the West Bank, even though they were travel-
 ing on special passes issued by Israel. In general Palestinians in the West Bank and
 Gaza Strip find it difficult to obtain permits to work, visit, study, obtain medical
 care, or attend religious services outside of the West Bank or Gaza. Palestinian resi-
 dents of Jerusalem are sometimes prohibited from entering PA-controlled areas of
 the West Bank, and they require written permits from Israel to travel to the Gaza
 Strip. Residents of the Gaza Strip are rarely able to obtain permission to travel to
 the West Bank, or residents of the West Bank to enter the Gaza Strip; this is even
 true of residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip who regularly receive permission
 to enter Israel. Israeli authorities do not permit Gazans to bring vehicles into Israel
 and rarely permit West Bank vehicles to enter Jerusalem or Israel. Except for sen-
 ior PA officials, Palestinians of all ages entering (or exiting) the Gaza Strip from
 
 
 1487
 (or into) Israel are not permitted to travel by car across the main checkpoint. In-
 stead, they must traveralong a narrow walkway almost a mile long. Israelis moving
 into and out of the Gaza Strip are permitted to use their cars. Israel and the PA
 have yet to establish "safe passage" to facilitate travel between the West Bank and
 Gaza Strip as set out in the 1995 Interim Agreement.
 Israel continues to apply its policy, begun in 1993, of closure of the West Bank
 and the Gaza Strip, following terrorist attacks. On occasion Israel also imposes a
 tightened version of closure in the wake of terrorist incidents. During these times
 Israel tends to cancel all travel permits and prevents Palestinians, even those with
 valid work permits, from entering Israel or Jerusalem. Israel often imposes an "in-
 ternal closure" during the "an initial limited period." An "internal closure" prohibits
 Palestinians from traveling between West Bank towns and villages. Tightened clo-
 sures, especially those that include an internal closure, severely hamper the flow
 of food, medicine, students, doctors, and patients into and out of the occupied terri-
 tories, and they seriously disrupt commercial activity. A tightened closure was im-
 posed after the March 21, July 30, and September 4 terrorist bombings. Tightened
 closures imposed during the year lasted longer and were more strictly enforced than
 those from past years. After both the July 30 and September 4 bombings, an "inter-
 nal" closure was imposed for almost 2 weeks, while the tightened closure lasted for
 about a month.
 As a security precaution, Israel also routinely tightens the closure of the West
 Bank and the Gaza Strip during major Jewish or Muslim holy days, as well as dur-
 ing times of political sensitivity for Israel.
 Israel continued to impose periodic curfews in areas of the West Bank under its
 jurisdiction in response to its security concerns, in anticipation of incidents, or as
 part of ongoing security operations. Israelis are generally free to move about during
 curfews, while Palestinians are confined to their homes. A curfew was imposed on
 the southern West Bank village of Surif in March and on the northern West Bank
 village of Assira Shamaliyyah in September. During periods of tightened closure, Is-
 raeli settlers were prevented from entering Palestinian-controlled zones.
 The Israeli Government restricted travel for some Israeli settlers, prohibiting
 them from entering sensitive locations in the West Bank. The Yesha Council, an
 umbrella group of settler organizations, reported that six Israelis were placed under
 administrative detention during the year.
 The Israeli Government requires all Palestinian residents in areas under its con-
 trol to obtain permits for foreign travel and has restricted the travel of some politi-
 cal activists. Bridge-crossing permits to Jordan may be obtained at post offices with-
 out a screening Rrocess. However, in the case of East Jerusalem Palestinians, the
 fear of losing one s residency is an obstacle to travel. Palestinian males between the
 ages of 16 and 25 who cross into Jordan must remain outside the occupied terri-
 tories for 9 months. Restriction on residence, tourist visas, reentry, and family re-
 unification apply only to Palestinian residents of the occupied territories. Israeli au-
 thorities sometimes refuse to renew the laissez-passers of Palestinians from the oc-
 cupied territories who live or work abroad, on the grounds that they have aban-
 doned their residences.
 Palestinians who live in the part of Jerusalem that was occupied during the 1967
 War generally do not accept Israeli citizenship. They are, therefore, issued a resi-
 dence permit, or Jerusalem ID card, by the Israeli Government. Israel applies the
 1952 Law of Permanent Residency and its 1974 amendments to Jerusalem identi-
 fication card holders. This law stipulates that a Jerusalem resident loses the right
 of residence if the resident leaves Israeli territory for more than 7 years, acquires
 nationality of another country, or acquires permanent residence in another country.
 Such persons are permitted to return only as tourists and are sometimes denied
 entry. The Israeli Government does not apply these same restrictions to Israeli citi-
 zens. Israeli government officials deny that more stringent enforcement of the Jeru-
 salem residency requirements in 1997 reflects a concerted policy to decrease the Pal-
 estinian population in the city. Human rights groups estimate that approximately
 5,000 Palestinian residents had their residency permits revoked in 1996 and 1997.
 Invoking the 1952 law, Israeli officials routinely tell Palestinian residents of Jeru-
 salem who possess other nationalities that they have to renounce their other nation-
 alities in order to retain the right to live in Jerusalem. Over 175 Palestinian-Ameri-
 cans have been told that they must renounce their U.S. citizenship in order to retain
 their Jerusalem residency.
 Israeli authorities also place restrictions on family reunification. Most Palestin-
 ians who were abroad before or during the 1967 War, or who have lost their resi-
 dence permits for other reasons, are not permitted to reside permanently with their
 families in Jerusalem or the occupied territories. Foreign-born spouses and children
 of Palestinian residents also experience difficulty in obtaining permission to reside
 
 
 1488
 with their family members. Only 1,500 family reunificatip permits have been is-
 sued since the Interim Agreement was signed in 1995.
 Israeli security singles out young (often unmarried) Palestinian males for more
 stringent restrictions than other Palestinians, citing them as more likely to be secu-
 rity risks. They are generally prohibited from working in Israel.
 The PA issues passports and identification cards for Palestinians residing in the
 West Bank and Gaza. Bearers of Palestinian passports do not need special exit per-
 mits from the PA, but do require reentry permits. They can travel both over the
 Allenby Bridge to Jordan and via Ben Gurion Airport in Israel. Palestinians who
 are Jerusalem residents may not obtain Palestinian passports and must obtain trav-
 el documents from the Government of Israel to travel abroad. Those wishing to trav-
 el to Jordan must leave their ID documents with Israeli authorities at the Allenby
 Bridge. There is also a requirement that Jerusalem Palestinians have a special per-
 mit to cross the Allenby Bridge, available for $40 (125 New Israeli Shekel-nis)
 from the Ministry of Interior. Palestinians, including Palestinian-Americans who are
 residents of the West Bank, the Gaza strip, or Jerusalem, are not allowed to cross
 at the Sheikh Hussein or Arava crossings with Jordan.
 Palestinians with passports from other countries are required by Israel to exit and
 enter (either via Ben Gurion or via land crossings) with a Palestinian passport. Is-
 rael asserts that the requirement results from the Interim Agreement. Palestinian
 officials dispute this interpretation and characterize this requirement as "harass-
 ment." On several occasions in 1997 following terrorist incidents, Israel has re-
 stricted foreign travel of all those who hold Palestinian passports. This has some-
 times resulted in Palestinians being unable to leave or to enter Israel. At all times,
 West Bank and Gazan Palestinians require a special permit, issued by Israel, to
 enter Jerusalem.
 The PA does not control its borders. All persons entering PA-controlled areas
 must be granted permission by Israel. The issue of Palestinian refugees is a matter
 to be discussed between Israel and the PA in final status negotiations.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Palestinian residents of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem chose their
 first popularly-elected government in 1996. They elected an 88-member Council and
 the Ra'ees (President or Chairman) of the Executive Authority of the Council. Yasir
 Arafat won almost 89 percent of the vote in a two-person race for Chairman. Some
 700 candidates ran for council seats. Council members were elected in multimember
 electoral districts. As many as 35 of the elected members were independent can-
 didates or critics of Arafat and his Fatah faction. International observers concluded
 that the election could be reasonably regarded as an accurate expression of the will
 of the voters, despite some irregularities. During the year, the Council debated nu-
 merous draft laws and some 168 resolutions. So me members of the Council com-
 plained of its relative lack of power in relation to the executive branch of govern-
 ment; the Council and the Executive Authority work within the boundaries set out
 in the 1995 Interim Agreement. The Council's mandate runs to mid-1999, the end
 of the interim period set out in the accords.
 Most Palestinians in Jerusalem do not recognize the jurisdiction of the Municipal-
 ity of Jerusalem. Less than 7 percent of Jerusalem's Palestinian population voted
 in the 1993 municipal elections. No Palestinian resident of Jerusalem sits on the
 city council.
 women are underrepresented in government and politics. There are 5 women in
 the 88-member Council, and 2 women serve in ministerial-level positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Many local groups-Israeli, Palestinian, and international-monitored the Israeli
 Government's human rights practices. The Israeli Government normally cooperates
 with human rights organizations; officials normally agree to meet with human
 rights monitors. The Israeli Government permits human rights groups to publish
 and hold press conferences.
 However, some individual human rights workers have been subjected to inter-
 ference. A fieldwork coordinator for the Palestinian human rights organization Al-
 Haq was arrested by Israel and has been detained without charge since February
 1996.
 The Israeli Government withheld its cooperation from the U.N. Special Committee
 to Investigate Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and
 Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories. The Special Committee was unable to visit
 
 
 1489
 the occupied territories and reported that the Government of Israel did not respond
 to communications addressed to it on the matter.
 Many local human rights groups-mostly Palestinian-as well as several inter-
 national human rights organizations monitored the PA's human rights practices.
 The PA generally cooperates with these organizations and PA officials normally
 meet with their representatives. Several Palestinian human rights organizations
 work behind the scenes with the PA to overcome abusive practices in certain areas.
 They also publish criticism if they believe that the PA is not responding adequately
 to private entreaties. In December the West Bank intelligence service lifted a 6-
 month ban on visits to its prisons by lawyers of one human rights group.
 The ICRC operates in the PA areas under the terms of a memorandum of under-
 standing signed in September 1996 between the ICRC and the PLO. The memoran-
 dum accords the ICRC access to all detainees held by the PA and allows regular
 inspections of prison conditions. In accordance with the agreement, the ICRC -con-
 ducted routine visits of PA-run prison facilities and to PA-held prisoners throughout
 the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Under the complex mixture of laws and regulations that apply to the occupied ter-
 ritories, Palestinians are disadvantaged under Israeli law and practices compared
 with the treatment received by Israeli settlers. This includes discrimination in resi-
 dency, land use, and access to health and social services.
 Women.-The problems of rape, domestic violence, and violence related to "family
 honor" have gained greater prominence in the Palestinian community, but public
 discussion is generally muted. Victims are often encouraged by relatives to remain
 quiet and are themselves punished or blamed for the "shame" that has been brought
 upon them and their families. Women's groups seek to educate women on these
 problems, but women's rights advocates claim that few resources are available to
 shelter the victims of violence. They also maintain that society has not been recep-
 tive to providing counseling or outreach services to victims of problems that they
 see as more widespread than is acknowledged. According to women's groups, there
 are no reliable data on the incidence of violence against women. Spousal abuse, sex-
 ual abuse, and "honor killings" occur, but societal pressures prevent most incidents
 from being reported, and most cases are dealt with informally by family members.
 Palestinian women in both the Israeli- and PA-controlled areas of the occupied
 territories endure various forms of social prejudice and repression within their own
 society. Because of early marriage, girls frequently do not finish the mandatory level
 of schooling. Cultural restrictions sometimes prevent them from attending colleges
 and universities. While there is an active women's movement in the West Bank, at-
 tention has only recently shifted from nationalist aspirations to issues that greatly
 affect women such as domestic violence, equal access to.education and employment,
 and laws concerning marriage and inheritance.
 A growing number of Palestinian women work outside the home, where they tend
 to encounter discrimination. There are no special laws providing for women's rights
 in the workplace. Women are underrepresented in most aspects of professional . fe.
 Despite the fact that there is a small group of women who are prominent in politics,
 medicine, law, teaching, and in nongovernmental organizations, women for the most
 part are seriously underrepresented in the decisionmaking positions in these fields.
 Personal status law for Palestinians is based on religious law. For Muslim Pal-
 estinians, personal status law is derived from Shari'a (Islamic law). In the West
 Bank and Gaza, Shari'a law pertaining to women is part of the Jordanian Status
 Law of 1976, which includes inheritance and marriage laws. Under the law, women
 inherit less than male members of the family. The marriage law allows men to take
 more than one wife, although few.do so. Women are permitted to make "stipula-
 tions" to protect them against divorce and questions of child custody. However, only
 an estimated 1 percent of women take advantage of this section of the law, leaving
 most women at a disadvantage when it comes to divorce or child custody. Following
 legal protests, the PA Ministry of Civil Affairs in 1996 rescinded a law requiring
 women to obtain the written consent of a male family member before it would issue
 them a travel document.
 Children.-The PA requires compulsory education up to 12 years of age. Current
 British Mandate, Jordanian, and military laws, from which West Bank and Gaza
 law is derived, offer protection to children under the Labor and Penal Codes. While
 there is no juvenile court system, judges specializing in children's cases generally
 sit for juvenile offenders. In cases where the child is the victim, Judges have the dis-
 cretion to remove the child from a situation deemed harmful. However, the system
 is not advanced in the protection afforded children.

 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children among Palestinians.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no mandated accessibility to public facilities in
 the occupied territories under either Israeli or Palestinian authority. Approximately
 130,000 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are disabled. Some Pa estinian in-
 stitutions care for and train disabled persons; their efforts, however, are chronically
 underfunded. Many Palestinians with disabilities are segregated and isolated from
 Palestinian society;, they are discriminated against in most spheres, including edu-
 cation, employment, transportation, and access to public buildings and facilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Labor affairs in the West Bank came under Palestin-
 ian responsibility with the signing of the Interim Agreement in September 1995.
 Until a- new law being drafted by PA authorities comes into effect, labor affairs in
 the West Bank are governed by Jordanian Law 21 of 1965, as amended by Israeli
 military orders, and in Gaza by PA decisions. The law permits workers to establish
 and join unions without government authorization. The earlier Israeli stipulation
 that all proposed West Bank unions apply for a permit is no Ion ger enforced. No
 new unions were established in 1997. Israeli authorities previously have licensed
 about 35 of the estimated 185 union branches now in existence. There are almost
 30 licensed trade unions in the West Bank and 6 in Gaza.
 Palestinian workers in Jerusalem are governed by Israeli labor law. They are free
 to establish their own unions. Although the Government restricts Jerusalem unions
 from joining West Bank trade union federations, this restriction has not been en-
 forced. Palestinian workers in Jerusalem may belong simultaneously to unions affili-
 ated with West Bank federations and the Israeli Histadrut Labor Federation.
 West Bank unions are not affiliated with the Israeli Histadrut federation. Pal-
 estinians who work in Israel or Jerusalem are not full members of Histadrut, but
 they are required to contribute 1 percent of their wages to Histadrut. Negotiations
 between Histadrut and West Bank union officials to return half of this fee to the
 Palestinian Union Federation were completed in 1995, but funds have yet to be
 transferred.
 Palestinians who work in Israel are required to contribute to the National Insur-
 ance Institute (NIl), which provides unemployment insurance and other benefits.
 Palestinian workers are eligible for some, but not all, NII benefits. According to the
 Interim Agreement, Palestinians working in Israel continue to be insured for inju-
 ries occurring in Israel, the bankruptcy of a worker's employer, and allowances for
 maternity leave. The Israeli Government agreed to transfer the NII fees collected
 from Palestinian workers to the PA, which is to assume responsibility for the pen-.
 sions and social benefits of Palestinians working in Israel. Implementation of this
 change is still underway.
 The great majority of West Bank unions belong to the Palestinian General Fed-
 eration of Trade Unions (PGFTU). The PGFTU acted as the informal coalition in
 the completion of the negotiations with Histadrut regarding workers' fees. The reor-
 ganization of unions under the PGFTU is intended to enable the West Bank unions
 and Gaza unions to better represent the union members' interests; the reorganiza-
 tion had not yet been finalized at year's end.
 An estimated 86,000 workers are members of the PGFTU, the largest union bloc.
 The PGFTU estimates actual organized membership, i.e., dues-paying members, at
 about 30 percent of all Palestinian workers.
 No unions were dissolved by administrative or legislative action during the year.
 Palestinian unions seeking to strike must submit to arbitration by the PA Ministry
 of Labor. If the union disagrees with the final arbitration and strikes, a tribunal
 of senior judges appointed by the PA decides what, if any, disciplinary action is to
 be taken. There are no laws in the territories that specifically protect the rights of
 striking workers, and in practice, such workers have little or no protection from an
 employer's retribution.
 In March 25 members of the teachers union, who went on strike over low wages,
 were imprisoned for 40 days in Nablus and Ramallah.
 The PGFTU has applied for membership in the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-A majority of workers in the
 occupied territories are self-employed or unpaid family helpers in agriculture or
 commerce. Only 35 percent of employment in the territories consists of wage jobs,
 most with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the PA, or in
 municipalities. Collective bargaining is protected. Labor disputes are adjudicated by
 committees of 3 to 5 members in businesses employing more than 20 workers.
 Existing laws and regulations do not offer real protection against antiunion dis-
 crimination. One industrial zone is being developed in the Gaza Strip.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-PA law does not specifically pro-
 hibit forced or compulsory labor, including by children.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum working age in the West Bank and Gaza is 14 years, but most observers agree
 that a significant number of Palestinian children under the ae of 16 years, and
 many under the age of 12 years, are engaged in some work activities. Most of this
 employment is believed to involve work on family farms, in family shops, or as
 urban street hawkers. Some employment of children is also reported to occur in
 small manufacturing enterprises, such as shoe and textile factories. The law does
 not specifically prhiit forced or compulsory labor by children (see Section 6.c.).
 The PA's capacity to enforce existing laws is limited, with only 40 labor inspectors
 to inspect an estimated 65,000 enterprises. The International Labor Organzation
 and UNICEF are working with the PAX to study the nature and extent of the prob-
 lem and to develop the capacity to enforce and update child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-_There is currently noouinimum wage in the
 West Bank or Gaza areas. In the West Bank, the normal work week is 48 hours
 in most areas; in Gaza the work week is 45 hours for day laborers and 40 hours
 for salaried employees. There is no effective enforcement of maximum work week
 laws.
 The PA Ministry of Labor is responsible for inspcting work places and enforcing
 safety standards in the West Bank and Gaza. The Ministry of Labor says that
 newer factories and work places meet international health and safety standards but
 that older ones fail to meet minimum standards. There is no specific legal protection
 afforded workers that allows them to remove themselves from an unhealthy or un-
 safe work setting without risking loss of employment.
