 CYPRUS
 Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish military intervention
 of 1974, following a coup d'etat directed from Greece. Since
 then, the southern part of the country has been under the
 control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, and the
 northern part under an autonomous Turkish Cypriot administration
 supported by the presence of Turkish troops. In 1983 that
 administration proclaimed itself the "Turkish Republic of
 Northern Cyprus," which is recognized only by Turkey.
 The internal political systems of the Republic of Cyprus and
 the Turkish Cypriot administration are democratic, based on
 free elections, and accord basic human rights to their
 populations both in law and in practice.
 Both Cypriot economies are based on free enterprise, private
 initiative, and the right to own property. The Greek Cypriot
 economy has prospered in recent years, particularly in the
 tourism and manufacturing sectors, and continued to be strong
 in 1991 despite the effects of the Gulf War. The weaker
 economy in the Turkish Cypriot area, closely linked to that of
 Turkey, was~depressed in 1991 due to the combined effects of
 sustained drought, the Gulf War, the collapse of a major
 Turkish Cypriot business conglomerate, and Turkey's clampdown
 on duty-free goods imported from northern Cyprus.
 Conflict between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities
 during the 1963-74 period, the Turkish intervention in 1974,
 and the subsequent presence of Turkish troops in the north
 resulted in the uprooting of Greek Cypriots and Turkish
 Cypriots from the northern and southern parts of the island,
 respectively. The resultant loss of lives, homes, and
 livelihoods has led to continuing charges of human rights
 violations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or extrajudicial killings in
 1991.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of persons abducted, secretly arrested,
 or held in clandestine detention during 1991.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community specifically prohibit torture.
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is provided for in law and respected in practice in
 both communities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Laws providing for freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention
 are respected in practice by the Government of Cyprus and
 Turkish Cypriot authorities. No one may be held for more than
 I day for investigation of a crime without referral of the case
 
 
 1079
 CYPRUS
 to the courts for extension of the period of detention. Most
 periods of investigative detention do not exceed 8 to 10 days
 before formal charges are filed. Attorneys have unimpeded
 access to detainees. Exile is specifically prohibited by the
 Cyprus Constitution and by the basic document governing the
 Turkish Cypriot community..
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In both-parts of Cyprus, fair public trial is provided for in
 law and accorded in practice. The judiciary is independent of
 executive or military control. --Defendants have the right to be
 present at their trials, to be represented by counsel (at
 government expense for those who cannot afford one), to confront
 witnesses, and to present evidence in their own defense. Cases
 are generally tried before a judge or panel of judges, although
 a request for a jury trial is usually granted. There are no
 special courts to deal with security or political offenses. On
 the Turkish Cypriot side, civilians deemed to have violated
 military zones are subject to trial in a military court.- These
 courts consist of one military and two civilian-judges and a
 civilian prosecutor. There are no political prisoners in
 Cyprus.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both the Cyprus Constitution .and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community-include provisions protecting the
 individual against arbitrary interference by the authorities.
 A judicial warrant is required, for example, for a police
 official to enter a private residence. Abuses of privacy run
 counter to the democratic traditions of both communities.
 However, Turkish Cypriots continue to complain that mail coming
 through the Republic of Cyprus postal system is delayed or not
 delivered.
 Section. 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press"
 These rights are provided for by law and are freely practiced
 throughout the island. The press is free and represents the
 entire political spectrum. .There is no press censorship. Greek
 Cypriot authorities do, however, exercise monopoly control over
 local television broadcasting, while Turkish Cypriot authorities
 do so over both radio and television. Cable services offering
 Cable News Network and other international broadcasts are
 available throughout the island. The Cypriot House of
 Representatives adopted a law in 1990 authorizing private
 broadcasting, and several privately owned radio stations have
 commenced operations. With the passage of further implementing
 legislation, expected sometime in 1992, this law is expected to
 end monopoly control, over television broadcasting in the part
 of the island under government control. In addition, the
 proliferation of party and independent newspapers and
 periodicals in both communities enables ideas and arguments to
 circulate freely. Opposition papers .on both sides of the
 island frequently criticize the authorities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to associate, organize, and hold meetings is
 protected by law and respected in practice.

 CYPRUS
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is respected in Cyprus. In the south, the
 vast majority of the population is Greek Orthodox; in the north,
 Sunni Muslim. The Greek Orthodox Church in the south has the
 character of a state institution; all its activities and
 holdings are exempt from taxation. Missionaries are permitted
 to proselytize in both communities, although both Greek Cypriot
 and Turkish Cypriot authorities closely monitor missionary
 activities.
 Approximately 100 Turkish Cypriots who still live in the south
 of the island are allowed to practice their religion freely.
 In the north, non-Muslims include approximately 700 Greek
 Cypriots, over 300 Christian Maronites, and some foreign
 residents--all of whom are free to practice their religions.
 The only incident of religious controversy recorded in 1991 was
 an attempt by Greek Cypriots to stop construction of a minaret
 at the mosque in Cyprus's only remaining mixed village. The
 dispute was settled peacefully when the U.N. intermediary
 convinced the Greek Cypriots that the minaret would not be used
 as an advance observation post for the Turkish forces on the
 island, and the Turkish Cypriots agreed to lower its planned
 height.
 Persons who conscientiously object to military service on
 religious grounds are required by the Cyprus Government to
 carry out unarmed military service or face imprisonment. A new
 law, passed on January 9, 1992, allows alternative nonmilitary
 service for conscientious objectors: either 34 months of
 unarmed military service or 42 months of Civil Defense Force or
 social service, compared to 26 months of military service.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Turkish and Greek Cypriots enjoy general freedom of movement
 within their respective areas. Turkish Cypriot authorities
 regulate travel into and out of the Turkish Cypriot area. In
 general, they have barred Greeks, Greek Cypriots, and sometimes
 third-country nationals with Greek surnames from entering the
 north, and Turkish Cypriots from visiting the south. The
 applications of Greek Cypriot residents of enclaves in the
 north to visit the south are usually granted, but the applicants
 must return within a designated period or risk losing their
 right to return, along with their property. A representative
 of a Greek Cypriot enclave has complained that applications to
 visit the south are processed slowly by the Turkish Cypriot
 authorities--sometimes taking up to 15 days for approval.
 Foreigners coming from the south must obtain permission to
 enter the north. The Government of Cyprus has sometimes barred
 foreign tourists from crossing into the north for certain
 periods in retaliation for Turkish Cypriot policies and actions,
 such as the 1990 detentions of Greek Cypriot youths by Turkish
 Cypriot authorities. The Government of Cyprus has barred travel
 to the north by foreigners intending to depart the island from
 the Turkish Cypriot area. At the same time, it bars entry into
 the Greek Cypriot area by foreigners who have entered Cyprus at
 Turkish Cypriot ports of entry.
 The right to travel abroad and to emigrate is observed, although
 persons facing military service or legal action in either part
 of Cyprus may not travel without-specific permission. Turkish
 Cypriots have difficulty in traveling to some countries because
 
 
 1081
 CYPRUS
 travel documents issued by the Turkis..Cypriot authorities are
 not generally recognized. Usually in such cases, they travel
 on.Turkish passports provided by means of a special arrangement
 with'Turkey. Citizens may repatriate freely.
 The Government of Cyprus does not accept third-country refugees
 for resettlement in Cyprus on the grounds that it already has
 enough responsibilities in caring for the Greek Cypriots
 displaced after the 1974 Turkish intervention. The Greek
 Cypriot authorities prefer that they make their claims
 elsewhere and generally endeavor to remove or deport all such
 third-country refugee claimants to their country of embarkation
 or to a country that will accept them as refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Both the Government of Cyprus and the administration of the
 Turkish Cypriot community have lively multiparty political
 systems. Parties compete for popular support actively and
 without restriction. Suffrage is universal, and elections are
 held by secret ballot. Elections for the- office of President  -
 of the Republic of Cyprus are held every 5 years, and for the
 House of Representatives every 5 years or less.
 The Turkish Cypriots elect a leader and a representative body
 every 5 years or less. Such elections were last held in 1990.
 Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north--the latter
 having chosen-before independence in 1960 to be regarded as
 members of the Greek Cypriot community--do not participate in
 Turkish Cypriot elections but elect theirown village officials.
 They are eligible to vote in Greek Cypriot elections but must
 travel to the south in order to exercise that right.'
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are organizations in both parts of the island which
 consider themselves human rights groups, but all appear to be
 primarily concerned with alleged violations of the rights of
 members of their community by the other community. There are
 no restrictions preventing the formation of human rights groups
 in either part of the island.
 The question of human rights in Cyprus is closely connected to
 the political differences that divide the two communities.
 Each group continues to blame the other for alleged human
 rights abuses stemming from the events in 1974. Representatives
 of international human rights organizations have access to both
 the south and the north.
 In March the European Commission on Human Rights accepted
 petitions from two Greek Cypriots who charged that Turkey
 deprived them illegally of their liberty when Turkish Cypriot
 authorities arrested and held them for 12 days after they
 entered the buffer zone during a demonstration in July 1989.
 U.N. officials have described the entry into the buffer zone by
 over 1,000 Greek Cypriots during the demonstration as a
 "violation of the status quo," which the United Nations Force
 in Cyprus (UNFICYP) is charged to maintain. 'The demonstrators
 clashed with some 100 UNFICYP personnel who had formed a cordon
 to prevent the Greek Cypriots from proceeding. UNFICYP
 persuaded the majority of the demonstrators to return home.
 
 
 1082
 CYPRUS
 The Commission also agreed in March to accept a petition from a
 Greek Cypriot contending that she has been denied the peaceful
 enjoyment of her property in Cyprus since Turkey's intervention
 in 1974. The Commission limited its consideration of her
 petition to the period since 1987, the year Turkey acceded to
 the European Convention on Human Rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, education, and health care are usually available
 to members of both communities and the tiny Maronite, Armenian,
 and Latin minorities, regardless of race, religion, ethnic
 background, or political opinion. Nevertheless, there are
 continuing complaints that the welfare of minorities in the
 north is impaired by Turkish Cypriot restrictions on housing,
 education, and movement. For example, Greek Cypriot students
 studying in the south continue to have difficulty obtaining
 permission to spend their holidays with their families in
 enclaves in the north. U.N. officials indicate that Greek
 Cypriots in the north are unable to travel outside their
 communities without Turkish Cypriot authorization. U.N.
 officials point out that they also receive complaints of human
 rights violations from Turkish Cypriots living in the south
 who, they say, are unable to speak with U.N. officials unless a
 police officer is present.
 The Cyprus Red Cross sends supplies weekly to Greek Cypriots
 remaining in the north; this effort is coordinated by UNFICYP
 and financed largely by the United States. UNFICYP monitors
 the welfare of the Greek Cypriots and Maronites in the north,
 as well as that of the Turkish Cypriots in the south.
 Throughout Cyprus, women generally have the same legal status
 as men. In the north, legal provisions requiring equal pay for
 men and women performing the same job are effectively enforced.
 In the south, government workers receive equal pay for equal
 work, regardless of sex. In October 1989, a law was passed
 requiring equality of pay between men and women working in the
 private sector. The 3-year grace period for full implementation
 expires in October 1992. Meanwhile, private sector employers,
 who hope to be in full compliance by October 1992, have begun
 gradually to implement the law.
 Social taboos, traditions, and family honor shroud incidents of
 wife and family abuse in Cyprus. Moreover, it is understood
 that police files on incidents of domestic violence are
 sometimes destroyed under the pretext that these are "personal
 matters." Nevertheless, the Crisis Center for Family Violence,
 a private organization in the south, has indicated that the
 number of reported domestic abuse cases, including wife beating,
 is on the rise. The Crisis Center, as well as several other
 support groups, was established in part to draw public attention
 to this problem and to encourage government action in dealing
 with it. Neither the Government of Cyprus nor the Turkish
 Cypriot authorities have made pronouncements or taken specific
 action on this issue.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unions and confederations are free to organize in both
 the north and south. In late 1990; the Government of Cyprus
 amended its trade union laws to allgw trade unions to elect
 
 
 1083
 CYPRUS
 their leaders regardless of whether or not they are union
 members--a previous source of contention with the International
 Labor Organization (ILO).
 Almost 85 percent of Greek Cypriot workers and 40-50 percent of
 Turkish Cypriot workers belong to independent trade unions.
 Union officials in the north, however, allege that the. ruling
 party tends to exert its influence to split the labor movement,
 especially in the public sector, by supporting the establishment
 of rival unions. In both communities, trade unions freely and
 regularly take stands on public policy issues affecting workers.
 All Cypriot workers have the right to strike. Strikes usually.
 are of short duration. Both the Government of Cyprus and the
 Turkish Cypriot authorities have the power to curtail strikes
 in what they deem to be "essential services." The Government
 of Cyprus has-used these regulations in the past to intervene
 during strikes involving port workers. At its 1991 meeting,
 the ILO Committee of Experts renewed its earlier observation
 that "essential services" should be more strictly interpreted
 in Cyprus as those whose interruptions would endanger the life,
 personal safety, or health of the whole or part of the
 population.
 Unions in both parts of Cyprus freely take part in international
 meetings. Most unions are affiliated either with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions or with the
 Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions. Labor
 unions, more than most other organizations on Cyprus, attempt
 to maintain contact and cooperation across the dividing line.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 By law and in actual practice, trade unions and confederations
 are free to organize and to bargain collectively in both parts
 of Cyprus. In both the north and the south, parties to a
 dispute may request mediation by the authorities. In both
 sectors, legislation prohibiting dismissal for participation in
 trade union activity is effectively enforced.
 Small export processing zones exist in Larnaca in the south and
 Famagusta in the north, but the laws governing working
 conditions and actual practice are uniform throughout the
 country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and no
 instances were reported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Government of Cyprus has set the minimum age for employment
 of children in an "industrial undertaking" at age 16. In the
 north, the age is 15. The law is effectively enforced in both
 sectors by government labor inspectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is a legislated minimum wage in the south which is renewed
 every year and covers clerks, salespersons, nursery assistants,
 practical nurses, and hairdressers. The legislated minimum
 wage is not sufficient to provide an adequate living for a
 worker and his family. All other occupations are covered under
 collective bargaining agreements between trade unions and
 
 
 1084
 CYPRUS
 employers within the same economic sector, and the minimum
 wages set in these agreements are at least $100 more per month
 than the legislated minimum wage. The legislated minimum wage
 in the north, which is renewed annually after tripartite
 negotiations, is more broadly applicable. It would not be
 adequate to support a worker and his family, although most
 workers earn more than the minimum wage.
 The Government of Cyprus sets 40 hours as the maximum number of
 hours of work per week except for shop workers and drivers, for
 whom the legal limit is 42 hours. In the north, the maximum
 number of hours of work per week in the winter is 38 and in the
 summer 36. These laws are effectively enforced by government
 labor inspectors.
 Although in both sectors the standards are not equivalent to
 those in Western industrialized countries, occupational safety
 and health regulations are administered effectively. In both
 sectors, an Inspector of Factories receives and processes
 complaints and inspects factories and businesses in order to
 ensure that occupational safety laws are observed. Workers who
 file complaints are protected by law and the court system in
 the Greek Cypriot sector but not in the Turkish Cypriot
 sector. In both sectors, however, workers risk losing their
 jobs if they unilaterally remove themselves from a position
 which they believe endangers their health.
