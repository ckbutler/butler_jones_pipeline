 THE BAHAMAS
 The Bahamas is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy with
 regular national elections. As a Commonwealth country, its
 political and legal traditions are similar to those of Great
 Britain, with emphasis on the rights of individuals. The
 Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) has governed since 1967 under
 the same leader, Sir Lynden 0. Pindling.
 The police and small defense force generally are well regarded
 by the populace but, like other elements of the society, have
 experienced some drug-related corruption. A rally of more
 than 15,000 Bahamians took place in September to protest
 growing drug abuse and the illegal sale and trafficking of
 narcotics in the country. Violent crime remains a serious
 social problem.
 The country has a tradition of human rights observance. The
 Constitution provides for the protection of fundamental rights
 and freedoms without discrimination by reason of sex, race,
 religion, origin, or political opinion, and its provisions
 normally are observed. However, treatment of illegal Haitian
 migrants sometimes has led to concern for their safety and
 well-being. In March a large rally in Nassau sponsored by a
 human rights coalition protested mass arrests and conditions
 of detention following the first of several roundups of
 Haitians living illegally in The Bahamas.
 The country's human rights record remained relatively good in
 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of killings for political motives.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such practices are prohibited by the Constitution. However,
 police brutality, particularly in the course of arrests or
 obtaining confessions to a crime, remains a problem. Bahamian
 and American detainees reported instances of such abuse in
 1986. In February a Haitian national died while in police
 custody following beatings reportedly administered in the
 course of an investigation of a theft. Nassau's downtown jail
 is crowded and dirty, and the food barely adequate. The
 Freeport Central Lockup is unsanitary.
 The Supreme Court in September heard a case involving a
 question whether detention conditions for illegal Haitian
 immigrants at Fox Hill prison in Nassau were in violation of
 fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The
 justice presiding characterized the prison's conditions as
 constituting a "highly unpleasant environment" and urged the
 authorities to improve the situation.

 THE BAHAMAS
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment
 and requires that persons be charged without undue delay. The
 right to a judicial determination of the legality of detention
 is recognized; charges are normally brought within 48 hours of
 arrest. Arrested persons are usually allowed access to an
 attorney of their own choosing.
 On several occasions, government enforcement authorities have
 carried out mass arrests of Haitians under nonspecific
 warrants. This has resulted in the erroneous arrest of
 legally resident Haitians and of Bahamians mistaken for
 Haitians, in addition to illegally resident Haitians.
 Following one mass arrest of 103 Haitians in May, arraignment
 procedures precluded about half of those detained from
 consulting with an attorney.
 Haitians detained on immigration infractions are routinely
 denied bail on the apparent supposition that they would flee
 prior to prosecution. In two cases, Haitians detained for 5
 weeks following their arrests in May were found to have no
 charges filed against them, and were ordered freed. In
 another case a woman married to a Bahamian was sentenced to 1
 month's imprisonment for originally entering the country
 illegally, but she was detained 5 months until freed in a
 court action brought by an attorney associated with the Human
 Rights Association. Several groups of Haitians were subjected
 to indeterminate detention awaiting deportation while the
 Governments of The Bahamas and Haiti consulted on procedures
 to implement their 1985 treaty on repatriation.
 Detention by police in July of the Haitian consul on a parking
 violation underlined the sensitivity of relations between
 Bahamian law enforcement officials and the Haitian community.
 The consul reportedly was manhandled, verbally abused, and
 brought to the police station in spite of his having shown his
 diplomatic identification card. Although the Government later
 apologized for the incident, the cabinet minister responsible
 publicly defended the police.
 In a case unrelated to illegal immigration, two Haitian men
 originally charged with the murder of another Haitian in
 December 1983 were found to be still in detention and awaiting
 trial 2 1/2 years after arrest. When the situation came to
 light, the Government dropped the charges.
 Forced or compulsory labor is specifically prohibited by the
 Constitution and is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 An independent judiciary conducts fair and public trials.
 There are no political prisoners. Legal representation at
 public expense is provided only for capital cases. The
 Constitution entitles defendants to counsel and attorneys are
 given free access to defendants. These protections have not
 always been afforded to Haitians detained on immigration
 charges. The Human Rights Committee of the Bahamas Bar
 Association, following the its investigation of arrests of
 Haitians, exonerated the Government of brutality charges.
 Nonetheless, it severely criticized the mass arraignment of
 those arrested, calling the practice contrary to the Civil
 Procedure Code.
 
 
 396
 THE BAHAMAS
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not interfere in the private lives of its
 citizens. The sanctity of the home is safeguarded both by law
 and tradition and is normally respected in practice. The
 Constitution permits searches only with court-issued warrants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press exist in The Bahamas. There are
 three privately owned daily newspapers--two in Nassau and one
 in Freeport--one government-owned radio station, and one
 government-owned television station. There are no privately
 owned broadcasting facilities. There are several
 newsweeklies, some of which are affiliated with political
 parties, including the Marxist Vanguard Party. There is no
 political censorship or intimidation of journalists. The
 press freely reports public and parliamentary debate on a
 variety of issues. However, it frequently refrains from
 printing the names of those publicly criticized because of the
 country's stringent libel laws. Based on such laws, the
 editor of the opposition party's newsweekly was formally
 charged in court in December with criminal libel; a headline
 on an article in his publication, alluding to corruption
 allegations involving the Prime Minister, asked the question:
 "The Country Wants to Know, Is the Chief Still a Thief?" The
 editor faces trial.
 While the press is free, opposing points of view are not
 accorded fair radio and television treatment by the
 government-owned broadcasting corporation (ZNS). The
 Government and the ruling party receive favorable treatment,
 at the expense of the opposition party and dissidents within
 the ruling party. The opposition party is prohibited by 1965
 legislation from purchasing air time to broadcast its views,
 other than one 15-minute spot each year. It was prevented
 from having its January convention broadcast live, even though
 it was willing to pay for the air time.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution protects the right to associate freely and
 specifically mentions political parties and trade unions.
 Labor unions are independent of the Government and are free to
 organize, bargain, and strike. Many unions are affiliated
 with counterparts in other countries and are represented in
 the International Labor Organization. Labor leaders are vocal
 in criticizing labor laws, especially where the laws fail to
 protect workers from unfair dismissals, insure severance pay,
 and permit unions to represent workers before arbitration
 tribunals.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion, freedom of conscience is
 protected, and discrimination on the basis of creed is
 prohibited. Some members of the small Rastafarian cult
 believe they are singled out for persecution by the police;
 the police deny their allegations.
 
 
 397
 THE BAHAMAS
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within The Bahamas, and citizens
 may freely travel abroad. There are no state restrictions
 regarding the right to change residence or workplace.
 However, there is considerable controversy regarding the
 repatriation of both displaced Haitian nationals resident in
 The Bahamas--estimated to number 20,000 to 40,000--and
 Haitians shipwrecked in Bahamian waters.
 In 1985 the Governments of The Bahamas and Haiti signed a
 treaty outlining the conditions under which some Haitians with
 long residence and other ties to The Bahamas could receive
 legal status. The treaty simultaneously specified a 2-month
 amnesty period for voluntary repatriation without prosecution,
 while making provisions for orderly, humane repatriation of
 the remainder of the displaced Haitians. While over 300
 Haitians were involuntarily repatriated and approximately
 2,400 Haitians voluntarily returned to Haiti in 1986, it
 appears that no Haitians have been accorded legal status under
 the terms of the treaty; the few cases settled in 1986 appear
 to predate the treaty.
 Official Bahamian Government policy continued to imperil the
 health and safety of displaced Haitians aboard unseaworthy or
 shipwrecked vessels in Bahamian territorial waters. On Ocean
 Cay in January and Cay Verde in February, the Government
 declined to accept its international responsibility to aid
 distressed mariners. In the former case, a U.S.-owned company
 operating on Ocean Cay had to feed 51 stranded Haitians and
 negotiate with the Bahamian and Haitian Governments over
 repatriation. In the latter case, emergency action by the
 U.S. Coast Guard was necessary to aid eight stranded Haitians.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Bahamas is a constitutional democracy governed by an
 elected Prime Minister and Parliament, with a resident
 Governor General under the British Commonwealth system. The
 political process is open to all elements of the society.
 There are two principal political parties, the governing
 Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) and the opposition Free
 National Movement (FNM). The PLP led the country for 5 years
 of internal self-government before independence in 1973 and
 has held power without interruption since. It currently holds
 32 of the 43 seats in Parliament. The FNM, a more
 conservative party, holds the other 11 seats. The radical
 leftist party, the Vanguard, has no seats. The last general
 election was in 1982; new elections need not take place before
 August 1987 but can be called sooner.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests from international organizations
 to investigate human rights conditions in The Bahamas. The
 Government generally has not been active in human rights
 affairs.
 
 
 398
 THE BAHAMAS
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Bahamas has a good record of nondiscrimination on grounds
 of sex, race, and religion. Notwithstanding the transfer of
 political power from the white elite to a black majority at
 the end of the colonial era in the 1960's, white Bahamians
 retain a visible presence in the country, hold high-level
 civil service and political posts, and are represented in
 Parliament.
 Women participate prominently at all levels of Government and
 business and are well represented in professional and private
 sectors. Women are serving in the executive branch as
 permanent secretaries, the highest positions in the civil
 service, in the legislative branch in elected capacities, and
 in the judicial branch. The Constitution makes several
 distinctions between the sexes regarding citizenship. For
 example, female Bahamians may not bestow citizenship upon
 their spouses, while male Bahamians may do so.  Women's
 rights activists have stated that Bahamian law also puts women
 at a disadvantage concerning child care, inheritance, and
 property ownership.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Although there is no minimum wage law in The Bahamas, wages
 offered are generally considered to provide for decent living
 conditions. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1970 states that
 employers cannot permit their employees to work more than 48
 hours per week. It does not, however, address the question of
 child labor, but the employment of children is effectively
 discouraged by the requirement of compulsory education until
 the age of 14 years.
 Although there is no specific legislation dealing with worker
 safety, the Director of Labor regularly checks all work places
 for lighting, safety, ventilation, and machine protection
 guards. Employers cooperate with these inspections and in
 implementing recommended safety meansures.
 
 
 399
 BARBADOS
 A member of the British Commonwealth, Barbados is a
 constitutional democracy with a free, two-party democratic
 system of government. Its House of Assembly is the third
 oldest elected body in the Western Hemisphere. Barbadians
 recognize the Queen of England as Head of State; she is
 represented by an appointed Governor General. The Prime
 Minister is the Head of Government.
 The Royal Barbados Police Force ensures public order; it
 respects constitutional and legal guarantees of human rights.
 Its personnel and training have improved in recent years.
 Police morale is good, and public respect for the police force
 is high. The volunteer Barbados Defence Force is responsible
 for national security, but is used for public order in times
 of crisis, emergency, or other specific need. Barbados has a
 well-established judicial system based on common law and
 British procedure.
 The country's economy is based on light manufacturing,
 tourism, services, and sugar.
 There were no changes in Barbados' excellent human rights
 record during 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No killings for political motives were reported.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there
 were no reports in 1986 of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. Prison conditions are humane.
 Prison facilities were expanded in 1986 to accommodate
 increased numbers of inmates charged with drug-related
 crimes. A separate facility was also built for prisoners held
 on charges for civil debts, thereby separating them from
 prisoners held on criminal charges.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment,
 and this prohibition is respected in practice. The
 Constitution also requires the authorities to bring detainees
 before a court of law within 72 hours of arrest. Criminal
 defendants have the right to counsel, and attorneys have ready
 access to their clients.
 The use of any form of forced or compulsory labor is
 prohibited by law and that prohibition is respected.
 
 
 400
 BARBADOS
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that persons charged with criminal
 offenses be given a fair, public hearing within a reasonable
 time by an independent and impartial court. Defendants are
 presumed innocent until proven guilty. The Government
 provides free legal aid to the indigent. The judiciary acts
 independently and is free of intervention from other branches
 of government. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not interfere arbitrarily in the private
 lives of its citizens. The Constitution prohibits arbitrary
 entry, search, or seizure, and the law requires warrants to be
 issued before privately owned property can be entered and
 searched. The Government neither censors the mail nor
 restricts the receipt of foreign correspondence or
 publications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and press, and
 these rights are respected in practice. The Caribbean
 Broadcasting Corporation Radio and Television Service is
 government owned, but is independent of government control.
 Views opposing government policies are regularly reported.
 The Government often comes under attack on two popular daily
 call-in radio programs.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government observes the constitutional guarantees of
 peaceful assembly and private association. Political parties,
 trade associations, and private organizations function without
 government hindrance.
 Workers have the right to organize, to bargain collectively,
 and to strike. Fifty-five percent of the labor force is
 organized, and protests or strikes have occurred when
 collective bargaining has failed. Although the major union
 has strong ties with the governing party, and its four
 principal officers are parliamentarians, labor leaders and
 rank-and-file trade union members are motivated primarily by
 economic and social rather than political considerations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is full freedom of religion. While Anglican and
 Methodist faiths have traditionally predominated, there are
 numerous other religious denominations and organizations
 active throughout the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens and legal residents move freely within and outside
 Barbados, a right guaranteed by the Constitution. Barbados
 has a small number of applicants for admission as refugees;
 these applicants are handled on a case-by-case basis.
 
 
 401
 BARBADOS
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In Barbados' parliamentary democracy, parties compete freely
 in honest elections held at least every 5 years. There are no
 impediments to participation in the political process;
 Barbadians over age 18 enjoy universal suffrage.
 The present Democratic Labour Party (DLP) Government won the
 May 1986 election, taking 24 of the 27 seats. The differences
 between the government party and the opposition Barbados
 Labour Party (BLP) are based more on personalities than on
 ideology. A Marxist third party, the Workers Party of
 Barbados which was formed in 1985, has attracted little
 support and participated only marginally in the 1986 election.
 Following the DLP's victory in May, Errol Barrow, who headed
 the government between 1961 and 1976, again became Prime
 Minister in a smooth transition of power. Henry Forde, a
 former Foreign Minister and Attorney General with a strong
 record as a champion of human rights, leads the BLP opposition.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no reports of human rights violations in Barbados
 during 1986, and human rights groups have not requested
 investigations. Barbados advocates strengthening the human
 rights machinery of the United Nations and the Organization of
 American States. The Government favors more investigations
 into alleged violations of human rights in other countries and
 the increased use of factfinding or observer teams to monitor
 controversial political and electoral situations. Prime
 Minister Barrow, while in opposition before his party's
 electoral victory, served as a member of an international
 observer team to the Philippine elections.
 The Government has consistently spoken out on human rights
 violations in other countries, particularly in Africa, Latin
 America, and the Caribbean.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Barbadian law does not discriminate on the basis of race or
 sex. Barbados is a signatory of the 1979 Convention on the
 Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.
 Women actively participate in all aspects of national life and
 are well represented at all levels in both the public and
 private sectors. There are four women in the Senate, a woman
 is a junior minister, and another is Ambassador to the United
 Nations. Women's groups speak out on public issues and insist
 on being consulted by the Government on important national
 issues.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The legal minimum working age in Barbados is 16 and is
 observed. The work week is 40 hours in 5 days. Workers are
 guaranteed a minimum of 3 weeks of annual leave. Occupational
 safety and health conditions are in keeping with International
 Labor Organization standards. Minimum wages are established
 by law.
