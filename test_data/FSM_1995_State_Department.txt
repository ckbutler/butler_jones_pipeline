 FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA
 The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is composed of 607 small islands ex-
 tending over a large area of the Central Pacific. Four states-Chuuk (formerly
 Truk) Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap-comprise the federation. The population is esti-
 mated at 106,000 mostly of Micronesian origin. The four states were part of the
 Trust Territoy o? the Pacific Islands and were administered by the United States
 from 1947 to 1986 pursuant to an agreement with the United Nations.
 Political legitimacy rests on the ppular will expressed by a majority vote through
 elections in accordance with the Constitution. There are three branches of govern-
 ment: a president as chief executive and head of state, a unicameral legislature
 elected from the four constituent states, and a judicial system that applies criminal
 and civil laws and procedures closely paralleling those of the United States.
 Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is responsible for de-
 fense. The FSM has no security forces of its own, aside from local police and other
 law enforcement officers, all of whom are firmly under the control of the civil au-
 thorities.
 The economy depends heavily on transfer payments from the United States, fish-
 ing, tourism, and subsistence agriculture.

 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens. However, tra-
 ditional customs sustain a value system which distinguishes between people on the
 basis of social status and sex. The continuing breakdown of those customs, including
 the breakdown of the extended family, has contributed to a number of human rights
 problems, including violence against women and child neglect with abusers acting
 with increasing impunity.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial lalling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There was no known incidence of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards. There are no local orga-
 - nizations concerning themselves solely with human rights, and there have been no
 requests for visits from human rights monitors. Accordingly, the question of visits
 e by human rights monitors remains undefined.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal procedures, for the most part pat-
 terned after US. law, provide for due process, which is carefully observed. There
 is no governmental use of exile for political purposes.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and it is independent in practice.
 The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is appointed by the President, with the
 advice and consent of the Congress.
 Public trial is provided for in the Bill of Rights, and trials are conducted fairly.
 Juveniles may have closed hearings. Despite these provisions, cultural resistance to
 litigation and incarceration as methods of maintaining public order have allowed
 some to act with impunity. Serious cases of sexual and other assault and even mur-
 der have not gone to trial, and suspects are routinely released indefinitely.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such arbitrary interference, and in practice there is none.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and
 the Government respects them in practice. Each of the four state governments con-
 trols a radio station broadcasting primarily in the local language. Local television
 programming in some states shows videotaped and occasionally live coverage of local
 sports and political and cultural events. Subscription cable television, showing major
 US. programming, is available in Chuuk and Pohnpei. Religious groups operate pri-
 vate radio stations. The national Government and the four states publish news-
 letters.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Bill of Rights provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and the Government respects these
 in practice. During political campaigns, citizens often question candidates at public
 - meetings. Formal associations are uncommon in Micronesia, but student organiza-
 tions exist.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Bill of Rights forbids establishment of a state reli-
 gin and governmental restrictions on freedom of religion. The Government respects
 this freedom in practice; it is hospitable to diverse religions, and missionaries of
 many faiths work within the nation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution has specific provisions for freedom of movement with-
 in the FSM. It is silent on foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, but in prac-
 tice none of these is restricted.
 There have been no refugees or asylumseekers in the FSM, and accordingly no
 policy toward their treatment has been formulated.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Congress is elected by popular vote from each state; the Congress then choos-
 es the President and Vice President from among its four at-large senators by major-
 ity vote. State governors, state legislators, and municipal governments are all elect-
 ed by direct popular vote. Political campaigning is unrestricted, and, as there are
 
 
 677
 no established political parties, political support is generally courted from among
 family and allied clan groupings.
 Although there are no restrictions on the formation of political groups, there have
 been no significant efforts to form political parties.
 For cultural reasons in this male-dominated society, women have not reached sen-
 ior positions in government. The only female member of any of the four state legisla-
 tures was defeated in the November elections in Pohnpei.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There were no known requests for investigations of alleged human rights viola-
 tions. While there are no official restrictions, there are no local groups exclusively
 concerned with human rights. There are, however, women's groups which concern
 themselves with rights for women and children.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Although the Constitution provides explicit protection against discrimination
 based on race, sex, language, or religion, there is extensive societal discrimination,
 notably discrimination and violence against women. Government enforcement of
 these constitutional protections is weak.
 Women.-Violence against women usually stems from domestic conflict between
 husband and wife, and wife beating under certain circumstances is still condoned
 among more traditional elements of the population. The incidence of alcohol abuse
 increasingly contributes to this problem. While assault by a husband or other male
 relative on women and children within the family is a criminal offense under law,
 most women are reluctant to bring formal charges. When formal charges are
 brought by women against men who assault them, the attitude of the authorities
 is that such issues are best left to the extended family unit to resolve. At the same
 time, the breakdown of the extended family increasingly denies women even the tra-
 ditional means of redress.
 Women's roles within the family as wife, mother, homemaker, and childrearer re-
 main virtually unchanged from earlier times. There are no cultural or institutional
 barriers to education for women. Statistics supplied by the College of Micronesia-
 FSM as well as by high schools and grade schools indicate that the percentage of
 female graduates at all levels now exceeds that of males. The government-funded
 National Women's Advisory Council as well as some local nongovernmental organi-
 zations were active in regional and international preparations for the Fourth World
 Conference on Women.
 In some areas the Government's expressed commitment to women's rights lacks
 follow through. For example, the FSM acceded to the Convention on the Rights of
 the Child in 1993 and subsequently established a national advisory committee on
 children. That committee has taken no action to draft the first implementing report
 due last June. Similarly, the Government made no effort to finalize the government-
 drafted legislation to provide counseling and other services to families and neglected
 children and to submit it to the FSM Congress. When the Government did ask the
 Congress to consider the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimina-
 tion Against Women, there was no serious debate, and the Congress rejected the
 Convention.
 In 1992 women began to have organizational representation at the national level
 with the formation of the National Women's Advisory Council, made up of the Na-
 tional Women's Interest Officer (NWIO) and representatives from each of the four
 states. The NWIO position was funded in 1994, but the incumbent took only ten-
 tative steps to increase women's awareness of their legal rights.
 Children.-Programs in health care and education are inadequate to meet the
 needs of a sharply growing population in an environment in which the extended
 family is breaking down.
 While children'a rights are generally respected, child neglect has become increas-
 ingly common, a byproduct of the continuing breakdown of the extended family. The
 Government has not recognized this as a problem or taken steps to address it.
 People With Disabilities.-Neither laws nor regulations mandate accessibility to
 public buildings and services for the disabled. FSM schools have established special
 education classes to address problems encountered by those who exhibit learning
 disabilities.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The FSM prohibits non-Micronesians from
 purchasing land in the FSM, and the national Congress grants citizenship to non-
 Micronesians only by individual acts. For the most part, however, non-Micronesians
 share fully in the social and cultural life of the FSM.

 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the Bill of Rights, citizens have the right to
 form or join associations, and national government em loyees by law may form asso-
 ciations to "present their views" to the Government. However, as yet, neither asso-
 ciations nor trade unions have been formed in this largely nonindustrial society.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-TIThere is no law dealing
 specifically with trade unions or with the right to collective bargaining. Wages are
 set by individual employers, the largest of which are the national and state #overn-
 ments. The Government is not a member of the International Labor Organization.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits involuntary servitude, and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There is no law establishing a
 minimum aye for employment of children. While in practice there is no employment
 of children or wages, they often assist their families in subsistence farming activi-
 ties. The FSM does have a compulsor. education law which requires that all chil-
 dren begin school at the age of 6. Children may leave school when they reach the
 age of 14 or after completing the eighth grade, whichever comes fist.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The four state governments have established
 minimum hourly wages for government, and in two cases private workers: $1.35 in
 Kosrae, effective October 1992; $1.35 in Pohnpei, effective October 1991; $0.80 in
 Yap, effective January 1980; $1.25 in Chuuk, effective October 1994 (pachecks to
 Chuuk gvernment workers continue to be sporadic as a result of Chuuk s debt cri-
 sis). Pohnpei and Yap apply the minimum wage to both government and private
 workers. These minimum wage structures and the wages customarily paid to un-
 skilled workers are sufficient to provide an acceptable standard of living under local
 conditions.
 There are no laws regulating hours of work (although a 40-hour workweek is
 standard practice) or prescribing standards of occupational safety and health. A fed-
 eral regulation requires that employers provide a safe place of employment. The De-
 partment of Health has no enforcement capability; working conditions vary in prac-
 tice.
 The FSM does not have any law for either the public or private sector which
 would permit workers to remove themselves from dangerous work situations with-
 out jeopardy to their continued employment.
