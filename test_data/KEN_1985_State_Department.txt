 KENYA
 Kenya has been a single party state since 1982, and the
 President, Daniel Arap Moi, exercises firm control over both
 the Government and the party, the Kenyan African National
 Union (KANU). The role of the party was enhanced in 1985 with
 local and national party elections, the third such elections
 since independence. There was government pressure to force
 rank and file citizens to join the party during the voter
 registration drive. As of January 1, 1985, all Kenyan civil
 servants are required to be party members. However, neither
 KANU nor the National Assembly have significant impact on
 policy initiation.
 Despite the one-party system there is still considerable
 competition for parliamentary seats. In the September 1983
 parliamentary elections, over 900 candidates competed for 158
 seats. While the large majority of parliamentary and party
 elections are free and fair, reportedly there was government
 interference in 1985 party elections in a few sensitive cases
 to ensure that only State House-approved candidates won.
 People who have been expelled from the party (15 during 1984)
 are ineligible for public office. Others have voluntarily
 stepped down in order to facilitate the election of candidates
 more favored by State House.
 Kenya's economy has largely recovered from the 1984 drought,
 although growth in the gross national product (GNP) in 1985
 barely kept pace with the population growth. With population
 expanding at over 4 percent a year, unemployment continuing to
 rise (400,000 job seekers after at best 20,000 new jobs in the
 wage economy each year), declining per capita income,
 inefficient subsidized public corporations, and an
 increasingly difficult budget situation, Kenya's economic
 problems are not likely to be resolved in the near term,
 although the Government has begun to take appropriate steps.
 There was no basic change in the human rights situation in
 Kenya in 1985 from 1984. As in the previous year, there was a
 serious border incident involving nomadic tribesmen. Two
 persons are still held under the Public Security Act which
 includes provisions superceding constitutional safeguards.
 The judiciary showed significant independence in handling
 several student cases.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Kenya does not sanction or practice unlawful or arbitrary
 deprivation of life, and there were no reports of political
 killings in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 The Government does not sanction or carry out secret arrests
 or abductions.

 KENYA
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is specifically forbidden under the Kenyan
 Constitution. Nevertheless, there are reports that police
 have used torture and that security forces in Northeast
 Province have tortured local citizens (mostly Somali
 ethnics). Most allegations of torture are investigated by the
 Government, and several police and military officials have
 been jailed or sacked for torturing suspects or prisoners.
 Police also often use excessive force in apprehending
 criminals and numerous suspects have been killed while
 attempting to flee the scene of a crime. Many Members of
 Parliament have questioned the authority of the police to
 "shoot to kill," and the topic has led to lively discussions
 both within the Government and in the National Assembly.
 Military forces have also been criticized for "overreaction"
 to incidents in border areas. In February 1985, the Kenyan
 military used helicopter gunships to kill at least 50
 Ethiopians who had reportedly massacred 42 Kenyan women and
 children while rustling cattle in Marsabit district. This
 district routinely is troubled by cross-border raids and
 incidental attacks on civilians by nomadic tribes inhabiting
 both sides of the border. No attempt was made to apprehend or
 question the suspects. Although military officers spoke
 freely about the incident, the Government never publicly
 acknowledged it.
 In 1982, the Moi Government began to utilize the Preservation
 of Public Security Act, which includes provisions superceding
 constitutional safeguards. Persons formally held under the
 Act are kept in solitary confinement, where they are allowed
 almost no contact with the outside world, including their
 attorneys and families.
 Prison conditions are poor, and Amnesty International has
 expressed concern over the treatment of detainees. In June
 1985, a former Member of Parliament, held in conjunction with
 the murder of his successor, died in prison of a heart attack
 after allegedly being refused his prescribed medication.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Preservation of Public Security Act empowers the State to
 detain or otherwise control individuals without trial or other
 reference to the judiciary for an unlimited period. Since
 resuming the practice of detention without charge in 1982, the
 Government has formally detained or restricted 13 persons
 under the Act. Ten uncharged detainees were released in 1983
 and 1984 and one in 1985. Those remaining in detention
 without being charged are a journalist and Ralli Odinga, the
 son of Kenya's former Vice President, Oginga Odinga.
 Other Kenyans have been held, usually for short periods,
 without being formally detained. Approximately 60 soldiers
 and airmen have been held since the 1982 coup attempt, and
 several others implicated in an alleged coup plot in early
 1985. Subject to military jurisdiction, none of them has been
 charged with any crime.
 Double jeopardy is not unknown in Kenya. In December 1984, a
 prominent businessman was arrested and charged with a crime
 allegedly committed in 1976. The case was dropped by the
 
 
 159
 KENYA
 Attorney General in 1976, and the dropping charge was
 confirmed by his successor in 1981. The case was reopened
 even though no additional evidence was produced. Although a
 constitutional court convened by the Chief Justice in 1985
 ruled that continuation of the case would be "vexatious and
 harassing, an abuse of the process of the court, and contrary
 to public policy," the current Attorney General continues the
 prosecution..
 However, aside from detention cases under the Public Security
 Act and the unprecedented circumstances created by the
 attempted coup in August 1982, habeas corpus has generally
 been available in Kenya. Kenyan law requires that persons
 charged with crimes be brought biweekly before judicial
 authorities in public court to ensure that investigations are
 carried out in a timely manner and that prisoners are not
 mistreated. The degree of compliance with the biweekly review
 requirement seems to vary with the diligence of the individual
 senior resident magistrate responsible for ensuring that these
 procedures are followed. Detainees' cases are reviewed every
 6 months by a Confidential Detainees Review Tribunal.
 Kenya does not practice forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary usually exhibits considerable independence. The
 major exception is in cases involving detention under the
 Preservation of Public Security Act, where its authority is
 limited to ensuring compliance with procedural provisions.
 Aside from these security cases, the right to a fair public
 trial is usually observed in Kenya. Civilians are tried in
 civilian courts, and verdicts may be appealed to the Kenyan
 High Court. The High Court is susceptible to executive
 pressure since justices are appointed and dismissed solely at
 the pleasure of the President.
 Military personnel are tried by military courts and verdicts
 may be appealed. Judge Advocates are appointed on a case by
 case basis by the Chief Justice. Most sentences meted out as
 a result of the August 1982 coup attempt have either been
 reduced or suspended. However, the 12 coup leaders convicted
 of treason, whose appeals were rejected, were reportedly
 executed in July 1985. Members of the press regularly attend
 and report on court proceedings whether civilian or military.
 The major judicial event in 1985 was the arrest and trial of
 students involved in demonstrations leading to the closure of
 the University of Nairobi's main campus for several months.
 Five students were charged in March 1985 with participating in
 an illegal assembly and failure to obey an order to disperse.
 The senior resident magistrate hearing the case jailed one
 defendant for 1 year, fined three $330 each, and acquitted the
 fifth.
 In another case, 14 students were convicted of stealing a
 university vehicle and sentenced to 6 months in prison, but
 the High Court upheld their appeals and called the initial
 trial "arbitrary and unlawful." The students were released
 and permitted to return to their studies in October.

 KENYA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Security officials sometimes conduct unwarranted or illegal
 searches to seize allegedly stolen property or apprehend
 suspected criminals. In early 1985, after the murder of a
 European couple in the Nairobi suburb of Karen, general
 service units conducted house-to-house searches and illegally
 confiscated personal property which they claimed must have
 been stolen since the owners "could not afford it."
 Correspondence with prisoners is monitored, censored, and
 frequently not delivered. Security officials are invariably
 present when prisoners or detainees consult with family
 members or attorneys. Reportedly, security forces
 occasionally employ surveillance techniques and electronic
 invasion of the home.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including.
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are proclaimed in
 the Constitution. In practice, however, these freedoms have
 been narrowly interpreted by Kenyan authorities (e.g.,
 Parliament is not permitted to discuss "foreign affairs").
 The existence and use of the detention provisions of the
 Preservation of Public Security Act inhibit public exchange of
 views on political subjects. Kenya has no formal censorship
 of the local press, but pressure--including the firing of
 journalists--has been brought to bear on journalists and
 publications not to stray too far from the government line.
 Additionally, government officials regularly caution editors
 against printing information which they wish withheld from the
 public, and editors usually oblige. The press can and does
 report unflattering news about government officials, but never
 about the President and only rarely about other leaders
 considered to be "off limits." Government policies are rarely
 criticized.
 The Government also discourages students and faculty from
 political activism. Kenya's institutions of higher education
 have been closed on repeated occasions. The main campus of
 the University of Nairobi only reopened after students were
 required to refrain from any political activity. Shortly
 thereafter, three university lecturers and a primary school
 teacher and his wife were arrested and charged with sedition.
 Kenyan leaders regularly harangue lecturers for disloyalty and
 for preaching tribalism.
 Kenya has a 30 member film censorship board under the auspices
 of the Ministry of Culture and Social Services. The Board
 must approve all films shown in Kenya, but a wide variety of
 uncut foreign films is regularly available. A 10 member
 television censorship board has established precepts which
 govern what can be shown on television.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Kenyan Constitution formally sanctions freedom of
 assembly and association, these rights are sometimes limited
 by the Public Order and Police Act, which gives local
 administrative authorities wide powers to control public
 gatherings. It is illegal to convene an unlicensed meeting,
 
 
 161
 KENYA
 and politicians have been arrested or investigated for
 violations of this statute. Nonetheless, licenses for public
 meetings are rarely denied, and then usually on the grounds
 that the proposed meeting might generate civil disorder. The
 Government has occasionally prevented political, religious,
 and social meetings under the Societies Act.
 Excepting civil servants, forced membership in political
 organizations is not officially required. Nevertheless, many
 Kenyans complained of harassment and intimidation during the
 KANU party recruitment drive from January to June 1985.
 Security forces routinely arrested on false charges those who
 could not produce a party membership card, and one district
 commissioner directed that party membership was a prerequisite
 to any economic activity in his district. Another refused to
 grant interviews to nonparty members. The Government and the
 party both repudiated the coercion, but intimidation continued
 Kenya has a relatively free trade union movement. Its single
 trade union confederation, the Central Organization of Trade
 Unions, is affiliated with the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity. Complex labor legislation renders virtually all
 strikes illegal. Strikes are permitted only if the Ministry
 of Labor has not taken action toward resolution within 21 days
 after the formal declaration of dispute. Wildcat strikes of
 no more than 1 to 2 days are quite common. Most disputes,
 however, are settled by the parties concerned. Kenya's
 dispute mechanism is centered in the Industrial Relations
 Court, founded in 1964, which has a high reputation for
 fairness and impartiality. All Kenyan wage earners are
 subject to government regulations limiting wage increases.
 Nevertheless, some unions have had notable success in
 obtaining salary adjustments for union members by filing
 litigation before the Industrial Court. Some unions have also
 obtained significant additional worker benefits, such as
 expanded health insurance coverage and increased housing
 allowances. All collective agreements must be approved by the
 Industrial Court before they can take effect. The Industrial
 Court has become the model for several other such labor courts
 in Africa.
 In August 1980, the Government formally disbanded the Kenyan
 Civil Servants Union (at that time Kenya's largest union)
 because of its alleged political activities. The Public
 Service International has continued to press for a genuine
 civil servants' union, given Kenya's membership in the
 International Labor Organization and signature to the
 Convention on the Right to Organize and Collective
 Bargaining. In September 1985, a "civil servants association"
 was formed with presidential permission, but labor observers
 claim that it is not a legitimate labor union.
 All permanent workers engaged by an enterprise employing at
 least seven persons may be organized into trade unions.
 Approximately 75 percent of all such enterprise employees are
 unionized, and about half (300,000) pay voluntary union dues.
 Unions actually represent a greater number in collective
 bargaining because nonunion workers are also covered by
 collective agreements negotiated for their respective
 enterprise. Agreements are usually valid for 2 years. A few
 professional voluntary organizations, such as the Law Society
 of Kenya (i.e., the Kenyan Bar Association), exist, but such
 associations do not conduct themselves as trade unions.
 
 
 162
 KENYA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 A wide range of religious freedoms exists in Kenya, and
 freedom of worship is protected by the Constitution. The
 Government has often criticized church officials for meddling
 in politics and has refused to register religious societies
 and groups which it believes may pursue activities harmful to
 society. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
 (Mormons) has tried for the past 4 years without success to
 obtain registration under the Societies Act. However, the
 Government has not registered any other churches during that
 period, and it has not interfered with Mormon meetings. In
 1985, the Government also started to deregister "sects" which
 it considers prejudicial to public security. For example, the
 African Gospel Church of God was deregistered on August 23,
 1985, after 25 years of activity in Kenya.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within Kenya is restricted only by provisions of the
 Preservation of Public Security Act, which limits movement
 within Kenya of persons considered to be a danger to public
 security. These provisions are only rarely implemented.
 Following the August 1, 1982, coup attempt, the Kenyan
 Government expanded bureaucratic requirements necessary for
 travel abroad. These additional hurdles have had a negative
 impact upon study and research opportunities for Kenyan
 university students and faculty. Kenya does not formally
 prohibit emigration of its nationals,. In rare cases
 influential or controversial Kenyans have had their passports
 confiscated by the Government, thus preventing them from
 traveling abroad.
 Although Kenya suffers from high and increasing unemployment,
 it continues to accept refugees. During 1985, Kenya's refugee
 population increased by approximately 15 percent to about
 8,500 documented resident refugees. Of these, over 90 percent
 are Ethiopian, Ugandan, or Rwandan. In addition to those
 individuals who obtained official refugee status, between
 3,000 and 10,000 additional persons have taken refuge in Kenya
 unofficially. The renewed fighting in Uganda produced new
 refugee flows from Uganda at the beginning of 1986.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Chief of State, President Moi, supported by a small group
 of advisors, controls all major aspects of policy-making and
 has increasingly consolidated political power, especially
 since the attempted coup of August 1, 1982. Kenya became a de
 jure one-party State on June 9, 1982, but a wide range of
 candidates and views is generally permitted. In 1983, the
 Kenyan electorate rejected approximately 35 percent of Kenya's
 incumbent parliamentarians, including 5 Ministers and 18
 Assistant Ministers. Within the one-party system, the number
 of candidates for a particular public office is frequently a
 half dozen or more, and in the September .1983 general
 elections up to 15 candidates ran for a single parliamentary
 seat. Of the 995 persons who applied for party clearance to
 run for Parliament, 992 were granted permission to stand for
 election. Of these, roughly 700 ultimately had their names
 placed on the ballot. A small number of elections in
 
 
 163
 KENYA
 sensitive districts reportedly were rigged to ensure that
 government-favored candidates won. Individual local
 government officials also allegedly have accepted bribes to
 influence a favorable outcome for certain candidates.
 In Kenya's post-independence history neither the President nor
 the Vice President has ever faced an opposing candidate. The
 Kenyan Government encourages but does not coerce the
 electorate to vote. Turnout has generally averaged between 60
 and 70 percent of the electorate, but this figure fell to 42
 percent in 1983. Participation in the 1985 party elections
 was also relatively low.
 President Moi has expanded ethnic representation in the
 Government and the party. Members of all ethnic groups are
 permitted to run for office, and Kenya has one white
 Parliamentarian who was reelected in a constituency that is 99
 percent black African, despite the presence of several black
 African candidates on the ballot. Twelve persons from
 different ethnic groups hold cabinet portfolios in the
 Government, including the first ethnic Somali ever appointed
 to Ministerial rank in Kenya. Sixteen groups are represented
 among the 43 assistant ministers in the Government.
 Only one female candidate was elected to Kenya's National
 Assembly in 1983, although several others ran for seats. Over
 20 female candidates were elected to municipal office.
 President Moi subsequently appointed two women to Kenya's
 National Assembly as nominated members (the Kenyan
 Constitution provides for 12 such presidential appointments).
 In August 1985, one of the women resigned her nomination and
 contested and won a by-election in her constituency.
 The range of permissible discussion of, and opposition to,
 government policies has been fairly broad within the National
 Assembly. However, discussion is increasingly focused on
 local subjects, and there is no criticism of the President or
 any policies which he initiates or supports. The formal
 detention in August 1982 of Koigi Wa Wamwere, a sitting member
 of Parliament who was repeatedly critical of major government
 policies, exemplified government sanction against critics.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government of Kenya is sensitive to criticism of human
 rights conditions. Various human rights organizations,
 including Amnesty International, have conducted extensive
 letter-writing campaigns to the Government with respect to
 Kenya's resort to the use of formal detention. Although the
 Government released 11 persons held under the Public Security
 Act between October 1983 and September 1985, Government
 officials have emphatically rejected the notion that foreign
 pressure had anything to do with the releases. President Moi
 has publicly criticized Amnesty International for "meddling"
 in Kenyan internal affairs.
 Although there are several Kenyan organizations which address
 certain aspects of human rights issues, there is no group
 which focuses exclusively on human rights concerns in Kenya.
 Kenya has neither signed nor ratified the Organization of
 African Unity's Human Rights Charter which was adopted at that
 organization's July 1981 Summit in Nairobi. Kenya hosted the
 U.N. End of Decade for Women Conference in 1985.
 
 
 164
 KENYA
 In its 1985 report, Amnesty International noted the release in
 1984 of five prisoners of conscience and expressed concern
 about the continued imprisonment of other political prisoners
 held without trial since 1982. Freedom House rates Kenya
 "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Kenya's population of 20.3 million will double by the year
 2000 given an annual population growth rate of 4.1
 percent--the highest in the world. Real growth in per capita
 gross national product ($340 in 1983) has been uneven over the
 last several years. Kenya has had one of the most dynamic and
 successful economies in Africa with a highly developed private
 sector and, in most years, self-sufficiency in food. The
 Kenyan Government has taken action to improve the country's
 health care, education, and general standard of living, but
 recent economic difficulties, including an unprecedented
 drought in 1984, retarded progress in these areas. While good
 rains in 1985 substantially improved crop harvests, bills due
 for food purchases, payment to the (International Monetary
 Fund), and uncertain prices for coffee and tea (the two main
 foreign exchange earners) cloud the outlook for 1986. Also,
 the Government, despite praise for the private sector, still
 relies heavily on inefficient, subsidized public corporations,
 which control major commodity prices and distribution.
 Approximately 80 percent of all Kenyans live in rural areas,
 and most are involved in subsistence agriculture. Only 1.1
 million people (out of the 7.4 million estimated to be in the
 work force) are in the formal sector, i.e., the wage economy,
 and 50 percent of those are government employees. Kenya's
 work force in the year 2000 will number approximately 14.6
 million, putting even greater strain on the country's society
 and economy. About 10 percent of the urban population and 55
 percent of the rural population was estimated in 1978 to live
 below the poverty level.
 The minimum age for the employment of children in Kenya is
 16. However, with the majority of Kenyans employed in the
 informal sector, the law is unenforceable. Kenya has adequate
 legislation to provide for acceptable conditions of work and
 occupational safety and health, but the Government is unable
 to ensure compliance due to a shortage of qualified
 inspectors. The minimum wage is established by the Government
 and reviewed periodically.
 Women constitute an essential factor in Kenya's labor
 equation. They still provide about three-quarters of Kenya's
 farm labor, while carrying out their traditional familial
 responsibilities at the same time. Because of an accelerating
 rural migration of males to the cities in search of
 hard-to-find but higher paying jobs, female farm labor is
 likely to maintain its prominent position. Most of Kenya's
 tribes still practice female circumcision. The Kenyan
 Government, however, has made a major effort to eliminate the
 practice. President Moi has publicly and repeatedly condemned
 female circumcision, and the Ministry of Health has forbidden
 such operations to be performed in government facilities. The
 Kenya Government's commitment to women's rights was shown by
 its hosting of the U.N. End of Decade Conference.
 Education is given a high budgetary priority, and this is
 reflected in a primary school enrollment ratio (1982) of 125
 
 
 165
 KENYA
 percent (This ratio is more than 100 pe'rcent because overage
 children are included in the enrollment statistics.) However,
 secondary school enrollment rates drop sharply: of all
 students between ages 15 and 19, only 25 percent of males and
 15 percent of females are enrolled in secondary school. About
 2 percent of Kenya's college age population is enrolled in
 institutions of higher education, and of these students only
 25 percent are female.
 The infant mortality rate has steadily declined from 150 per
 1,000 live births in 1960, to 83 in 1977, and now stands at
 59. Life expectancy has risen steadily from 42.5 years in
 1960 to 58.5 years in 1985. Although the most recent data
 available (1980) indicate that 85 percent of Kenya's city
 dwellers have access to clean water, only 15 percent of the
 rural population has regular access to safe water. Last
 available data (1977) on caloric consumption indicate that 94
 percent of Kenya's minimal nutritional requirements are met.
 Another looming economic and social problem concerns Kenya's
 65,000 member Asian community which directly accounts for
 approximately one-fourth of Kenya's total economic output.
 African resentment of Asians, primarily because of their
 extensive business holdings, has intensified in direct
 proportion to Kenya's current economic decline. Kenya's
 Africanization campaign to encourage black African
 participation in commercial interests has resulted in some
 Asian emigration and disinvestment and has prompted concern
 within the community for the security of Asian ownership.
 Kenya also amended its citizenship law in 1984 depriving many
 Asians and Europeans of Kenyan nationality. Under the current
 law, people born in Kenya of non-Kenyan parents can no longer
 claim Kenyan citizenship. Several such persons have been
 refused passports and work permits.
