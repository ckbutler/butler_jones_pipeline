 KENYA
 After 9 years as a single-party state led by the Kenya Africa National Union
 (KANU), a 1991 constitutional amendment restored multiparty politics. However,
 President Daniel Arap Moi and his KANU party continued to dominate the political
 system. In addition to his role as President, Moi also heads the military, and con-
 trols the security, university, civil service, judiciary, and provincial, district, and
 local governance systems. KANU controls a majority of the unicameral National As-
 sembly's 200 seats.
 The large internal security apparatus includes the police Criminal Investigation
 Department (CID), the paramilitary General Services Unit (GSU), the Directorate
 of Security and Intelligence (DSI), and the National Police. The CID and DSI inves-
 tigate criminal activity and also monitor persons the State considers subversive.
 Members of the internal security forces committed numerous serious human rights
 abuses.
 The economy includes a well-developed private sector in trade, light manufactur-
 ing, and finance. The predominant agricultural sector provides food for local con-
 sumption, substantial exports of coffee, tea, and cut flowers, and around 70 percent
 of total employment. Tourism remained the top foreign exchange earner. Tight mon-
 etary policies reduced annual inflation to a single digit, and publicly traded compa-
 nies were opened to partial foreign ownership. With the earlier elimination of most
 trade controls, imports increasingly challenged previously protected industries.
 Challenges to the country's continued economic improvement include corruption, un-
 predictable exchange rates, and inadequate infrastructure. Annual gross domestic
 product per capita is $270.
 The Government's human rights record worsened in 1995. Police committed sev-
 eral extrajudicial killings and tortured and beat detainees. The Government ar-
 rested some police officers responsible for abuses. Authorities sometimes used arbi-
 trary arrest and prolonged detention. Prison conditions are life threatening, and the
 judiciary is subject to executive branch influence.
 Citizens ability peacefully to change their government has not yet been fully dem-
 onstrated at the presidential level. The Government continued to harass and intimi-
 date those opposed to the ruling party. In August a progovernment mob attacked
 members of a newly formed opposition party. In February and March, several arson
 attempts against a newspaper and at least one civic organization appeared to be po-
 litically motivated. The Government continued to detain critics of the ruling party,
 including opposition parliamentarians and journalists, and two civic organizations
 were deregistered after they addressed governance issues. The Government contin-
 ued to limit freedom of speech, assembly, and association, and obstruct opposition
 leaders' access to their supporters and electronic media. In January the Government
 forcibly relocated victims of ethnic violence for a second time, and in October, eth-
 nically motivated riots broke out in a Nairobi slum. The Government has not ad-
 dressed the root causes of factional violence in the Rift Valley and elsewhere in
 Kenya. Discrimination against women and ethnic groups, and violence against
 women and children remained serious problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was one killing with political
 undertones involving Bernard Kahumbi, a CID Superintendent. In late April,
 Kahumbi led a highly publicized but unsuccessful police search for Njehu Gatabaki,
 editor of Finance magazine. The day that Gatabki surrendered to police Kahumbi
 was found shot to death near a Nairobi slum. Opposition parliamentarians claimed
 that Kahumbi had been murdered by government forces because he had failed to
 arrest Gatabaki, a fellow Kikuyu. Government officials denied the charge, linking
 the murder to the opposition. In July two men were charged with Kahumbi's mur-
 der; at year's end their trials had not yet begun.
 Kenyan police used improper lethal force on several occasions in attempts to ap-
 prehend criminal suspects. In a case that sparked nationwide protests in July, two
 administrative policemen mistook two electric company employees for thieves and
 shot and killed them. The policemen were charged with murder and at year's end
 were awaiting trial. Six other policemen faced murder charges in different cases.

 Over 800 persons died in prison from disease or lack of medical care. There was
 at least one prison death due to police brutality. Sergeant Martin Obwong, a prison
 warder died on March 18 shortly after being released from a Nairobi police station.
 He had been arrested the previous evening after a bar room quarrel with a police
 officer. Upon returning home, Obwong reportedly told his son that he had been beat-
 en in custody. In September a police corporal and a constable were charged with
 manslaughter in connection with Obwong's case. At year's end, they had not yet
 come to trial. In March the Kenyan High Court determined that a police reservist
 had acted in self-defense when he killed a homeless child in August 1994. The re-
 servist is currently the subject of an inquest in the murder of four other homeless
 children. There were no developments in the case of the 1990 murder of former For-
 eign Minister Ouko. Regarding the 1994 murder of Charles Njeru, a suspected thief
 who died in police custody in Karaba, a third police constable was arrested and
 charged in the case. At year's end, he and two policemen arrested in 1994 remained
 in custody awaiting trial. The Government said that it did not have sufficient evi-
 dence to bring charles in the 1993 beating death of the nephew of Central Organi-
 zation of Trade Unions' Secretary-General Joseph Mugalla. The Government also
 said that there was no evidence to implicate police in the 1993 death of Jackson
 Mutonye, who died in custody after being arrested for an alleged raid on a govern-
 ment arms depot. Two persons were convicted for the 1994 murder of opposition
 Member of Parliament (M.P.) Peter Nyongo's uncle. In April both were given death
 sentences.
 Mob justice remained a serious problem. The Kenya Human Rights Commission
 documented 84 cases between January and June where suspected criminals were
 murdered by angry crowds. The Government condemned the practice but has taken
 no action to address the problem, nor arrested anyone who participated in the vio-
 lence.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There were no developments in the 1994 disappearance of Islamic Party of Kenya
 activist Mohammed 'Aekesa.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There continued to be credible reports that'pohce resorted to torture and brutality,
 and at least 12 police officers were charged for such offenses. In one serious incident
 police tortured and mistreated four suspected members of the February Eighteenth
 Movement (FEM), a small Kenyan guerrilla force based in Uganda (see Section 1.g.).
 According to medical reports, one of the FEM suspects, Joseph Wekesa's left ear-
 drum was ruptured, his back pierced, his arms burned, and his hands and feet beat-
 en by police during his detention in February. Wekesa's attorney claimed that he
 confessed to guerrilla activities to avoid further abuse.
 Another suspect, Richard Wasilwa, was slapped in the face, hit on the knees, and
 struck on the genitals by police. A doctor reported that two other suspects, Moses
 Mukono and Frederick Wafula, sustained similar injuries in police custody. Though
 Wasilwa, Mukono, and Wafula were eventually released, the courts did not order
 an investigation of their treatment in detention.
 Sixty-three members of the Mungiki religious sect arrested in December 1994 for
 involvement in an illegal oathing ceremony alleged various forms of police abuse
 during their 10-month confinement (see Section 2.c.). One suspect lost an arm after
 police hung him from a tree during interrogation. An attorney for the oathing sus-
 pects informed the court in September that police had subjected the defendants to
 unwarranted anal examinations in prison. He also claimed that police placed them
 in toilet-flooded prison cells that formerly belonged to inmates with tuberculosis and
 scabies.
 The Government did not take action against policemen responsible for the abuse
 of 11 persons arrested in connection with Koigi Wa Wamwere's alleged police station
 raid in 1993. Similarly, the Government failed to comply with a court order to dis-
 cipline police officers who tortured the "Ndeiya Six" suspects, who in 1994 were ac-
 quitted of an alleged 1993 assault on a government arms depot. A senior govern-
 ment official indicated in October that internal police investigations in the Ndeiya
 Six case had concluded and that no police officers would be charged. The trial of
 Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki, a cousin of Koigi Wa Wamwere, who sustained head inju-
 ries during his 1994 arrest for alleged theft, was postponed in 1995 because he re-
 quired brain surgery.
 On August 10, police failed to protect members of the Safma Political Party from
 a mob attack in Nakuru. First, a crowd armed with whips and clubs set upon Safina
 Secretary-General Richard Leakey (a double leg amputee), Party Treasurer Njeri
 Kabeberi, and reporters at the Nakuru courthouse. Prison warders later joined an-
 other crowd near the Nakuru prison in beating journalists and other Safina mem-
 'ers. Safima officials accused police and KANU supporters of involvement in the at-
 
 
 125
 tacks. Following an investigation ordered by the Attorney General, three suspected
 participants in the attacks were arrested and charged in September. At yeares end,
 they had not yet come to trial.
 In January Alice Maraga Ashioya, the widow of a former magistrate, told a court
 in Nyeri that she had confessed to her husband's murder after having been sexually
 abused by a female police officer during interrogation. The judge rejected the confes-
 sion, acquitted Ashioya, and criticized the police for misconduct. I October Nairobi
 polie offiers arrested Mary Wangoi for alleged drunken behavior and beat her in
 custody, causing her to miscarry. Sofar one polieman has been suspended in the
 course of police investigations into the incident.
 Prison conditions are life threatening, due in part to a lack of resources and in
 p art to the Government's unwilingness to address defiiencies in the penal system.
 Both male and female prisoners are subjected to inadequate water, poor diet, severe
 overcrowding, deficient health care, and substandard bedding. Kenya's 78 prisons
 hold approximately 38,000 prisoners, 12,000 of whom are awaiting trial. On aver-
 age, prisons are overcrowded by 30 percent of holding capacity, although some facili-
 ties, such as the Nairobi remand prison, are overcrowded by several hundred per-
 cent. There were over one hundred deaths in prison in 1995, most due to dysentery
 and diarrhea. Kenyan prisons do not have resident doctors, and only one prison had
 a doctor permanently assigned to it. Rape of both male and female prisoners contin-
 ued to be a serious problem. The Government does not permit independent monitor-
 ing of prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that most per-
 sons arrested or detained shall be brought before a court "as soon as is reasonably
 practicable," which would be within 24 hours of the arrest or from the start of de-
 tention. A 1988 constitutional amendment allows police to hold persons suspected
 of capital offenses, such as murder and treason, for 14 days before charygi them
 in court. A 1993 amendment to the Penal Code excludes weekends and holidays
 from this 14-day period. In practice, however, suspects are sometimes held for 2 to
 3 weeks or even longer before being brought to court.
 Persons arrested and charged are usually allowed access to their families and at-
 torney promptly. Detainees, however, may be visited by family members and attor-
 neys only at the discretion of the State. For those who have been charged, it is often
 possible to be released on bail with a bond or guarantees of return.
 The law does not stipulate the period within which the trial of a charged suspect
 must begin. The Government has acknowledged cases where persons have been eld
 in pretrial detention for several years, usually because of backlogs. There were cred-
 ible reports of pretrial detention periods in excess of 5 years.
 The Preservation of Public Security Act (PPSA) allows the State to detain a per-
 son indefinitely without charges or trial upon a determination that it is necessary
 for the "preservation of public security." This includes "prevention and suppression
 of rebellion, mutiny, violence, intimidation, disorder and crime, unlawful attempts
 and conspiracies to overthrow the Government or the Constitution." The Chiefs Au-
 thority Act, leftover from the colonial period, empowers local officials called "chiefs"
 to                       o restrict a person s movement without trial. No persons
 were detained under the PPSA or the   efs Authority Act in 1995.
 The task force on the Reform of Penal Law and Procedures, created by the Attor-
 ney General in 1993, continued its task of reviewing and proposing new statutes re-
 lated to criminal investigation, arrest, detention, questioning, charge, and bail. The
 Task Force's inal reporthad not yet been submitted by yeah end.
 The police continued to detain politicians, members of civic organizations, clergy-
 men, journalists, and others who were critical of the Government. As in 1994, the
 police usually held the detainees for several hours before releasing them without
 charge. In July, for example, police detained three members of the unregistered
 Safina Political Party for 24 hours for speaking with Kenyatta University students
 about the new party. In May police detained prominent Kikuyu M.P. Paul Muite,
 attorney Mlirug Kariuki, two Norwegian journalists, and a representative of the
 International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) for 11 hours for visiting a site the au-
 thorities declared to be restricted. In some cases, detainees were held for much
 longer periods. In March police held former University of Nairobi student leader
 Robert Wafula for 57 days without charge to question him about the FEM move-
 ment.
 In January police arrested and charged opposition M.P. Njeng Mungai along
 with two other opposition M.P.'s, Francis Wanyange and Lwali Oyondi, for allegedly
 advocating violence against the Kalenjin tribe. The Government dropped the
 charges against Oyondi and Wanyange but kept Mungai in remand, denng his bail
 apphcations on three occasions. While in prison, Mungai was admitted to the hos-
 pital three times for dehydration and stomach complications; he was finally released
 
 
 126
 on bail in April and at year's end was awaiting trial. Attorneys for suspected mem-
 bers of the FEM claimed that their clients had been arrested as many as 8 months
 before appearing in court.
 Police also harassed and arrested opposition M.P.'s, usually on charges of some
 variation of sedition. The authorities arrested and formally charged 9 opposition
 M.P.'s with sedition in 1995. The Government dropped charges against 4 MP.'s, and
 the other 5 were awaiting trial at year's end. The 1994 case of one M.P., Stephen
 Ndichu, was still outstanding at year's end.
 In October Nairobi attorney Mbuthi Gathenji was arrested and charged on 24
 counts of publishing false and inflammatory statements. The statements in question
 were testimonials about the 1991 ethnic clashes in Narok. Gathenji had recorded,
 but not published, the statements in preparation for a suit on behalf of the clash
 victims. Gathenji's trial had not begun by year's end.
 Police also continued to conduct mass arrests. On March 14, police arrested
 roughly 300 persons in Nakuru in what the town Police Commissioner described as
 an attempt to rid the town of "unwanted elements." All of those arrested paid fines
 for either illegal hawking or possessing homemade liquor. On April 13, Nakuru po-
 lie took approximately 350 people into custody following the murder of a local chief.
 All but three were released the following day.
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control. However, Sheik
 Khalid Balala, a former leader of the unregistered Islamic Party of Kenya, has re-
 mained in a European country for more than a year because Kenyan Embassy offi-
 cials there have been unwilling to renew his passport. In August Balala attempted
 to fly to Kenya but was prevented from boarding the plane by airline officials.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution provides for an inde-
 pendent judiciary, it is subject to executive branch influence in practice. The Presi-
 dent has extensive powers over appointments, including the Chief Justice, the Attor-
 ney General, and Appeals and High Court Judges. The President can also dismiss
 judges and the Attorney General upon the recommendation of a special presi-
 dentially appointed tribunal. Judges do not have life tenure but rather serve on a
 contract basis. Two retired High Court judges told a lawyers' seminar in March that
 judges sometimes delivered sentences under the suasion of public comments and
 private recommendations by executive branch officials.
 The court system consists of a Court of Appeals, a High Court, and two levels of
 magistrates' courts, where most criminal and civil cases originate. Judges hear all
 cases; there is no jury system. Customary law is used as a guide in civil matters
 affecting persons of the same ethnic grup as long as it does not conflict with statu-
 tory law. In 1989 High Court Justice orbury Dugdale ruled that the "Bill of
 Rights" outlined in the Constitution was unenforceable; this decision reinforced the
 implicit ower of the executive branch over the judiciary. The decision has not been
 overruled.
 Civilians are tried publicly though some testimony may be held in secret. There
 is a presumption of innocence, and defendants have the right to attend their trial,
 to confront witnesses, and to present witnesses and evidence. Civilians can also ap-
 peal a verdict to the High Court and ultimately to the Court of Appeal. Military
 personnel are tried by courts-martial, and verdicts may be appealed through mili-
 tary court channels. The Chief Justice appoints attorneys for military personnel on
 a case by case basis.
 Defendants do not have a right to government-provided legal counsel, except in
 capital cases. For noncapital charges free legal aid is usually not available outside
 Nairobi. As a result, poor people who do not have an attorney may be found guilty
 for lack of an articulate defense. Although defendants generally have access to an
 attorney in advance of trial, defense lawyers do not always have access to govern-
 ment-held evidence, since the Government can plead the state security secrets
 clause as a basis for withholding evidence.
 In August the Government raised court fees for the filing and hearing of cases
 by between 200 and 500 percent. For instance, the daily rate for arguing a case be-
 fore a judge rose from approximately $10 to $50. The Law Society of Kenya and
 other attorneys strongly opposed the increase, saying the new charges would deny
 the majority of citizens access to the courts.
 The Constitution entitles the Attorney General to take over and discontinue pro-
 ceedings in private prosecution cases. Using his authority, Attorney General Amos
 Wako argued that citizens must first notify his office before initiating private pros-
 ecution. In May Wako used this authority to terminate a public corruption case filed
 against Vice-President George Saitoti by opposition MI'. Raila Odinga. He also used
 the provision to stop an incitement case brought against Local Government Minister
 William Ntimama by opposition activist Ngengi Muigai.
 
 
 After charging 47 persons with suspected membership in FEM, the Government
 dropped the charges against 28 of them. Four were convicted, one of whom subse-
 quently died in prison, and 15 others still faced charges at year's end. Human rights
 activist Josephine Nyawira Ngengi is also being tried under questionable cir-
 cumstances. Ms. Ngengi and 13 others have been accused of violent robbery, a cap-
 ital offense. Despite the fact that Attorney General Amos Wako twice terminated
 criminal proceedings against the group for lack of evidence, Ms. Ngengi and the
 other accused were arrested again in June for the same offense. At year's end, her
 trial was ongoing and the case had adjourned several times because police officers
 had not complied with a summons to appear to testify.
 The trial of Koigi Wa Wamwere andhis 3 codefendants, who were charged with
 armed robbery in connection with an alleged raid on a Nakuru police station in
 1993, concluded in October. International observers concluded that the prosecutor
 did not produce credible evidence tying Wamwere to the alleged raid. Despite the
 lack of evidence, the chief magistrate found Wamwere and two of his codefendants
 guilty of unarmed robbery and sentenced the three men to two concurrent 4-year
 prison terms plus three strokes of the cane. The fourth defendant was acquitted of
 all charges. Throughout 1995 Wamwere's defense attorneys established convincing
 alibis and showed that the State had tampered with evidence. The presiding mag-
 istrate, William Tuiyot, interfered with the proceedings in a way that called into
 question Wamwere's ability to receive a fair trial. For example, in July Wamwere's
 attorneys withdrew from the case when Magistrate Tuiyot halted their final summa-
 tion because of its political content. In August and September, prison warders twice
 prevented Wamwere from meeting with his attorneys. International observers and
 human rights groups consider Wamwere and his codefendants to be political pris-
 oners. Wamwere's defense attorneys began the a ppeals proess in December.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Famdy, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution permits searches without warrants in certain instances "to promote the
 public benefit." The Police Act clarifies that policemen may enter a home forcibly
 if the time required to obtain a search warrant would "prjudice" their investiga-
 tions. Although security officers generally obtain search warrants, they occasionally
 conduct searches without warrants to apprehend suspected criminals or to seize
 property believed to be stolen. The courts have admitted evidence obtained without
 search warrants to support convictions.
 There were several instances during the year where police conducted searches or
 seizures without warrants. While apprehending members of Mwangaza Trust in
 early April for holding an allegedly illegal meeting, police searched the Trust offices
 without a warrant and confiscated several documents. In late April, roughly 20
 armed police officers twice searched the residence of opposition M.P. Njehu
 Gatabaki without a warrant (see Section 1.a.). In May Nakuru police seized letters
 written by Koigi Wa Wamwere from the car of his defense attorney, opposition M.P.
 Paul Muite.
 Security forces continued to employ various means of surveillance, including a
 network of informants to monitor the activities of opposition politicians and human
 rights advocates. A prominent local attorney stated that she had been followed by
 police in February after representing suspected members of the February Eight-
 eenth Movement. Prior to the raid on the Mwangaza offices, police had trailed sev-
 eral Trust members. In May police followed opposition M.P. s to a private dinner
 hosted by fellow M.P. Joab Omino and then dispersed the group for having allegedly
 convened an illegal meeting.
 Although Kenyans are tee to choose their political affiliation, the Government
 continued to discourage civil servants from membership in opposition parties. An
 Assistant Minister in the Office of the President blamed opposition members in the
 civil service several times for the country's economic development problems. In April
 the Public Service Commission gave early retirement to civil servant James Njeru
 after the Kajiado District Commissioner accused him of supporting the Democratic
 Party.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.--Substantial evidence indicates that hi h-level government officials were
 complicit in instigating and promoting the ethnic clashes of 1991-1994, which
 claimed over 1,000 lives and displaced 250,000 people. In April opposition activist
 Ngengi Muigai brought charges against Local Government Minister William
 Ntimama for having allegedly incited the Maasai tribe during the 1991 clashes in
 Narok. Attorney General Amos Wako acted on his constitutional authority to quash
 the charges before the trial commenced (see Section 1.e.).
 Ethnic-related violence continued in January, but there were no other reported in-
 cidents of ethnic violence the rest of the year. On January 6, Kipsigi warriors at-
 tacked a displaced persons camp in Thessalia and seriously injured three people
 
 
 with arrows; the cam p was demolished. On January 11, 10 people were killed in
 clashes in Longonot. Homes were burned, and the inhabitants, mostly Kikuyu, were
 chased away. There were unconfirmed reports that the attackers were brought into
 the area by helicopters. On January 12, a National Council of Catholic Churches
 (NCCK) camp in Eldoret was raided by administrative police, who chased away ap-
 proximately 65 families. The NCCK, assisted by the U.N. Development Program
 UNDP), was in the process of moving the diplaed persons from the camp after
 the District Officer had ordered the camp closed on January 2. The Government
 made no arrests in any of thes cases.
 In early January displaced persons from the Maela Camp, who were dispersed by
 the Government in late December 1994, were again forcibly moved by the district
 administration to unknown locations in Central Province. Those remaining in Mala
 were harassed in nightly attacks by the Administrative Police and relief support
 was not alowed into the area. Leading elders accused the Government of attempt-
 ing to starve them out. Many of the displaced, however, remained in Maela through-
 out the year, living in the market center and in private homes.
 In October reports surfaced about renewed clashes in the Rift Valley between
 Kalenjin subtribes. Although these clashes were unconfirmed, reliable sources re-
 ported that tensions in the area were high and that numerous injuries had resulted
 rom the fighting. In November reparts of cattle raids in the Turkana area between
 the Pokots and the Turkana, which were viewed by many as ethnically related, led
 to the deaths of aver 40 people and the theft of thousands of cattle. Government
 officials, particularly Minister Ntimama, continued to make inciteful and threaten-
 ing statements against non-Maasai living in the Rift Valley.
 The UNDP program to assist thousands of displaced clash victims came to a vir-
 tual standstill in January. The program has not resumed operations due to the lack
 of government support.
 In one incident with ethnic and political undertones, in October riots broke out
 in Nairobi's Kibera slum, leaving two dead and scores injured. The fighting was re-
 portedy between the Nubian and Luo population in the slum.
 During the year the Government blamed isolated attacks against police stations,
 banks, and villages on the self-proclaimed FEM, a small Kenyan force based in
 western Uganda that opposes President Moi's Government. When, for example, an
 estimated 200 armed assailants killed 2 officers during a raid an police head-
 quarters in Sirisia (Western province) in March, the Provincial Commissioner attrib-
 uted the attack to FEM guerrillas. Similarly, an Assistant Minister in the Office of
 the President said FEM operatives were responsible for several Nairobi bank rob-
 beries.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and the press, the Government has interpreted broadly colonial-era sedi-
 tion and libel laws in order to limit free expression (see Section 1.d.). The Govern-
 ment has used these prvisions to deny opposition parties the right of free speech.
 Far example, in February President Moi instructed police to arrest anyone who in-
 sulted him, and three opposition M.P.'s, James Orengo, Linus Polo, and Njehu
 Gatabaki, were later arrested and charged with sedition for allegedly disparaging
 the President. Security forces and local administration officials also used these pro-
 visions as a pretext to disperse aopposition rallies to prevent speakers from criticizing
 the Government. Despite these forms of obstruction, civic organizations and the op-
 position continued to present their views to the public.
 The print media include three daily newspapers that report on national politics.
 The Nation is the country's largest newspaper and carries articles critical of govern-
 ment policies. In August the second largest daily, the Standard, was sold to an in-
 vestment group with links to the Government. Athough the new management has
 pledged to maintain the Standard's independent editorial policy, KANU party stal-
 warts have reportedly tried to interfere in the aper's editorial process. The third
 daily newspaper, the Kenya Times, reflects KANU party views. Weekly newspapers
 and magazines, many of which are more openly critical of the Government, also
 have substantial audiences. Newspaper and magazine editors continued to feel vary-
 ing degrees of government pressure to self-censor, paicularly an such topics as
 President Moi's amily or corruption involving his advisrs.
 On the whole, the print media remained vibrant and independent, although gov-
 ernent harassment of the press increased. During theyear, one journalist was ar-
 rested for false reporting, three were detained by polie for questioning, and at least
 six were assaulted by security officials. In August a group of armed administrative
 policemen and an assistant chief beat three Nation reporters, stole their equipment
 and money, and threatened to shoot them when they visited a shanty village in
 
 
 Nairobi. City police promised to investigate the incident but have not yet released
 their findings. One Nation bureau chief was acquitted of publishing false reports
 concerning the 1994 doctors' strike.
 In early February, unidentified assailants firebombed the offices of Finance, a
 magazine published by opposition M.P. Njehu Gatabaki. No arrests were made. On
 April 27, a police squad raided Colourprint Press, the company that produces Fi-
 nance, and arrested its director, Anil Vidyarthi. The squad confiscated plates for the
 magazine's April edition, which had alleged President Moi's involvement in the 1990
 murder of former Foreign Minister Robert Ouko. The squad also immobilized a
 printing machine. Vidyarthi and Gatabaki were charged on April 28 with sedition
 and at year's end were still on trial. Both Colourprint and Finance have continued
 to operate, however.
 Radio is the medium through which most citizens get news. The Government con-
 trols the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), which operates the country's only
 radio station its affiliate television station, and a new cable television station. KBC
 radio and television typically do not criticize the Government, give a large share of
 news time to government or ruling party functions, and neglect to give equal report-
 ing to opposition activities. Members of KANU own another television station, the
 Kenya Television Network, which airs news programs with more balanced political
 coverage. A government supporter owns a second-cable television network. The Min-
 ister of Information continued to delay action on numerous television and radio li-
 cense applications while awaiting recommendations on media liberalization from the
 Attorney General's Task Force on the Press.
 Representatives of the international media are generally free to operate in Kenya.
 However, throughout the year the Government tenporarily impounded issues of the
 Economist and the International Herald Tribune that reported on Kenya's human
 rights situation. In March Minister of Information Johnstone Makau threatened to
 deport reporters for Time, Newsweek, and the Washington Post for writing articles
 critical of President Moi. Makau subsequently permitted the reporters to stay,
 claiming falsely that they had agreed to correct mistakes in their articles. In May
 two Norwegian journalists were arrested and charged for photographing the police
 station that Koigi Wa Wamwere allegedly raided in 1993; they departed the country
 after posting bail (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government continued its ban on a number of books, including a Kiswahili
 play based on George Orwell's Animal Farm," and a number of works by emigre
 Kenyan author Ngugi Wa Thiong'o. In May the Nakuru District Commissioner re-
 fused to license the staging of a Thiong'o play, even though the play was not actu-
 ally banned.
 Contrary to previous years, the Government did not overtly pressure university
 students and faculty to support the ruling party. However, in August police detained
 temporarily the Dean of the University of Nairobi Faculty of Law for discussing po-
 litical issues with opposition supporters. There were also notable clashes between
 the Government and the universities in July and November, when police forcefully
 dispersed student demonstrations against unsatisfactory dormitory conditions and
 increases in tuition.
 b. Freedom of Peacefd Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly is pro-
 vided for in the Constitution but is seriously limited by the Public Order Act, which
 gives the authorities power to control public gatherings. This act prohibits meetings
 or processions of 10 or more persons without a license from the District Commis-
 sioner. In theory the law does not apply to persons meeting for "social, cultural,
 charitable, recreational, religious, professional, commercial, or industrial purposes."
 In practice, meetings under almost all categories are subjected to the Public Order
 Act.
 Throughout the year the Government restricted the right of peaceful assembly by
 refusing to license meetings. The three major opposition parties-FORD-Kenya
 (FORD- ), FORD-Asili (FORD-A), and the Democratic Party (DP)--estimated that
 they were denied permits for public gatherings more than a half dozen times each.
 The Government occasionally denied licenses to KANU as well.
 The Government also disrupted both licensed and unlicensed oppsition gather-
 ings. In July police fired shots in the air to disperse a rally conducted by FORD-
 Asii M.P.'s during the parliamentary by-election campaign for the Kipipiri Con-
 stituency. In August a procession by FORD-K M.P. Raila Odinga and opposition
 supporters in Suba District broke up when police attacked participants with sugar-
 cane stalks and fired guns in the air. In September police scattered a Democratic
 Party rally in Kirinyaga by firing tear gas and clubbing party members.
 Government officials and opposition leaders warned against meetings by rival par-
 ties in their home districts. For example, in January seven opposition M.P.'s de-
 clared Webuye a FORD-Kenya zone and warned KANU activists to stay out of the
 
 
 area. In August Local Government Minister William Ntimama told a public rally
 that a planned FORD-Asili meeting in Narok would be a provocation of the Maasai
 community.
 Police broke up gatherings by nonpolitical groups as well. In February antiriot po-
 lice in Murang'a District disrupted a Catholic procession protesting the ban on
 Inooro, a local diocesan newsletter (see Section 2.c.). The priest who led the march
 was charged with incitement and at year's end was on trial.
 The Societies Act governs freedom of association; it states that every association
 must be registered or exempted from registration by the Registrar of Societies.
 Twelve political parties are currently registered under this statute: KANU, FORD-
 K, FORD-A, the DP, the Social Democratic Party, the Kenya Social Congress, the
 Kenya National Congress, the Party of Independent Candidates of Kenya, the
 Kenya National Democratic Alliance, the Social Democratic Party, Labor Party De-
 mocracy, and the National Development Party of Kenya. Twenty-three parties have
 been refused registration since 1992, while at year's end 13 others had applications
 pending, including a party newly formed in 1995 named Safina.
 Nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) are registered by the Government's NGO
 Coordination Board under the NGO Act. In January a legal affairs NGO, the Center
 for Law Research International (CLARION), hosted a seminar on corruption in
 Kenya and published a report on the subject. The following month the NGO Coordi-
 nation Board deregistered CLARION on the grounds that it had disseminated inac-
 curate material damaging to the Government. CLARION sued for reinstatement in
 August, claiming that the Board had not made its decision according to lawful pro-
 cedure. At year's end the case had not yet come to court.
 In January the Government deregistered the Mwangaza Trust, an organization
 formed in 1994 for the purpose of promoting civic education, constitutional reform,
 democratization, and development. The Government stated that the Trust had en-
 gaged in political activities, contrary to the terms of its registration. Mwangaza
 members subsequently sued the Attorney General, arguing that, unlike societies
 and NGO's, trusts were not required to be registered. In March the High Court al-
 lowed Mwangaza to continue functioning so long as it pursued its declared objec-
 tives. The Trust, however, dissolved itself in May, enabling its principals to form
 the Safina Political Party.
 The Government continued to discourage civil servants from membership in oppo-
 sition parties (see Section 1.f.).
 c. Freedom of Reliio n-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government generally does not infringe upon religious activities, except to require
 registration by new c urches.
 However, in February the Government banned the publication of Inooro, a month-
 ly newsletter published by the Catholic diocese of lurang'a. The Kikuyu-language
 newsletter featured social commentary that was frequently critical of President Moi
 and KANU. The Government order banning Inooro gave no justification for the deci-
 sion.
 In October and November, 58 members of a Kikuyu Christian sect based in
 Laikipia were sentenced to 2 years and 9 months in prison for belonging to an ille-
 gal society and taking part in an unlawful assembly. Sixty-three sect members had
 been arrested in December 1994 for allegedly participating in an illegal oathing
 ceremony. Throughout the trial the sect denied the charges and claimed that the
 Government had licensed its gatherings for the past 3 years.
 Muslim groups charged that the Government's refusal to register two Islamic
 teachers colleges in Mombasa and Murang'a demonstrated anti-Muslim discrimina-
 tion. The Minister of Education denied the charge (see Section 5).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country. Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-By law, citizens may travel freely within the country. However, the es-
 tablishment of security zones following ethnic clashes in 1993 restricted the ability
 of many Kenyans to travel, particularly to those parts of the Rift Valley most af-
 fected by clashes. Although the security zones, such as in Molo and Burnt Forest,
 have not been officially lifted, access to the areas has been allowed in practice.
 Nonetheless, opposition party members and diplomats have been stopped at police
 road blocks and prevented from visiting some of the areas.
 The Government does not restrict emigration or foreign travel. The law requires
 a woman to obtain her husband's or father's permission prior to obtaining a pass-
 port (see Section 5). Civil servants must obtain government permission for inter-
 national travel which was granted in all cases.
 There are 195,000 refugees, mostly Somali and Sudanese, living in camps, and an
 undetermined number living outside of camps in cities and rural areas. Somalis ac-
 count for about 75 percent of the total refugee population. In the past year over
 30,000 Somalis have returned home either through voluntary assisted repatriations
 
 
 or spontaneously following the closure of one the largest refugee camps near
 Mombasa. The Government cooperated with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. How-
 ever, the Government has insisted that camps in the heavily populated tourist areas
 of the coast be closed and refugees consolidated into two areas-the northeastern
 camps for Somalis and Kakuma camp for Sudanese and other nationalities.
 Violent rapes and attacks in the refugee camps, reported in 1993, decreased sig-
 nificantly. However, incidents of rape of women and young girls continued to occur.
 With the assistance of the UNHCR, Kenyan police response to these incidents im-
 proved during the year. Acts of violence, including caijackings and banditry, still
 occur with some frequency in the camps and the Dadaab area, which sometimes led
 to the injury or death of some refugees and police personnel. In August the Chief
 Inspector of Police in Dadnab, who had been lauded for his support and profes-
 sionalism, was killed by bandits while in hot pursuit following a caracking.
 Refugees living outside the camps are vulnerable to arrest, and those who pur-
 chase false identification documents and visas are even further at rik. In December
 thousands of refugees, illegal aliens, visitors, as well as Kenyans were arrested in
 police sweeps, supposedly to target those involved in criminal activity in Nairobi.
 Those arrested were held m a former refugee camp in Nairobi in crowded rooms
 with no facilities. The UNHCR was allowed to facilitate the release of refugees who
 were ordered to camps, but other aliens, many with legitimate documents, were still
 being held at the end of the year. There were no reports of expulsion of those having
 a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 d            dnt
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 through free and fair multiparty elections, but their ability to do so has not yet been
 fully aemonstrated at the presidential level. The 1992 presidential and parliamen-
 tary elections were marked by violence, intimidation, fraud, and other irregularities,
 but opposition candidates nevertheless won 63 percent of the vote.
 President Moi's election victory has allowed him and his KANU Party to dominate
 the political process. At the local level the President exercises sweeping power over
 the political structure. The President appoints both the powerful provincial and dis-
 trict commissioners and a multitude of district and village officials.
 At the national level, the Constitution authorizes the President to dissolve the
 legislature and prohibits Assembly debate on issues under consideration by the
 courts. This law, in conjunction with the Speaker of the Assembly's ruling that the
 President's conduct is inappropriate for parliamentary debate, has limited the scope
 of deliberation on controversial plitical issues. M.P.'s are entitled to introduce legis-
 lation, but in practice it is the Attorney General who does so. As the head of KANU,
 which controls 119 of the Parliament's 200 seats, the President is also able to influ-
 ence significantly the legislative agenda.
 The Gm-overnment continued to harass and intimidate the political opposition, and
 th~e opposition has had difficulty competing with KANU. The Government's monop-
 oly on the electronic media has prevented opposition parties from reaching television
 and radio audiences. The Public Order Act has kept opposition leaders from meeting
 their supporters (see Section 2.b.), and colonial-era sedition laws restrict freedom of
 expression. The Electoral Conmmssion, which oversees all elections, lacks statutory
 independence, since its members are appointed by the President. The opposition has
 also claimed that voter constitiencies are apportioned in favor of KANU, which has
 resulted in a KANe pariamentary majority despite only reeiving one-third of the
 popular vote. At the local level, officials have demonstrated partiality to the ruling
 party during parliamentary by-elections. For example, in June, the district adminis-
 tration in Machakos distributed food supplies at a KANU rally several days before
 a by-election.
 Seven parliamentary by-elections were held in 1995 due to the deaths or disquali-
 fications of sitting M.P.'s. The elections were generally free and fair, although jour-
 nalists and diplomatic observers reported anomalies in voter registers as well as in-
 cidents of vote-buying, bribery, and violence. During the June by-election in
 Changamwe, young opposition supporters stoned vehicles beieved to be ferrying
 KANJ voters and burned two minivans after removing the passengers. In the De-
 cember by-election in Nyatike, KANU supporters assaulted the FORD-K candidate
 and attacked FORD-K representatives inside polling stations.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on the participation of women in politics,
 traditional attitudes circumscribe the role of women in politics. There were two fe-
 male permanent secretaries in the Government and seven female MP.'s. President
 Moi also appointed Kenya's first woman cabinet minister. Within the opposition,
 
 
 132
 women figure most significantly in the Democratic Party, where 25 percent of the
 Party's national office holders are women.
 Members of all tribal and ethnic groups participate in the Government and politi-
 cal parties. However, since white Kenyan paleontologist Richard Leakey announced
 his involvement in the Safina Political Party, President Moi repeatedly cautioned
 against white Kenyans' participation in political activities. Numerous tribes--includ-
 ing Kisiis, Merus, Embus, Kambas, Kikuyus, Taitas, Kalenjins, Luhyas, Turkanas,
 Somalis, Maasai, Giriamas, and Luos-are represented in the President's Cabinet.
 However, the President is widely reputed to rely on an inner circle of advisers
 drawn mostly from his Kalenjin tribe.
 Section 4. Government Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Kenya has several well-organized and vocal human rights organizations. Two
 groups, -the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) and Release Political Pris-
 oners, not only produce a regular series of often critical reports on Kenya's human
 rights record but also organize activities to publicize their causes. The Institute for
 Education in Democracy continues to monitor parliamentary by-elections with co-
 operation from the Electoral Commission. Legal organizations such as the Public
 Law Institute, the Kenya Law Society, the International Commission of Jurists, and
 the International Federation of Women Lawyers cover human rights issues as a
 major priority. A new organization, the Citizens Coalition for Constitutional
 Change, has lobbied on behalf of constitutional reform. A large pool of Kenyan attor-
 neys conduct pr   no representation of defendants.
 In March there was an arson attempt at the offices of the Kituo Cha Sheria
 (KCS-Legal Advice Center) located along the same hallway as the KHRC. The
 arsonists shot two security guards who were working at the KC offices at the time
 of the attack. The arson attempts are believed to have been politically motivated.
 It is not clear whether the Commission was also a target.
 President Moi and government officials continued to criticize domestic and inter-
 national human rights NGO's. However, some domestic human rights organizations
 have successfully cooperated with government officials on issues like women's
 rights. The Government also allowed representatives of international human rights
 NGO's, such as the Secretary General of Amnesty International, to visit Kenya.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of a person's "race, tribe,
 place of origin or residence or other local connection, political opinions, color, or
 creed."
 Women.-Violence against women is a serious and widespread problem. The most
 recent police statistics on the subject were released in 1994 and showed that in 1992
 there were 454 cases of rape, 136 cases of attempted rape, 343 cases of indecent
 assault, 407 cases of defilement (e.g., child molestation), and 14 cases of incest. The
 statistics are probably underreported, however, since social mores deter women from
 going outside their families or ethnic groups to report sexual abuse. The Govern-
 ment has condemned violence against women, and the law carries penalties up to
 life imprisonment for rape. Still, the rate of prosecution remains low because of cul-
 tural inhibitions against discussing sex, the fear of retribution, the disinclination of
 police to intervene in domestic disputes, and the unavailability of doctors who might
 otherwise provide the necessary evidence for conviction. Furthermore, traditional
 culture permits a man to discipline his wife by physical means and is ambivalent
 about the seriousness of rape.
 The Constitution does not specifically address discrimination based on gender,
 and women continue to face both legal and de facto discrimination on several fronts.
 For example, a woman is legally reguired to receive consent from her husband or
 father before obtaining a passport. In practice a woman must also have her hus-
 band's or father's approval to secure a  ak loan. Also, women can legally work at
 night only in the export processing zones (EPZ's). According to Pension Law, a
 widow loses her work pension upon remarriage, whereas a man does not. Not only
 do women have difficulty moving into nontraditional fields, but they are also pro-
 moted more slowly than men and bear the brunt of retrenchments.
 Kenya's Law of Succession, which governs inheritance rights, provides for equal
 consideration of male and female children. In practice, most inheritance issues do
 not come before the courts. Women are often excluded from inheritance settlements
 or given smaller shares than male claimants. In addition, a widow cannot be the
 sole administrator of her husband's estate unless she has her children's consent.
 
 
 Societal discrimination is most apparent in rural areas, where women account for
 75 percent of the agricultural work force. Rural families are more reluctant to invest
 in educating girls than in educating hoys, especially at the higher levels. The num-
 ber of boys and girls in school are roughly equal at the primary and secondary lev-
 els, but men outnumber women almost two to one in higher education, and literate
 men significantly outnumber literate women.
 The nation's most well-known women's rights and welfare organization is
 Maendeleo Ya Wanawake ("Development of Women," in Kiawabili), which was es-
 tablished as a nonpolitical NGO during the colonial era but is reportedly informally
 controlled by the  vernment.
 Children.-The May 1994 report of the Attorney General's Task Force on Children
 recommended beth pragmatic and legal measures to safeguard the rights of chil-
 dren. The Government daftd legislation, which is current ly being debated in Par-
 liament, to establish a National Cosuncil of Children's Services to supervise the plan-
 ning and financing of child welfare activities. The bill also revamps the juvenile
 court system. However, both KANU and opposition M.P.'s, as well as a number of
 local NGO's, have faulted the bill for portraying child offenders as criminals in need
 of discipline. Opponents of the bill also have noted that it does not address home-
 lessness, female circumcision, forced labor, sexual abuse, and education.
 Economic displacement and population growth continued to fuel the problem of
 homeless street children. Media reports plae the number of su hchildren nation-
 wide in the tens of thousands, and the Government estimates that their number is
 groWing at an annual rate of 10 percent. According to the Attorney General's Task
 , these children are typically involved in thef drug trafficking, assault, tres-
 p ass, defilement, and property damage. There have been credible reports that police
 have treated these children inhumanely (see Section l.a.).
 Despite the Government's stated opposition, female genital mulation (FGM) ,
 which is widely condemned by international health experts as damaging to both
 physical and psychological health, remains widespread, particularly among Kenya's
 nomadic peoples. It is usually performed at an eary age. Health officials estimate
 that roughly 50 pe    int of females nationwide have undergone this procedure. A
 Maendeleo a Wanawake official stated in January that the percentage in some dis-
 tricts of the Eastern, Nyanza, and Rift Valley provinceas as high as 80 percent.
 Child rape and molestation have also emerged as significant problems. Local
 newsaThrs reported roughy 20 court cases where females below the age of 15 were
 raped. The rapists in question were typically older than 40 and received prison sen-
 tences of between 5 and 2elears, plus several strokes of the cane. In late Septem-
 ber, two men were sentened to life in prison for raping a minor.
 People With Disabilities.-Government poicies do not discriminate against people
 with itisabilities in employment, education, or other state services. Disabled persons
 are frequently denied driig licenses, however. There is also no mandated provision
 of accessibility for the disabled to public buildings or transportation.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-cAccording to the 1989 Government ensus,
 whose figures were released in May 1994, the   u are the largest ethnic commu-
 nity, comprising 20.8 percent of the population. The Luhya, Luo, Kamba, and
 Kalenjin an amalgamation of nine small tribes) are the next largest, each making
 up over 11 percent of the population.
 The Government continued to discriminate against Rift Valley Kikuyus. According
 to opposition politicians and local human rights bodies, provincial authorities have
 denied national identification cards to a substantial number of Kikuyu youths, even
 though they and, in many cases, their parents have been born and raised in the Rift
 Valley. Without identification cards these youths cannot marry, attend universities,
 obtaln employment, or register to vote. In addition, Local Government Minister Wil-
 liam Ntimama stated again in 1995 thatKikuyus displaced from Enosupukia by the
 ethnic clashes would not be allowed to return. He also warned that Kikuyus apply-
 ing for identification cards in the Narok area were attempting to steal political
 power from the local Maasal community. A series of talks between Kikuyu and
 aen in elders that focused on reconciliation and resettlement possibilities ended
 abruptly when the Democratic Party won the September by-election the Kkuyu
 constituency of Kipipiri.
 There continued to be tensions between Asians, that is Kenyans of subcontinent
 descent, and black Kenyans, and Asians are subject to official and societal discrimi-
 nation. Black Kenyans generally resent Asians because of their affluence, their
 seeming reluctance to assimilate African culture, and to employ black Kenyans in
 management positions in their enterprises. The acquittal of an Indian police reserv-
 ist in the shooting death of an African street child and the reservists alleged in-
 volvement in the murders of other street children have heightened these preexisting
 racial tensions.
 
 
 134
 The Government singled out ethnic Somalis as the only ethnic group in Kenya re-
 quired to carry an additional form of identification proving that they are Kenyan
 citizens. Ethnic Somalis who are overwhelmingly Muslim, must still produce upon
 demand their Kenyan identification card and a second identification card verifying
 "screening." Both cards are also required in order to apply for a passport. In June
 the police made sweeps through a Somali community in Nairobi, ostensibly in
 search of illegal aliens. Innocent Somali Kenyans were among those arrested. So-
 mali Kenyans were also victimized during a December sweep. many were harassed
 or arrested and paid as much as $50 (2,500 Ksh) to be released. The continued pres-
 ence of Somali refugees in Kenya has exacerbated the problems faced by Kenyan
 Somalis.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Except for central government civil servants, includ-
 ing medical personnel and university academic staff, all workers are free to join
 unions of their own choosing. The law provides that as few as seven workers may
 establish a union, provided that objectives of the union do not contravene the law
 and another union is not already representative of the employees in question. The
 Government may deregister a union, but the Registrar of Trade Unions must give
 the union 60 days to challenge the deregistration notice; an appeal of the Registrar's
 final decision may be brought before the High Court.
 President Moi deregistered the Kenya Civil Servants Union in 1980; since 1989
 the Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) has sought to reverse this deci-
 sion.
 There are at least 33 unions in Kenya representing approximately 350,000 work-
 ers, less than 20 percent of the country's industrial work force. Except for the
 150,000 teachers who belong to the Kenya National Union of Teachers, which the
 Government has registered, all other unions are affiliated with one central body, the
 COTU. The Government created COTU in 1965 as the successor to both the Kenya
 Federation of Labor and the Kenya African Workers Congress. The 1965 decree es-
 tablishing COTU gives the President power to remove from office the central body's
 three senior leaders and grants nonvoting membership on the Executive Board to
 a representative of the Ministry of Labor as well as of KANU. A 1993 High Court
 decision nullified the 1993 abortive attempt to install leaders more acceptable to the
 Government, but the plotters refused to vacate COTU headquarters. Following a
 1994 Appellate Court order, however, the Registrar of Trade Unions agreed to recog-
 nize the old COTU leadership. The elected leadership remained in office through
 1995. Although the Board is comprised of the leadership of affiliated unions, it is
 not uncommon for KANU to provide funding and other support for the election of
 senior union officials. In 1995 several trade union leaders from affiliated unions re-
 invigorated their efforts to bring about democratic reforms in the election and ap-
 pointment of labor officials, separation from the Government, and the establishment
 of links with any Kenyan political party that supports workers' rights.
 The Trade Disputes Act permits workers to strike provided that 21 days have
 elapsed following the submission of a written letter to the Minister of Labor. The
 military, police, prison guards, and members of the National Youth Service are pre-
 cluded by law from strking. Other civil servants, like their private sector counter-
 parts, can strike following the 21-day notice period (28 days if it is an essential serv-
 ice, e.g., water, health, education, or air traffic control). During this 21-day period,
 the Minister may either mediate the dispute, nominate the arbitrator, or refer the
 matter to the Industrial Court, a body of five judges appointed by the President,
 for binding arbitration. Once a dispute is referred to either mediation, fact-finding,
 or arbitration, any subsequent strike is illegal. However, Section 28 of the Act gives
 the Minister of Labor broad discretionary power to determine the legality o an
 strike. The Minister in 1994 used this power to declare several strikes illegal, al-
 though the required notice had been given. The Minister did not declare any strikes
 illegal in 1995. Several unions including municipal workers and some civil servants
 held brief strikes for back or increased wages.
 Internationally, COTU is affiliated with both the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and the Internal Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Many of its af-
 filiates are linked to international trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While not having the force
 of law, the 1962 Industrial Relations Charter, executed by the Government, COTU,
 and the Federation of Kenya Employers, gives workers the right to engage in legiti-
 mate trade union organizational activities. Both the Trade Disputes Act and the
 Charter authorize collective bargaining between unions and employers. Wages and
 conditions of employment are established in negotiations between unions and man-
 agement. In 1994 the Government relaxed wage policy guidelines to permit wage
 
 
 increases of up to 100 percent and renegotiation of collective agreements. Collective
 bargaining agreements must be registered with the Industrial Court in order to
 guarantee adherence to these guidelines.
 The Trade Disputes Act makes it illegal for employers to intimidate workers. Em-
 ployees wrongfully dismissed for union activities are generally awarded damages in
 the form of lost wages by the Industrial Court; reinstatement is not a common rem-
 edy. More often, aggrieved workers have found alternative employment in the
 lengthy period prior to the hearing of their cases.
 Legislation authorizing the creation of EPZ's was passed in 1990. The EPZ Au-
 thority decided that local labor laws, including the right to organize and bargain col-
 lectively, would apply in the EPZ's, although it grants many exemptions in practice.
 For example, the Government waived aspects of the law that prevent women from
 working at night (see Section 6.e.). Worker and some government officials criticized
 health and safety conditions in the EPZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prescribes slav-
 ery, servitude, and forced labor. However, under the Chiefs' Authority Act, a local
 authority can require people to perform community services in an emergency, al-
 though this did not occur in 1995. The International Labor Organization (ILO) Com-
 mittee of Experts has found these and other provisions of Kenyan law to contravene
 ILO Conventions 29 and 105 concerning forced labor, but noted the Government's
 efforts to review the Chiefs' Authority Act.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Employment Act of 1976
 makes the employment in industry of children under the age of 16 illegal. This Act
 applies neither to the agricultural sector, where about 70 percent of the labor force
 is employed, nor to children serving as apprentices under the terms of the Industrial
 Training Act. Ministry of Labor officers nominally enforce the minimum age statute.
 Children often work as domestics in private homes (including those of relatives), in
 the informal sector, and in family businesses and farms. Given the high levels of
 adult unemployment and underemployment, the employment of children in the for-
 mal industrial wage sector in violation of the Employment Act is not a significant
 problem
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for blue collar work-
 ers in the wage sector varies by location, age, and skills, with 12 separate scales.
 After a modest 1994 wage increase and considerable appreciation of the Kenya shil-
 ling against the US. dollar, the lowest minimum wages were $34 (1,700 shillings)
 per month in urban areas and $19.50 (955 shillings) in rural areas. Workers in some
 enterprises claimed that employers forced them to work extra hours with no over-
 time pay. Prices for basic commodities declined in mid-1995, but because of inflation
 the minimum wage was still insufficient to meet daily needs of a family. Most work-
 ers relied on second jobs, subsistence farming, or the extended family for additional
 support.
 The Regulation of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act limits the normal
 workweek to 52 hours, although some categories of workers have a shorter work-
 week. Nighttime employees, however, may be employed for up to 60 hours per week.
 As is the case with respect to minimum age limitations, the act specifically excludes
 agricultural workers from its purview. An employee in the nonagricultural sector is
 entitled to 1 rest day per week. There are also provisions for 1 month of annual
 leave and sick leave. On overtime, the law provides that the total hours worked (i.e.,
 regular time plus overtime) in any 2-week period for night workers may not exceed
 144 hours; the limit is 120 hours for other workers. The Ministry of Labor is tasked
 with enforcing these regulations, and reports of violations are few.
 The Factories Act of 1951 sets forth detailed health and safety standards; this act
 was amended in 1990 to encompass the agriculture, service, and government sec-
 tors. The 65 health and safety inspectors attached to the Ministry of Labor's Direc-
 torate of Occupational Health and Safety Services have the authority to inspect fac-
 tories and work sites. As a result of the 1990 amendments, the Directorate's inspec-
 tors may now issue notices enjoining employers from practices or activities which
 involve a risk of serious personal injuries. Previously, only magistrates were vested
 with this authority. Such notices can be appealed to the Factories Appeals Court,
 a body of four members, one of whom must be a High Court judge. The number of
 factory inspections increased dramatically in 1993 and subsequently have continued
 at a high level.
