 DJIBOUTI
 The Republic of Djibouti, formerly the French Terri-
 tory of Afars and Issas, has been independent since
 June 1977. Our information on the human rights record
 of the Djibouti Government dates from that time.
 Until recently there were no indications of any
 human rights violations. However a mid-December
 terrorist explosion in a popular bar has provoked
 stringent security measures by the Djibouti government
 which fears that the incident is the beginning of a
 major attempt to shatter the fragile political con-
 sensus established just before independence.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There have been private allegations that some torture
 has been practiced in pursuing the investigation
 of the terrorist incident. We do not know whether
 the charges are justified.
 b.- Cruel, Ijhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment.
 Beyond the allegations noted in l.a., we have no
 indication of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.
 We have no information on prison conditions.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 It is impossible for us to judge whether any of the
 arrests which have occurred following the terrorist
 incident can be called arbitrary. Those recently
 arrested have been taken into custody because of
 suspected connection with a terrorist campaign.
 d. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 Trials in ordinary civil and criminal cases are
 public and appear to be fair. There has not been
 enough time since independence to determine how
 "political" cases will be handled.
 
 
 e. Invasion of the Home
 It is unlikely that people suspected of connection
 with or terrorist groups are free from arbitrary
 search and seizure of personal possessions.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education.
 The new government of the Republic of Djibouti is
 seriously concerned about the economic progress of the
 country.
 Within its very limited resources it is attempting to
 stimulate economic development to meet the needs of
 the mass of the people. It has been seriously handi-
 capped, however, by the economic dislocation caused by
 the Ogaden conflict between Ethiopia and Somalia,
 which has resulted in the cutting of the railway
 from Djibouti to Addis Ababa, Djibouti's main economic
 resource, and in a large influx of refugees.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Though, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Djibouti does not yet have a constitution, but is
 proceeding on an ad hoc basis with a modified form of
 the government inherited from the French. We have no
 information on the degree to which freedom of speech
 and assembly may have been curtailed during the
 present political and security crisis. There is
 freedom of religion in Djibouti. We have no indica-
 tion that the local press is censored.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration.
 We have no indication that freedom of movement by
 Djibouti citizens has been curtailed, either within or
 outside the country.-

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process.
 The opportunity for popular participation in the
 political process has been enhanced by independence;
 freedom of political participation has not been
 limited. There is universal adult suffrage.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights.
 The government of Djibouti is committed to the estab-
 lishment and preservation of a liberal and economically
 progressive state and is mainly responsible for
 what progress has been made in these directions
 since independence.
 There have been no requests for inspection of Djibouti's
 human rights record, and no independent body has yet
 charged the government of Djibouti with violations
 since its independence.
