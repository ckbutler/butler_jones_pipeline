 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 A        and Barbuda, a small two-island state, is a parliamentary democracy and
 a meer of the Commonwealth of Nations. It is governed by a Prime Minister, a
 Cabinet, and a bicameral Legislative Assembly. The Governor General, with largely
 ceremonial duties, is the titular Head of State and serves as the representative of
 the British monarch. The Constitution requires general elections at least every 5
 years. Prime Minister V.C. Bird, Sr., and his Antigua Labour Party hold 15 of the
 17 seats in the House of Representatives. The Governor General appoints the 17-
 member Senate with the advice of the Prime Minister and opposition leader.
 Security forces consist of a police force and the Antigua and Barbuda Defense
 Force, a 90-person infantry unit. No estimates are available from the U.S. Arms
 Control and Disarmament Agency for total military expenditures. Historically, mili-
 tary spending has accounted for a very small percentage of the annual budget; the
 Government did not authorize any increases in force levels during 1992. The police
 are organized, trained, and supervised according to British law enforcement prac-
 tices. The security forces have a reputation for respecting individual rights in the
 performance of their duties.
 Antigua and Barbuda has a mixed economy with a strong private sector. A slow-
 down in the tourism sector, Antigua and Barbuda's major industry, was blamed for
 a decline in economic growth during 1992. The large and growing external debt,
 combined with the financial pressures of meeting payroll demands of an oversized
 public sector work force, also contributed to the economic slowdown.
 The Constitution _provides for political and civil rights, which are generally re-
 spected in practice. Despite government announcements during 1992 that opposition
 political leaders would have access to the government-controlled electronic media,
 there was still evidence of news censorship and very little exposure of opposition
 parties or persons presenting opinions opposed to government policies.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance or politically moti-
 vated abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel or inhuman treatment of pris-
 oners or detainees, and these prohibitions are generally respected in practice. In
 1990 Parliament amended the law to permit flogging as a penalty for rape. While
 there were no reported floggings of convicted rapists, several people were fogged for
 conviction on child molestation charges.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, which do not occur in practice. Criminal defendants have the
 right of judicial determination of the legality of their detention. Detainees must be
 brought before a court within 48 hours of arrest or detention. There were no reports
 of involuntary exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system is modeled on that of the
 United Kingdom and is part of the Eastern Caribbean legal system. Final appeal
 may be made to the Queen's Privy Council in the United Kingdom and is invariably
 made in the case of death sentences. There are no military or political courts. Crimi-
 nal defendants are assured a fair, open, and public trial. In capital cases, the Gov-
 ernment provides legal assistance at public expense to persons without the means
 to retain a private attorney.
 There are no political prisoners in Antigua and Barbuda.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence-There
 were no reports of arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspond-
 ence in 1992. The police must obtain a warrant before searching private premises.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.- The Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech, the press, and other forms of communication. These provisions are generally
 respected. However, the Government dominates the electroic media, the only daily
 source of news. The Government owns one of the two radio stations and the single
 television station. A son of the Prime Minister owns the second radio station, while
 another son is the principal owner of the sole cable television company. The cable
 service also operates a channel that occasionally features local programming. The
 government-controlled media report regularly on the Government's activities but
 rarely on those of the opposition political parties.
 The Ministry of Information announced a policy of open access to and non-censor-
 ship of the electronic media. However, there was clear evidence of censorship and
 manipulation of news reports which were potentially damaging to the Government
 during opposition-led demonstrations against alleged corruption by senior govern-
 ment offcials. The Government also refused to permit selected reports filed by re-
 gional Caribbean news agencies to be aired on local stations when reporting on dem-
 onstrations against political corruption, or the tear gas and suspected fire bombing
 incidents associated with the demonstrations.
 The political opposition publishes one weekly newspaper. Several private sector
 organizations, such as the Chamber of Commerce, publish newsletters with a vari-
 ety of opinions.  -
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. Required permits for public meetings are issued by
 the police and are normally granted. Permits for political rallies and protest
 marrhes were granted during 1992, although march routes were usually altered and
 controlled by the police. Public meetings and organized demonstrations were gen-
 erally held without poie interferene. However, in March the police used tear gas
 to clear a crowd of demonstrators who were protesting plitical corruption and call-
 ing for the resignation of the Prime Minister. The plie claimed that the crowd,
 which had legal permits to march, had become disruptive and that force was nec-
 essary t clear at least a  -mile radius around the Pariament building. There were
 several injuries, and the gas affected schools and business interests in the nearby
 commercial sector.
 c. Freedom of Reigion.- There is unrestricted exercise of religious freedom. The
 population is overwhelmingly Protestant but adherents of other religious denomina-
 tions practice their religion and proselytize openly without government interference.
 All groups are free to maintain links with coreligionists in other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Neither law nor practice restricts the right of citizens to move about
 within the country, to travel abroad, or to emigrate.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Antigua and Barbuda has a multiparty political system accommodating a wide
 spectrum of political viewpoints. All citizens 18 years of age and older may register
 and vote by secret ballot. The Constitution requires general elections at least every
 5 years. The Government is obligated by law to hold voter registration during a
 fixed period each year, and parties conduct their own registration drives free of gov-
 ernment interference. The last general elections were held in March 1989 and were
 won by the Antigua Labour Party (ALP). With 15 of the 17 seats in the House of
 Representatives, the ALP retains the power that it has held since 1951 except for
 a period of opposition from 1971 to 1976. One seat is held by United ogressive
 Party (UPP) leader Baldwin Spencer, who is also the designated leader of the oppo-
 sition. The remaining seat represents the Barbuda constituency and is held by a po-
 litical independent who leads the Barbuda faction advocating secession from Anti-
 gus.
 The opposition has charged that the ALl's longstanding monopoly on patronage
 and its influence on the economic life of the country make it extremely lifficult for
 opposition parties to attract membership and financial support. During 1992, dis-
 sent over government policy and leadership came more from competing ALP factions
 than from the opposition UPP.
 However, growing public concern over corruption in the Government spawned the
 merger of the three political opposition parties into the UPP and gave rise to an
 unprecedented coalition of religious, private sector, and opposition parties.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no governmental restrictions, no local human rights groups have
 formed to date. There were no requests for human rights investigations or inquiries
 during 1992.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, creed, language, or social sta-
 tus, and it is generally observed. However, while the role of women in society is not
 legally restricted, tradition tends to limit women to home and family, particularly
 in rural areas, and to restrict their career options. These traditional roles are chang-
 ing, however. The Government has begun programs to provide enhanced educational
 opportunities for both sexes as well as family planning services. The Directorate of
 Women's Affairs ( reviously the Women's Desk) has worked energetically, with
 some success, to help women advance in government and the professions, but
 progress is slower in the private sector. The Women's Desk was founded a decade
 ago with one director and a secretary; the Directorate now employs, in addition to
 the Executive Director, three professionals and clerical and support staff. In 1992
 the Directorate continued educational programs for women in such areas as health,
 crafts, and improving business skills.
 Most violence against women in Antigua probably goes unreported. Gauging the
 extent of the problem is difficult due to the lack of accurate data and is compounded
 by the reluctance of women in many cases to testify against their abusers. Police
 may be reluctant to interfere in cases of domestic violence, and some women charge
 that the courts are too lenient.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to associate freely and to
 form labor unions. Although fewer than 50 percent of Antigua and Barbuda's work-
 ers belong to unions, the important hotel industry is heavily unionized. Unions are
 free to affiliate with international labor organizations and do so in practice.
 Antigua and Barbuda has two major trade unions: the Antigua Trades and
 Labour Union (ATLU) and the Antigua Workers' Union (AWU). The ATLU is associ-
 ated with the ruling ALP, while the AWU is somewhat mere loosely allied with the
 opposition. The AWU is the larger and more active of the two major unions.
 The right to strike is recognized by the Labour Code. This right may be limited
 in a given dispute by the Court of Industrial Relations. Once either party to the dis-
 pute requests the court to mediate, there can be no strike, a provision of law that
 the International Labor Organization's Committee of Experts again criticized in
 1992. Because of the delays associated with this process, in practice labor disputes
 are often resolved before a strike is called. There were no strikes in 1992.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor organizations are free
 to organize and bargain collectively. Antiunion discrimination is prohibited by law,
 and there have been no reports of its practice. There are no areas of the country
 where union organization or collective bargaining is discouraged or impeded. There
 are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 or forced labor, and they do not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law provides a minimum
 working age of 13, which is respected in practice. Responsibility for enforcement
 rests with the Ministry of Labour, which is required by law to conduct periodic in-
 spections of workplaces. While there have been no reports of minimum age employ-
 ment violations, the political strength of the two major unions and the powerful in-
 fluence that the Government has on the private sector, combine to make the Min-
 istry of Labour very effective in enforcement of this area.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law permits a maximum 48-hour, 6-day
 workweek, but in practice the standard workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. Workers
 are guaranteed a minimum of 3 weeks of annual leave and up to 13 weeks of mater-
 nity leave. Different minimum wages for different work categories were established
 by law in 1981. Most minimum wages would not provide a decent standard of living
 for workers and their families, but in practice the great majority of workers earn
 substantially more than the minimum wage. Increases in the minimum wage were
 recommended in 1989, but there was no action to implement the recommendation
 in 1992. There are no occupational health and safety laws or regulations.
