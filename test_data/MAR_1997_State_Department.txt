 MOROCCO
 The Constitution of Morocco provides for a monarchy with a parliament and an
 independent judiciary. Ultimate authority, however, rests with the King, who may
 at his discretion terminate the tenure of any minister, dissolve the Parliament, and
 rule by decree. In August King Hassan named an interim government, composed
 largely of technocrats. Also in Augst, the present Parliament, which was created
 in_1993, unanimously passed two laws creating a 270-seat upper house, and a 325-
 seat lower house. On November 14, lower house deputies were elected by direct uni-
 versal suffrage; on December 5, the -upper house was selected by labor unions, pro-
 fessional organizations, and local government authorities. There were widespread,
 credible reports of vote buying by political parties and the Government and exces-
 sive government interference in the legislative elections. The fraud and government
 ,pressure tactics led most independent observers to conclude that the results were
 heavily influenced, if not predetermined, by the Government. All opposition parties
 criticized, the Government; some called for a boycott of Parliament. The judiciary is
 subject to bribery and government influence.
 The security apparatus includes several overlapping police and paramilitary orga-
 nizations. The Border Police, the National Security Police, and the Judicial Police
 are departments of the Ministry of Interior, while the Royal Gendarmerie reports
 directly to the Palace. The security forces continued to commit serious human rights
 abuses.
 Morocco has a mixed economy based largely on agriculture, fishing, light industry,
 phosphate mining, tourism, and remittances from citizens working abroad. Illegal
 cannabis production is also a significant economic activity. Economic growth is high-
 ly dependent on agricultural output, and has experienced wide fluctuations in recent
 years due to a-series of debilitating droughts. While good rainfall during 1996 re-
 sulted in gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 12 percent, erratic rainfall was
 expected to contribute to a slightly negative growth in 1997.
 The. Government's human rights record remained largely the same, and serious
 problems persisted in several areas. Citizens do not have the right to change their
 government; however, in the November elections, the opposition gained an impor-
 tant plurality, which observers noted could be a step toward increased democratiza-
 tion. Security forces occasionally abuse and torture detainees and prison conditions
 remain harsh. Authorities sometime ignore legal provisions for due process during
 arrest and detention. The Government's use of force to disperse student protesters
 in Casablanca in January and February resulted in numerous violations of citizens'
 human rights. Security forces beat students, many of them innocent bystanders, and
 the Government failed to thoroughly investigate increased allegations of abuse by
 
 
 1531
 the security forces. During the June local election campaign, police arrested over
 130 left-wing activists who called for an election boycott in contravention of Article
 90 the Electoral Law, which forbids "inciting voters to abstain from voting." The ju-
 diciary is subject to corruption and Interior Ministry influence. Authorities at times
 infringe on citizens' privacy rights. The Government restricts freedom of speech and
 the press in certain areas, and limits the freedoms of assembly, association, religion,
 and movement. While the Government generally tolerates peaceful protests and sit-
 ins, it does not tolerate marches and demonstrations. On several occasions during
 the year protesters were seriously beaten, and scores were arrested. Dissenters' reli-
 gious freedoms are constrained; missionaries who contravene a law barring pros-
 elytizing face expulsion without due process, and converts from Islam to other reli-
 gions experience security force intimidation and occasional imprisonment. Discrimi-
 nation and domestic violence against women are common. Child labor is a problem,
 and the Government has not acted to end the plight of young girls who work in ex-
 ploitative domestic servitude. Unions are subject to government interference.
 A large number of allegations of governmental human rights abuse involve the
 Ministry of Interior. The Ministry is responsible for: the direction of most security
 forces; the conduct of elections, including cooperation with the United Nations in a
 referendum on the Western Sahara; the appointment and training of many local of-
 ficials; the allocation of local and regional budgets; the oversight of university cam-
 puses; and the licensing of associations and political parties. Less formally, the Min-
 istry exerts substantial influence over the judicial system. In naming the interim
 government, the King consolidated several ministerial portfolios, and eliminated the
 Human Rights Ministry from the Government; however, he named a former Human
 Rights Minister as Minister of Justice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Security forces violently broke up
 student demonstrations in November and severely beat protesters. One student,
 Moncef Azzouzi, reportedly died of head injuries caused by security force beatings
 (also see Sections 1.c., 1.d., 2.a., and 2.b.).
 Although human rights groups reported no extrajudicial killings in 1997, they
 continue to complain that security forces too often act with impunity; deaths in cus-
 tody and other instances of potential abuse are not thoroughly investigated. None
 of the cases outstanding from 1996 have been investigated or publicq  resolved.
 These include the deaths in custody under mysterious circumstances of Mohamed
 Tarbaoui and Youssouf Rami in late December 1996. According to security forces,
 Tarbaoui died of a heart attack on a public street, while Rami died of injuries after
 he threw himself through a glass door. Human rights groups dispute these expla-
 nations. In addition, there were no new developments, nor any investigations into
 the 1996 deaths in custody of several other persons, i.e., Salhi, Lahssen, M'rabet,
 Mernissi, Daghdagh, Benderweesh, Fedaoui, Bouhdoun, Hammouch, and Rachid
 Rami.
 Detainees claimed that several prisoners died during the year due to harsh prison
 conditions and inadequate medical care (see Section 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no new cases of disappearance for the second con-
 secutive year. This contrasts with 1995 when there were reports of over 20 such
 cases. However, the practice of the forced disappearance of individuals who opposed
 the Government and its policies dates back several decades. Many of those who dis-
 appeared were members of the military who were implicated in attempts to over-
 throw the Government in 1971 and 1972. Others were Sahrawis or Moroccans who
 challenged the Government's claim to the Western Sahara or other government poli-
 cies. Many of those who disappeared were held in secret detention camps. To this
 day, hundreds of Saharan and Moroccan families do not have any information about
 their missing relatives, many of whom disappeared over 20 years ago.
 The Government continues to deny that it has any knowledge of the whereabouts
 of those still missing. In recent years it has quietly released several hundred per-
 sons who had disappeared, including about 300 in June 1991, but no explanation
 for their incarceration has ever been provided. Local human rights monitors have
 concluded that many others died while at the notorious Tazmamart prison, which
 the Government has since closed. The Government has acknowledged 34 of these
 deaths and has provided death certificates to the families of all but 1 of the 34 who
 died.
 The Moroccan Human Rights Organization (OMDH) and other human rights
 groups continued to pursue the issue of unresolved disappearances. The OMDH re-
 ports that its efforts to meet early in the year with the Minister of Justice and
 
 
 1532
 Human Rights to discuss this issue were unsuccessful. The Moroccan Association for
 Human Rights (AMDH) maintains a list of 68 persons who disappeared between
 1961 and 1995 for whom no information is available.
 There were no developments in the disappearance of Abdullah Sherrouq, a stu-
 dent, who was reportedly detained by security services on June 22, 1981. After 16
 years, his family has been unable to learn anything of his whereabouts or his fate,
 despite appeals by Amnesty International.
 A group representing Tazmamart prison survivors and the families of persons who
 disappeared continues to call for an accounting of unresolved cases, compensation
 to families of those who disappeared, proper burial of victims' remains, and prosecu-
 tion of responsible officials. The Government has not responded to their demands.
 The Government pays a monthly stipend of $500 (5000 dirhams) to the 28 former
 prisoners who survived 18 to 20 years in solitary confinement without health care
 or sanitary facilities at Tazmamart prison. The 28 are former military men who had
 been arrested in connection with the failed coup attempts in 1971 and 1972. After
 their release, the Government prohibited them from speaking out publicly about
 their detention. In exchange, the Government gave the 28 assurances that it would
 help them find jobs and reintegrate them into society, however, none of them has
 yet obtained government assistance in this regard, despite public complaints. A
 former Tazmamart detainee, Mohamed Iffiaui, complained to the press that the
 Government refused his application for a passport and denied him a voter registra-
 tion card. The Government claims that Iffiaui does not appear on the voter lists and
 has not requested a passprt.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Government claims that the use of torture has been discontinued, but news-
 papers and other sources indicate that security forces still torture and abuse detain-
 ees. The fact that detainees are not allowed to have contact with family or lawyers
 during the first 48 hours of incarceration (see Section 1.d.) increases the likelihood
 of torture and abuse.
 According to local human rights advocates, one of the problems in documenting
 torture and abuse is that autopsies are not routine. They are only carried out at
 the request of the state prosecutor and at the order of a judge. The lack of autopsies
 indicates that follow-up investigations into deaths in custody are inadequate (see
 Section L.a.).
 In a January crackdown on Islamist student activities on campus, security forces
 beat students, many of them innocent bystanders (see Section 2.b.). Police also beat
 student protesters at Hassan II University in September (see Section 2.b.). Students
 arrested in the January-February crackdown on Islamist students on campuses al-
 leged that they were beaten during their initial detentions. In July the OMDH re-
 ported that demonstrators arrested in Ait Ishak for protesting against fraud in the
 election of the local council chief were detained overnight and tortured at the offices
 of a local Interior Ministry official. Police beat textile workers in February (see Sec-
 tions 2.b. and 6.b.), and the Government used force against demonstrators during
 the June local elections (see Sections 3). Security forces violently broke up several
 student demonstrations, beating students so severely that some (reportedly as many
 as 20 in one instance) were placed in intensive care. One student reportedly died
 due to injuries caused by security force beatings (also see Sections L.a., 1.d., 2.a.,
 and 2.b.).
 Although prison conditions remain harsh, they have reportedly improved in recent
 years, due in part to reforms undertaken at the suggestion of the Royal Consultative
 Council of Human Rights. Nonetheless, credible reports indicate that harsh treat-
 ment and conditions continue, with state security prisoners more likely to be victim-
 ized. In May the AMDH complained about conditions in Kenitra central prison,
 which contributed to the deaths of eight prisoners who were already in poor health.
 Also in May, prisoners at Oukacha prison in Casablanca wrote to an Arabic lan-
 guage newspaper to report eight deaths from February to April due to malnutrition
 and an absence of medical care. These allegations follow a 1996 open letter from
 detainees at Kenitra prison alleging seven deaths due to poor conditions. In Septem-
 ber 28 prisoners died when a fire broke out at the Oukacha prison. In response, the
 Justice Minister admitted that the prison, designed for 5,000 inmates, actually held
 8,831. There Government claims to have granted prisoners' demands for daily visits,
 access to newspapers, and better medical care, but there was no independent con-
 fi-mation of such changes.
 The Government does not generally permit prison visits by human rights mon-
 itors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal provisions for due process have
 been revised extensively in recent years, although reports indicate that the authori-
 ties sometimes ignored them (see Section 1.c.). Although police usually make arrests
 
 
 1533
 in public, they do not always identify themselves and do not always obtain war-
 rants. Incommunicado ("garde-a-vue") detention is limited to 48 hours, with one 24-
 hour extension allowed at the prosecutor's discretion. In state security cases, the
 "garde-a-vue" period is 96 hours; this may also be extended by the prosecutor. It
 is during this initial period, when defendants are denied access to counsel, that the
 accused is interrogated and abuse or torture is most likely to occur. Some members
 of the security forces, long accustomed to indefinite precharge access to detainees,
 continue to resist the new rules.
 Lawyers are not always informed of the date of arrest, and thus are unable to
 monitor compliance with the "garde-a-vue" detention limits. While the law provides
 for a limited system of bail, it is rarely used. Defendants are, however, sometimes
 released on their own recognizance. The law does not provide for habeas corpus or
 its equivalent. Under a separate code of military justice, military authorities may
 detain members of the military without warrants or public trial.
 Although the accused are generally brought to trial within an initial period of 2
 months, prosecutors may order up to five additional 2-month extensions of pretrial
 detention. Thus, an accused person can be kept in pretrial detention for up to 1
 year.
 Security forces beat and arrested students in a number of demonstrations on cam-
 pus across the country in November (also see Sections 1.a., 1.c., 2.a., and 2.b.).
 There are no known instances of enforced exile, although a number of dissidents
 live abroad in self-imposed exile. Their number has been steadily diminishing, how-
 ever, as many returned to Morocco following a broad-based amnesty decree issued
 by the Government in 1994.
 Many human rights groups consider Abraham Serfaty to be a Moroccan exile. A
 member of the (now defunct) Communist Party and a supporter of Saharan inde-
 pendence, Serfaty was released in 1991 after 17 years in prison. Upon his release,
 the Government declared that Serfaty was a Brazilian rather than a Moroccan citi-
 zen, because his father was a naturalized Moroccan citizen originally from Brazil.
 Based on this Serfaty was expelled from Morocco. This decision has been widely
 criticized by human rights groups. In July 1996, Serfaty's wife was stopped at the
 Casablanca airport and prohibited from entering the country. Srfaty has appealed
 his expulsion, and awaits a response.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but all courts are subject to extrajudicial pressures, including bribery and gov-
 ernment influence.
 There are three levels in the court system, courts of first instance, the Appeals
 Court, and the Supreme Court. While in theory there is a single court system under
 the Mvinistry of Justice, two other courts also operate: the Special Court of Justice
 that handles cases of civil servants implicated in corruption and the Military Tribu-
 nal for cases involving military personnel and on certain occasions matters pertain-
 ing to state security, although state security also falls within the jurisdiction of the
 regular court system.
 Although there is a single court system for most nonmilitary matters, family is-
 sues such as marriage, divorce, child support and custody, and inheritance are adju-
 dicated by judges trained in Islamic law, or Shari'a. Judges considering criminal
 cases or cases in non-family areas of civil law are generally trained in the French
 legal tradition. All judges trained in recent years are graduates of the National In-
 stitute for Judicial Studies, where they undergo 2 years of study heavily focused on
 human rights and the rule of law. It is not necessary to be a lawyer to become a
 judge and the majority ofjudges are not lawyers.
 iarliament authoed the creation of special tribunals in January to hear com-
 mercial complaints and resolve all small- claims cases, thus easing the burden on
 the traditional court system.
 In general detainees are arraigned before a court of first instance. If the infraction
 is minor and not contested, the judge may order the defendant released or impose
 a light sentence. If an investigation is required, the judge may release defendants
 on their own recognizance. Cases are often adjudicated on the basis of confessions,
 some of which are obtained under duress, according to reliable sources.
 All courts are subject to extrajudicial pressures. Salaries for both judges and their
 staffs are extremely modest; as a result, petty bribery has become a routine cost of
 court business. In many courts, especially in minor criminal cases, defendants or
 their families pay bribes to court officers and judges to secure a favorable disposi-
 tion.
 A more subtle corruption derives from the judiciarys relationship with the Mn-
 istr    d of Interior. Judges work closel with the Ministry's network of local officials,
 or caids,     i who serve as members oo Judicial Police and often assume personal
 responsibility for the questioning of criminal detainees. They also frequently prepare
 
 
 1534
 the written summary of an arrest and subsequent interrogation. The summary is
 admissible in court and may be the only evidence introduced at trial, effectively ren-
 dering it an instruction passed from the caid's office to the court. Credible sources
 report that judges who hope for higher salaries and career advancement follow the
 caid's gi'dance closely.
 The law does not distinguish political and security cases from common criminal
 cases. In serious state security cases, communications between the Ministry of Inte-
 rior and the court are more direct. At the Government's discretion, such cases may
 be brought before a specially constituted military tribunal, which is subservient to
 other branches of the Government, notably the military and the Ministry of Interior.
 Aside from external pressures, the court system is also subject to resource con-
 straints. Consequently, criminal defendants charged with less serious offenses often
 receive only a cursory hearing, with judges relying on police reports to render deci-
 sions. Although the Goveent provides an attorney at public expense for serious
 crimes (i.e., when the offense carries a maximum sentence of over 5 years), ap-
 pointed attorneys often provide inadequate representation.
 During student demonstrations in January, the OMDH condemned the Govern-
 ment's use of an administrative circular, signed by three ministers, which conferred
 responsibility for security on campuses upon Justice Ministry magistrates, giving
 them an inappropriate public security role.
 In June the OMDI and    MDH charged that members of the Party of the Demo-
 cratic and Socialist Avante-garde, known by its French acronym PADS, did not re-
 ceive fair trials for having called for an elections boycott. Many of the over 130
 PADS members arrested throughout the country were sentenced to short prison
 terms for violating laws banning calls for election boycotts, distribution of unauthor-
 ized tracts, illegal gatherings, and civil disturbances. Many PADS members were
 charged and convicted of violating Article 90 of the Electoral Code, among other
 statutes, which provides for 1 to 3 months' imprisonment and a fine of $127 to $527
 (1,200 to 5,000 dirhams) for "anyone... who incites one or more voters to abstain
 from voting." The PADS detainees were swiftly tried, often receiving only cursory
 legal defenses before receiving their sentences (see Section 2.a.).
 The OMDH estimates that there are some 60 political prisoners, of which 50 are
 Islamists and the remainder are leftists. Among the 50 alleged Islamists are 16
 members of the aGrup of 26. The Ministry of Interior claims that the  rre 55
 Islamists serving sentences for offenses that range from arms smuggling to partici-
 pating in a bomb attack on a hotel in Marrakech. However, some of these prisoners
 remain in prison for havingclled for nn Islamic state in 1983. International human
 rights groups estimate of the number of persons in prison for advocating independ-
 ence for the Western Sahara vary from none to 700. The AMDH lists 42 political
 prisoners who were detained between 1984 and 1996.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution states that the home is inviolable and that no search or investigation
 may take place without a search warrant. The law stipulates that a search warrant
 may be issued by a prosecutor on good cause. Authorities frequently ignore these
 provisions.
 Government security services monitor certain persons and organizations, both for-
 eign and Moroccan; government informers monitor activities on university cam-
 puses.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of expression, the Government seriously restricts press freedom in certain areas.
 The Government owns the official press agency, Maghreb Arab Press, and the Ar-
 abic daily Al-Anbaa. The Government also supports two semiofficial dailies, the
 French-language Le Matin and the Arabic-language Assahra, in addition to rovid-
 ing subsidies to the rest of the press through price supports for newsprint an office
 space. A 1958 decree grants the Government the authority to register and license
 domestic newspapers and journals. Authorities can use the licensing process to pre-
 vent the publication of materials that they believe cross the threshold of tolerable
 dissent. Offending publications may be declared a danger to state security, seized,
 the publisher's license suspended, and equipment destroyed. The Ministry of Inte-
 rior can control foreign publications by collecting "banned" publications after they
 have been distribute d. In general, however, the Government does not employ ex-
 treme measures, since the media regularly engage in self-censorship to avoid the
 Government's attention and possible sanctions.
 The Press Code empowers the Minister of Interior to confiscate publications that
 are judged offensive by the Government. Under the Code the Prime Minister may
 order the indefinite suspension of a publication.
 
 
 1535
 
 The Press Code empowers the Government to censor newspapers directly by or-
 dering them not to report on specific items or events. In most instances, government
 control of the media generally is exercised through directives and "guidance" from
 the Ministry of Interior. Nonetheless, the Government generally tolerates satirical
 and often stinging editorials in the opposition parties' dailies. However, both law
 and tradition prohibit criticism on three topics: the monarchy, Morocco's claim to the
 Western Sahara, and the sanctity of Islam.
 There were some notable instances of censorship during the year. In January au-
 thorities banned the January 25 issue of the London- based Arabic language weekly
 Al-Mustaqilla, which carried an article about Islamic fundamentalism in Morocco.
 In February authorities delayed distribution of copies of the Paris-based English
 language daily International Herald Tribune that carried commentary critical of Mo-
 rocco. In January journalists appealed the Prime Minister's November 1996 order
 banning Al Ousboua Al Siasia, a popular tabloid widely distributed in major cities,
 for publishing unflattering stories on children of top officials, including those of the
 Prime Minister and the Minister of Interior. Nonetheless, the tabloid remains
 closed. In November the Government seized copies of Le Monde and The Economist
 that carried articles critical of the Government. The December 11 edition of the
 French weekly L'Express also was banned due to an article critical of the November
 elections and speculation on the uncertainties of the post-Hassan era.
 The Government controls RTM radio broadcasts. Another major broadcaster is the
 French-backed MEDI-1, which operates from Tangier and reaches throughout Mo-
 rocco and North Africa. While nominally private and independent, MEDI-1 prac-
 tices self-censorship, as do other Moroccan media outlets. The Government owns the
 only television stations whose broadcasts can be received in most parts of the nation
 without decoders or satellite dish antennas. In 1996 the Government purchased a
 majority share in 2M, formerly the country's sole private station, which can be re-
 ceived in most urban areas. The ostensible reason for the Government's action was
 to save 2M from bankruptcy; the Government now owns 68 percent of 2M stock and
 the Minister of Information by virtue of his position has become the chairman of
 the board. Since then, a government-approved committee has monitored broadcasts
 for objectionable material. Dish antennas are available on the market and permit
 free access to a variety of foreign broadcasts. Residents of the north can receive
 Spanish broadcasts with standard antennas. The Government does not impede the
 reception of foreign broadcasts or Internet access.
 In April Malika Malik, host of a popular monthly talk show on television channel
 2M, was dismissed for failing to control the statements of guests appearing on her
 show. During the March broadcast, a journalist appearing on her program had
 asked a political party leader a question that alleged the Interior Minister's complic-
 ity in election fraud. She was reemployed by her former employer, the Ministry of
 Social Affairs, in August.
 During the local election campaign, the Government arrested over 130 demonstra-
 tors of the left-wing PADS party for having distributed tracts calling for a boycott
 of the elections. Most of the detainees received 1- to 3-month sentences and mod-
 erate fines for calling for an election boycott, creating civil disturbances, and gather-
 in illegally (see Section i.e.).
 The universities enjoy relative academic freedom in most areas, but are barred
 from open debate on the monarchy, the Western Sahara, and Islam. Government
 informers monitor campus activities (see Section 1.f.) and rectors are approved by
 the Ministry of Interior. Police beat students on several occasions (sec Sections 1.c.
 and 2.b.).
 University students, many of whom were member of the Islamist Justice and
 Charity Organization (JCO), demonstrated on campus across the country November
 25-27 to protest, among other issues, transportation and lack of freedom to gather.
 In many cases, security forces violently intervened to break up the many sit-ins,
 gatherings, and marches. On November 25, confrontations at Mohammed Ben
 Abdullah University in Fez led to several casualties. One student, Moncef Azzouzi,
 reportedly died of head injuries sustained from beatings by the security forces.
 Three other persons were seriously injured, with one now in intensive care. More
 students in Fez were injured on November 27 when, after news of Azzouzi's death,
 they organized a march to the University from the hospital where he and others
 were treated. Police intervened and beat some students so severely that they were
 placed in intensive care (some reports put the number at 20).
 Students in Tangiers sponsored a sit-in and hunger strike on November 27 to pro-
 test lack of transportation and freedom of assembly. Security forces reportedly inter-
 vened violently and arrested many students. One was placed in intensive care and
 others were hospitalized. In Casablanca and Mohammedia, an altercation on No-
 
 
 1536
 vember-28 ledto the arrest of two students at the Faculty of Law for illegally gath-
 ering on campus (also-see Sections La. 1 c., 1.d., and 2.b.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assoation.-Although the Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of assembly, the law also-permits the Government to suppress
 even peaceful demonstrations and mass gatherings. Most conferences and dem-
 onstrations require the prior authorization of the Ministry of Interior, ostensibly for
 security reasons.
 In a continuation of 1996.protests, members of the Association of Unemployed
 University Graduates, an unofficial organization not sanctioned by the Government,
 continued to hold periodic sit-ins in front of the Union Marocaine du Travail (UMT)
 labor union's Rabat headuarters to protest high unemployment and government in-
 action. There was little official reaction until August 22, when the police used force
 to block another association of unemployed university PhD graduates from marching
 to Parliament to demand jobs, injuring several marchers. Earlier, on Au  st 14,
 lice used force to intimidate protesters from the same grou  who gatherepeacefu ily
 at theForeign Ministry to present a petition to-the Prime Minister and the Foreign
 Minister. A government representative accepted the student petitions and the crowd
 dispersed peacefully.
 In February police beat textile workers in Sale who were demanding better pay
 and conditions during a sit-in organized at the factory gates (see Section 6.b.).
 In Januarythe Government initiated a crackdown on student demonstrations over
 transportation costs which were being exploited by- Islamic fundamentalist groups.
 The Islamist groups provoked the security forces by takin the demonstrations out-
 side the campus boundaries for the first time. In Casaba    elite security forces
 entered campuses, breaking up any gatherings, and beating students, many of
 whom were innocent bystanders not involved in Islamist activities. In one instance,
 security forces herded students out of a library where they had been studying and
 beat them with truncheons as a warning not to become active in Islamist activities.
 In September police violently broke up demonstrations of students protesting con-
 ditions on the  Hassan I University campus and lack of freedom to assemble and
 pray. Police.beat several students and. arrested up to 25 of the demonstrators. In
 November.security forces violentlybroke up several student demonstrations on cam-
 pus across the.country, severely beating protesters and causing numerous injuries,
 including one-,death (also see Sections 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., and 2.a.).
 - The -Constitution provides for freedom of association, however, the Government
 limita this right in practice. Under a 1958 decree, persons wishing to create an orga-
 nization must obtain the approval of the Ministry of Interior before holding meet-
 ings. In practice the Ministry uses this requirement to prevent persons suspected
 of advocating causes opposed by the Government from forming legal organizations.
 Islamist and leftist groups have the greatest difficulty in obtaining official approval,
 although there are over 20 active Islamist groups. The Government has prohibited
 membership in two, Justice and Charity and Jama'a Islamia, due to their perceived
 anti-monarchy rhetoric. Political parties must also be approved by the Ministry of
 Interior, which uses this power to control participation in the political process. How-
 ever, individual Islamists are not barred from participating in recognized political
 parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom of reli-
 gion, only Islam, Christianity, and Judaism are tolerated in practice.
 Islam is the official religion. Ninety-nine percent of citizens are Sunni Muslims,
 and the King bears the title commander of the faithful. The Jewish community of
 no more than 5,000 is allowed to practice its faith, as is the somewhat larger foreign
 Christian community. The Baha'i community of 150 to 200 people has been forbid-
 den to meet or hold communal activities since 1983.
 Islamic law and tradition calls for strict punishment of any Muslim who converts
 to another faith, although voluntary conversion is not a crime under the Criminal
 or Civil Codes. Any attempt to induce a Muslim to convert is illegal. Foreign mis-
 sionaries either limit their proselytizing to non-Muslims or conduct their work quiet-
 ly. In June in Tangier, two U.S. citizens were briefly detained and subsequently ex-
 pelled after authorities suspected that they intended to proselytize. In August in
 Settat, five South Africans were expelled for the same reason. At the same time an
 American was refused permission to reenter Morocco from a brief trip outside the
 country because of suspicion that he was engaged in proselytizing. Also in August
 in Fez, an American was expelled after he was charged with proselytizing and pos-
 session of Arabic-language Bibles.
 The Ministry of Isl-amic Affairs monitors Friday mosque sermons and the Koranic
 schools to ensure the teaching of approved doctrine. The authorities sometimes sup-
 press the activities of Islamists, but generally tolerate activities limited to the prop-
 agation of Islam, education, and charity. Security forces commonly close mosques to
 
 
 1537
 the public shortly after Friday services to prevent use of the premises for unauthor-
 ized political activity. Authorization to construct new mosques is strictly controlled
 by the Government.
 The Government permits the display and sale of bibles in French, English, and
 Spanish, but confiscates Arabic language bibles and refuses licenses for their impor-
 tation and sale.
 Throughout the year, some members of Morocco's small Baha'i community were
 convoked by Interior Ministry officials for questioning concerning their faith and
 meetings. Some Baha'is have been denied passports, while others were permitted to
 travel abrad only for medical emergencies.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom of movement, in prac-
 tice security forces set up checkpoints throughout the country and stop traffic at
 will. In some regions the checkpoints have been maintained in the same places for
 years, creating what some characterize as internal frontiers. Reports persist that po-
 lice use these checkpoints to demand monetary payments. In the Moroccan-adminis-
 tered portion of the Western Sahara, movement is restricted in areas regarded as
 militarily sensitive.
 The Ministr of Interior restricts freedom to travel outside Morocco in certain cir-
 cumstances. The OMDH and AMDH have compiled lists of individuals who have re-
 portedly been denied passports. The AMDH's list includes 70 persons. In addition,
 all ciil servants and military personnel must obtain written permission from their
 ministries to leave the country. Baha'is experience difficulty in obtaining travel doc-
 uments (see Section 2.c.).
 In June 1996, Maria Oufkir, who had spent 14 years under house arrest, was able
 to leave Morocco and emigrate to France. Oufkir is the daughter of Mohamed
 Oufkir, a general and Interior Minister during the 1960's who was implicated in the
 1971 coup attempt against King Hassan. Ouikir died under mysterious cir-
 cumstances in 1972. His family spent the following 14 years under house arrest and
 in prison. Although nominally released in 1986, the Outkir family remained barred
 from traveling outside Morocco until Maria Oulkir's move to France. While her
 flight has been described as an escape, sources report that the Oufkirs were issued
 passports shortly before her departure, and it is acknowledged that she departed
 with at least the tacit consent of the Government.
 Moroccans may not renounce their citizenship, but the King retains the power-
 rarely used-to revoke it. Tens of thousands of Moroccans hold more than one citi-
 zenship and travel on passports from two or more countries. While in Morocco, they
 are regarded as Moroccan citizens. As a result, the Government has sometimes re-
 fused to recognize the right of foreign embassies to act on behalf of dual nationals
 or even to be informed of their arrest and imprisonment. Dual nationals sometimes
 complain of harassment by immigration inspectors.
 The Government welcomes voluntary repatriation of Jews who have emigrated.
 Moroccan Jewish emigres, including those with Israeli citizenship, freely visit Mo-
 rocco. The Government also encourages the return of Sahrawis who have departed
 Morocco due to the conflict in the Western Sahara-provided that they recognize the
 Government's claim to the region. The Government does not permit Saharan nation-
 alists who have been released from prison to live in the disputed territory.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were
 no reports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status.
 While Morocco has from time to time provided political asylum to individuals, the
 issue of first asylum has never arisen.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Constitutional provisions notwithstanding, in practice citizens do not have the
 right to change their national government by democratic means. The King, as Head
 of State, ap ints the Prime Minister, who is the titular head of government. The
 Parliament has the theoretical authority to effect change in the system of govern-
 ment, but has never exercised it. Moreover, the Constitution may not be c anged
 without the King's approval. The Ministry of Interior appoints the provincial gov-
 ernors and local caids. Municipal councils are elected.
 Constitutional changes in 1992 authorized the Prime Minister to nominate all
 government ministers, but the King has the power to replace any minister at will.
 nyv significant surrender of power from the Crown to the Prime Minister's office
 was further diluted when the King transferred to the Secretaries General, who serve
 at the King's pleasure, many of the powers previously vested in the Ministers.
 
 
 1538
 Morocco created a bicameral legislature in 1997. Sixteen parties have members
 in Parliament. The opposition parties have consistently urged that all Members of
 Parliament be directly elected by the people. Instead, the King proposed creating
 a bicameral legislature, whereby all members of the lower chamber would be di-
 rectly elected by the people and all members of the second chamber indirectly se-
 lected.
 On June 13, Morocco held municipal council elections, followed by balloting for re-
 gional professional councils. In the wake of the June election, political parties ac-
 cused each other of manipulation and vote-buying, and claimed government inter-
 vention on behalf of candidates. Allegations of fraud during the June elections are
 still pending before the Election Commission. The OMDH condemned the prominent
 role of the Interior Ministry in the June elections, as well as the numerous allega-
 tions of vote-buying both by the Government and political parties, electoral list ma-
 nipulation by the Government, and electoral card falsification. The OMDH also criti-
 cized the arrest of members of the PADS party, who were detained for distributing
 tracts that called for an election boycott, as well as the Government's use of force
 against demonstrators in Alt Ishak, near Khenifra.
 In August King Hassan convoked a special session of Parliament to ratify two
 laws creating a bicameral assembly. On August 17, Parliament unanimously ap-
 proved these laws, which created a 325-seat lower house to be filled by direct elec-
 tions, and a 270-seat upper house whose member would be elected by various pro-
 fessional and regional councils. There were widespread, credible allegations of vote
 buying and government manipulation in the November legislative elections. The
 fraud and government pressure tactics led most independent observers to conclude
 that the election results were heavily influenced, if not predetermined, by the Gov-
 ernment. All opposition parties. criticized the Government, and some called for a
 boycott of Parliament. Two winners renounced their seats; alleging unsolicited gov-
 ernment interference on their behalf. The Government is inyestigating some of the
 complaints, other it is deliberately ignoring.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics. Since August, for the
 first time, there are 4 female Secretaries of State in the 28-member Cabinet. There
 are 2 women among the 325 members of Parliament's Chamber of Deputies and 2
 women in the Chamber of Counselors.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are three officially-recognized nongovernmental human rights groups: the
 Moroccan Human Rights Organization (OMDH), the Moroccan League for te De-
 fense of Human Rights (LMDH), and the Moroccan Human Rights Association
 (AMDH). A fourth group, the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights (CDDH),
 was formed in 1992 by former AMDH members.
 The Royal Consultative Council on Human Rights (CCDH), an advisory body to
 the King, counsels the palace on matters such as prison reform. In naming the in-
 . terim government, the King consolidated several ministerial portfolios, thereby
 eliminating the Human Rights Ministry from the Government; however, he named
 a former Human-Rights Minister as Minister of Justice.
 Amnesty international (AI) has local chapters in Rabat, Casablanca, and Marra-
 kech. These chapters participate in AI international letter campaigns outside Mo-
 rocco.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Although the Constitution states that all citizens are equal, non-Muslims and
 women face discrimination in the law and traditional practice.
 Women.-Spousal violence is common. Although a battered wife has the right to
 complain to the police, as a practical matter she would do so only if prepared to
 bring criminal charges. While physical abuse is a legal ground for divorce, the court
 will only grant it if the woman can provide two witnesses to the abuse. Even medi-
 ,cal certificates are not sufficient. If the court finds against the woman, she is re-
 turned to her husband's -home. Consequently, few women report abuse to the au-
 thorities.
 The Criminal Code includes severe punishment for men convicted of rape or sexu-
 ally assaulting a woman or a girl. The defendants in such cases bear the burden
 of proving their innocence. However, sexual assaults often go unreported because of
 the stigma attached to the loss of virginity. A rapist may be offered the opportunity
 to marry his victim in order to preserve the honor of the victim's family. The law
 is more lenient toward men with respect to crimes committed against their wives;
 
 
 1539
 for example, a light sentence or reprimand may be accorded a man who has mur-
 dered his wife after catching her in the act of adultery.
 Women suffer various forms of legal and cultural discrimination. The civil law
 status of women is governed by the Moudouwana, or Code of Personal Status, which
 is based on Islamic law. Although the Moudouwana was reformed in 1993, women's
 groups still complain of unequal treatment, particularly under the laws governing
 marriage and divorce.
 In order to marry, a woman is generally required to obtain the permission of her
 "tuteur," or legal guardian, usually her father. Only in unusual circumstances may
 she act as her own "tuteur."
 It is far easier for a man to divorce his wife than for a woman to divorce her hus-
 band. Rather than asking for a divorce, a man may simply repudiate his wife.
 Under the 1993 reforms to the Moudouwana, a woman's presence in court is re-
 quired in order for her husband to divorce her, although women's groups report that
 this law frequently is ignored. The divorce can be finalized even over the woman's
 objections, although in such cases the court grants her unspecified allowance rights.
 A woman seeking a divorce has several alternatives. She may offer her husband
 money to agree to a divorce (known as a khol'a divorce). The husband must agree
 to the divorce and is allowed to specify the amount to be paid-without limit. Ac-
 cording to women's groups, many men pressure their wives to pursue this kind of
 divorce. A woman also ma file or a udicial divorce if her husband chooses to take
 a second wife, if she has been aban oned by her husband, or if she is a victim of
 physical abuse. However, divorce procedures in these cases are lengthy and com-
 plicated.
 Under the Criminal Code, women are generally accorded the same treatment as
 men, but this is not the case for family and estate law, which is based on the
 Malikite school of Islamic law. Under this law, women inherit only half as much
 as male heirs. Moreover, even where the law provides for equal status, cultural
 norms often prevent a woman from exercising those rights. When a woman inherits
 property, for example, male relatives may pressure her to relinquish her interest.
 While many well-educated women pursue careers in law, medicine, education, and
 government service, few make it to the top echelons of their professions. Women
 constitute approximately 35 percent of the work force, with the majority in the in-
 dustrial, service, and teaching sectors. The Government reports that the illiteracy
 rate for women is 67 percent, compared with 41 percent for men. Women in rural
 areas suffer most from inequality. Rural women perform most hard physical labor,
 and the literacy rate in the countryside is significantly lower for women than for
 men. Girls are much less likely to be sent to school than are boys especially in rural
 areas when the quality of schooling is inferior to urban areas. Women who do earn
 secondary school diplomas, however, have equal access to university education.
 Children.-The Government provides compulsory education for children between
 the ages of 7 and 13. The Government conducts an annual campaign to vaccinate
 children against childhood diseases.
 The Government has taken little action to end child labor (see Section 6.d.).
 Young girls in particular are exploited as domestic servants. Some orphanages are
 knowing accomplices to the practice of adoptive servitude, in which families adopt
 young girls who perform the duties of domestic servants in their new homes. Credi-
 ble reports of physical abuse are widespread. The practice is often rationalized as
 a better alternative to keeping the girls in orphanages. This practice is socially ac-
 cepted, attracts little criticism and is unregulated by the Government.
 Another problem facing orphans of beth sexes is lack of civil status. Normally,
 men are registered at local government offices; their wives and unmarried children
 are included in this registration, which confers civil status. Civil status is necessary
 to obtain a birth certificate, passport, or marriage license. If a father does not reg-
 ister his child, the child is without civil status and the benefits of citizenship. It is
 possible for an individual to self-register, but the process is long and cumbersome.
 People With Disabilities.-A high incidence of disabling disease, especially plio,
 has produced a large population of disabled persons. While the Ministry of Social
 Affairs contends that the Government endeavors to integrate the disabled into soci-
 ety, in practice this is left largely to private charities. However, even charitable spe-
 cial education programs are priced beyond the reach of most families. Typically, dis-
 abled persons survive by begging. The Government continued a pilot training pro-
 gram for the blind sponsored in part by a member of the royal family. There are
 no laws mandating physical changes to buildings to facilitate access by the disabled.
 National/Racial Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution affirms, and the Govern-
 ment respects, the legal equality of all citizens. The official language is Arabic. Both
 French and Arabic are used in the news media and educational institutions. Science
 and technical courses are taught in French, thereby eliminating the large,
 
 
 1540
 monolingual Arabic-speaking population from these programs. Educational reforms
 in the past decade have stressed the use of Arabic in secondary schools. Failure to
 similarly transform the university system has effectively disqualified many students
 from hgher education in lucrative fields. This is especially true among the poor, for
 whom French training is not always affordable.
 Some 60 percent of the population claim Berber heritage. Berber cultural groups
 contend that Berber traditions and the three remaining Berber languages are rap-
 idly being lost. Their repeated requests to the King to permit the teaching of Berber
 languages in the shools led to a royal dcree authorzing the necessary curriculum
 changes, although no changes have yet occurred.
 In June 1996, a number of Berber associations issued a communique petitioning
 the Government to recognize their language, Amzaghi, as an official language and
 to acknowledge the Amzaghi culture as a part of Moroccan society. The Government
 thus far has made no response to the petition.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-Although workers are free to establish and join trade
 unions, the unions themselves are not completely free from government interference.
 Perhaps half a million of Morocco's 9 million workers are unionized in 17 trade
 union federations. Three federations dominate the labor scene: the Union Marocaine
 du Travail (UMT), the Confederation Democratique du Travail (CDT), and the
 Union Generale des Travailleurs Marocains (UGTM). The UMT has no political af-
 filiation, but the CDT is affiliated with the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, and
 the UGTM with the Istiqlal Party.
 It is widely believed that the ,Ministry of Interior has informants within the
 unions who monitor, union activities and the election of officers. Sometimes union
 officers are subject to government pressure. Some unions, particularly the UMT, ex-
 perienced increased harassment and violent intervention by security forces in efforts
 to break up its work stoppages during the year. Union leadership does not always
 uphold the rights of members to select their own leaders. There has been no case
 of the rank and file voting out its current leadership and replacing it with another.
 For example, in March the-CDT held its third national congress, during which it
 reelected Noubir El Amaoui, who ran unopposed, as Secretary General.
 Workers have the right to strike and do so. Work stoppages are normally intended
 to advertise grievances and last 48 to 72 hours or less. The public health care sector
 experienced numerous strikes of limited duration throughout the year. Employees
 in the banking, education, and phosphates sectors also held limited strikes. In Janu-
 ary taxi drivers in the Rabat area held a strike over issues including insurance costs
 and vehicle inspections.
 Unions belong to regional labor organizations and maintain ties with inter-
 national trade union secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is implied in the constitutional provisions on the right to strike
 and the right to join organizations. Trade union federations compete among them-
 selves to organize workers. Any group of 8 workers may organize a union and a
 worker may change union affiliation easily. A work site may contain several inde-
 pendent locals or locals affiliated with more than one labor federation.
 In general the Government ensures the observance of labor laws in larger compa-
 nies and in the public sector. In the informal economy, and in the textile and handi-
 crafts industries, both the Government and management routinely ignore labor laws
 and regulations. As a practical matter, unions have no judicial recourse to oblige
 the Government to enforce labor laws and regulations.
 The laws governing collective bargaining are inadequate. collective bargaining has
 been a longstanding tradition in some parts of the economy such as the industrial
 sector, especially heavy industry, but the practice has not spread to other sectors
 such as the service and informal sectors. The wages and conditions of employment
 of unionized workers are generally set in discussions between employer and worker
 representatives. However, wages for the vast majority of workers are unilaterally
 set by employers.
 Employers wishing to dismiss workers are required by law to notify the provincial
 governor through the labor inspector's office. In cases where employers plan to re-
 place dismissed workers, a government labor inspector provides replacements and
 mediates the cases of workers who protest their dismissal. Any worker dismissed
 for committing a serious infraction of work rules is entitled by law to a court hear-
 in.here is no law specifically prohibiting antiunion discrimination. Employers com-
 monly dismiss workers for union activities regarded as threatening to employer in-
 terests, as occurred at textile plants in Sale in February (see Section 2.b.). The
 
 
 1541
 courts have the authority to reinstate such workers, but are unable to ensure that
 employers pay damages and back pay.
 Ministry of Labor inspectors serve as investigators and conciliators in labor dis-
 putes, but they are few in number and do not have the resources to investigate all
 cases. Unions have increasingly resorted to litigation to resolve labor disputes.
 Labor law reform is such a controversial issue that a draft revised Labor Code
 has remained under discussion in parliamentary committee for 3 years.
 Labor law applies equally to the small Tangier expert zone. The proportion of
 unionized workers in the expert zone is about the same as in the rest of the econ-
 omy.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor was
 prohibited in 1957 when the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Convention
 29 was adopted by royal decree. When authorities become aware of instances of
 forced labor, courts enforce the decree. However, in practice, the Government lacks
 the resources to inspect all places of work to ensure that forced labor is not being
 used.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, but does not en-
 force this prohibition effectively. The practice of adoptive servitude, in which fami-
 lies adopt young girls who serve as domestic servants, is socially accepted, and the
 Government does not regulate it. Physical abuse in such cases is widespread (see
 Section 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Abuse of
 the child labor laws is common. The law prohibits the employment or apprenticeship
 of any child under 12 years of ag.
 Education is compulsory for c ildren between the ages of 7 and 13 years. Special
 regulations cover the employment of children between the ages of 12 and 16 years.
 In practice, children are often apprenticed before age 12, particularly in the handi-
 craft industry. The use df minors is common in the rugmaking industry and also
 exists to some extent in the textile and leather goods industries. Children are also
 employed informally as domestics and usually receive little or no wages. Safety and
 health conditions as well as wages in enterprises employing children are often sub-
 standard. The law prohibits forced or bonded labor by children, however the Govern-
 ment does not enforce the law effectively (see Section 6.c.). The practice of adoptive
 servitude is often characterized by physical abuse (see Sections 5 and 6.c.).
 Ministry of Labor inspectors are responsible for enforcing child labor regulations,
 which are generally well observed in the industrialized, unionized sector of the econ-
 omy. However, the inspectors are not authorized to monitor the conditions of domes-
 tic servants.
 The Government lacks the resources to enforce laws against child labor. In fact,
 there is general acceptance of the presumption that, to learn properly traditional
 handicraft skills, it is necessary for children to start working at a young age. In ad-
 dition, many persons argue that having children working to learn a craft is better
 than having them live on the streets.
 In July the Government announced a new voluntary labeling system for carpet
 exports to certify that no child labor was involved in production. The system is co-
 sponsored by German rug importers. However, the Government does not monitor
 non-participatinghandicraft producers who violate child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-rThe June 1996 general strike led to negotia-
 tions that have continued throughout the year among the Government, the manu-
 facturers' association, and the labor confederations over increasing the minimum
 wage and improving health benefits, social benefits, and housing. In August 1996,
 all three parties agreed to a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage retroactive
 to July 1, raising it to approximately $166 (1,661 dirhams) per month in the indus-
 trialized sector and to approximately $8.10 (80.96 dirhams) per day for agricultural
 workers. Neither figure provides a decent standard of living for a worker and fam-
 ily-even with government subsidies for food, diesel fuel, and public transportation.
 In many cases, several family members combine their income to support the family.
 Most workers in the industrial sector earn more than the mimmum wage. They are
 generally paid between 13 and 16 months' salary, including bonuses, each year.
 The minimum wage is not enforced effectively in the inforal and handicraft sec-
 tors, and even the Government pays less than the minimum wage to workers at the
 lowest civil service grades. To increase employment opportunities for recent grad-
 uates, the Government allows firms to hire them for a limited period at less than
 the minimum wage.
 The law provides for a 48-hour maximum workweek with no more than 10 hours
 in any single day, premium pay for overtime, paid public and annual holidays, and
 minimum conditions for health and safety, including a prohibition on night work for
 
 
 1542
 women and minors. As with other regulations and laws, these are not universally
 observed.
 Occupational health and safety standards are rudimentary, except for a prohibi-
 tion on the employment of women in certain dangerous occupations. Labor inspec-
 tors endeavor to monitor working conditions and accidents, but lack sufficient re-
 'sources. While workers, in principle, have the right to remove themselves from work
 situations that endanger health and safety without jeopardizing their continued em-
 ployment, there were no reports of any instances in which a worker attempted to
 exercise this right.
