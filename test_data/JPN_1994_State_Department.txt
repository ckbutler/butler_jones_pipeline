 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy based on a 1947 Constitution. Sovereignty
 is vested in the people, and the Emperor is defined as the symbol of state. Executive
 power is vested in a cabinet, composed of a prime minister and ministers of state,
 responsible to the Diet, Japan's two-house Parliament. The Diet, elected by univer-
 sal suffrage and secret ballot, designates the Prime Minister, who must be a mem-
 ber of that body. In the lower house general election in July 1993, the Liberal Demo-
 cratic Party (LDP) lost its majority for the first time in 38 years. The Government
 formed in June 1994 is a three-party coalition consisting of the LDP, the Social
 Democratic Party of Japan, and the new party Sakigake. The judiciary is independ-
 ent of the Government.
 A well-organized and disciplined police force generally respects the human rights
 of the ppulace and is firmly under the control of the civil authorities. However,
 there continued to be credible reports of harsh treatment of some suspects in cus-
 tod.
 Tap~an's industrialized free market economy is highly efficient and competitive in
 worl markets. In 1994 the economy began to recover from a recession that began
 in 1991.
 A just and efficient legal system generally assures observance of constitutionally
 provided human rights. However, the Burakumin (a group historically treated as
 outcasts), the Ainu (Japan's indigenous people), women, and alien residents experi-
 ence varying degrees of discrimination, some of it severe and of long standing. There
 also continue to be reports of physical and psychological abuse of prisoners or de-
 tainees. Officials are sometimes dismissed for such abuse but are seldom tried, con-
 victed, and imprisoned.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrad-
 ing treatment or punishment. However, reports by several Japanese bar associa-
 tions and some prisoners indicate that police sometimes use physical violence, in-
 cluding kicking and beating, as well as psychological intimidation, including threats
 and name calling, to obtain confessions from suspects in custody or to enforce dis-
 cipline. In Japan, confession is regarded as the first step in the rehabilitative proc-
 ess. Roughly 85 percent of all criminal cases going to trial include confessions, re-
 flecting the priority that the system places on admissions of guilt. The Government
 also points out that the high percentage of confessions, like the high conviction rate,
 is reflective of a higher standard of evidence needed to bring about indictment in
 the Japanese system. Appellate courts have overturned several convictions in recent
 years on the ground that they were obtained as a result of forced confession. In ad-
 dition, civil and criminal suits have been brought against some police and prosecu-
 tion officials, alleging abuse during interrogation and detention. While many of
 these cases are still pending, one Tokyo public prosecutor was dismissed and two
 resigned in 1994 in separate incidents of aleged assaults on witnesses during ques-
 tioning. One of the prosecutors involved has been indicted, and the State has agreed
 to cornensate one of the victims.
 The National Bar Association and human rights gups have criticized the prison
 system, with its emphasis on strict discipline and obedience to numerous rules.
 Guards some times selectively enforce rules and impose punishment, including
 "minor solitary confinement," which may be imposed for at least 1 and not more
 than 60 days and in which the prisoner is made to sit (for foreigners) or kneel (for
 Japanese) motionless in the mid0le of an empty cell.
 me human rights groups allege that physical restraints, such as leather hand-
 cuffs, have been used as a form of punishment and that prisoners have been forced
 to eat and relieve themselves unassisted while wearing these restraints. Ministry
 of Justice officials state that restraints are only used inside the prison when pris-
 oners have been violent and pose a threat to themselves and others, or when there
 is concern about an attempt to escape.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Constitutional provisions for freedom
 from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment are respected in practice. Japanese law pro-
 vides for judicial determination of the legality of detention. Persons may not be de-
 tained without charge, and prosecuting authorities must be prepared to demonstrate
 
 
 609
 before trial that probable cause exists to detain the accused. Under the Code of
 Criminal Procedure, a suspect may be held in police custody for up to 72 hours with-
 out judicial proceedings. This period may be extended by a judge for up to 20 addi-
 tional days for preindictment investigation. If an indictment folows the suspect is
 transferred to a criminal detention facility. Bail is available in only about 25 percent
 of cases.
 The Bar Association and human rights groups have criticized the practice of "sub-
 stitute detention." While Japanese law stipulates that suspects should be held in
 'houses of detention" between arrest and sentencing, a police detention facility may
 be substituted at the order of the court. This provision was originally added to facili-
 tate investigation and cover a shortage of normal detention facilities. However, ac-
 cording to a 1994 Ministry of Justice report, normal detention facilities were filled
 to only 60 percent of capacity in 1993. Critics charge that allowing suspects to be
 detained by the same authorities that interrogate them heightens the potential for
 detainee abuse and coercion. The Government counters that adequate safeguards to
 prevent abuse, including strong judicial oversight, have been built into the system.
 The length of time before a suspect is brought to trial depends on the nature of
 the crime but rarely exceeds 2 months from date of arrest; the average is 1 to 2
 months. Critics charge that access to counsel is limited both in duration and fre-
 uenc    although the Government denies that this is the case. The Criminal Proce-
 dure Code grants the prosecution and investigating police officials the power to con-
 trol access to attorneys before indictment when deemed necessary for the sake of
 the investigation. As a court-appointed attorney is not approved until after indict-
 ment, suspects must rely on their own resources to hire an attorney for counseling
 before indictment. In addition, counsel may not be present during interrogation at
 any time before or after indictment. Beyond this, the Government affirms that the
 right of the accused to seek legal counsel is fully respected and that attorneys are
 almost always able to see clients without obstruction. Some local bar associations
 provide detainees with a free counseling session prior to indictment. Counsel is pro-
 vided at government expense after indictment if the arrested person cannot   ord
 one.
 Preventive detention does not exist.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TraL.-The Government respects in practice the constitu-
 tional provisions for the right to aspeedy and public trial by an impartial tribunal
 in all criminal cases. The  endn is informed of charges upon arrest and assured
 a public trial by an indepndent civilian court with defense counsel and the right
 to cross-examination. The Constitution assures defendants the right not to be com-
 pelled to testify against themselves as well as free and private access to counsel,
 although the right to such access i sometimes abridged in practice. For example,
 the law allows prosecutors to control access to counsel befor indictment, and there
 are persistent allegations of coerced confessions. Defendants are also protected from
 the retroactive application of laws and have the right of access to incriminating evi-
 dence after a formal indictment has been made. However, Japanese law does not
 require full disclosure by the prosecutor, and material that will not be used in court
 by the prosecution may be suppressed.
 The judiciary is independent and free from executive branch interference. Judges
 are appointed by the Cabinet for 10-year terms, which can be renewed until judges
 have reached the a  of 65. Justices of the Supreme Court can serve until the a e
 of 70 but face periodic review through popular referendum. A defendant who is dis-
 satisfied with the decision of a trial court of first instance may, within the period
 prescribed by law, appeal to a higher court. There are several levels of courts, with
 the Supreme Court serving as the highest judicial authority. There is no trial by
 jury in Japan.
 Therere e no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondnce.-Under
 the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made upon separate warrant is-
 sued by a judge. Standards for issuing such warrants exist to guard against arbi-
 trary searches. There were no reports that the Government or any other organiza-
 tion arbitrarily interfered with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution, an independent press and ju-
 diciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of
 speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are provided
 for in the Constitution and respected in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution
 and respected in practice. While Buddhism and Shintoism remain the two major re-
 
 
 610
 ligions, there are many others, including several Christian denominations. Foreign
 missionaries are welcome and gain admission to Japan through a specific visa cat-
 egory for foreign religious workers. Some temples and shrines receive public support
 as national historic or cultural sites.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Japanese citizens have the right to travel freely both within Japan and
 abroad, to change their place of residence, to emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily.
 Japanese nationality may be lost by naturalization in a foreign country or failure
 to elect Japanese nationality at the required age.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Japanese citizens have the right and ability peacefully to change their govern-
 ment. A parliamentary democracy, Japan is governed by the political party or par-
 ties able to form a majority in the lower house of its bicameral Diet. From 1955
 until 1993 all prime ministers and almost all cabinet ministers were members of
 the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which enjoyed a majority in the lower house
 throughout this period. From August 1993 to June 1994, non-LDP coalitions gov-
 erned the country. The current three-party coalition government includes the LDP
 but is headed by a Prime Minister from the Japan Socialist Party. Local and prefec-
 tural governments are often controlled by coalitions.
 Elections on all levels are held frequently; suffrage is universal; and ballots are
 secret.
 Postwar population movements contributed to significant imbalances in size
 among parliamentary electoral districts. In June, however, the Diet approved legis-
 lation reducing the maximum voting weight disparity among upper house districts
 of the Diet from almost six-and-a-haf to one tless than five to one. In November
 1994 the Diet passed legislation reducing the maximum voter weight disparity to
 approximately two to one in lower house districts. In addition, the new legislation
 provides that two-fifths of lower house members will be elected in proportional races
 vhich, in effect, further reduces malapportionment.
 There are no legal or de facto impediments to women's participation in govern-
 ment and politics, but cultural attitudes are not favorable to their participation.
 Women hold 14 seats in the 511-member lower house of the Diet and 38 seats in
 the 252-member upper house. The 21-member Cabinet includes only 1 female mem-
 ber. Women make up nearly 20 percent of all government workers but hold less
 than 1 percent of top (section chief and higher) government posts. In 1994 the Prime
 Minister's office promulgated an action plan to increase the ratio of women in lead-
 ership positions on government advisory panels to 30 percent by fiscal year 1995.
 However, the target was later cut to 15 percent, a step apparently reflecting slower
 than anticipated progress. Only 40 of the 201 existing panels currently meet the 15-
 percent target.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights organizations function freely, with no governmental restric-
 tions or impediments. International human rights nongovernmental organizations
 have been allowed to work freely in Japan, although the Government restricts ac-
 cess to prisons and detention facilities by human rights groups.
 The Civil Liberties Bureau in the Ministry of Justice and the Human Rights and
 Refugee Division in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs monitor problems relating to
 human rights practices in Japan. The Civil Liberties Bureau also commissions pri-
 vate citizens, nominated by prefectural governments, to investigate charges of dis-
 crimination.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The position of women in society, although significantly improved dur-
 ing the last few decades, continues to reflect deep-seated traditional values that as-
 sign women a subordinate role in the workplace. Although discrimination by private
 employers against women is prohibited by the Constitution, it persists. Legislation
 has been enacted over the past 30 years to accord women the same legal status as
 men. The Equal Employment Opportunity Law of 1986 was aimed at eliminating
 sex discrimination in such areas as recruitment, pay, and working hours. Yet the
 law does not expressly forbid discrimination; it merely states that "employers should
 endeavor" to avoid it. Under this law and other regulations, the Ministry of Labor
 attempts to encourage corporate compliance with its objectives by positive induce-
 ments, including subsidies; it does not enforce compliance through fines or other pu-
 nitive measures. As part of their lower overall intake of new employees because of
 
 
 recessionary pressures, some companies announced that they would hire no women
 in 1994; other companies did not announce such a policy but reduced the percentage
 of women hired for entry-level positions.
 Significant disparities in pay and access to managerial positions persist for
 women, who comprise over 40 percent of the employed population. Several cases are
 pending which challenge management's allegedly biased use of Japan's two-track
 (general versus administrative) system in hiring women employees. Initially de-
 signed to create a 'career" track for employees while maintaining a separate cleri-
 cal:" track, observers say the system is used to discriminate against women, who tra-
 ditionally have not been hired for managerial positions. While the Labor Standards
 Law prohibits employers from discriminating against women in wages, it does not
 ban disproportionate hiring into different career tracks based on gender. A 1994
 Ministry of Labr report noted that the average wage of women workers is less than
 60 percent of that of men and that women account for only 4.1 percent of manage-
 ment posts in the country. An increasing number of women have filed discrmina-
 tion suits and have protested unfair hiing practices of Japanese firms.
 Public awareness of discrimination against women andsxual harassment in the
 workplace has increased. A growing number of government entities are establishing
 hot lines and designating ombudsmen to handle complaints of discrimination and
 sexual harassment. Nevertheless, sexual discrimination and stereotyping in the
 workplace continue to be major problems for women.
 Violence against women, particularly domestic violence, often may go unreported
 due to social and cultural concerns about shaming one's family or enagerg the
 reputation of one's spouse or offspring. Typically, victimized women more often re-
 turn to the home of their parents rather than file reports with authorities. There-
 fore, Ministry of Justice statistics on violence against women undoubtedly under-
 state the scope of the current situation. Many local governments are respnding
 positively to a need for confidential assistance by establishing special women's con-
 sultation departments in police and prefectural offices.
 Recent immigration trends reflect the growing problem of trafficking of Asian
 women to Japan. While the number of illegal male workers has decreased from its
 peak in November 1992, the number of illegal female workers continued to increase.
 Human rights groups estimate that over 60 percent of illegal female immigrants
 work in occupations involving prostitution. The Government is working to reduce
 the foreign prostitution problem by enforcing existing antiprostitution laws as well
 as provisions in the Immigration Control and Refugee Recotion Act directed
 against anyone encouraging a person to engage in illegal work. Over the past year,
 police, especially in Tokyo, have condutd a number of sweeps against bth foreign
 prostitutes and their employer.
 In August 1993, the Japanese Prime Minister officially acknowledgedan adpolo-
 gized for the former Imperial government's involvement in the Japanese army's
 practice of forcing an estimated 200,000 women (including Koreans, Filipinos, Chi-
 nese, Indonesians, Burmese, Dutch, and Japanese) to provide sex to soldiers be-
 tween 1932 and 1945. Current plans by the Government to atone for these abuses
 d not include direct government compensation to surviving "comfort women." Two
 cases are pendgin   Tokyo District Court-one brought by 3 Korean plaintiffs and
 the other by 18 Filipino plaintiffs--seeking compensation for these abuses, but a de-
 cision in these cases is likely to take years.
 Chidren.-in general the rights of children are adquatey rotected. In recet
 years, however, more attention has been paid to the problem  o  r severe bull-g, or
 fijime,N involving verbal or physical abuse in middle and high schools. Over 10,000
 serious cases of jine are reported to the Ministry of Education annually, although
 human rights organizations estimate that the true number of such incidents is
 much higher. In 1993, 92 children under the age of 14 committed suicide, many ap-
 parently in response to ijime. In an effort to cope with ije as well as with other
 cildren's issues, the Ministry of Justice establshd the Oltffic of Ombudsman for
 Children's Rights in August 1994.
 Indwgenous People.-The Ainu, a Caucasoid people descended from the first inhab-
 itants of Japan, now probably number less than 100,000; almost all of them live on
 Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's four main islands. Their primary occupa-
 tions are hunting, fishing, and small-scale farming. A law passed in 1899, the
 Former Aborigines Protection Act, left the Ainu with only about 15 percent of their
 original landholdings. Ainu leaders continue to express grievances about this situa-
 tion. Meanwhilen the Ainu continue to face social discrimination while engaging in
 an uphill struggle against complete assimilation. The Government has done little in
 response to Ainu grievances. An interagency stud group opened hearings in Janu-
 ary 1990 with the stated goal of   in     ister    and making recommenda-
 tions but it has been largely moribund. A milestone was reached on October 13,
 
 
 612
 1994, when a Sapporo district court defined the Ainu as a minority group. However,
 in November the Ainu failed in their attempt to obtain a court ruing that they are
 an indigenous people with special lan, fishing, and cultural rights.
 In July Shigeru Kayano became the first Ainu member of the Diet when he
 gained a seat in the House of Councilors. Kayano declared his intent to promote
 Ainu rights legislation in the Parliament but immediate progress appears unlikely.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The ethnocentric nature of Japanese society,
 reinforced by a high degree of cultural and ethnic homogeneity and a histoy Of iso-
 lation from other cultures, has impeded the integration of minority groups. This pri-
 marily affects Burakumin, Koreans, and alien workers, against whom social and
 legal discrimination is widespread.
 The Burakumin (descendants of feudal era "outcasts" who practiced "unclean" pro-
 fessions such as butchering and undertaking) are frequently victims of entrenched
 social discrimination. Their access to private housing, employment, and marriage
 opportunities has been greatly restricted. Beginning in 1969, the Government intro-
 duced with some success a number of social, economic, and legal programs designed
 to improve conditions for the Burakumin and hasten their assimilation into main-
 stream Japanese society. The Government has extended basic legislation to provide
 funding for Burakumin programs until 1997, but the Burakumin continue to lobby
 for a new law that will expand current programs. In recent years, however, some
 within the Burakumin community have questioned whether "assimilation" is an ap-
 Dspit     vements in Japan's legal safeguards against discrimination, Korean
 prmanent residents (most of whom were brn, raised, and educated in Japan and
 who are estimated to number approximately 700,000) are still subject to various
 forms of deeply entrenched social discriminaton. In 1994, as Japanese concerns over
 North Koreas suspected nuclear development program grew, verbal and physical at-
 tacks escalated against pro-North Korean sympathizers until tensions decreased in
 midyear. Between April and July, over 120 such incidents-mostly targeting Korean
 school students-were alleged by the pro-North Korea Chosen Soren Residents' As-
 sociation. The Ministry of Justice acknowledged 42 attacks on Korean students as
 "human rights violations" as of June.
 The Government in 1993 halted the fingerprinting of permanent foreign residents.
 (A Korean alien resident of Japan who lost her permanent resident status because
 of her refusal to be fingerprinted won an appeal to the Fukuoka High Court after
 the law was repealed.) Instead of fingerprinting, the Government has established a
 family registry system that uses the resident's picture and signature and contains
 information on parents and spouses living in Japan, a system similar to that used
 for Japanese nationals. The current law eaves intact the requirement that all for-
 eign residents must carry alien registration certificates at all times.
 In recent years, the Government has enacted several laws and regulations provid-
 ing permanent resident aliens with equal access to public housing and loans, social
 security pensions for those qualified, and certain public employment rights. Some
 immigrants reportedly face plie harassment and dic nation in obtaining hous-
 ing, jobs, and health care. In recognition of the difficulties faced by foreigners in
 these areas Tokyo city has issued a law to prevent housing discrimination against
 foreigners. 'here have also been efforts by the entral and local governments to dis-
 seminate information on health insurance plans to enroll foreigners into the system.
 Some communities are using existing social welfare programs to cover emergency
 medical expenses incurred by uninsured foreign visitors.
 The January 1991 Memorandum Between the Japanese and South Korean Gov-
 rnments extended employment rijghts to local government positions, giving each lo-
 cality the authority to decide which jobs ma  held by non-Japanese nationals.
 Local governments are also being urged by the Government to allow Korean resi-
 dents to take the Teacher Entrance Examination and to employ them on a full-time
 basis. Private-sector employment and social discrimination are still common. Anti-
 discrimination laws affecting Korean residents were initiated as government guid-
 ance and are not backed up by penalty provisions. In the first court test of Japan's
 antidiscrimination laws, in September a second-generation Korean nurse sued the
 Tokyo metropolitan government on the grounds that she had been refused consider-
 ation for promotion because she is not Japanese. At year's end the case was still
 pending.
 According to law, aliens with 5 years of continuous residence are eligible for natu-
 ralization and the simultaneous acquisition of citizenship rights, including the right
 to vote. In fact, however, most eligible aliens choose not to apply for citizenship, in
 part due to fears that their cultural identity would thereby be lost. De facto obsta-
 cles to naturalization include broad discretion available to adjudicating officers and
 great emphasis on Japanese language ability.

 The Immigration Bureau of the Justice Ministry estimates that, as of May 1994,
 there were 293,800 foreign nationals residing illegally in Japan, a decrease of 1.6
 =ercent from the previous year. Many are laborers from Southeast Asia, China,
 n  d South Korea.
 Wile many of Japan's illegally resident foreigners came in search of better-pay-
 ing manufacturing and construction jobs, there are i catons that these opportuni-
 ties decreased during Japan's economic slowdown. Thus, mere of the foreign workers
 are unemployed or marginally employed. Law enforcement sweeps against illegal
 foreign workers have increased. Activist groups claim that, with little or no knowl-
 edge of the Japanese language or of their legal rights, foreign workers can easily
 be discriminated against by employers. Some illegal alien workers have been ex-
 ploited. The Government has tried to reduce the inJfow of illegal foreign workers by
 prosecuting employers. Recent revisions of the Immigration Law provide for pen-
 alties against employers of undocumented foreign workers. Suspected foreign work-
 ers may also be   med entry for passport via, and entry application irregularities.
 The Government continues to study the loreign worker issue, and several citizens'
 groups are working with illegal foreign workers to improve their access to informa-
 tion on worker rights.
 Japan has granted asylum in only a small number of cases to those claiming fear
 of persecution upon return to their homeland. The Government believes that most
 people seeking asylum in Japan do so for economic reasons. According to the For-
 eign Ministry, from 1982 to August 1994, Japan determined that 206 of 1,109 appli-
 cants met the required standard for asylum. As for Chinese student dissidents, the
 Government has shown flexibility in dealing with visa extensions, though it contin-
 ues to be reluctant to grant permanent asylum.
 In March, in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA) developed
 in Geneva in 1989 by participating nations to determine the refugee status of Indo-
 chinese asylm seekers, the Government changed its position on screening proce-
 dures for Vietnamese boat people-it will no longer conduct special screening proce-
 dures for newly arrived boat people and will treat them as it would all other illegal
 entrants to Japan.
 Strict administrative procedures contribute to the roughly 20-percent rate of ap-
 proyal of asylum applications. For example, appeals of initil denials are reviewed
 a separate authority of the same body, and decisions are rarely overturned. Asy-
 lum seekers and some critics claim that the processing of asylum applications is not
 readily understandable, making it difficult for applicants to omnply with government
 procedures. Also, the 6overnment's '60-day rule" requires applicants to appear at
 an immigration office within 60 days of arrival or within 60 days of the time they
 learn they are likely to be persecuted in their home country; most asylum seekers
 arrive in Japan without knowledge of this requirement and can inadvertently waive
 their claim by not acting promptly. In an effort to make procedures clearer to appli-
 cants, the Government has revised the English-language pamphlet it distributes to
 those interested in the asylum process.
 People With Disabilities.-Japan has no national law protecting the rights of the
 disabled, including access and employment, but some prefectures and cities have en-
 acted their own legislation addressing the issue. Despite growing awareness of the
 issue, access to public transportation, 'mainstream7 public education, and other fa-
 cilities is often quite limited for the disabled in Japan.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of workers to associate freely in unions
 is assured by the Constitution. Approximately 24 percent of the active work force
 belongs to unions. Unions are free of government control and influence. The Japa-
 nese Trade Union Confederation (RENGO), which represents 8 million Japanese
 workers and was formed in 1989 through the merger of several confederations, is
 Japan's largest labor organization. There is no requirement for a single trade union
 structure, and there are no restrictions on who may be a union official. Members
 of the armed forces, police, and firefighters, however, are not permitted to form
 unions or to strike. Most unions are involved in political activity as well as labor
 relations but are not controlled by political parties.
 Unions are active in international bodies, most notably the International Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions, and maintain extensive international contacts. The
 right to strike, implicit in the Constitution, is exercised. During 1993, 116,000 work-
 er days were lost to strikes. Japanese laws prohibit retribution against strikers and
 are effectively enforced. Public employees do not have the right to strike, although
 they do have recourse to mediation and arbitration. The Government determines the
 pay of government employees based on a recommendation by the independent Na-
 tional Personnel Authority.
 
 
 614
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution gives unions
 the right to organize, bargain, and act collectively. These rights are exercised freely,
 and collective bargaining is practiced widely. The annual 'Spring Wage Offensive,"
 in which individual unions in each industry conduct negotiations simultaneously
 with their firms, involves nationwide participation. Japanese management usually
 consults closely with its enterprise umon. However, trade unions are independent
 of management and aggressively pursue the interests of their workers. Antiunion
 discrimination is prohibited by law and adequate mechanisms exist for resolving
 such cases as do exist. A high-profile example still pending concerns the privatiza-
 tion of the national railway system in 1986. The East Japan Railway Company and
 some of the other private successor companies of the Japan National Railway re-
 fused to offer employment to thousands of former employees who were union mem-
 bers. Fourteen cases related to this matter have been filed with the Central Labor
 Commission. Two have been decided in favor of the workers but are under appeal
 by management, and the other 12 were still pending at year's end.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Standards Law pro-
 hibits the use of forced labor, and there are no known cases of forced or compulsory
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the revised Labor Stand-
 ards Law of 1987, minors under 15 years of age may not be employed as workers
 and those under the age of 18 years may not b e employed in dangerous or harmfui
 work. The Labor Inspection Division of the Ministry of Labor rigorously enforces
 child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Minister of Labor or the Director of the
 Prefectural Labor Standards Office administratively determines minimum wages,
 based usually on the recommendation of the Tripartite Minimum Wage Council.
 Minimum wage rates vary by industry and region. In the Tokyo area, a steel-
 worker's rate is $6.25 (620 yen) per hour. The wage rates are sufficient to provide
 workers and their families with a decent living. Amendments to the Labor Stand-
 ards Law provided for the phased reduction of maximum working hours in most in-
 dustries from the 44-hour, 6-day workweek to 40 hours in 1994.
 The Ministry of Labor effectively administers various laws and regulations gov-
 erning occupational health and safety, principal among which is the Industrial Safe-
 ty and Health Law of 1972. Standards are set by the Ministry of Labor and issued
 after consultation with the Standing Committee on Safety and Health of the Tri-
 partite Labor Standards Commission. Labor inspectors have the authority to sus-
 pend unsafe operations immediately, and the law provides that workers may voice
 concerns over occupational safety and remove themselves from unsafe working con-
 ditions without jeopardizing their continued employment.
