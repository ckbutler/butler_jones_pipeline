 LIBERIA
 The Liberian civil war entered its seventh year with a continuation of death and
 destruction. In April and May, Monrovia was nearly destroyed by fighting in the
 capital. Up to 3,000 may have died and more than 2,000 foreign nationals were
 evacuated. Almost half the population of the capital of 850,000 inhabitants was dis-
 placed. The breakdown of law and order continued until West African peacekeepers
 (ECOMOG) regained control of the city in late May.
 The fighting in Monrovia jeopardized the Abuja peace process that was launched
 in August 1995. A new peace accord-the fifteenth since the war began-was signed
 in Abuja, Nigeria, on August 17. It called for a cease-fire, disarmament, demobiliza-
 tion, reintegration, and the holding of national elections. The factions signing the
 new accord included: the Nationa[ Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL); two ethnic
 wings-Krahn and Mandingo-of the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in
 
 
 148
 Liberia (ULIMO); and a coalition of anti-NPFL forces composed of the Liberian
 Peace Council (LPC), the Lofa Defense Force, and a breakaway-NPFL group called
 the Central Revolution Council (CRC). The second Abuja Accord contained provi-
 sions for sanctions-such as travel restrictions, exclusion from elections, and estab-
 lishment of a war crimes tribunal-for factions not complying with the peace agree-
 ment.
 Although the capital returned to relative quiet by late May, when ECOMOG re-
 asserted its authority, the factions continued to wage war in the countryside beyond
 the scheduled cease-fire date of August 20. A new State Council chair, Ruth Sando
 Perry, assumed office on September 3, creating the third Liberian National Transi-
 tional Government (LNTG III). Given noncompliance with phase one of the peace
 process (implementation of a cease-fire and disengagement of fighters), phase two
 (disarmament and demobilization), which began November 22, faced formidable hur-
 dles.
 As an institution, the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) remained largely inactive.
 Many AFL Krahn soldiers, however, joined Krahn LPC troops in April and May to
 fight against the NPFL and ULIMO-Mandingo forces in Monrovia. There was a
 small corps of nonfactionalized AFL soldiers w o remained neutral in the April-May
 events and stayed, unarmed, in the Barclay Training Center.
 The Liberia National Police (LNP) and the National Security Agency (NSA),
 which report to the Ministry of Justice, together with the Special Security Services,
 which reports directly to the LNTG, alsoehave responsibility for internal security,
 but they lacked the leadership, resources, and training to function effectively. The
 LNTG II appointment of a poie director and top management team from one of
 the factions further reduced the effectiveness of the LNP. A special Rapid Response
 Unit (RRU), formed in 1995 to combat soaring violent crime in Monrovia, was infil-
 trated and corrupted by the NPFL. A new Minister of Justice appointed in Septem-
 ber disbanded the RRU. However, she was dismissed in December and her successor
 anuounced he would reconstitute the RRU. Members of the RRU committed serious
 human rights abuses.
 ECOMOG was the key military force supporting the LNTG 1II, as it was for all
 previous interim governments. At the end of 1996, ECOMOG claimed to have ap-
 proximately 7,200 troops from 6 West African countries; over half were Nigerian.
 egional governments, which had promised 2,700 additional troops for ECOMOG
 after the Abuja II Accord was signed, had not followed through on their commit-
 ments by the end of the year. In the absence of an effective central government,
 ECOMOG assumed many police powers in areas under its control. In contrast to
 previous years, there were no confirmed reports of ECOMOG committing human
 rights abuses.
 The economy, ravaged by civil war, remained in severe disarray. No reliable infor-
 mation on the GDP is available. Prior to 1990, the economy was based primarily
 on iron ore, rubber, timber, diamond, and gold exports. Ninety-five percent unem-
 ployment, massive displacements of civilians throughout the country, and wide-
 spread destruction and looting devastated productive capacity, despite the country's
 rich natural resources and potential self-sufficiency in food. Meanwhile, the parallel
 black market economy thrived as the faction leaders and businessmen exploited and
 looted the wealth of the country. Using forced labor and stolen goods and fuel, they
 logged old growth timber, used environmentally unsound mining methods, and ille-
 gaily tapped robber trees in the areas under their control. The millions of dollars
 of profits from these enterprises were used to purchase more munitions, reinforcing
 the cycle of violence.
 Factionally affiliated Government forces, factional forces, and agents were respon-
 sible for numerous human rights abuses. Some individual AFL members committed
 killings. RRU forces were responsible for killings, disappearances, and brutality.
 Factional members of the RRU actively participated in pundering and burning the
 capital in April and May, while threatemng and, in some cases, murdering civilians.
 Ministry of Internal Affairs agents also used brutality against suspects. Conditions
 in government jails were life-threatening. Police arbitrarily arrested and detained
 persons, and at times infringed on citizens' privacy rights.
 Because of the war, citizens have not been able to elct a representative govern-
 ment. The judicial system, already hampered by inefficiency and corruption, col-
 lapsed for 6 months following the outbreak off g in April There were attempts
 by authorities to limit freedom of the press and freedom of association; Journalists
 practiced self-censorship. Violence and discrimination against women are longstand-
 ing problems and have been widespread during the war. The war resulted in exten-
 sive abuse of children. The practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) persisted.
 Discrimination against minorities remains a problem. No progress was made in re-
 solving outstanding incidents of past human rights abuses.
 
 
 149
 There were credible reports that some members of ECOMOG facilitated the deliv-
 ery of-if they did not actually deliver-weapons and ammunition to the factions.
 Eyewitnesses also reported that some ECOMOG soldiers participated in the looting
 and destruction of Monrovia in April and May, this appeared to be limited to the
 Guinean contingent.
 Although the 1985 Constitution, the Penal Code, and the Labor Code remain in
 effect, because of the civil war the rights provided for in these documents were
 largely not protected in practice.
 The war has taken ahorrendous toll on civilians. Of an estimated prewar popu-
 lation of 2.8 million, 200,000 died as a result of the civil conflict, 750,000 fled the
 country, and over 1.2 million are internally displaced. Approximately 1.5 million Li-
 berians require humanitarian assistance to survive. The media, eyewitnesses,
 human rights groups, and international observers all reported flagrant disregard for
 human rights by the factional fighters. The factions committed summary executions,
 torture, individual and gang rapes, mutilations, and cannibalism. They burned peo-
 ple alive- looted and burned cities and villages; used excessive force; engaged in ar-
 bitrary detentions and impressment, particularly of children under the age of 18;
 severely restricted freedom of assembly, association, and movement; and employed
 forced labor.
 Following the looting and destruction in Monrovia in April and May, which in-
 cluded facilities of the United Nations and humanitarian relief organizations, and
 left them without offices, vehicles, and resources; the few remaining NGO's had dif-
 ficulty providing subsistence-level humanitarian relief, even within the Monrovia
 safehaven. The NGO's gradually rebuilt their staffs, even though fighters from var-
 ious factions continued to hold up relief convoys, take relief workers hostage, and
 use civilians to attract humanitarian aid (see Section 1.g.).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political violence has been endemic
 to Liberia since the war began in 1989. Factional members of the RRU and AFL
 committed illegal killings. There were credible reports of extrajudicial killings by all
 factions during the April and May fighting in Monrovia and elsewhere throuhout
 the year. NPFL-dominated RRU forces targeted and killed political opponents of
 NPFL head Charles Taylor in Monrovia. One outspoken NPFL critic was kidnaped
 in April by NPFL fighters and forced to view the headless bodies of people critical
 of Charles Taylor as a warning. On October 31, there was an assassination attempt
 by unidentified individuals against Charles Taylor at the executive mansion in Mon-
 rvia. Fighters--whether AFL, LPC or one of the ULIMO sub-factions--also tar-
 geted their enemies, fighters and civilians alike, removed their victims' body parts
 and ate them in front of civilians.
 Although they publicly professed adherence to the rule of law, the leaders of the
 major warring factions condoned and in some instances seemingly appeared to en-
 courage the murder and maiming of both civilians and combatants (see Section 1.g.).
 It was often impossible to determine whether these crimes were politically moti-
 vated or driven by tribal hatred (see Section 5). Among the many human rights
 atrocities in April, the Mandingo AFL Chief of Staff Mohammed Doumouyah was
 ritualistically tortured, mutilated, murdered, dismembered, and cannibalized by
 Krahn fighters in front of hostages at the AFL Barclay Training Center in Monro-
 via. There have been no arrests.
 The majority of civilian deaths took place during factional raids on villages (see
 Section 1.g) in the countryside. ULIMO fighters executed civilians, and looted and
 burned their villages in Grand Cape Mount and Bomi counties. Even after the
 cease-fire of the Abuja H Accord went into effect in August, killings continued. Local
 human rights monitors reported that- On September 16, in Dia town 14 civilians
 were killed and the village-hometown of State Council chairwoman Ruth Perry-
 burned to the ground; on September 21, in Kango town,16 civilians were murdered;
 on September 23, in Gunn town,17 civilians were murdered; on September 28, in
 Sinje, another massacre took place (see Section 1.g) with more than 20 civilian vic-
 tims; on December 7, in Zwanna Town (Royesville), 8 civilians were murdered; and
 on December 14 in Armadu Town, Bomi Highway, 4 people were killed. Fighting
 between the NPFL and LPC in the southeastern counties continued throughout the
 year, again resulting in many civilian deaths as villages repeatedly changed hands.
 No progress was made in investigating the many killings from previous years, in-
 cluding the December 1994 massacre at DuPont Road. ECOMOG transferred the al-
 leged perpetrators of the murder and cannibalization of a university student in Au-
 gust 1995 to civil authorities. The case has not yet been heard in court.
 
 
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports of disappearance perpetrated
 by the AFL, LNTG II or III regular police units or security forces, or by ECOMOG.
 However, there were credible reports of nighttime abductions and detention in se-
 cret jails by the NPFL-dominated RRU and other factions in Monrovia in April and
 May. The major factions were also responsible for many unexplained disappearances
 outside Monrovia (see Sections 1.g., 5, and 6.d.). Two Liberian nongovernmental or-
 ganization workers in Zwedru disappeared on April 1 and are presumed dead. There
 are credible reports that NPFL fighters abducted civilians, including children, to use
 as combatants and for forced labor in illegal rubber tree tapping and timber oper-
 ations. Both ULIMO factions used forced civilian labor to harvest alluvial gold and
 mine for diamonds.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) runs a program allowing
 family members separated by the conflict to exchange Red Crss messages, mainly
 between people remaining in the country and relatives living abroad. Save the Chil-
 dren/UJK reunited 140 children with their families during the year.
 c. Torture and Other Cruet, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.--
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other degrading treatment. There were no
 reports of torture by the LNTG II, or LNTG III police or security forces (with the
 exception of the RRU), or by ECOMOG. RRU forces were seen brutalizing civilians,
 burning houses, and looting during the April and May fighting in Monrovia. Men
 dressed in RRU trademark black clothes were involved in armedrobberies and mur-
 ders in the capital from June until September when they were disbanded.
 Although the Supreme Court ruled that "trial by ordeal" or "sassywood"--com-
 monly, the placement of a burning metal object on a suspect's body to induce confes-
 sion in a criminal investigation-is unconstitutional, the Ministry of Internal Affairs
 continued to have licensed agents who subjected suspects to this practice A lawsuit
 brought in 1994 for injuries resulting from sassywood is still pending before the Su-
 preme Court.
 All major factions engaged in torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading
 treatment. Many victims exhumed in Monrovia after the April and May fighting hag
 been "tarbeyed" before being killed-their arms tied tightly behind their backs at
 the elbow and wrist-an excruciating torture. Throughout the year, reports were re-
 ceived of rape, pillage, and the burning of villages in the western counties as the
 two ULIMO sub-factions fought for control. ULIMO-Mandingo fighters herded hun-
 dreds of displaced civilians into their Bomi county headquarters, Suehn, and held
 them hostage to attract relief food. When United Nations humanitarian workers
 were finally able to enter ULIMO-Krahn-controlled Tubmanburg in September, they
 found 20,000 starving civilians. Health care workers estimated the malnutrition
 rate at 83 percent; many people had died. Some civilians in Grand Cape Mount,
 when reached by the humanitarian community after 7 months, asked not to be
 given food because they feared that the fighters would kill. them to get it (see Sec-
 tion 1.g.). LPC and NPFL fighters were accused of beating, torturing, and killing
 civilians, especially persons suspected of being sympathizers of the other faction,
 and burned their villages in the southeastern counties. Humanitarian relief workers
 were frequently detained and harassed by fighters, their personal property and vehi-
 cles confiscated, and food, intended for hungry civilians, stolen. Members of all fac-
 tions practiced cannibalism (see Section 1.g.). The warring factions regularly com-
 mitted violence against women, including individual and gang rapes.
 Neither the LNTG 1 nor the LNTG II adequately addressed the life threatening
 conditions in government jails. There were incidents of starvation as the interim
 governments did not provide prisoners with adequate food or medical care. They did
 not pay guards for months. Cells were small, crowded, and filthy. Women, rep-
 resenting 5 percent of the central prison population, were held in separate cells, but
 there were no separate facilities or juvenile offenders. Ninety percent of the pris-
 oners in the Monrovia central prison had been jailed for over 1 year without charge
 when the central prison was abandoned and the prisoners escaped during the fight-
 ing in early April. The central prison did not reopen until October 24 and very few
 of the escaped prisoners were recaptured.
 The LNTG II and LNTG III granted human rights groups access to prisoners in
 Monrovia, and these groups frequently obtained needed medical treatment for pris-
 oners. In a number of cases, the work of human rights groups and interested indi-
 viduals resulted in the release of prisoners.
 Reliable reports indicate that all warring factions operated secret jails both to en-
 force discipline in their own ranks and to intimidate or punish their enemies. The
 conditions in these clandestine jails were even worse than in government jails. Fac-
 tions held prisoners in makeshift, substandard facilities and subjected them to var-
 ious forms of inhuman treatment, both physical and psychological.
 
 
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and provides for the rights of the accused, including warrants for arrests, and
 the right of detainees to be either charged or released within 48 hours. In practice
 some Liberian National Police officers in Monrovia and Buchanan often disregarded
 these rights and made arbitrary arrests. Many officers, whose average monthly sal-
 ary was already less than $5.00, were not paid during the year and accepted bribes
 to arrest persons based on unsubstantiated allegations. As the police have no logis-
 tics or forensic investigative capabilities, they were unable to investigate crimes
 such as the August murder of Seh Vincent, a civilian representative in the Legisla-
 tive Assembly.
 In January the editors of a Monrovia newspaper were arbitrarily arrested and de-
 tained by the NPFL-appointed police director because of an article they published
 concerning the director (see Section 2.a.). On February 27, the NPFL-appointed Min-
 ister of Justice, acting without a warrant, arrested a journalist for an article he had
 written; the journalist was beaten but later released. On April 2, the NPFL detained
 a well-known religious leader and human rights activist on the fabricated charge
 of hindering law enforcement activities when he tried to mediate a dispute between
 faction leaders.
 ECOMOG soldiers played the major role in policing the greater Monrovia and Bu-
 chanan areas. Many citizens continued to turn to ECOMOG rather than the un-
 armed, unpaid, and underequipped police force to arrest and detain alleged crimi-
 nals. ECOMOG regularly turned detainees over to civilian authorities, as in the case
 of three men arrested for the October 17 murder, mutilation, and burning of two
 market women in Monrovia. There were no reports that ECOMOG officials coerced
 confessions from suspects.
 Fighters outside of the ECOMOG safehavens of Monrovia and Buchanan did not
 honor due process safeguards and they arbitrarily detained numerous persons. Hav-
 ing almost unlimited power in practice to make warrantless arrests, they exercised
 that power often and capriciously, detaining persons, including international relief
 workers and missionaries, on spurious grounds or without charge for periods rang-
 ing from several hours to several weeks.
 Approximately 750,000 citizens (over one-fourth of the rewar population), includ-
 ing former political leaders and human rights activists, Red the country because of
 the war.
 The Government does not employ forced exile.
 In April and May, over 2,000 foreign nationals, including United Nations agency
 and international humanitarian aid workers were evacuated when fighting broke
 out in Monrovia. In May approximately 5,000 civilians fled NPFL-LPC fighting in
 the southeast to seek refuge in Cote dIvoire. Approximately 2,000 civilians fled to
 Tabou, Cote d Ivoire, when fighting began in September between the NPFL and LPC
 in Grand Gedeh county. Approximately 4,000 to 6,000 displaced Sierra Leoneans
 and 2,000 Liberians fled into Sierra Leone to avoid the fighting in the western coun-
 ties in September. Many were forced back into Bo-Waterside in October and Novem-
 ber due to fighting in Sierra Leone.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-While the Constitution provides for an independ-
 ent judiciary, the judiciary has always been subject to political, social, familial, and
 rmancial pressures. Corruption and lack of professionalism remained a recurrent
 problem. Because of the war, the judiciary did not function in most areas of the
 country.
 Under the Constitution, defendants have due process rights conforming to inter-
 nationally accepted norms of fair trial. Most of these rights, however were ignored
 in practice. The NPFL-appointed Abuja H Minister of Justice rejected a court order
 releasing an NPFL defector, reasoning that the courts had no jurisdiction because
 this was an internal NPFL affair since the arrestee was an NPFL member.
 The court structure is divided into four levels with the Supreme Court, whose
 members were appointed by the LNTG H, at its apex. All levels of the court system,
 including the Supreme Court in Monrovia, functioned erratically until fighting
 began in April. Subsequently the courts remained closed until September.
 Customary law was also used both in Monrovia and the countryside. As in pre-
 vious years, the Ministry of Internal Affairs subjected persons accused of occult
 practices and other crimes to "trial by ordeal," submitting defendants to physical
 pain to adjudicate guilt or innocence (see Section 1.c.).
 In the areas controlled by the major factions, there was little pretense of due proc-
 ess; swift, arbitrary punishment was meted out by the faction leaders.
 The Government does not hold political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-While
 the Constitution provides for these rights, in wartime Liberia LNTG II and LNTG
 III authorities sometimes ignored them. The Constitution provides that police must
 
 
 obtain a warrant, or have a reasonable belief that a crime is in progress, or is about
 to be committed before entering a private dwelling. In practice some police forced
 entry without a warrant to carry out arrests and investigations.
 The warring factions committed the most egregious abuses. Combatants looted the
 entire country with impunity. Widespread destruction in Monrovia in April and May
 included private homes, schools, hospitals and clinics, shops, churches, government
 buildings, and the offices of United Nations agencies and NGO's. Many buildings
 were burned. United Nations agencies and international NGO's were targeted by
 the factions and were looted of $30 million in equipment and vehicles in April.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The major warring factions inflicted considerably mere harm on noncombat-
 ants than on each other. They deliberately targeted, tortured, and murdered civil-
 ians, and regularly murdered women, children, and the elderly, indiscriminately
 ransacking villages and confiscating scant food supplies.
 The massacre of more than 20 people, mostly women and children, at Sinje,
 Grand Cape Mount county, on September 28 illustrates the factions' disregard ]or
 humanitarian law. An exhumation of the bodies revealed that a baby girl's skull had
 been crushed. She was buried still strapped to her mother's back; her mother had
 been shot. Many more civilians were wounded, including an 8-month-old girl who
 had her foot cut off. Investigation has yet to determine which sub-faction of
 ULIMO-Krahn or Mandingo--was responsible. There were probably dozens of ad-
 ditional massacres in remote areas of conflict involving hundreds of victims which
 did not come to immediate public attention due to extensive political and social dis-
 ir tion throughout the year.
 n  June volunteer relief workers including the ICRC unearthed more than 520
 corpses from shallow graves where they were temporarily buried during the fac-
 tional fighting in the capital. Most of the victims died from bullet wounds, starva-
 tion, or disease.
 There were credible reports that NPFL, ULIMO-Krahn, ULIMO-Mandingo, and
 LPC fighters committed acts of cannibalism (see Section l.a.). In some instances,
 the fighters ate specific organs in the belief that it would make them stronger or
 invincible.
 Relief organizations estimated that 1.2 million persons have been displaced since
 the war began. During this period, the factions have become experts at diverting
 humanitarian assistance. Most civilians are dependent on humanitarian aid for sur-
 vival, but are often denied freedom to seek such assistance, as faction leaders and
 their followers forcibly detained them. These abducted civilians served as human
 shields for the fighters and were also used as forced labor (see Sections l.b. and
 6.c.). The factions often refused access by international and humanitarian relief
 agencies to distribute food until a medical and nutritional emergency existed, as was
 the case in Grand Cape Mount and Bomi counties when thousands of civilians were
 held hostage for over 7 months (see Section 1.c.). When assistance finally arrived
 for civilians, the armed groups frequently stole it. Fighters extorted humanitarian
 convoys at checkpoints, often insisting on providing "protection" for convoys, raiding
 upcountry warehouses, and taxing civilians in supplies after the delivery of food and
 medicines. Some civilians began asking that no food be delivered, as they did not
 want to be further brutalized by the factions. In October NPFL fighters looted 270
 metric tons of food, then falsely accused two NGO workers of the theft. An NPFL
 spokesperson later declared that the food was intended for the civilians and, there-
 fore, no crime was committed. The NPFL fighters were not disciplined. None of the
 warring factions returned the equipment or vehicles stolen during the fighting in
 April and May to the U.N. or to the relief organizations from which they had been
 stolen.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These freedoms are provided for in the Con-
 stitution and, with some significant limitations, were generally exercised in Monro-
 via. The former NPFL-appointed LNTG II Minister of Justice and the NPFL-ap-
 pointed police director attempted to intimidate and restrict the press (see Section
 1.d.). Citizens, including journalists, usually showed restraint and self-censorship in
 favor of the interim governments. Due to continued economic stagnation, all news-
 papers struggled to get their editions published. Following the April hostilities, the
 press was virtually moribund.
 The restrictive Media Law, instituted during the Doe regime, remains in force and
 provides the Ministry of Information wide discretion in licensing and regulating
 journalists. A 1993 decree, which also remains in effect, set up guidelines for report-
 ing on war-related issues.
 
 
 Despite threats and harassment from the factions, the independent press contin-
 ued to function until April/May. The independent press was among the first targets
 when fighting broke out in Monrovia. Only 1 of 13 independent newspapers escaped
 destruction, as it had changed its offices 2 weeks prior to the outbreak of fighting,
 but had not moved its trade sign. The independent press lost almost all of its equip-
 ment and supplies as did the two printing houses in Monrovia. No newspapers were
 printed for almost 4 months. Although by December six independent newspapers
 were publishing sporadically in Monrovia, they were financially weak. The other
 independent newspapers were still trying to reopen, but one, the Daily Observer,
 discouraged by the destruction and intiidation, remained closed until January
 1997.
 In addition to the independents, there was one pro-NPFL newspaper, The Patriot,
 and one pro-ULIMO-Mandingo newspaper, The National.
 Although there once were three regional television stations in addition to one in
 Monrovia, television broadcasts ceased when the war started and have not resumed.
 Prior to the April and May destruction in Monrovia, there were six radio stations.
 With the exception of the NPFL-owned station, the others were looted or destroyed.
 In December only the government radio station, ELBC, the NPFL station, KISS-FM,
 and the independent Radio Monrovia were broadcasting regularly. In November the
 NPFL initiated a new short wave radio station from Totota.
 Academic freedom was generally respected at the University of Liberia, however,
 it has been closed since April.
 b. Freedom of Peacefd Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of peaceful assembly and association. The LNTG II and LNTG III gen-
 erally permitted political parties and other groups to organize freely and hold public
 meetings in Monrvia. In February, however, bth government oficials and faction
 leaders vigorously opposed a civil society (including N 's)-spnsord "stay at home
 day," the purpose of which was to express the popular demand for warring factions
 to disarm. In March the Women's Development Association of Liberia planned a
 public event on International Women's Day. The NPFL-appinted Minister of Jus-
 tic pubicly criticized the rally and denied the organizers permission to march in
 the capital. The organizers were granted permission by ECOMOG and the march
 was held as scheduled. For security purposes, however, ECOMOG continues to gen-
 erally discourage large-scale parades or demonstrations.
 The factions severely restricted freedom of assembly and association in areas they
 controlled.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution recognizes freedom of religion as a fun-
 damental right, and Liberia has no established state religion. Although Islam is
 gaining adherents, as much as 40 percent of the population profess to be Christian.
 A significant portion of the population follows traditional animism or blends tradi-
 tional religions with Christianity or Islam Although the law prohibits religious dis-
 crimination, Islamic leaders complained that Muslims were discriminated against
 (see Section 5). There was no evidence of systematic violation of religious freedom
 by the warring factions.
 d Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement throughout the
 country as well as the right to leave or enter. To protect the 1 million people in
 Monrvia and Buchanan from ramat lawlessness and banditry, ECOMOG estab-
 lished a protective cordon around those cities and numerous checkpoints within the
 capital. In April and May, however, ECOMOG failed to protect Monrovia from fac-
 tional fighting. It was not until May 27 that the Monrovia and Buchanan
 safehavens were reestablished. When ECOMOG could not guarantee safe passage
 upcountry, it restricted the movement of civilians and humanitarian aid workers at
 various times throughout the year.
 Throughout the year, factional fighters prevented freedom of movement, restrict-
 ing a range of activities from resettlement of displaced people to ordinary commerce
 and travel, througout the areas they controlled. The warring factions also impeded
 the movement of relief workers and supplies, and extorted, humiliated, and har-
 assed civilians throughout the country at checkpoints and makeshift barricades.
 Even after the seating of the LNTG I Council of State in September, there were
 reports that beatings of international humanitarian workers and thefts of foodstuffs
 and humanitarian vehicles by the warring factions continued. In November, on the
 eve of disarmament, aid work er reported that fighters in Tubmanburg threatened
 to hold them hostage if the aid workers did not distribute food as they desired (see
 Section 1.g.).
 Since 1990 over 1.2 million citizens (of an estimated prewar population of 2.8 mil-
 lion) have been internally displaced. There are mre than 750,000 Liberian refugees
 in neighboring West African countries. Some of the internally displaced returned to
 
 
 154
 Monrovia in January-March, but fled again when fighting resumed in April. Most
 subsequently returned, and there was no influx of displaced persons returning to
 Monrovia following the Ajuba II accord.
 The Government provides first asylum. Although in 1995 there were approxi-
 mately 120,000 Sierra Leonean refugees in Liberia, because of the fighting in west-
 ern Liberia where most of the Sierra Leonean refugees lived, it is not known how
 many still remain.
 The LNTG III cooperated with the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in attempting to assist
 refugees. However, inaccessibility to refugees due to fighting and security concerns
 severely limited the amount of relief assistance that could be provided. There were
 no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Despite constitutional and statutory guarantees of free and fair elections, due to
 the civil war citizens could not exercise the right to change their government. A new
 interim government, the LNTG III, was installed on September 3, as a result of the
 signing of the Abuja II Accord on August 17. The Abuja II Accord calls for national
 elections in May 1997.
 There are no restrictions on the participation of women in politics, however, they
 are underrepresented. Overall numbers of women in the LNTG II and LNTG III and
 the various political parties are small. With the advent of the LNTG III, a women
 chaired the Council of State, but there were no women as government ministers.
 A woman was appointed as chairman of the Elections Commission.
 One vice councilman on the Council of State is a Muslim.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The interim governments have generally permitted domestic and international
 groups to operate, but factional members of the Council of State have harassed,
 threatened, and beaten local human rights and humanitarian workers when they
 did not like their reports assessing responsibility for human rights violations.
 The few domestic human rights organizations were underfunded, understaffed,
 and their personnel lacked adequate training. These groups were specifically tar-
 geted during the April and May fighting in Monrovia by factional fighters. Several
 influential human rights activists, who were the targets of RRU killers, left the
 country. Some have not returned. In December there were eight small human rights
 groups in the country; all struggled to rebuild looted offices and secure the funding
 needed to continue their work. The support structure for the consortium of human
 rights NGO's in Monrovia was destroyed during the April fighting and has not been
 reconstituted.
 Prior to the fighting in Monrovia in April, some of the domestic human rights
 groups, as well as lawyers performing legal aid work, visited prisoners in govern-
 ment jails. None reported governmental interference with their activities. There
 were no domestic human rights organizations outside the cities of Monrovia and Bu-
 chanan due to insecurity associated with the warring factions' hostility to such orga-
 nizations, but a few Monrovia-based human rights workers and members of the
 press sometimes were able, often at great risk to themselves, to visit the countryside
 to investigate reports of massacres and other human rights abuses.
 Although the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) has respon-
 sibility for monitoring human rights, for most of the year no one carried out this
 function. No UNOMIL reports on human rights were made public. The trained
 human rights observer assigned to UNOMIL in October 1995 resigned in November
 1995, claiming lack of support for his work by the Special Representative of the Sec-
 retary General. He was replaced by another trained human rights observer in De-
 cember 1996.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on ethnic background, race, sex,
 creed, place of origin, or political opinion, but discrimination exists. There are no
 laws against gender-based discrimination, ethnic discrimination, or female genital
 mutilation (FGM).
 Women.-In the massive violence inflicted on civilians during the conflict, women
 suffered the most (see Sections 1.c. and 1.g.). Rape was commonplace. Even prior
 to the war, domestic violence against women was extensive but never seriously ad-
 dressed as an issue by the Government, the courts, the media, or women's groups.
 Since the war began, several women's organizations were established in Monrovia
 
 
 155
 and Gbarnga to advance family welfare issues, to help promote political reconcili-
 ation, and to assist in rehabilitating former combatants as well as civilian victims
 of war. Several NGO's in Monrovia and Buchanan have developed programs for
 treating abused women and girls and increasing awareness of their human rights.
 Facilities and equipment were destroyed in the April fighting. At year~s end, the
 NGO's were attempting to restart many of their programs.
 The status of women varies by region, ethnic group, and religion. Before the out-
 break of the civil war, women held one-fourth of the professionaland technical occu-
 pations available in Monrovia. Some women currently hold skilled jobs in govern-
 ment, including in the judiciary. On the whole, however, the situation of women de-
 teriorated dramatically with the onset of war, the closing of most schools, and the
 loss of their traditional role in production, allocation, and sale of food. In urban
 areas, women can inherit land and property. In rural areas, where traditional cus-
 toms are stronger, a woman is normally considered the property of her husband and
 his clan and usually is not entitled to inherit from her husband.
 Children.-Denied a normal childhood, Liberian youth have been seriously victim-
 ized by the civil war. The factions have abused children and have given no attention
 to their welfare; education and nurturing have been completely disrupted. Many
 who were disabled, orphaned, abandoned, or "lost" during a military attack on their
 homes or villages, accepted the protection and sustenance that joining a faction
 brought. The NPFL, LPC, and the two win   of ULIMO recruited and trained chil-
 dren as cooks, spies, errand runners, guard, patrols, and in many instances, com-
 batants. Factions provided addictive drugs to children, thereby ensuring their com-
 pliance and continued participation in warfare. Many have been killed or wounded,
 ave witnessed terrible atrocities, or themselves committed atrocities, becoming
 both victims and abusers in the conflict. There are no precise figures on the number
 of child soldiers, but some sources believe that 10 percent of the estimated 60,000
 combatants are under 15 years of age; about 50 percent may be under 19. Many
 suffer from posttraumatic stress syndrome and have become addicted to drugs.
 Some NGO's and UNICEF initiated small retraining and rehabilitation programs
 for a limited number of former child fighters (see Section 6.d.), but these programs
 and facilities were destroyed during the April and May destruction of Monrovia.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM) is widely condemned by international health ex-
 ports as damaging to both physical and psychological health. FGM traditionally has
 en performed on young girls by northern, western, and central tribes, particularly
 in rural areas among traditional societies. Prior to the onset of civil war in 1989,
 approximately 50 percent of women in rural areas among northern, western, and
 central tribes between the ages of 8 and 18 underwent FGM. The war, however, has
 totally disrupted village life. Today probably less than 10 percent of females undergo
 FGM. In some instances, female health professionals in the tribes participated in
 the practice to the extent of providing hygienic conditions and postoperative care.
 The most extreme form of FGM, infibulation, is not practiced.
 People With Disabilities.-The 7-year civil war has produced a large number of
 persons with permanent injuries in addition to persons disabled from other causes.
 There is no legal discrimination against the disabled, but in practice they do not
 enjoy equal access. There are no laws mandating accessibility to public buildings or
 services.
 Religious Minorities.-The law prohibits religious discrimination. Some Muslims,
 however, who represent a growing share of the population, believe that Liberia's sec-
 ular culture gives preference to Christianity in civic ceremonies and observances,
 and that discrimination spills over into areas of individual opportunity and emjploy-
 ment. Although there are some Muslims in senior government positions, many Mus-
 lims believe that they are bypassed for highly sught-after government jobs.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although the Constitution bans ethnic dis-
 crimination, it also provides that only "persons who are negroes or of negro descent"
 may be citizens or own land, thus denying full rights to many persons who were
 born or lived most of their lives in Liberia. There has been no governmental initia-
 tive to repeal this racial test, but there are reports that non-Liberians have acquired
 Liberian passports. The 1975 economic "Liberianization" law prohibits foreign own-
 ership of certain businesses, such as travel agencies, retail gasoline stations, and
 beer and soft-drink distributors.
 The roots of the current civil conflict can be found to a large extent in the histori-
 cal division between the Americo-Liberian minority who comprised 5 percent of the
 population and the 16 indigenous ethnic groups. Ethnic tensions were exacerbated
 during the Doe regime (1980-89) because of domination by his ethnic group, the
 Krahn. Throughout the civil war, the factions used an individual's language to iden-
 tify ethnicity and often summarily executed those from groups considered hostile.
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution states that workers, except mili-
 tary and police, have the right to associate in trade unions. The Constitution also
 states that unions are prohibited from partisan political activity. Government inter-
 ference in union activities, especially elections and leadership conflicts, was com-
 monplace both before and during the war.
 Even though legal economic activity came almost to a complete halt during the
 on-going 7-year civil war, there were 32 functioning unions with the common objec-
 tive of protecting the rights of their 60,000 members, who were largely unemployed.
 There is a proposal before the unions to merge into one body called the All Liberia
 Trade Union Unity Council which, if instituted, would encompass the Liberian Fed-
 eration of Labor Unions. Despite this union activity, the actual power the unions
 exercised was extremely limited. The most vocal organization was the Liberian Sea-
 man, Port and General Workers Union, which urged the government to pressure Li-
 berian flag vessels to employ more Liberian workers.
 The Constitution is silent on the right to strike, but labor laws protect this right.
 During the year, neither LNTG II nor LNTG III took discriminatory actions against
 organized labor. There were no noteworthy strikes during the year. Government offi-
 cials were attempting to solve the problem of salary arrearages for all civil servants
 at year's end.
 Liberia's status as a beneficiary of trade preferences under the United States' gen-
 eralized system of preferences (GSP) program was suspended in 1990 as a result
 of the Doe government's failure to take steps to provide internationally recognized
 worker rights.
 Labor unions have traditionally affiliated with international labor groups, such as
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-With the important exception
 of civil servants, workers (including employees of public corporations and autono-
 mous agencies) have the right to organize and bargain collectively. In the past,
 agreements were negotiated freely between workers and their employers without
 government interference. In 1996 these rights were largely moot because of the lack
 of economic enterprise, especially in Monrovia, where only a few businesses resumed
 operations, usually with greatly reduced staffing, after the April and May fighting.
 There are no export processing zones. All were destroyed when the war started.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, but even before the civil war this prohibition was widely ignored in rural
 areas where farmers were pressured into providing free labor on "community
 projects" which often benefited only local leaders. During the year the warring fac-
 tions continued to use forced labor for all purposes, including the exploitation and
 theft of national resources. Displaced persons reported that the LPC and the NPFL
 forced civilians to labor in the illegal timber cutting business throughout the south-
 east.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Even before the civil war, enforce-
 ment of the law prohibiting employment of children under age 16 during school
 hours in the wage sector was lax. Small children continued to assist their parents
 as vendors in local markets and on family subsistence farms. This practice persists,
 particularly in those areas affected by the war, where there are no schools. All fac-
 tions recruited young children as soldiers. Many of these children remained under
 arms (see Section 5). Based on extensive interviews, one NGO reported that only
 the LPC abducted children and forced them to serve in the war.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Law provides for a minimum wage,
 paid leave, severance benefits, and safety standards, but with the war, the enforce-
 ment mechanisms collapsed. In the war-ravaged economy, citizens were forced to ac-
 cept any work they could find, regardless of wage. A legal minimum wage of ap-
 proximately $0.90 per day for agricultural workers and 3 or 4 times that amount
 for industrial workers remains in force, but because of the war, it was not enforced.
 The Labor Code provides for a 48-hour, 6-day regular workweek with a 30-minute
 rest period per 5 hours of work. The 6-day workweek may extend to 56 hours for
 service occupations and to 72 hours for miners, with overtime pay beyond 48 hours.
 Prior to 1990 there also were government-established health and safety standards,
 enforced in theory by the Ministry of Labor. Because of the war these regulations
 were not in fact enforced. Even under the Labor Code, workers did not have a spe-
 cific right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations.
