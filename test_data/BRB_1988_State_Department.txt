 BARBADOS
 Barbados is a member of the British Commonwealth and a
 constitutional democracy with a free, multiparty system of
 government on the British parliamentary model. Its House of
 Assembly is the third oldest elected body in the Western
 Hemisphere. Barbadians recognize the Queen of England as Head
 of State; she is represented by an appointed Governor
 General. The Prime Minister is the head of government.
 The Royal Barbados Police Force is charged with maintaining
 public order; it respects constitutional and legal guarantees
 of human rights. Police morale is good, and public respect
 for the police force is high. The 350-man volunteer Barbados
 Defence Force is responsible for national security, but is
 used for public order in times of crisis, emergency, or other
 specific need.
 The country's economy, based on tourism, light manufacturing,
 services, and sugar, is highly susceptible to external
 economic developments.
 Barbados has a long record of respecting human rights. There
 was no change in that record during 1988.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No killings for political motives were reported.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there
 were no reports in 1988 of cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment,
 and requires detainees to be brought before a court of law
 within 72 hours of arrest. These provisions are respected in
 practice. Criminal defendants have the right to counsel, and
 attorneys have ready access to their clients. Exile is not
 used as a punishment or means of political control.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that persons charged with criminal
 offenses be given a fair, public hearing within a reasonable
 time by an independent and impartial court. Defendants are
 presumed innocent until proven guilty. The Government
 provides free legal aid to the indigent. The judiciary acts
 independently and is free of intervention from other branches
 of government. There are no political prisoners.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not interfere arbitrarily in the private
 lives of its citizens. The Constitution prohibits arbitrary
 entry, search, or seizure, and the law requires warrants to be
 issued before privately owned property may be entered and
 searched. The Government neither censors mail nor restricts
 the receipt of foreign correspondence or publications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and
 these rights are respected in practice. There are five radio
 stations, two of which are government owned. CBC Television
 Service (the sole television station) is government owned.
 Though CBC is not independent of government control, views
 opposing government policies are regularly reported. There
 are two independent daily newspapers. Opposing political
 views are presented, and the Government regularly comes under
 attack in the newspapers and on two popular daily call-in
 radio programs.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government observes the constitutional guarantees of
 peaceful assembly and private association. Political parties,
 trade associations, and private organizations function and
 hold meetings and rallies without government hindrance.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is full freedom of religion. While the Anglican and
 Methodist faiths have traditionally predominated, there are
 numerous other active religious denominations and organizations
 throughout the country. Foreign missionaries of various
 faiths proselytize freely. The Caribbean Conference of
 Churches is headquartered in Barbados and publishes materials
 there.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens and legal residents move freely within Barbados, and
 leave and enter the country without restriction, rights
 provided for in the Constitution. Barbados has a small number
 of applicants for admission as refugees; their applications
 are processed on a case-by-case basis.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Parties freely compete in honest elections by secret ballot at
 least every 5 years. There are no impediments to
 participation in the political process; all Barbadians over
 age 18 may vote.
 The present Democratic Labour Party (DLP) Government won the
 May 1986 election, taking 24 of the 27 seats and replacing the
 incumbent Barbados Labor Party (BLP) Government. A small

 BARBADOS
 Marxist party, the Workers Party of Barbados, was formed in
 1985, but has attracted little support and participated only
 marginally in the 1986 election. It holds no parliamentary
 seats. A fourth party, the Barbados National Progressive
 Party, was formed in 1988.
 A Cabinet of Ministers, appointed by the Prime Minister,
 exercises executive power. The head of the BLP, a former
 foreign minister and attorney general with a strong record as
 a champion of human rights, is the leader of the opposition.
 Women have full political rights under the Constitution, and
 they are increasingly active in politics and in government.
 Section-4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no reports of human right violations in Barbados
 during 1988, and human rights groups have not requested any
 investigations. There is a local affiliate of Amnesty
 International. The Government of Barbados advocates
 strengthening the human rights machinery of the United Nations
 and the Organization of American States, as well as more
 investigations into alleged violations of human rights in
 other countries and the increased use of fact-finding or
 observer teams to monitor controversial political and
 electoral situations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law,
 regardless of race, religion, or sex. These provisions are
 generally respected in practice; however, an instance in June
 of a government road contract awarded to a Black-owned company
 which was a high bidder instead of a White-owned low bidder
 was widely viewed as official racism, and cost Barbados World
 Bank support for the project. Barbados is a signatory of the
 1979 Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of
 Discrimination Against Women. Women actively participate in
 all aspects of national life and are well represented at all
 levels in both the public and private sectors. There are no
 statistics available on sex-based wage discrimination.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to organize and strike, and freely
 exercise these rights. There are two major unions and several
 smaller ones, representing various sectors of labor. The
 largest union, the Barbados Worker's Union (BWU), is
 historically closely associated with the governing DLP (BWU
 officers hold three elected parliamentary seats and the
 appointed post of President of the Senate), but the union is
 not controlled by the Government. Trade unionists' personal
 and property rights are given full protection under law.
 Barbadian trade unions are free to affiliate to trade union
 internationals and are active in a variety of regional and
 international labor organizations. Barbados is a member of
 the International Labor Organization (ILO) and has ratified
 ILO Conventions 87 and 98 dealing with freedom of association
 and collective bargaining.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of collective bargaining is provided by law and
 respected in practice. Approximately 20 percent of the
 working population is organized, and wages and working
 conditions are negotiated through the collective bargaining
 process. Employers have no legal obligation to recognize
 unions but most do when a majority of their employees are
 organized. Workers who may be subject to antiunion
 discrimination have recourse to the Department of Labor, whose
 chief labor officer conducts inquiries. One incident in 1988
 involved workers who were dismissed, allegedly for joining a
 union. The case is still under investigation. There are no
 manufacturing or special areas where collective bargaining
 rights are legally or administratively impaired.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by the Constitution
 and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum working age of 16 in Barbados is generally
 observed. Minimum age limitations are reinforced by compulsory
 primary and secondary education policies.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The workweek is 40 hours in 5 days, and workers are guaranteed
 a minimum of 3 weeks of annual leave. Occupational safety and
 health conditions are in keeping with ILO standards. Minimum
 wages for specified categories of workers are administratively
 established and enforced by law. The minimum wage for shop
 assistants, $136 per week, is sufficient to meet minimum
 decent living standards; most employees earn more. All
 workers are covered by unemployment benefits legislation, and
 by national insurance (social security) legislation. A
 comprehensive government-sponsored health program offers
 heavily subsidized treatment and medication.
