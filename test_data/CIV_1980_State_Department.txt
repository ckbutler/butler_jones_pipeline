 IVORY COAST
 The Ivory Coast is a one party state. Power is concentrated
 within the party whose longtime leader is President Houphouet-
 Boigny. The party seeks to develop a broad consensus for
 its program of socioeconomic development. This consensus
 has been reinforced over the past year by the institution of
 competitive elections for party, legislative and municipal
 posts. Economic growth has permitted appreciable improve-
 ment in the standard of living and has contributed to
 widespread support for the policies of the Ivorian govern-
 ment. Ivory Coast remains a developing country in which the
 vital needs of some of its people are not fulfilled. Ivory
 Coast generally seeks to involve dissenters in the operations
 of the system, rather than to isolate or imprison them.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 186 of the Ivorian penal code prohibits the use of
 violence by officials unless there is legitimate justifi-
 cation. Article 186 does not, however, specifically mention
 torture, nor does it define what constitutes "legitimate
 justification" or legitimate level of violence officials may
 use. There have been no reports of torture in Ivory Coast.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Although capital punishment is not legally prohibited, it
 has not been used since independence. Some foreign Africans
 have been treated roughly; but systematically cruel,
 inhuman or degrading treatment of individuals or prison
 inmates is not known to occur. Prisoners are allowed visits
 from attorneys of their choice and family members, who
 frequently provide food to supplement the sparse prison
 diet. Prison conditions are poor. There is no evidence of
 discriminatory treatment of prisoners on the basis of sex,
 ethnicity or race.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no reports of any cases of abduction, secret
 arrest or clandestine detention. There have been no allega-
 tions of persons disappearing.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Ivorian constitution and pertinent statutes prohibit
 arbitrary arrest or imprisonment (article 134 of the penal
 code, among other provisions) and they rarely occur. The
 government does occasionally detain individuals it believes
 may be security threats. It also takes firm measures
 against acts it considers threats to internal security.
 There are no known political prisoners in Ivory Coast.
 There are no pending allegations by human rights groups,
 opposition groups or individuals about the existence of
 political prisoners.

 Under the Ivorian penal code, a public prosecutor can detain
 a suspect for up to 48 hours without bringing charges. Any
 further detention must be ordered by a magistrate. Magistrates
 can authorize periods of detention of up to four months, but
 must provide a monthly written explanation of why the
 detention should be continued to the Minister of Justice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial exists and appears to be
 respected. In most rural areas, however, justice is often
 administered at the village level through traditional tribal
 institutions. The judiciary is independent of the executive
 and military and that independence is broadly respected.
 Defendants have the right to legal counsel and the Ivorian
 judicial system provides court-appointed attorneys for
 indigent defendants, although in practice such attorneys are
 not readily available. Appeals of verdicts of civilian
 courts are made to the Court of Appeals. Civilians are not
 tried by military courts. There is no structure of appeals
 courts within the military justice system. Persons convicted
 by a military tribunal may request the Supreme Court to set
 aside the tribunal's verdict and order a retrial.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The Code of Penal Procedure specifies the conditions for
 entry into a private residence. A policeman or investigat-
 ing magistrate may conduct searches of homes without a
 warrant, if he has reason to believe there is evidence
 concerning a crime on the premises. He must have the
 prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects seized in the
 search. He is required to have witnesses to the search
 which may not take place between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and
 4:00 a.m.
 Legal safeguards against arbitrary searches are generally
 respected in the modern parts of cities. In less developed
 urban sectors and in rural areas legal safeguards are
 sometimes ignored.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 In 1979 the rate of real economic growth in Ivory Coast
 fell from the over seven percent-average experienced since
 1960 to five percent and is likely to be even lower during
 1980. New jobs are being created less rapidly than the
 labor force is growing and unemployment is creeping up.
 inflation was over 15 percent in 1979.
 Ivory Coast's population of some eight million includes over
 two million foreign Africans, 100,000 Lebanese, perhaps
 60,000 French and smaller numbers of other Europeans and
 North Americans. Despite the potential for friction in
 this diverse society, foreigners hold a disproportionate
 share of the well-paying managerial positions. The official
 policy of Ivorianization keeps the better blue-collar jobs
 from the foreign Africans. The government has upgraded
 living standards during the 20 years since independence.
 It has striven to improve conditions of health, education,
 
 
 123
 housing and employment. Special efforts have been made in
 favor of the economically backward north and southwest
 regions. The tax structure and plan for government expendi-
 tures will probably redistribute income to lower income
 groups.
 All land in Ivory Coast belongs to the government unless
 legal title is established. In urban areas, master.plans
 for the centers have been developed and surveys made: land
 rights are clearly established and alienable; real estate is
 exchanged in an orderly market and may be acquired by both
 citizens and foreigners.
 In rural areas land teac   is less certain. Although land
 belongs to the government, tribal traditions govern its
 use. The right to occupy and cultivate land is determined by
 local custom and may vary from one part of the country to
 another.
 Government medical insurance and retirement programs provide
 an element of income security for salaried employees in the
 modern sector, and there are extensive safeguards against
 unjust compensation and capricious discharge from one's
 position. Month-long paid vacations and substantial
 severance pay are guaranteed. Conditions are quite differ-
 ent for urban workers in the informal sector and rural
 workers. No nationwide government programs are designed to
 create jobs or maintain incomes during periods of unemploy-
 ment; medical insurance benefits are not available. The only
 unemployment-, medical and social security "programs" are
 those provided by the extended families where collective
 responsibility is strongly felt, even by those well estab-
 lished in the modern sector.
 Salaried workers in the modern sector are entitled to
 minimum wages set by the government that in recent years
 have been adjusted upward to reflect inflationary pressures.
 Many workers receive salaries far in excess of government
 norms.
 While laws governing occupational health and safety exist,
 they tend to be underenforced.  In general, foreign Africans
 work in considerably less favorable conditions than do
 Ivorians. Children are economically active, especially in
 rural family agriculture, and are often found working in the
 informal sector in urban areas. Labor unions exist but the
 right to strike is circumscribed.
 The government's policy of Ivorianization deliberately
 favors Ivorians over the more than two million foreign
 nationals in Ivory Coast. It is most effective in limiting
 the access foreign Africans have to better paid, blue collar
 positions in the modern sector, hence relegating them to
 more menial, lower paid jobs.
 Gross domestic product per capita was nearly $1200 in 1979.
 Substantial disparities in income exist and the standard of
 living in the north is generally below that in the south.
 Although a degree of malnutrition exists in the north, no
 starvation is in evidence anywhere. In the southern coastal
 region, nature provides tropical fruits and fish in abundance
 and adequate food is generally available.
 
 
 124
 The government is committed to improving living conditions;
 housing, water supplies, and rural electrification have
 received special emphasis in the last years. Since indepen-
 dence the government has constructed over 50,000 new urban
 housing units. While most units have been constructed
 in Abidjan so far, preliminary indications are that 50
 percent will be built in other cities during the next
 five year plan. Urban housing programs have been oriented
 towards lower income families. As new industrial planta-
 tions are created in rural areas, good quality worker
 housing with adequate water and sanitary facilities is
 typically part of the projects. The commitment to reduce
 the urban/rural income gap is there and the government has
 done well in translating promise into reality.
 Eight percent of the government's operating budget is
 allocated to health care. Many people, however, especially
 in rural areas, have only limited, if any, access to medical
 services and future planning seems as much oriented toward
 prestigious high technology centers as to basic health
 services. Some observers put the rate of child mortality
 as high as 40 percent during the first five years.
 Thirty percent of the Ivorian government's budget is
 allocated to education. In principle, all residents of
 Ivory Coast, foreigners as well as Ivorians, are entitled
 to a primary education at state expense. In the south,
 educational facilities are widely provided. Not all villages
 have schools; some have primary schools only through grade
 three. Transportation is not generally provided, and the
 distances are sometimes great. These factors, coupled with
 the need for child labor in agriculture, make rural matricula-
 tion considerably lower than in the towns and cities.
 In the poorer, predominantly Muslim north the incidence
 of school attendance is generally lower, and disproportion-
 ately lower for girls. Boys get first priority in educational
 opportunities. Expenses for books, supplies, and uniforms
 keep some children from the schools.
 There are fewer places in the schools than the number
 of students who would like to attend and each autumn there
 is a frantic rush as parents seek to enroll their children.
 The same competition applies to entry into the national
 university. The quality of primary and secondary education
 is quite good, but not necessarily geared to the job oppor-
 tunities the economy is generating. The government is
 beginning to reorient programs away from a traditional
 French educational system towards subjects of greater
 applicability in a rural developing country.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Within the framework of the one party state, there is a
 large measure of freedom of speech and complete freedom of
 religion. There is freedom of assembly except when the
 government perceives a significant and immediate danger to
 public order. In such cases the government prohibits
 meetings, and arrests persons disregarding its orders.
 All Ivorian news media are owned or controlled by the
 
 
 125
 Ministry of Information. The media are supposed to play a
 positive role in promoting national unity and development.
 Criticism is permitted. In practice this means there
 is regular criticism of the shortcomings of policy execution,
 but not of the policies themselves. Foreign publications
 are readily available and are not seized,even when they
 criticize the Ivorian government, the party and the president.
 The authorities attempt to suppress distribution of the
 occasional locally produced artigovernment tracts that
 appear.
 Unions are organized and directed by a government-sponsored
 umbrella union, the leaders of which occupy important
 positions in the top organs of the country's single political
 party. The right to strike exists in theory, but strikes
 are discouraged in practice. Wildcat strikes occur occasional-
 ly. If there appeared to be a threat to public order, the
 strikers or their leaders might be detained temporarily.
 Generally, the government negotiates with the strikers and
 resolves at least some of their economic grievances. There
 have been no reports that professional groups have experienced
 persecution and/or harassment, but the government does make
 a conscientious effort to bring them under its wing or that
 of the party so as to ensure that their activities are
 consonant with the party lines. There is no favored religion.
 Those affiliated with minority religions do not suffer
 persecution or harassment. No particular faith is favored
 for advancement.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign.
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Ivorians have the right of voluntary repatriation. Ivory
 Coast's refugee and asylum practices are liberal. The
 country has resettled or granted safehaven to Angolans,
 Eritreans, Guineans, Liberians and Indochinese. The Ivorian
 government issues them refugee travel documents which permit
 them to return to Ivory Coast within two years. While in
 Ivory Coast, they receive one year renewable residents'
 visas for their first five years in the country, after which
 they may apply for permanent residents' cards. Ivory Coast
 does not take any significant burden in providing for the
 economic and social welfare of refugees.
 The government exercises minimal control over domestic
 and foreign travel. Checkpoints operate regularly outside
 major urban areas for verification of personal identification,
 motor vehicle licenses, insurance papers and other documents.
 Ivorians can freely travel abroad and emigrate, without
 distinction as to sex.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political participation in Ivory Coast is limited to the
 single Democratic Party of Ivory Coast (PDCI). President
 Eouphouet-Boigny has launched a wide-ranging program of
 democratization this year. There was intense competition in
 the party elections in July and August and about 50 percent
 of the top local party leaders were voted out of office. In
 November, opposition candidates outside of the party contested
 municipal and national legislative elections. These elections
 also resulted in a significant turnover of elected officials.
 
 
 126
 Public criticism of basic governmental policies, or of the
 president, rarely occurs. Unions and professional and other
 associations serve as channels for citizen participation,
 articulating the interests of their constituents. The
 president meets with these associations to try to resolve
 significant or difficult issues.
 some Ivorian traditional societies accord women considerable
 political and economic power. In other fields their role is
 more restricted. The October 1980 party congress devoted
 a separate section of its final resolutions to reiterating
 and strengthening the official policy of encouraging full
 participation by women in social, economic and political
 life. Women remain, however, very lightly represented
 at the higher levels of the government and the party.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government of Ivory Coast is cooperative toward inquiries
 into its human rights situation. Ivory Coast has a chapter
 of Amnesty International. The Ivory Coast Aelegation to the
 United Nations Commission on Human Rights has played an
 active and constructive role in the activities of that
 body.
