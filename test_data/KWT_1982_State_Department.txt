 KUWAIT
 Kuwait is a hereditary amirate in which leadership is held by
 the ruling Al Sabah dynasty. Traditionally, Kuwait's amirs, or
 rulers, have governed in consultation with other community
 leaders, but still hold the bulk of power in their own hands.
 Kuwait's popularly elected National Assembly now
 institutionalizes that traditional consultation. The Assembly
 wields some influence on government policy and programs through
 its powers to review budgets, approve government-proposed
 legislation, and to interrogate ministers.
 Political parties are banned and women are denied the vote, but
 there are no political prisoners in Kuwait and no recorded
 instances of political killings, disappearances, or torture
 sanvtioned by the regime.
 The National Assembly's election in February 1981, after being
 extra-constitutionally suspended from 1976 to 1981, and its
 re-emergence as a forum for popular opinion sometimes critical
 of government policy, mark an improvement in political
 participation in Kuwait. However, the Assembly itself has on
 occasion taken a less enlightened view of human rights than has
 the Government, for example, by rejecting women's suffrage and
 by barring naturalization to non-Muslims.
 Kuwait has experienced rapid change in a single generation.
 Once poor, isolated, and underdeveloped, Kuwait has become a
 highly urbanized regional center for finance, commerce, and the
 media, and a regional pioneer in some aspects of
 modernization. Kuwait's oil wealth has been distributed to its
 citizens through education, medical care, housing, and assured
 jobs. Employment opportunities have also brought an influx of
 foreign workers, some long-term (largely Palestinians), and
 others temporary (mostly non-Arab Asians). Some of these
 expatriates have imported their own regional political tensions
 and rivalries. Non-Kuwaitis, nearly 60 percent of the
 population, enjoy fewer civil and political rights and social
 benefits than do citizens.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There were no reports during 1982 of persons being killed in
 Kuwait for political motives. There were, however, three
 attacks on Kuwaiti diplomats abroad, resulting in the deaths of
 two of them. In addition, the Charge d'Affaires of the United
 Arab Emirates Embassy in Kuwait was shot and wounded. Some of
 these attacks have been linked to Abu Nidal's Black June, a
 Palestinian terrorist organization, but exact motives are
 unclear.
 b. Disappearance
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detention in Kuwait by the authorities or with
 their cognizance. Reports have surfaced in past years of a few
 persons being abducted from Kuwait and forcibly repatriated by
 foreign agents to their country of origin for political
 reasons; no such disappearances have been reported in 1982.
 c. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the Kuwaiti Constitution. There have
 been no reports that the Government of Kuwait engages in or
 
 
 1188
 encourages torture. "Third degree" methods are employed by the
 police on occasion, particularly with non-Kuwaiti suspects, to
 extract confessions to crimes.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 Summary executions and harsh Koranic punishments are not
 practiced in Kuwait. Corporal punishment is no longer
 authorized practice in prisons.
 Kuwait's prisons appear well-run along modern lines. Prison
 conditions are relatively humane and do not inflict
 intentionally degrading treatment. Prisoners receive necessary
 medical care. They are permitted to supplement prison fare
 with food purchased from outside the prison. There are limited
 educational and recreational programs for prisoners. Family
 visits and access by attorneys are permitted. Youthful
 offenders, few of whom are imprisoned, are customarily
 separated from hardened criminals. There is no policy of
 differential treatment on the basis of social class, race, or
 religion.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited by the
 Constitution. With occasional exceptions, such practices are
 not sanctioned by the Kuwaiti Government. Road blocks and spot
 checks of outdoor gatherings of expatriates, especially of
 South Asians, are used sporadically by the police searching for
 illegal immigrants and contraband liquor. Persons without
 proper identification may be detained by the police. The
 authorities have considerable leeway in detaining individuals
 whom they suspect constitute security threats. However, no
 political prisoners are known to be in custody in Kuwait.
 Legally, police may hold a person for investigation without
 charge for no more than four days, of which a prosecutor's
 approval is required for detention periods over 24 hours.
 Thereafter, the suspect either must be released or charged by a
 prosecutor, who may authorize detention for up to an additional
 21 days. Further detention may be authorized by a judge
 pending trial. These procedures are followed in practice. The
 lack of a specific charge against an expatriate considered a
 troublemaker does not hinder the authorities from summarily
 expelling him.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Kuwait's legal system is independent and provides for public
 trial, the right of appeal, and representation by an attorney
 of one's choice. Procedural rights are, however, not always
 strictly observed. Failure of the police to protect a
 suspect's rights may provide a defense in the courts. Charges
 are supposed to be stated formally when a suspect is brought
 before a prosecutor, not more than four days after arrest.
 However, non-Arabic speaking defendants in particular have
 occasionally protested that they were inadequately informed
 regarding the charges or their rights. Trials in absentia have
 occurred. In such cases, however, the defendant is allowed an
 additional right of appeal. There are no reports of secret or
 unfair trials or of discrimination against defense counsel.
 However, the court-appointed attorney of a defendant unable or
 unwilling to engage his own lawyer is not always given adequate
 time to prepare a defense. Interpretation of court proceedings
 to ensure their understanding by non-Arabic speaking defendants
 is sometimes inadequate. The Kuwaiti judiciary is independent
 
 
 1189
 of the executive and the military. There are no special
 political or security courts. According to the Constitution,
 military courts have jurisdiction only over offenses committed
 by members of the armed or security forces, except during
 periods of martial law. There has never been a state of
 martial law in Kuwait.
 The amir has the power to pardon or to commute sentences passed
 by either civilian or military courts.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is provided for in the Kuwaiti
 Constitution and respected in practice. Warrants are required
 for searches, unless the police are in actual pursuit of a
 suspect fleeing the scene of a crime or where an outside odor
 indicates the presence of a distillery or illegal narcotics.
 Search warrants to enter residences or business premises are
 issued by a public prosecutor.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Kuwaiti citizens and expatriate residents possess a significant
 degree of freedom to speak, write, read, and hear what they
 wish. The Kuwaiti Constitution guarantees freedom of opinion
 and scientific research, and there are similar guarantees for
 many basic civil and political rights. These guarantees are,
 however, stated conditionally, modified by such phrases as "in
 accordance with conditions and manner specified by law." The
 average Kuwaiti or Kuwait resident feels free to offer his
 opinion on almost any subject and does not fear official
 retaliatfon, although there are some understood boundaries
 (such as written or public attacks upon the amir, the ruling
 family, or Islam) beyond which he may not stray. Kuwait does
 have an active censorship department, which reviews all books,
 films, videotapes, periodicals, and other material entering
 Kuwait in bulk or for commercial purposes. Items arriving by
 post for individual or institutional use are usually not opened
 before delivery, unless the contents are suspected of being
 pornographic material. Printed and visual material produced
 within Kuwait is not subject to pre-censorship, but is liable
 to government action after publication or release. Radio and
 television are government-controlled.
 The Kuwaiti press is not pre-censored and is given wide
 latitude in its content. Articles and editorials critical of
 government action or of individuals appear often. Partly for
 this reason, Kuwaiti publications are widely read in the
 region. A press law, promulgated in 1961 and still in effect
 (with some amendments), sets down several categories which are
 restricted. These include criticism of the amir and the ruling
 family; official confidential communications or treaties and
 agreements with other states; material which might disturb
 relations with Arab and friendly states or which might prove
 embarrassing to their heads of state; and a general category of
 stories which "might incite people to commit crimes, create
 hatred, or spread dissension among the people." Although the
 list is somewhat loosely structured, it is, in fact,
 interpreted selectively and violators are most often let off
 with warnings. Editors and publishers are liable to
 imprisonment and fines for violations, but to date there have
 been no known imprisonments. More often, a newspaper or
 periodical is closed for a period of time ranging from a few
 days to a month. During the past year (since November 1, 1981)
 
 
 1190
 action under the press law has been taken three times -- in
 each case against the Arabic weekly magazine "al-Mujtama,"
 which was closed down for periods of one week, two weeks, and
 one month, for articles critical of the Syrian regime.
 The Kuwaiti National Assembly is currently considering a new
 government-proposed press law which will detail more explicitly
 the restricted areas, as well as spell out harsher
 punishments. A 1976 amendment to the existing press law which
 allowed the Council of Ministers to suspend any publication for
 up to two years without recourse to the courts was repealed by
 the National Assembly in May 1982.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Kuwait's Constitution theoretically protects private assembly,
 public meetings, processions, and gatherings which are peaceful
 and not contrary to public morals. However, any group of more
 than three people desiring to meet for public discussion (or to
 meet privately but issue a public statement) must receive
 explicit, prior permission from the Ministry of Interior. The
 authorities may prevent such an assembly merely by ignoring the
 request. Such permission is not, however, required for
 Idiwaniyyas,* traditional gatherings presided over by community
 leaders or family elders, which anyone can attend and there
 speak freely. Although an unauthorized pro-Palestinian protest
 at Kuwait University was forcibly suppressed by the police in
 March 1982, other demonstrations, including one march and rally
 in August involving perhaps 50,000 people, have been permitted
 to protest the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
 Kuwait permits the establishment of trade unions. The
 petroleum and banking industries and government employees are
 unionized. Most union members are civil servants. Kuwaiti
 citizens and expatriates residing in Kuwait for five years are
 permitted to join unions, although only Kuwaitis may vote in
 union elections or hold union offices. The right to strike is
 officially recognized, but seldom exercised. Refinery workers
 of the state-owned oil company struck in April 1981, but
 returned to work after some union demands were met. There is
 no apparent harassment of professional groups, bar
 associations, scientific bodies, or labor unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 While the Constitution declares that 'freedom of belief is
 absolute,' it states further that its practice is not to
 'conflict with public policy or morals.' Kuwait's state
 religion is Islam and the Sharia (Islamic law) is, by the
 Constitution,, "a main source of legislation.' The ruling
 family and most prominent Kuwaiti families are Sunni Muslims.
 There is no official policy of discrimination against Shi'ite
 Muslims, who constitute about one-third of Kuwait's citizenry,
 but they and members of Kuwait's very tiny Arab Christian
 minority are seldom appointed to sensitive government
 positions. There are a number of expatriate Christian
 congregations in Kuwait and several churches exist.
 Practitioners of Eastern religions, e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and
 Buddhists -- all of whom are expatriates -- are not allowed to
 establish places of worship in Kuwait. Proselytizing of
 Muslims by non-Muslims is prohibited. Restrictions that do
 exist in housing or employment have less to do with religion
 than with the fact that virtually all non-Muslims are
 expatriates who share few of the many privileges open only to
 Kuwaiti citizens.
 
 
 1191
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Kuwait citizens generally are free to travel inside and outside
 the country, to emigrate, and to return. There is some
 restriction of foreign travel for young men who have not
 completed their compulsory military service or been exempted.
 Those serving in the military must receive permission from the
 Ministry of Defense before traveling abroad. While there are
 no different legal standards regarding the internal or foreign
 travel or emigration of Kuwaiti women, in practice husbands can
 prevent their wives and children from leaving the country.
 There are occasional instances in which citizens' passports are
 suspended temporarily, both for criminal offenses and for
 outspoken criticism of the regime. In October 1982, eight
 Kuwaitis, including one National Assembly member, were barred
 from traveling abroad because of their allegedly criminal stock
 market activities. Since 1977 representatives of societies,
 associations, and trade unions wishing to travel to and
 participate in international meetings have had to receive prior
 permission from the authorities.
 While the Constitution says "no Kuwaiti may be deported from
 Kuwait or prevented from returning thereto," individuals have
 in the past been stripped of Kuwaiti nationality and deported.
 NO such incident occurred during 1982. However, under Kuwaiti
 law, any Kuwaiti accepting a foreign nationality automatically
 loses his own.
 All non-Kuwaitis living in Kuwait must have the sponsorship of
 a Kuwaiti citizen. Effectively, this means that non-Kuwaitis'
 freedom to leave and re-enter the country is circumscribed.
 Kuwait does not extend permanent residence to its expatriate
 population. Thus, employers have the power to restrict job
 mobility and the continued residence of their expatriate
 employees. Those employed by government agencies are given
 residence visas which require an exit permit or 'no objection,
 letter in order to leave the country. Non-Kuwaitis convicted
 of a crime are routinely deported after serving their sentences.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Al Sabah, a family of bedouin origin, have provided the
 rulers of Kuwait for over two hundred years. Oral tradition is
 that there has always been a consensus among Kuwaitis that the
 Al Sabah should rule. This tradition was affirmed by the 1962
 Constitution which established Kuwait as a hereditary amirate
 with the succession limited to descendants of the ruler at the
 turn of this century. In practice, the ruler and senior family
 members choose the crown prince from either the al-Jabir or the
 al-Salim branch of the Al Sabah. The Constitution requires
 that this choice be confirmed by majority vote of the National
 Assembly. Executive power is vested in the ruler and in an
 appointed Council of Ministers whose chairman by tradition is
 the crown prince.
 Upon independence, Kuwait inaugurated a National Assembly
 composed of 50 deputies (elected by direct male suffrage and
 secret ballot) plus cabinet members sitting ex officio. The
 National Assembly can best be described as a body to review
 government policy and programs and to recommend changes to
 reflect popular views. The Assembly reviews budgets and
 interrogates ministers on a variety of subjects, especially
 their ministeries' responsiveness in public services.
 Government policy is criticized in the Assembly. The Assembly
 
 15-480 0 - 83 - 76
 
 
 1192
 occasionally rejects government-proposed legislation but this
 is rare since the Government has usually commanded a sufficient
 number of votes from loyal deputies plus cabinet ministers to
 maintain a majority.
 When the National Assembly was suspended in August 1976, the
 Government committed itself to the Assembly's eventual
 restoration after four years. On February 23, 1981, a new
 Assembly was elected in an orderly fashion following a
 hard-fought election campaign. From among 447 condidates
 running in 25 two-member constituencies, 50 deputies were
 elected. Over 80 percent of Kuwait's 42,000 registered voters
 (i.e., about 3 percent of the total population) cast ballots.
 Within their very restricted terms, the elections appeared free
 and fair, with their major departures from democratic practice
 being the prohibition on party labels and a 'grandfather
 clause* which effectively limits the suffrage to adult males
 and their descendants who resided in Kuwait before 1920 and
 maintained a residence there until 1959. In January 1982, the
 National Assembly rejected by a vote of 27 to 7 a private
 member's bill to permit women's suffrage. The women's suffrage
 issue is unlikely to be addressed again by this Assembly, whose
 term ends in 1985. Although limited and slow, the trend toward
 more democratic practice is discernable in Kuwait.
 Informal contacts between rulers and ruled are also an
 important feature of the Kuwaiti political system.
 Traditionally, adult male Kuwaitis have had relatively easy
 access to their tribal and religious leaders, the heads of the
 prominent merchant clans, and to the ruling family itself
 through a system of "diwaniyyas,l informal clubs in which
 anyone can come and freely speak his mind. That custom has
 endured, as has the tradition that the amirs should govern in
 consultation with other community leaders. High-ranking
 officials are also approachable through "wasta," the use of
 influential family members or acquaintances as intermediaries
 in obtaining favors or a more favorable hearing for one's case.
 While Kuwaiti citizens have a significant though limited degree
 of formal political participation, non-citizens now outnumber
 Kuwaitis by 59 to 41 percent. Kuwait has been sparing in
 extending citizenship to those of non-Kuwaiti origin, with the
 exception of certain stateless bedouin. Naturalization of even
 Kuwait-born persons is rare. This anomaly is particularly
 striking for the 300,000 Palestinians, the second largest group
 in the population. Kuwait has largely denied citizenship to
 members of the Palestinian community, pending resolution of the
 Palestine issue. While expatriates in Kuwait have little say
 in the internal affairs of Kuwait, they are permitted
 considerable freedom in conducting exile activities. However,
 expatriates who violate sanctions against their involvement in
 Kuwait's affairs or whose activities risk embarrassing Kuwait
 in its relations with another friendly state may be summarily
 deported.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Amnesty International does not report on Kuwait. There are no
 known current requests by non-governmental organizations to
 examine human rights in Kuwait. Freedom House calls Kuwait
 "partly free.'
 
 
 1193
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Government has a lavish social welfare program to spread
 the benefits of its $22,840 annual per capita GNP to all
 citizens. Programs are designed to provide Kuwaitis with jobs
 (there is little unemployment), housing, family allowances,
 retirement income, medical care, education, and employment.
 Improved health care has resulted in a drop in the infant
 mortality rate to 33.9 per 1,000 live births and an increase in
 life expectancy to 70 years. Improved health care contributed
 to a high annual population growth rate of 6 percent in the
 years 1970 to 1975. However, the rate of annual population
 growth dropped to 3.7 percent in 1980, as the Government
 introduced stricter controls on immigration. In 1980,
 71 percent of the population over ten years old was literate.
 Primary school enrollment reached 99 percent in 1979.
 The major social distinction in Kuwait is between Kuwaiti
 nationals, who comprise only 41 percent of the population, and
 the expatriate population. Ownership of commercial
 establishments, real estate, and shares on the local stock
 market--the principal sources of private wealth in this
 capitalist economy--are open only to Kuwaitis. Foreigners are
 not allowed to own real estate in Kuwait and usually are able
 to engage in business or the professions only in partnership
 with a Kuwaiti citizen.
 Expatriate workers are found in all sectors and levels of the
 economy, although they occupy almost all of the lower paying
 positions. They often earn the same base pay as Kuwaitis but
 receive less in fringe benefits. Benefits restricted to
 Kuwaiti citizenship include higher government salaries,
 additional government stipends and social allowances, and
 retirement pensions. Resident expatriates are entitled to
 medical benefits and to elementary and secondary schooling (but
 not kindergarten) for their children in the public schools, but
 Kuwaitis are given preference for admission to the University
 of Kuwait. The non-Kuwaiti population can be divided roughly
 into those who consider themselves temporary *guest workers' in
 Kuwait and those (primarily Palestinians) who are basically
 permanent residents. The temporary work force is comprised
 mainly of semi-skilled workers in the construction field,
 common laborers, and domestic servants, whose families often
 remain at home and accumulate savings from remittances. Many
 of these laborers live in camps or crowded apartments under
 spartan, sometimes unhealthy, conditions. Temporary workers
 are prohibited from changing employers without permission both
 of the original employer and of the government authorities, a
 system which is sometimes abused by unscrupulous employers to
 discourage attempts by expatriate workers to seek higher pay or
 better working conditions. The Government increasingly favors
 contract workers hired for fixed periods of time. These
 workers now come predominantly from South and East Asian
 countries and have little social contact with the permanent
 population.
 Women in Kuwait (both Kuwaiti and expatriate) have comparative
 social and economic freedom considering the traditional role of
 women in Islamic societies. Although women are denied the vote
 and are yet to join the workforce in significant numbers,
 education is provided equally to both sexes and most
 professions are open to women. Women in Kuwait are permitted
 to drive automobiles and may appear in public unveiled.
