 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 In 1991 the Republic of Korea (ROK) continued the transition
 begun in 1987 from an authoritarian state to a democracy. The
 ROK held two local elections in'March and June, giving Koreans
 the right to choose their local representatives for the first
 time in over 30 years. Defeated by the ruling party in these
 elections, the two opposition parties merged in September.
 Despite the end of the Cold War and, although high-level talks
 between South and North Korea produced landmark agreements in
 December, North Korea remained a military threat. Although
 progress towards democracy has been made, elements of the ROK's
 authoritarian past survive..
 The powerful security services in 1991 continued to collect
 information on a wide variety of people, including opposition
 politicians, student radicals, and labor activists, and to
 detain people who held views the Government considered
 dangerous, principally those who advocated approaches to North
 Korea that were not sanctioned by the Government. The new
 National Police Administration was established on August I as
 an "independent" government agency no longer under the Interior
 Ministry.
 The ROK in the last 30 years has transformed itself into a
 major industrial power and trading nation. Important exports
 include textiles, footwear, motor vehicles, electronics,
 petrochemicals, and industrial machinery. A lack of important
 natural resources, especially oil, is compensated for by an
 industrious and literate population. Although growth of the
 gross nitional product was near 10 percent annually in both
 1990 and 1991, Koreans worried about the declining
 international competitiveness of their exports, brought about
 in part by wage increases that in real terms virtually doubled
 in the last 3 years, far outpacing productivity. Urban housing
 shortages, continued high levels of rural migration to the
 cities, labor shortages, and unbalanced regional development
 continued to pose problems for the Korean economy.
 Although Korea is a markedly more tolerant and open society
 than in the mid-1980's, some gaps remain between democratic
 ideals and practices. The principal remaining areas of human
 rights problems are continuing instances of police abuse of
 detainees (in both political and nonpolitical cases) and the
 use of broad security laws which, although designed to thwart
 subversion by forces aligned with North Korea, are sometimes
 used to punish the nonviolent expression of opinion or the
 ,exercise of freedom of association. Student violence,
 including firebomb attacks on police, continued, resulting in
 three student deaths. and injuries to numerous riot police.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.' Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 For the first time since 1987, a student was killed during a
 demonstration, dying after being beaten by riot police on
 April 26. He had been participating in a violent demonstration
 in which firebombs were thrown at police to protest the arrest
 of the university's student president and proposed tuition
 increases. In the appeals court, three policemen involved got
 reduced sentences of 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 years, while two others
 were released on suspended sentences. After the April 26
 
 
 896
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 demonstration authorities issued orders to prevent similar
 incidents and riot police appeared more restrained in their
 crowd control tactics during student demonstrations.
 Student demonstrations continued throughout the year and
 frequently erupted into violence because demonstrators came
 armed with firebombs. Korean police figures show that during
 the first 8 months of 1991 students attacked police stations
 115 times. Police used firearms 29 times against such attacks.
 On May 6 the leader of the Hanjin Heavy Industries union, Park
 Chang Soo, was found.dead after plunging from the roof of a
 10-story hospital where he was undergoing treatment. Arrested
 in February for violating the prohibition on third-party
 intervention in labor disputes, he had been hospitalized for a
 cut on the head suffered in a prison soccer game. The
 authorities' determination that the death was a suicide was
 disputed by his family and human rights groups, who noted that
 there was neither a suicide note nor any witnesses to the death.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no documented cases of disappearance during 1991.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Credible allegations of cruel treatment continued in 1991.
 Although political cases get the most publicity, mistreatment
 of people detained or arrested for nonpolitical crimes is said
 to be common. In both cases the mistreatment reportedly
 includes acute sleep deprivation, being forced to stand during
 long periods of questioning, verbal abuse, and beatings. On
 July 31, a Seoul Appellate Court judge ruled that authorities
 tortured two pickpocket suspects arrested in October 1990,
 forcing the two to make false confessions. The judge
 overturned the lower court's guilty verdict. In a number of
 poltical cases, most involving members of groups which the
 Government views as "antistate," there were allegations, some
 credible, that authorities used physical and mental abuse
 during the investigation phase of their detention. In June a
 policeman was arrested in Yosu for beating a detainee who later
 died. On December 30, two policemen beat to death a 19-year
 old drunken student for refusing to obey their instructions.
 Police began an investigation into the incident.
 There appears to be widespread acceptance of the use of force
 among policemen. A survey by a Korea Institute of Criminology
 researcher of 617 investigators with the rank of sergeant of
 below, showed that 60 percent believed that inflicting some
 degree of pain on criminal suspects to obtain a confession is
 justified. Only 4 percent said that torture should not be used
 under any circumstances. After the Government declared a "war
 on crime" in the fall of 1990, a number of criminal suspects
 charged they were similarly mistreated by police. In an
 important ruling on January 30, a Seoul court convicted four
 policemen of torturing dissident Kim Kun Tae in 1985. The four
 were sentenced to terms of between 2 and 5 years. They were
 set free pending appeals.
 Throughout the year students and police clashed frequently,
 exchanging rocks, firebombs, and tear gas canisters. In
 general, the Korean police have shown restraint and discipline,
 often in the face of severe provocation. Nevertheless, there
 were reports of beatings by combat police in demonstrations
 
 
 897
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 outside Seoul. In May, 8 policemen were indicted for beating
 Kwon Chong Soo, an unemployed worker, during a demonstration.
 Kwon was hospitalized in critical condition and spent 3 months
 in a hospital. In September a judge sentenced the eight
 policemen to 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 years in jail but released them on
 suspended sentences.
 Conditions in Korean prisons have reportedly improved somewhat
 in the last few years. Most accusations of mistreatment
 involved persons detained for investigation or awaiting trial
 in detention facilities, rather than those who were already
 convicted and serving their sentences in prison. Authorities
 stated that as of August 1, each correctional facility was
 staffed by three to nine medical attendant's; they denied that
 prisoners have died due to insufficient medical attention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Several restrictive laws permit the Government to detain
 persons whose views it considers dangerous, particularly people
 it considers involved in activities in support of North Korea.
 These include the National Security Law (NSL), the Law on
 Assemblies and Demonstrations, the Social Surveillance Law
 (SSL), and labor laws. Article 7 of the NSL permits
 imprisonment of persons who "praise, encourage, or cooperate
 with antistate organizations or their members or persons who
 received orders from them, or by other methods benefit
 antistate organizations." North Korea has been defined as an
 "antistate organization." (See also Sections 2.b. and 6.a.)
 In May the National Assembly amended the NSL to provide that a
 person may now be arrested only if his or her action was taken
 with the knowledge that'it was destructive to the "liberal
 democratic system." The Assembly also shortened the list of
 crimes for which the "tattletale" clause applies; it is no
 longer a criminal offense, for example, to fail to inform the
 authorities if one has knowledge that someone has made an
 illegal trip to North Korea.
 In May, based on the amendments to the NSL, the Government
 dropped NSL charges that opposition politicians Kim Dae'Jung,
 Kim Won Ki, and Lee Chol Yong knew about Assemblyman Suh Kyung
 Won's unauthorized trip to North Korea in 1989 and failed to
 inform the authorities. The Government also announced clemency
 for 258 people convicted or arrested for violations of the
 NSL. The Government continued to arrest, indict, and bring to
 trial supporters, mostly students, of North Korea's "juche"
 ideology (the state ideology of North Korea), and also to bring
 to trial members of the Advanced Masses Organization and the
 Socialist Workers Alliance under the NSL. Prosecutors
 requested the death penalty for Park Noh Hae, head of the
 Socialist Workers Alliance on charges of forming an antistate
 organization and instigating illegal demonstrations. A Seoul
 district court judge on August 1 sentenced him to life in
 prison for violating the NSL.
 There are credible reports that in separate incidents
 throughout the summer over 50 other activists were arrested
 under provisions of the NSL, among them Moon Ik-Hwan and Prof.
 Park Soon Kyung. In September the Prosecutor General's office
 released a list of over 120 student activists, mostly
 supporters of juche ideology and leaders of student groups,
 wanted for violating the NSL and the Law on Assemblies and
 Demonstrations.
 
 
 898
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 In January an appeals court reduced from 3 years to 2 the
 sentence of prominent dissident Kim Keun Tae, who was
 imprisoned under the NSL and the Law on Assemblies and
 Demonstrations. One of the charges against Kim was of aiding
 the enemy by reading his organization's charter at a rally.
 The Government justifies its broad security laws and the
 resulting restrictions by arguing that Korea is in a "special
 situation" because the Korean War ended with the signing of an
 armistice, not a peace treaty, and North Korea remains a
 formidable threat. The Government asserts that unauthorized
 attempts to contact North Korea threaten the Government's
 efforts to ensure peaceful reunification on the basis of
 democracy and respect for human rights.
 Warrants are required by law in cases of arrest, detention,
 seizure, or search, unless a criminal is apprehended while in
 the act of committing a crime. The Constitution specifically
 provides the right to representation by an attorney, but in
 practice attorneys are not allowed to be present during
 interrogation. During 1991, however, the courts made a number
 of important rulings to protect a defendant's right to
 counsel. In an important decision, the Supreme Court upheld on
 March 28 a lower court ruling that it is illegal for the
 National Security Planning Agency (NSP) to bar contact between
 arrestees and their lawyers during the initial investigation.
 There is a functioning system of bail in Korea. The right to a
 judicial determination of the legality of a person's detention
 was deleted from the Code of Criminal Conduct in 1973,
 partially restored in 1980, and then fully restored in late
 1987.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides defendants a number of rights in
 criminal trials, including a presumption of innocence,
 protection against self-incrimination, freedom from ex post
 facto laws and double jeopardy, and the right to a speedy
 trial. When a person is physically detained, his initial trial
 must be completed within 6 months of arrest. These rights are
 generally observed. Trials are open to the public, but
 attendance is restricted when the judge believes the spectators
 would seek to disrupt the proceedings.
 The Chief Justice and the other justices of the Supreme Court
 are appointed by the President with the consent of the National
 Assembly for a term of 6 years. Lower court justices are
 appointed by the Chief Justice with the consent of the other
 justices. The justices of the Constitutional Court are
 appointed by the President. Judges generally allow
 considerable scope for examination of witnesses by both the
 prosecution and defense counsel. The right to an attorney is
 frequently ignored in political cases until the initial
 investigation is completed. Political and criminal cases are
 tried by the same courts; military courts do not try
 civilians. Defendants have the right of appeal. Appeals may
 result in reduced or lengthened sentences. Convictions are
 rarely overturned. Death sentences are automatically appealed.
 Although historically the executive branch has exercised great
 influence on judicial decisions, there have been increasing
 indications of judicial independence in recent years.
 Nevertheless, the judiciary remains subject to executive
 influence in politically sensitive cases. The role of the
 
 
 899
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 Constitutional Court, which began operations in 1988, continued
 to grow in 1991.
 In February, May, and December the Government released 12
 long-term "security" prisoners (22 were released in 1990), most
 of them for humanitarian reasons and without "conversion
 statements," which involve recantation of previous political
 beliefs.
 It is difficult to estimate the number of political prisoners,
 i.e, those jailed for exercising their political rights
 unaccompanied by violence, because many people are detained and
 then released without charges, or are charged and then released
 without being tried. 'It is extremely difficult to determine
 whethbr particular persons were arrested for merely exercising
 the right of free association or were detained for committing
 violent acts during demonstrations or illegal wildcat strikes.
 Nonetheless, by the end of 1991, it appeared that the number of
 political prisoners and detainees as defined by international
 human rights standards remained in the hundreds.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In general the Government honors the integrity of the home and
 family. Nevertheless, many political and religious figures are
 still subjected to varying degrees of government surveillance.
 Security officials have admitted that thousands of former NSL
 detainees remain under surveillance. In March newspapers
 published copies of fax messages from the Defense Security
 Command (DSC) to its branches ordering them to conduct
 investigations of six student activists. The Government said
 the investigations were necessary because they were soon to be
 drafted. In April an NSP employee was caught spying on a think
 tank run by opposition Assemblyman Lee Hae Chan. Authorities
 required domestic and foreign credit card companies to turn
 over their magnetic tapes recording cardholders' transactions
 without those persons' authorization, reflecting the lack of
 legal guarantees for a person's right to privacy.
 Because of often violent student demonstrations, the security
 presence in city centers, near university campuses, government
 buildings, ruling party offices, and media outlets is heavy.
 Citizens, particularly students and young people, are sometimes
 stopped, questioned, and searched. Government informants are
 known to be posted on and around university campuses.
 Persons thought to have backgrounds as political or labor
 activists are stilldenied some forms of employment and
 advancement, particularly in government, the broadcast media,
 and education. In September a 1987 blacklist on computer
 diskette of over 8,000 dissidents and labor and student
 activists was found-in the Pusan-based Kumho Shoe Company. The
 blacklist included opposition Assemblyman and party spokesman
 Nho Moo-hyun. Nho in 1987 was a lawyer representing labor
 unions. A source, known only as"Mr. Kim," provided reporters
 another 1987 blacklist containing 1,925 names from Pusan's
 "local personnel management committee of the footwear
 industry." The source claimed that member firms and companies
 with more than 500 employees received the lists, exchanging and
 adding information from police and the Labor Ministry. He also
 claimed Labor Ministry officials were present when the
 diskettes were distributed.

 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Most political discourse remains unrestricted; nonetheless,
 restrictions on the expression of ideas that the Government
 considers Communist or pro-North Korea remain severe. Direct
 control over the print media has virtually disappeared.
 However, the Government continued to apply the NSL against
 publishers, printers, and distributors who produce or sell
 "subversive" literature. The NSL remains the Government's main
 weapon to suppress domestic dissent and to inhibit unauthorized
 exchanges with North Korea. In May a Seoul court ordered the
 registration of the monthly Labor Liberation Literature revoked
 because the magazine's political contents were at variance with
 the literary purposes listed by the publishers when they
 registered the magazine. Listening to North Korean radio is
 illegal if the authorities judge it is for the purpose of
 "benefiting the antistate organization," i.e., North Korea.
 Reading or purveying books or other literature considered to be
 subversive, pro-Communist, or pro-North Korean is also
 illegal. In April police entered university campuses to
 prevent the showing of the student-made film "Mother, Your
 Son," and arrested the filmmaker, who received a 2-year
 suspended sentence.
 Despite restrictions on the production or sale of "subversive"
 literature, the Government has allowed, within its guidelines,
 an increase in media coverage of North Korea. Both television
 networks broadcast, on a weekly basis, edited versions of North
 Korean television programs. Newspapers published interviews of
 ruling and opposition National Assemblymen who attended the
 International Parliamentary Union (IPU) in May. The Government
 has also allowed somewhat wider public access to selected North
 Korean publications. The December 13 agreement between South
 and North Korea included provisions for exchanges and
 cooperation in publishing, journalism, radio, and television,
 which South Korea has long advocated.
 Constraints under the NSL continued to limit academic freedom,
 both directly and indirectly. In September the NSP arrested a
 student who had studied juche ideology in Japan and met with
 the pro-North Korean group for Korean residents in Japan
 (Chosen Soren). In June police and the DSC arrested six
 researchers from the Seoul Social Science Research Institute
 under the NSL for writing and publishing books which the
 Government said advocated violent revolution to overthrow the
 government and build a Socialist country. By the end of 1991,
 four of the six researchers were indicted, two of whom received
 suspended sentences. Two others, who were soldiers completing
 their military service obligations when they were arrested,
 received 8 months in prison and 1 year of suspended civil
 liberties. There is also a threat to academic freedom from
 radical leftist students who attack the person or property of
 professors whose lectures or writings contradict the students'
 ideology. For example, students physically hit and threw eggs
 and flour at Prime Minister Chong Won-Sik when he visited
 Hankuk University to deliver his final lecture. Following the
 spring demonstrations, presidents of Korea's 148 4-year
 colleges and universities moved to take measures to reduce
 radical influence, such as restoring academic standards for
 continued enrollment and removing access to student activity
 funds from radical groups.
 
 
 901
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Law on Assembly and Demonstrations prohibits assemblies
 considered likely to "undermine" public order and requires that
 demonstrations of all types, including political rallies, be
 reported in advance to the police. The Government continued to
 use these and other restrictive laws to prosecute protest
 organizers and to block many gatherings organized by dissidents
 and particularly students, arguing that they might incite
 "social unrest" and are therefore illegal. Police usually
 tried to prevent student demonstrations from moving off
 campuses into the streets, and confrontations .frequently
 ensued, often involving violence on both sides.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion. Full freedom prevails for
 proselytizing, doctrinal teaching, and conversion. Korea both
 sends and receives missionaries of various faiths, and many
 religious groups in Korea maintain active links with members of
 similar faiths in other countries. The Government and the
 public do not discriminate against minority sects. Adherence
 to a particular faith confers neither advantages nor
 disadvantages in civil, military, or official life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is universal freedom of movement within the country.
 Foreign travel is generally unrestricted, but travel to North
 Korea is allowed only with government approval; one of the
 conditions is that the trip must not be "political." In the
 first civilian contacts at Panmunjom authorized by the
 Government, South Korean students met their North Korean
 counterparts in August and September. The Government, however,
 revoked permission when they agreed to undertake trips to North
 Korea that the Government viewed as political. Political
 opponents are sometimes banned from overseas travel, even if
 they are not being sought by the authorities for the commission
 of a crime.
 The Government continued to issue arrest warrants for those who
 made contact with North Korea without government
 authorization. As of September 30, however, 143 South Koreans,
 mostly sports teams, had visited North Korea in 1991"with
 government approval. On September 24 Rev. Kwak Sun-Hee became
 the first South Korean citizen to visit Pyongyang with
 government permission. In November North Korean women leaders
 visited Seoul to attend, with their South Korean and Japanese
 counterparts, a seminar at'which reunification and other
 political issues were discussed. In the December 13 agreement,
 South and North Korea pledged to guarantee "free inter-Korean
 travel and contacts;" as well as "free correspondence,
 reunions, and visits" between separated family members and
 relatives.
 Authorities blocked several U.S. citizens involved in
 commercial disputes with Koreans from leaving Korea by imposing
 "exit bans" authorized by the Exit and Entry Control Act.' The
 Act gives immigration authorities discretionary powers to block
 the departure of both foreigners and Koreans from Korea.
 
 
 902
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Korean people have the right to elect their own
 government. In 1987 they chose their president in an open
 election, and the next year they elected an opposition majority
 in the National Assembly. For the first time in over 30 years,
 local elections were held in March and June, and local
 assemblies began functioning again.  In September, a year a
 half after the ruling party and two opposition parties merged,
 two other opposition parties also agreed to join in a single
 party, giving Korea a two-party political system.
 The Constitution, as amended in 1987, provides for the direct
 election of the President and for a mixed system of direct and
 proportional election of legislators. The President serves a
 single 5-year term and may not be reelected. The Assembly's
 term is 4 years. There is universal suffrage for all citizens
 aged 20 or above, and elections are held by secret ballot.
 For reasons of culture and discrimination, women occupy few
 positions in government and the professions. There are
 currently 6 women in the 299-seat legislature, all of whom were
 appointed to proportional representation seats based on their
 party's showing in the 1988 elections. There are two women on
 the executive committee of the newly merged opposition party.
 The Second Minister for Political Affairs is the only woman in
 the cabinet. Her portfolio is women's affairs.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The National Assembly and the major political parties all have
 committees concerned with various aspects of human rights. In
 addition, several nonaffiliated private organizations are
 active in promoting human rights. These groups publish reports
 on the human rights situation in Korea and make their views
 known both inside and outside the country. Some human rights
 activists have alleged government harassment and surveillance.
 Government and ruling party officials have generally been
 willing to meet with international human rights groups,
 including groups from Asia Watch and Amnesty International.
 The Government has regularly discussed human rights with
 foreign diplomats.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Republic of Korea is a racially homogeneous country with no
 ethnic minorities of significant size. Nonetheless, regional
 rivalries exist. Persons from the southwestern region (North
 and South Cholla provinces) have traditionally faced
 discrimination. Many Koreans believe that successive
 governments led by figures from the southeastern region (North
 and South Kyongsang provinces) have deliberately neglected the
 economic development of the Cholla provinces for political
 reasons.
 Korea's conservative Confucian tradition has left women
 subordinate to men socially, economically, and legally. Some
 progress has been made since the founding of the republic.
 Women may and do vote, become government officials, hold
 elected office, and enjoy full access to educational
 
 
 903
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 opportunities.. Nonetheless, the vestiges of Confucian
 traditions remain in many areas. Most married women do not
 work outside the home. In large.companies, women are often
 expected to resign upon marriage, or no later than the birth of
 their first child.
 The National Assembly enacted an Equal Employment Opportunity
 (EEO) Law in 1988 and, in early 1991, the Government issued
 "Guidelines to Eliminate Sexual Discrimination in Employment."
 So far, however, the law and guidelines have had only limited
 practical effect.
 The traditional preference for male children continues in Korea.
 today. It is estimated that when today's children reach
 marrying age there will be 400,000 "surplus bachelors."
 Although Korean law bans sex testing and abortions except when
 the woman's life is in danger, fetal sex testing and abortion-
 of female fetuses are still widely performed.
 Korea's amended Family Law went into effect in January 1990.
 New amendments permit women, as well as men, to head a
 household, recognize a wife's right to a portion of the
 couple's property, and allow a woman to maintain greater
 contact with her offspring after a divorce. The effect of the
 revised law on actual practice is still uncertain. For
 instance, although discrimination in the distribution of
 inherited property has been legally abolished, it continued to
 be widespread in practice.
 Although the revised Family Law contains no express provisions
 regarding wife abuse, it provides legal protections for women
 in terms of custody of their children and division of the
 property if they decide to file for divorce. Before the
 amended Family Law went into effect, a woman who filed for
 divorce, even if it was based on charges of physical or mental
 abuse, automatically lost custody of.her children and had very
 limited property rights. Although the revisions gave abused
 women a more credible option, divorce still remains a social
 taboo. Most Koreans remain unaware of the revised law, and
 there is little government or private assistance for divorced
 women. These factors, plus the fact that employment
 opportunities for women are limited and that divorced women
 have difficulty remarrying, leads some women to stay in abusive
 situations. There are no reliable statistics on the incidence
 of wife abuse, although some observers claim it is widespread.
 Although other types of violent crimes are directed against
 women, reliable data on their prevalence are not available.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution gives workers, with the exception of most
 public service employees and teachers, the right to free
 association. There are, however, unions in the public sectors
 of railways, telecommunications, postal workers, and the
 national medical center. The Trade Union Law specifies that
 only one union is permitted at each place of work and all
 unions are required to seek registration with the authorities.
 The Government refuses to register unions if they are not
 affiliated with one of the country's two legally recognized
 labor groupings--the FKTU (Federation of Korean Trade Unions)
 and the independent Korean Federation of Clerical and Financial
 Workers. There is no minimum number of members required to
 form a union. Companies have in the past taken advantage of
 
 
 904
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 this provision of the law to form small, company-controlled
 unions, which labor organizers have often found difficult to
 replace with more representative unions.
 Strikes are prohibited in government agencies, state-run
 enterprises, and defense industries. By law, enterprises in
 public interest sectors such as public transportation,
 utilities, public health, banking, broadcasting, and
 communications must submit to government-ordered arbitration in
 lieu of striking. The Labor Dispute Adjustment Act requires
 unions to notify the Minist.ry of Labor of their intention to
 strike and mandates a 10-day "cooling-off period" before a
 strike can legally begin. The cooling-off period is 15 days in
 public interest sectors. The Government continued its
 crackdown on "illegal labor practices" as part of a tougher
 stand on labor disputes. Measures included the use of police
 intervention and detention of leaders. In May a union leader
 allegedly committed suicide while in custody undergoing medical
 treatment (see Section l.a.).
 The FKTU has approximately 1.7 million members. It is
 affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. Most of the FKTU's constituent unions maintain
 affiliations with international trade secretariats. The
 membership of Chonnohyop (National Association of Trade
 Unions). a fledgling alternative labor center founded in 1990
 but not legally registered, reportedly dropped from 166,000
 workers in January 1990 to 90,000 in June. Chonnohyop unions
 numbered 456 in January 1990 and 232 in 1991. Chonnohyop
 supporters blame hard-line government policies for their
 confederation's decline in membership. Critics say workers are
 disenchanted with its focus on a leftist political agenda
 rather than economic demands.
 The Government continued its hard-line policy against
 Chonnohyop and "the Solidarity Conference of Large Firms'
 Unions" ("Yondae Hwaywe"), which was formed in December 1990 by
 16 large company-based unions representing 100,000 workers,
 mostly from heavy industry. The Government describes
 Chonnohyop and Yondae as "radical organizations." In February
 authorities arrested seven Yondae leaders and charged them with
 violating the prohibition against third-party intervention in
 labor disputes. In August the Government arrested 13 labor
 activists, including at least 1 Chonnohyop official, and
 investigated 6 others under the NSL for their activities in a
 reportedly Marxist-Leninist group called the Anti-imperialism,
 Antifascism Group for People's Democracy. Authorities also
 asked for a 1 1/2 year prison term for Choi Jae Ho, president
 of the Korean Federation of Clerical and Financial Workers,
 the only non-FKTU federation legally recognized by the
 Government, for violating the local election law prohibiting
 political participation by unions. According to Chonnohyop,
 from March 1988 to July 1991, the authorities arrested 1,736
 workers and union staffers for their involvement in the labor
 movement.
 Another group of unions outside the FKTU, Chonnohyop, and
 Yondae are the emerging crafts unions, including journalists,
 hospital workers, construction workers, and teachers. Some of
 these craft federations have begun to move toward affiliation
 with international trade secretariats. The officially
 recognized Korean Federation of Teachers' Associations (KFTA)
 claimed a new law gives it legal, but very limited, collective
 bargaining rights. The Government has thwarted efforts to form
 a teachers' union popularly called Chonkyojo. In July a
 
 
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 majority of Constitutional Court justices upheld the Private
 Schools Law (Articles 55 and 58) barring private schoolteachers
 from engaging in union activities. The ruling ended a 2-year
 legal battle between the Government and the banned Chonkyojo,
 and barred 1,500 teachers, fired for refusing to quit the
 union, from being rehired. Some teachers who formed a
 committee to promote reinstatement of the fired teachers have
 themselves been punished with expulsions and transfers. The
 authorities required teachers to remove their signatures from a
 statement criticizing the Government. They also issued a
 warrant for the arrest of Chonkyojo's president for reportedly
 leading a violent rally.
 In addition to its tough policy against Chonnohyop, the
 Goverhment took a hard line against strikes conducted outside
 the scope of the law. This year there wete fewer wildcat
 strikes at key industries and media outlets. Labor frequently
 avoided government intervention by changing its tactics, using
 protest measures short of full-blown strikes, such as holding
 union meetings during working hours. In July police
 interrupted a labor-management negotiation mediated by the
 Labor Ministry to arrest eight union negotiators.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution and the Trade Union Law guarantee the
 autonomous right of workers to enjoy freedom of association,
 collective bargaining, and collective action. Due to
 ambiguities in the Trade Union Law, the Seoul district court
 ruled in September that union members cannot reject collective
 bargaining agreements signed by management and labor
 negotiators. This situation has in'the past led to repudiation
 of contracts and wildcat strikes. Extensive collective
 bargaining is practiced. Korea's labor laws do not extend the
 right to bargain collectively to government employees,
 including employees of state or public-run enterprises, and
 defense industries. Companies operating in Korea's two export
 processing zones (EPZ'S) have been considered public interest
 enterprises whose employees' rights to organize and bargain
 collectively face restrictions. In practice, however, unions
 at EPZ companies have been formed and workers in the two EPZ's
 exercise the right to organize and collectively bargain like
 other private sector unions.
 Korea has no independent system of labor courts. The central
 and local labor committees form a semiautonomous agency of the
 Ministry of Labor that adjudicates disputes in accordance with
 the Labor Dispute Adjustment Law. Each labor committee is
 composed of equal representation from labor, management, and
 "the public interest." Local labor committees are empowered to
 decide on remedial measures in cases involving unfair labor
 practices and to mediate and arbitrate labor disputes. Rulings
 by the various labor committees are sometimes inconsistent.
 Many major employers are still strongly antiunion. In
 September a dissident newspaper obtained documents showing that
 Daewoo Shipbuilding planned to control and disrupt union
 activities by infiltrating company agents to inform on the
 union and influence elections of union officers. The February
 arrests of Yondae leaders were linked to their involvement in
 the labor dispute there.
 In 1991 there were no known incidents of "save the company
 squads" beating up union organizers, although there were press
 reports of kidnaping and intimidation of workers. In 1991, as

 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 in the past, there were cases of violence against property by
 workers. Workers at the Daewoo automobile factory in Inchon
 destroyed finished cars during a demonstration. There were
 credible reports of union activists harassing and physically
 intimidating management officials, including foreign
 businessmen, during labor disputes.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution provides that no person shall be punished,
 placed under preventive restrictions, or subjected to
 involuntary labor, except as provided by law and through lawful
 procedures. Forced or compulsory labor is not condoned by the
 Government.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Labor Standards Law prohibits the employment of persons
 under the age of 13 without a special employment certificate
 from the Ministry of Labor. Because there is compulsory
 education until the age of 13, few special employment
 certificates are issued for full-time employment. Some
 children are allowed to do part-time jobs such as selling
 newspapers. In order to gain employment, children under 18
 must have written approval from their parents or guardians.
 Employers may require minors to work only a reduced number of
 overtime hours and are prohibited from employing them at night
 without special permission from the Ministry of Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Korea implemented a minimum wage law in 1988. The minimum wage
 level is reviewed annually. Companies with fewer than 10
 employees are exempt from this law, and some still pay
 below-minimum wages. Due to Korea's tight labor market,
 however, firms are increasingly paying wages in excess of the
 minimum wage in order to attract and retain workers. The FKTU
 continued to claim that the current minimum wage does not meet
 the minimum requirements of urban workers.
 The Government states that the money an average Korean
 blue-collar worker takes home in overtime and bonuses
 significantly raises the total compensation package. In the
 last 3 years, wage increases in real terms (i.e., after
 adjusting for inflation) have virtually doubled, far outpacing
 productivity. Wage increases (including benefits) in the
 manufacturing sector for 1991 averaged about 17 percent.
 According to the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs 5.2
 percent of the population lived below the poverty level in 1991.
 The labor standards and industrial safety and health laws
 provide for a maximum 60-hour workweek. Amendments to the
 Labor Standards Law passed in March 1989 had brought the
 maximum regular workweek, excluding overtime, down to 46 hours
 in companies employing fewer than 300 employees, and 44 hours
 in companies with more than 300. According to the Ministry of
 Labor, the average Korean worker worked 47.8 hours per week,
 including overtime, in 1991.'
 The Government sets health and safety standards, but the
 Ministry of Labor employs few inspectors, and the standards are
 not effectively enforced.
