 GUINEA-BISSAU
 The Republic of Guinea-Bissau is a one-party state with former
 or present military leaders in key positions. General Joao
 Bernardo Vieira serves as President of the Council of State
 and Head of State, Commander-in-Chief, and General Secretary
 of Guinea-Bissau's sole political party, the African Party for
 the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC). In
 elections held in June 1989, Vieira, the only candidate, was
 elected to a second 5-year term as President. The 1984
 Constitution states that the National Assembly decides
 fundamental questions of policy, but effective power and
 day-to-day decisions rest in the hands of the President and
 the Council of State. Although the President is the most
 powerful member of the Council, decisionmaking is collegial.
 The armed forces (FARP) are responsible for state seeurity,
 both external and internal. FARP leaders are usually members
 of the PAIGC and often hold key positions in the Political
 Bureau or Central Committee. Security forces are under the
 full control of the Government. Persons- accused of political
 crimes are tried by military tribunals.-
 Guinea-Bissauremains one of the world's least developed
 nations, and most of the L-mllion population is engaged in-
 subsistence agriculture. More than 70 percent of the
 population is illiterate.- The Government's central control
 r the economy failed to stimulate agricultural production and
 resulVed in chronic shortages of most basic commodities,
 inefficient state-owned enterprises, high unemployment, and a
 weak national currency. Beginning in-late 1986, the
 Government launched a series of reforms to promote long-term
 economic growth by shifting from a state-run centralized
 economy to a free market system. While the reforms spurred
 private commercial activity and improved agnicultural
 production, In 1990 inflation remained high, and the
 purchasing power of urban residents continudd to erode.
 Human rights in Guinea-Bissau iemained circumscribed in 1990,
 with continuing concerns about police brutality, arbitrary
 arrests, lack of fair- trial, and restrictions on freedom of
 speech, press, assembly, and association, the right of
 citizens to change their government peacefully, and worker
 rights. However, the'Government announced plans for reforms,
 including the introduction-after a 2-year transition
 period-bf a presidential, multiparty-political system and a
 new constitution providing for basic human rights, including
 freedom of speech and press. The future course was widely
 publicized throughout the year and scheduled to be the subject
 of an extraordinary party congress in January 1991. Early in
 the year the Government released the 22 remaining prisoners
 convicted for participation in the 1985 coup attempt, and
 President Vieira stressed repeatedly that there were no
 political detainees or prisoners in Guinea-Bissau.
 RESPEtT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killing.
 
 
 162
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits cruel and inhuman punishment.
 However, security authorities employ harsh interrogation
 methods, especially severe beatings. Amnesty International
 (AI) continued to be concerned about allegations of police
 brutality during interrogations. There were no known
 investigations or punishment of officials responsible for such
 abuses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrests in Guinea-Bissau are frequently arbitrary, as arrest
 procedures are undefined, and the use of arrest warrants is
 the exception rather than the rule. The legal system,
 inherited from the Portuguese but modified by the 1984
 Constitution,.includes important procedural rights, such as
 the right to counsel and the right to a judicial determination
 of the legality of detention, but these are sometimes ignored
 in practice. In November, a presidential adviser/speech
 writer was arrested, interrogated, and then placed under house
 arrest for several weeks after being identified as the source
 of an article critical of President Vieira which appeared in a
 Portuguese newspaper. It is not known whether he was ever
 officially charged with an offense. Bail procedures are
 observed erratically.
 The Government has held persons without charge or trial,
 sometimes for extended periods of time, including in
 incommunicado detention. The Government has the legal right
 to exile prisoners but has not done so in recent years.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Traditional law still prevails in most rural areas, and many
 urban dwellers continue to bring judicial disputes to
 recognized traditional counselors. With some exceptions, the
 official judicial system is based on the Portuguese model.
 Intervals between arrest and trial are often lengthy. Defense
 lawyers traditionally have been court appointed. Private
 legal practice became legal and permissible only in 1990. The
 judiciary is part of the executive branch. Trials involving
 state security usually are not open to outside observers and
 are conducted by military tribunals. Armed forces members are
 tried by military courts for all offenses. The Supreme Court
 is the final court of appeal for both civilian and military
 cases, except those involving national security matters, in
 which the Council of State reviews all decisions.
 The Government publicized widely its January 1990 decision to
 grant amnesty to all 22 prisoners who had been incarcerated in
 connection with the 1985 coup attempt. Sixteen individuals
 were released from custody after serving less than half their
 terms of 12 to 15 years' imprisonment. Six other persons
 implicated in the abortive coup, who originally had been
 sentenced to death but later had their sentences commuted to
 15 years' imprisonment, were released to house arrest on
 islands in the Bijagos Archipelago, where living conditions
 are reportedly very harsh. In numerous speeches during 1990,
 President Vieira declared there were no more political
 
 
 163
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 detainees or prisoners in Guinea-Bissau. President Vieira
 also called for the justice system to become efficient, free
 of corruption, and capable of providing justice, but no
 specific steps had been taken by the end of the year.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Constitutional guarantees of the inviolability of-domicile,
 person, and correspondence are not always respected in cases
 of serious crimes or state security. International and
 domestic mail is subject to survei-llance and censorship.
 While membership in the PAIGC is not compulsory, most--though
 not all-government appointments have gone to party members.
 Section 2 Respect for-Civil Liberties, Includingr
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of intellectual,
 artistic-, and scientific expression, except when exercised in
 a manner "contrary to the promotion of social progress." In
 fact, these freedoms are severely restricted. The Government
 controls all information media and views the press as a
 vehicle of the Government. Journalists are government
 employees and practice self-censorship to maintain their
 positions. In 1990, however, as government leaders openly
 discussed democratization and political reform, there was an
 increase in candid discussion of the country's problems and
 government policies, including in the press to some extent.
 For example, in the one irregularly published newspaper, there
 were criticisms of the former Minister of Health and
 allegations of corruption within that ministry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association, but political meetings and associations are not
 yet tolerated. Despite discussions of reform, all existing
 organizations remained linked to the Government br the party,
 including the sole labor union, the National Union of Workers
 of Guinea-Bissau. Government approval is not required for
 peaceful, nonpolitical assemblies and demonstrations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is provided for in the Constitution and is
 respected in practice. Christians, Muslims, and animists
 worship freely, and proselytizing is permitted. However,
 religious groups must be licensed by the Government. In 1990
 there were no reports of groups being refused licenses.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are allowed to move freely throughout Guinea-Bissau.
 Foreign travel is not restricted, nor is citizenship revoked
 for political reasons. Thousands of persons have emigrated
 for economic reasons over the past three decades. While
 sympathetic to the principle of asylum, Guinea-Bissau does not
 host significant numbers of refugees. However, in 1990 at
 least 2,000 Senegalese, fleeing violence between the
 Senegalese military and Casamance separatists, sought refuge
 in northern Guinea-Bissau. The United Nations High
 
 
 164
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 Commissioner for Refugees sought to assist the Government in
 settling the Senegalese refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In 1990 citizens did not enjoy the right to change their
 government or the form of government peacefully and legally.
 Guinea-Bissau has been led by the PAIGC party and military
 elite, headed by President Joao Bernardo Vieira. By the terms
 of the 1984 Constitution, all political activity takes place
 within the party and state structure. Candidates for the 1989
 election for the National Popular Assembly at the district,
 regional, and national levels were approved by the party,
 although not all candidates were members of the PAIGC. Voting
 on the proposed electoral slates was cast by secret ballot.
 The President, members of the Council of State, and deputies
 of the National Popular Assembly were elected to 5-year
 terms. There are provisions for constitutional amendments and
 national referendums initiated by the National Popular
 Assembly, but the Assembly has never taken such initiatives,
 and it meets infrequently.
 The PAIGC party congress, held in the summer, focused (and the
 extraordinary party congress scheduled for January 1991 will
 focus) on potentially far-reaching decisions to begin a 2-year
 transition to a more representative system of government,
 beginning in early 1991. Over this 2-year period, the
 country's Constitution is to be revised and debated and
 legislation drawn up to establish a presidential, multiparty
 system of government by universal, direct, and secret ballot.
 If approved and fully implemented, the new constitution would
 provide for a number of protections, including freedom of
 speech and press. The PAIGC leadership also accepted the need
 to open up the political party, renewing it through additional
 membership and allowing greater "internal democracy" within
 the existing one-party structure.
 No single ethnic group dominates party and government
 positions, but Papel and Creole (mixed-race) groups,
 predominantly located in and around the capital of Bissau, are
 disproportionately represented in the Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights groups in Guinea-Bissau.
 Although international human rights groups have visited
 Guinea-Bissau, their visits have been tightly controlled. An
 AI mission held discussions in 1986 with President Vieira and
 other key officials and attended one session of a treason
 trial then taking place. However, the Government has not
 responded to AI's later request that an independent commission
 examine various human rights issues, including the issue of
 police brutality.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The population of Guinea-Bissau is composed of diverse tribal
 groups, each with its own language, customs, and social
 organization. The Balanta, Fula, Mandinka, Manjaco, and Papel
 are important groups, and there are several smaller minority
 ethnic groups. Creoles enjoy an advantageous position within
 
 
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 the society due to their generally higher level of education
 and their links abroad. Although the President and other
 influential leaders regularly urge the nation to overcome
 ethnic differences, the economic dominance of Creoles (and to
 a lesser extent Mandinkas and Fulas) has created resentment
 among other ethnic communities. Most of the defendants in the
 1986 coup trial were members of the Balanta, the largest
 ethnic group (30 percent).
 While officially prohibited, discrimination against women
 persists within certain ethnic groups, especially among the
 Muslim Fulas and Mandinkas of the north and east. The
 practice of female circumcisio is still widespread among-
 these groups despite official prohibition and educational
 campaigns against this custm. Women enjoy higher status in
 the societies of the Balanta, Papel, and Bijagos groups living
 mainly irr the southern coastal region, Women as a general
 rule do not have equal educational opportunitieLs_ with men-
 There are far fewer women in salaried employment than men-
 Perhaps in recognition of the discrimination suffered by
 women, the Government established a Ministry of Women's
 Welfare in 1990.
 Physical violence, including wife beating, is reportedly
 widespread and is used as a means of settling domestic-
 disputes among all ethnic groups. Police rarely intervene in-
 domestic disputes unless requested, and redress is not
 ordinarily sought in the regular courts. The Government has
 not undertaken specific-measures to raise the publ-ic
 consciousness of women or to reduce violenceagainst them,
 aside from forming the Union of Democratic Women, a women's
 organization sponsored by the PAICG.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 While the Constitution provided for freedom of association and
 while there is new thinking within the PAIGC on labor, the
 reality is that only one labor union, the National Union of
 Workers of Guinea-Bissau (UNTG), exists in Guinea-Bissau.
 With strong ties to the PAIGC, the UINTG more closely resembles
 a mass party organization than an independent union. The UNTG
 is neither aggressive nor effective in promoting workers
 rights. Public employees are permitted to join the UNTG
 While not specifically forbidden, strikes do not occur. Since
 the Government's use of force to disperse students attempting
 to strike in 1981, workers have been reluctant to go on strike
 for fear of forceful government reaction. In a major change,
 if implemented, the Government publicly committed itself in
 1990 to instituting the freedom of labor to organize unions
 with the right to strike. There was no progress on this issue
 by the end of the year.
 The UNTG is affiliated with the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions and is a member of the Organization
 of African Trade Union Unity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Of the estimated 28,000 salaried workers in the country,
 approximately 50 percent are employees of the Government.
 Guinea-Bissau's small manufacturing sector employs fewer than
 5,000 persons. The scarcity of salaried jobs has forced
 
 
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 workers (whether private or public) to focus on obtaining and
 keeping employment rather than on organizing and bargaining.
 The Constitution does not provide and protect the right to
 organize and bargain collectively. The General Labor Act of
 1986 does guarantee a-limited degree of collective bargaining
 and prohibits antiunion discrimination, but these provisions
 do not apply to the bulk of public workers. In practice,
 however, workers are not permitted to exercise these rights.
 The Committee of Experts (COE) of the International Labor
 Organization noted that the provisions in the labor law
 against antiunion discrimination do not appear to be
 accompanied by penal sanctions against employers, and that the
 General Labor.-Act is not applicable to workers in the public
 service. The COE also pointed out that public servants who
 are not engaged in the administration of the State should be
 able to enjoy the right of collective bargaining.
 There are no export processing zones in Guinea-Bissau, and
 labor laws are applicable throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is not permitted by law and is not
 known to exist. There are no penal. sanctions for offenders,
 however, and the Government lacks the means to provide
 adequate labor inspections.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The General Labor Act of 1986 established a minimum age of 14
 for general factory labor and of 18 for heavy or dangerous
 labor, including all labor in mines. These minimum age
 requirements are generally followed in the small wage sector,
 but there is minimum enforcement. In an overwhelmingly rural
 and agricultural society, the traditional division of labor
 practices both between sexes and age groups continues to
 prevail. Children in rural communities do domestic and field
 work for no pay. The Government does not attempt to
 discourage this practice and, in fact, delays the opening of
 schools until the rice harvesting season has ended.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Even in the small wage sector, labor laws are unevenly
 enforced due primarily to the extreme economic
 underdevelopment of the country and the vagaries of the legal
 system. However, there are government regulations governing
 such matters as job-related disabilities and vacation rights.
 The maximum number of hours permitted in a normal workweek is
 45 hours. Although not consistently enforced, a minimum wage
 of approximately $13 a month is mandated by the Ministry of
 Civil Service. The wage is inadequate to maintain even a
 minimum standard of living, and workers must supplement their
 income through reliance on the extended family and subsistence
 agriculture. Existing legal, health, and safety standards for
 workers are not enforced in a uniform or comprehensive manner.
