 CONGO
 During 1993 the Republic of Congo's young democracy was severely tried by sev-
 eral episodes of violent civil unrest. Throughout the year, President Pascal Lissouba,
 who was freely elected in 1992, governed with the support of a group of parties
 known as the Presidential Movement. The authority of his Government, however,
 faced challenges from a changing coalition of opposition parties. Strikes in March
 and tensions following first-round legislative elections in May gave way to armed
 conflict in June and Jul . Mediation efforts by the Organization of African Unity
 and the President of Gan succeeded in avoiding civil war in August, but combat
 in the capital, Brazzaville, again erupted in November between opposition support-
 ers and elements of the Government's security forces. Fighting continued sporadi-
 cally through the end of the year.
 The August agreement, known as the Libreville Accords, stipulated acceptance of
 the results of the first round of elections--with a panel of international arbiters to
 decide whether new elections should be called for a limited number of contested
 seats awarded in the first round-and scheduled a rerun of the second round of elec-
 tions. The opposition alliance, the Union for Democratic Renewal-Congolese Workers
 Party (URD-PCT) won 8 of the 11 seats contested in the second round of elections
 
 
 63
 held October 6. The seating of these opposition deputies in the new National Assem-
 bly in late October appeared to signal the success of the Accords, but was soon over-
 shadowed by renewed fighting between the army and opposition militias.
 The armed forces, which had played a critical role in earlier, successful steps to-
 ward the establishment of a democratic system, ultimately demonstrated loyalty to
 the chain of command and carried out the orders of President Lissouba. However,
 opposition parties continued to maintain independent militias, and the presi-
 dentially recruited Aubeville militia, along with the Presidential Guard, remained
 outside the regular military chain of command. In December the Government ac-
 knowledged the danger of this proliferation of irregular forces and pledged to inte-
 grate all groups into the official security forces. Individual soldiers, and members
 of the Presidential Guard and the partisan militias, were implicated in a full range
 of abuses. In November the army's strategy included firing heavy artillery rounds
 into residential neighborhoods, causing many civilian casualties.
 The economy is in transition from socialism to a free market system, and the 1992
 Constitution recognizes private property rights. In recent years, the economy has
 been heavily dependent on petroleum earnings and external borrowing. Faced with
 the collapse of world oil prices after 1985 and saddled with one of the world's largest
 per capita debts, Congo has been under pressure from international lending institu-
 tions to implement strict structural adjustment measures and free market economic
 policies. Despite political turmoil, Parliament began to implement necessary auster-
 ity measures in late 1993.
 Following the enormous strides achieved between 1990 and 1992, the human
 rights situation seriously deteriorated in 1993. While citizens now legally enjoy
 many civil and political liberties denied them in the recent past, 1993 saw the per-
 petration of widespread abuses. Militias loyal to faction leaders held hostages from
 rival groups and engaged in numerous instances of looting, burning, rape, and phys-
 ical assault. In the violence, at least 200 and perhaps many more persons died,
 many homes were destroyed, and tens of thousands of people had to flee their neigh-
 borhoods in which other ethnic gups dominated. The Government exercised tight
 control over the media and expelled a Radio France International correspondent for
 failing to stick to the Government's preferred message. Other human rights prob-
 lems persisted: reports of police brutality, deplorable prison conditions, societal dis-
 crimination against women, and the exploitation of Pygmy villagers in remote parts
 of the country.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The death toll from the June-July
 unrest was probably between 35 and 50. Military actions in November, centered
 against armed militias in the opposition stronghold of Bacongo, and the fighting in
 December produced even more casualties. Supporters of both the Government and
 the two main opposition parties were equally implicated in politically motivated vio-
 lence. Except for the Presidential Guard the armed forces and police in their insti-
 tutional capacity were not directly invoived in political killings, though individual
 soldiers and police officers, acting in support of the President, and some members
 of the President's irregular militia committed offenses while dressed in police and
 army uniforms. The Government ignored calls from international groups to inves-
 tigate human rights abuses and took no steps to identify supporters who partici-
 pated in extrajudicial killings in 1993. While the army assault in November was di-
 rected at opposition militias, many deaths occurred in incidents apart from that con-
 flict, and victims appeared to have been targeted on the basis of ethnic and political
 affiliation.
 b. Disappearance.-Each stage of civil unrest throughout the year produced nu-
 merous credible reports of kidnapings and disappearances, both political and for
 ransom. Many people fled to their home villages without notifying local friends or
 family, and thus may wrongly still be reported as missing. There were also numer-
 ous reports of varying credibility of bodies thrown into the river or buried in the
 neighborhoods of Brazzaville, making an accurate accounting for those missing at
 the end of the year virtually impossible.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits the use of torture, but there were unsubstantiated, but
 reliable and persistent, reports of torture employed by partisans of both the Govern-
 ment and the opposition during the crisis in June and July. These abuses included
 reports of rape and mutilation, e.g., allegations of the amputation of fingers and
 hands. Videotaped accounts of abuses inflicted by both officials and civilians and
 interviews with victims on both sides of the conflict lent credence to such claims.
 
 
 Military and security forces continue to employ unacceptable interrogation meth-
 ods. Army, police, and customs officials beat detainees, particularly accused thieves
 and those who resisted arrest, to extract information and as punishment. Military
 and security force leaders tacitly condoned such beatings, failing to try and punish
 offenders and failing to provide effective training in the lawful treatment of sus-
 pects.
 Prison conditions remained dire. Buildings are dilapidated, security lax, construc-
 tive activities such as classes or exercises are nonexistent, and food and medical
 care are inadequate. Most prisons, built during French colonial rule when convicted
 felons were sent out of the country, were never designed for long-term prisoners.
 Dozens of prisoners are often kept in the same cell for long periods of time sleeping
 on the floor and subsisting on only one meal per day. Malnutrition and disease in
 prison are generally untreated, and some deaths occur.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The new Constitution prohibits arbitrary
 arrest, detention or exile. While the Code of Penal Procedure requires that all de-
 tainees be brought before a judge within 3 days and be charged or released within
 3 months, these limits are often ignored in practice due to official indifference and
 limited resources. Delays in bringing cases to trial and arbitrary denial of bail con-
 tinued to be problems in 1993.
 During the July crisis, partisans on all sides engaged in arbitrary arrests and
 kidnapings, often solely to exchange hostages. The total number of these extralegal
 detentions was probably in the hundreds, but most were for very short periods. Par-
 tisans seized many people at roadblocks, at schools, and on the streets, including
 in late October two government officials from their homes. The officials were re-
 leased on November 1, but subsequent violence led to many new arbitrary arrests
 and detentions by official and unofficial forces.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Modeled on French institutions, the judicial s-
 tern consists primarily of local courts, courts of appeal, and the Supreme Court. The
 National Conference in 1991 abolished all specialcourts and secret trials. Defend.
 ants have the right to be represented by lawyers of their choice, and the State will
 cover legal fees in cases of destitution. There are credible reports of prisoners lan-
 guishing-sometimes for years-in jail because of lost files, oversights, and bureau-
 cratic inertia. The judiciary is overburdened with a caseload that far exceeds its ca-
 pacity to ensure fair public trial.
 In rural areas, traditional courts continued to handle many local disputes, espe-
 cially property cases and probate functions. Dispute resolution in these traditional
 courts is by extended debate, with no known instances of resort to physical punish-
 ment. Many domestic disputes are also adjudicated under traditional law or within
 the context of the extended family.
 During the state of emergency in June and July, the President suspended con-
 stitutional guarantees, but the Government promptly rescinded the declaration
 when order was restored. The violence in November did not produce a new state
 of emergency declaration.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution protects the privacy of the home, correspondence, and telecommuni-
 cations. Under current law, all official searches of private properties and commu-
 nications require a warrant. The transitional government announced publicly in
 1992 that the police have limited powers and encouraged citizens to insist on their
 rights. It also prohibited the maintenance of security files on citizens who had not
 been accused of violating the law. These measures remained in force. However,
 there was a widespread-if only anccdotally supported-belief that the Government
 continued to make use of the telephone-tapping equipment remaining from the days
 of East Germany's tutelage of the secret police. During November, without first at-
 tempting to undertake lawful search, the army responded to unconfirmed reports of
 weapon caches by bombarding some houses with tank cannon fire.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Like the bill of rights that preceded it, the 1992
 Constitution provides for freedom of expression and calls for the establishment of
 a special court to help safeguard freedoms of speech and press. That court has not
 been established, however, and, despite constitutional and judicial protections, the
 media enjoy only limited freedom.
 While people speak freely and opposition newspapers are permitted to circulate,
 censorship became pervasive in 1993. Prime Minster Yombi-Opango declared on
 June 24 that "only information emanating from state organs" would be broadcast
 by state radio and television and that news and declarations of political parties and
 associations would not be carried. Since the state media have a monopoly on local
 
 
 65
 radio and television-the main means of communicating with the public-opposition
 parties were effectively excluded from official broadcast and print media, having
 only indirect access to radio and television through broadcasts from neighboring
 Zaire.
 The Government announced but did not implement its statement that 11 parties
 would have equal access to radio and television during the October elections. Actual
 coverage of the opposition was nearly nonexistent, and accusations of censorship re-
 mained unanswered. The opposition's attempt to establish its own radio station was
 one of the precipitating events leading to the outbreak of hostilities in November.
 In a November 9 speech, President Lissouba committed to providing radio and tele-
 vision time to opposition parties. At year's end, however, no steps had been taken
 to implement the proposal.
 During November's disturbances, the Government objected to the reporting of a
 Radio France International journalist, Frederique Genot, the only resident foreign
 correspondent in Brazzaville. After she failed to change her reporting despite sev-
 eral reprimands, the Government took Gnot into custody for 2 days and then ex-
 pelled her from the country.
 Academic freedom is respeted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution also provides
 for freedom of assembly and association. In practie, any group wishing to hold a
 public assembly must inform the Minister of the Interior, who reserves the right to
 forbid assembh'es which threaten, in the Government's view, public peace or welfare.
 There were no reports of government denials of such requests in 1993. However, the
 Government placed strict limits on the time period during which campaigning was
 permitted beore elections, and some opposition gatherings were broken up by uni-
 formed and armed military shortly before the opening of the September-October leg-
 islative campaign.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion; people are free to join any
 church and practice any religion. Denominations not already established must reg-
 ister with the State, a sometimes cumbersome process. Many different creeds were
 represented in President Lissouba's administration.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution declares the right of all citizens to circulate freely
 within the country and specifically prohibits roadblocks and barricades. Barricades
 were nonetheless widespread during civil disturbances, erected by army troops,
 members of the Presidential Guard, and opposition supporters. The National Con-
 ference Charter of Rights gives all citizens the right to leave the country and to re-
 turn.
 The country maintained its traditional hospitality toward refugees and asylum
 seekers. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has registered over
 8,000 refugees from Cabinda, Angola, and almost 3,000 Cabindans live in a camp
 run by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent. The
 UNHCR also list over 2,200 Chadian refugees in 1993, as well as over 400 Zairians,
 and 300 Central Africans. A large number of other Zairians-mostly economic refu-
 gees-currently live in Congo.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right, but disagreement between the political groupings over
 the constitutional powers of the Presidency and the National Assembly led to near
 civil war in 1993. After disagreements with the National Assembly, the President
 dissolved Parliament in November 1992 and called for new elections in 1993. The
 opposition disputed his right to form an interim government, charged that the first
 round of legislative elections on May 2 were fraudulent, and refused to participate
 in the second round of elections on June 6, provoking the civil disturbances. During
 this period, the new 125-seat National Assembly opened on June 22-despite a boy-
 cott by the 49 URD-PCT members-and the President appointed the former army
 head, General Joachim Yhombi-Opango as the country's new Prime Minister.
 Subsequently, in the Libreville AccorAs, the parties, inter alia, recognized the pub-
 lished results of the first round of elections and stipulated that the second round
 of elections would be rerun. In the new second round of elections held October 6,
 the opposition won 8 of the 11 National Assembly seats at stake, thereby reducing
 the Presidential Movement's majority. A College of International Arbiters is consid-
 ering claims that results for 56 seats in the first-round elections were tainted. The
 disputed seats include 22 now held by Government supporters and 34 held by the
 opposition.
 Women are poorly represented in the political process. The Lissouba Government
 includes 2 women as part of its 28-member Cabinet. Women also represent only a
 
 
 66
 tiny minority in the security forces. While not officially prohibited, the indigenous
 Pygmies, living in remote regions, are largely excluded from the political process
 (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several local human rights organizations remained active in 1993. These included
 the National Committee on Human Rights, the Congolese Human Rights League,
 and a committee of the Congolese Association of Women Lawyers. Other special in-
 terest organizations included groups representing the rights of prisoners, women,
 children, and the handicapped. All freely criticized past government human rights
 violations as well as abusive and discriminatory aspects of some traditional local
 customs.
 In addition, the Government actively encouraged and even solicited the presence
 of international and nongovernmental (NGO) observers for elections held during the
 year. However, it refused to establish a committee to investigate past human rights
 violations, including torture and extrajudicial executions, as requested by inter-
 national groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The new Constitution specifically forbids such discrimination, but much tradi-
 tional discrimination persisted, particularly against women and Pygmies.
 Women.-Although the new Constitution prohibits discrimination based on gender
 and specifically endorses the right of women to earn equal pay for equal work, dis-
 crimination against women is endemic. Inequities persist in salaries as well as in
 employment opportunities and access to education. According to one 1991 U.N.
 study, females receive only 33 percent of the schooling provided to males. While tra-
 ditional inheritance customs favor maternal links, marriage and family laws overtly
 discriminate against women; for example, adultery is considered illegal for women
 but not for men, and polygyny is accepted. Women in rural areas are especially dis-
 advantaged in terms of education and wage employment and are confined largely
 to family farm labor and child-raising responsibilities.
 Nonetheless, educated women are increasingly finding pay equity and promotion
 opportunities more in consonant with their individual abilities, notably in white-col-
 lar and government jobs. Their qualifications are often enhanced by scholarships
 and foreign-sponsored studies. Women are also filling jobs once reserved only or
 males, such as magistrates and customs inspectors.
 Violence against women occurs frequently. In particular, wife beating is an accept-
 ed practice, and cases are usually handled within the context of the extended family.
 Only in extreme instances of abuse are cases prosecuted in the courts. The issue
 of violence against women is largely ignored by the general population, including
 the media. The police rarely intervene in domestic disputes.
 Children.-The Constitution states that the Government must protect children in
 accordance with international conventions. Child labor is illegal, and education is
 mandatory to age 16. In practice, limited state resources prevent achievement of
 these objectives, particularly in rural areas.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Pygmies, an ethnic minority numbering
 about 7,000 persons and living primarily in the northern forest areas, are theoreti-
 cally provided by the Constitution with the same rights as other citizens. However,
 in practice-in a society in which Bantu Congolese predominate in all respects--
 they do not enjoy equal treatment. In particular, they are exploited as a source of
 cheap labor. Pygmy workers are generally underpaid for their work relative to oth-
 ers, with compensation often being in the form of clothing, food, or other goods in-
 stead of wages. This practice is reinforced by an ancestral tradition of Pygmy slav-
 ery by Bantus, and in 1993 there were still reports that this practice continued in
 isolated locations. One human rights monitor reported "incontrovertible evidence"
 that Bantus in the north exploit Pygmies in slave-like conditions. In the past, Pyg-
 mies were denied access to public education, health, and other basic services and
 to the right to own property. Pygmies have traditionally also been excluded from
 the political process.
 People with Disabilities.-The Constitution provides the handicapped "specific
 measures of protection in relation to their needs." In practice, this means very little,
 though the Government has provided handpowered tricycles to some polio victims,
 and some special education is provided to the handicapped. The Government has an
 office charged with the welfare of handicapped persons, but its efforts in this area
 are limitedby severe resource constraints. A Congolese NGO works actively to bet-
 
 
 67
 ter conditions for the handicapped. There is no law mandating accessibility to build-
 ings.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Both the Constitution and the Labor Code affirm the
 right of workers to associate freely, allowing no restrictions on the formation of
 trade unions or on the right of workers to join a union. Nearly all workers are union
 members in the formal (wage) sector, and efforts have been made to unionize the
 informal sector. There is a small agricultural union.
 Unions are now free to join or form new federations or confederations. However,
 the Congolese Trade Union Confederation (CSC), formerly the only officially recog-
 nized union confederation, is still a powerful force and in 1993 remained the only
 umbrella labor organization. After the 1991 National Conference revoked CSC's mo-
 nopoly status and abolished the checkoff system, which gave CSC much of its power
 advantage, numerous small competing unions organized. The Secretary General of
 the CSCis also a member of the National Assembly.
 Unions are free to strike but must file a letter of intent to strike with the Min-
 istry of Labor beforehand, which starts a process of arbitration. In theory, a strike
 may not take place until after both parties have submitted to a process of
 nonbinding arbitration under the auspices of a regional labor inspector from the
 Labor Ministry. The letter of intent must also include notification of a strike date,
 at which time the strike can legally begin even if arbitration is not complete. Em-
 ployers theoretically may fire workers if no notification is given before a strike. In
 practice, these aspects of the Labor Code are seldom enforced, and many strikes
 have occurred without prior attempts to resolve disputes through arbitration.
 There were a number of strikes in 1993, including actions against oil companies,
 oil-related service fi-ms, and state-owned companies employing railway and elec-
 trical maintenance workers. The public sector was particularly hard hit by labor dis-
 p utes which erupted in strikes at the Ministries of Agriculture, Mines and Energy,
 ommerce, Culture, and Finance. Strikers most often sought increases in pay or
 other monetary benefits or, in the case of civil servants, back wages now overdue
 for 8 months. Public workers' strikes in March 1993 were resolved with relatively
 little civil disturbance, and unions remained relatively quiet as more serious unrest
 erupted later in the year.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international trade unions. Exercising this new
 freedom, some trade unions signed cooperative accords with other African, Euro-
 ean, and American trade union organizations. Although the CSC has not formally
 disaffiliated from the formerly Soviet-controlled WorldFederation of Trade Unions,
 the relationship has all but dissolved due to lack of interest or funding.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Still adapting to the new free-
 dom of trade union pluralism, the old Labor Code, dating from 1975, remains
 unreformed. Neither have laws been adopted to create a new legal framework for
 collective bargaining. In the past, many benefits were legally mandated and indus-
 try-specific wage scales or "conventions" were determined by negotiated agreement
 between representatives of the union, the employer or employers' association, the
 Ministry of Labor, and the ruling Congolese Workers Party. Independent unions
 may now negotiate freely on their own or in cooperation with other unions, federa-
 tions, or confederations.
 Under the Constitution, employers are forbidden from discriminating against em-
 ployees who exercise their constitutional right to organize or join a union. There
 have been no reported recent cases of firings for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and there is no evidence of its practice in the formal economy. (See
 Section 5, however, for a discussion of allegations of the slave-like exploitation of
 Pygmies.)
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits children under the age of 16 from working. The Ministry of Labor is respon-
 sible for enforcing child labor laws but concentrates its efforts on the formal wage
 sector. Children often work at younger ages on small family subsistence farms in
 rural areas and can be seen working in the informal economic sectors of the cities
 without government intervention.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets a minimum wage of
 about $80 a month (23,500 FCFA), a level which in theory allows for "human dig-
 nity." In those trades still subject to "conventions" (see Section 6.b.), the negotiated
 minimum wages are without exception considerably higher than the legal minimum.
 Yet, even these preferential salary scales often set minimum wages quite low rel-
 ative to the exorbitant cost of living. To make ends meet, many workers are obliged
 
 
 68
 to hold second jobs, practice subsistence agriculture, or receive help from the ex-
 tended family. During 1993, this was particularly true for government workers, who
 were forced to cope with salary backlogs of several months.
 The Constitution provides for not only reasonable pay, but also paid holidays
 periodic paid vacations, and legal limits on allowable hours of work. The standard
 legal workweek is 42 hours. There is no specific requirement for a 24-hour rest pe-
 riod. The Labor Code stipulates that overtime must be paid for all work in excess
 of 40 hours per week and that regular days of leisure must be granted by employers.
 Although health and safety regulations require twice-yearly visits by enforcement
 officers from the Ministry of Labor, in practice such inspections occur on a much
 less regular basis. There is no specific regulation granting workers the right to re-
 move themselves from hazardous situations, but unions are generally effective in
 protecting members.
