 MAURITIUS
 Mauritius is a parliamentary democracy governed by a Prime Minister, a Council
 of Ministers and a National Assembly. On March 12, Mauritius became a Republic
 within the 6ommonwealth of Nations, following a vote by the Parliament to amend
 the Constitution. Under the amended Constitution, a Mauritian-born President,
 nominated by the Prime Minister and confirmed by the Assembly, replaced the Brit-
 ish Monarch as Head of State. Like the Governor General under the previous sys-
 tem, the President'. powers are largely ceremonial. Fair and orderly elections, su-
 pervised by an independent commission, at national and local levels take place at
 relar intervals. There are four mmjor political parties and several smaller parties,
 reflecting arange of ideological views. Prime Minister Anerood Jugnauth's current
 coalition received a broad mandate in general elections in September 1991.
 A paramilitary Special Mobile Force of some 1,200 men and a 240-man Special
 Support Unit are responsible for internal security. These forces, under the command
 of the Commissioner of Police, are largely apolitical and well trained and are backed
 by a general duty police force numbering over 6,000. Mauritius' total military ex-
 penditures for 1989, the last year for which the U.S. Ana Control and Disar-
 mament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were $5 million. While there has
 been no public debate on defense spending reductions the Government has ordered
 a 10 perent across-the-board cut in the operatin bugt or all government agen-
 cies due to the severe fiscal constraints imposed by the economy. Due to their od-
 eat size, neither police nor military expenditures are an issue in the Mauritian polit-
 ical context.
 The economy is based on export-oriented manufacturing (mainly textiles), sugar,
 and tourism. The rapid economic growth of the mid-1980 a has slowed as a result
 of labor shortages. The Government, with the help  of international donors, is at-
 temptin$ to diversify the industrial base to favor high technology, capital-intensive
 production, and new sectors, such as financial services.
 Political and civil rights, including freedom of speech and press, are protected
 under the Constitution and respected in practice. The work of the Garoch Commit-
 tee, established by the Prime Minister in 1990 to conduct an independent review
 of several controversial laws, has led to significant reforms. These includeexpand-
 ing the freedom of assembly and abolishing the repressive Public Order Act, which
 permitted detention without charge or trial. In May the Garrioch Committee\sub-
 mitted to the Government its report on the Industrial Relations Act, which limits
 the right to strike. The Cabinet established a ministerial committee, headed by the
 Prime Minister, to study these recommendations. Discrimination and violence
 against women continued to be ongoing social problems.
 RESPET FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section a. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extmjudicial KiUing.-There were no reports of political or
 of severa     ncedTerl k i l  were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrding Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and inhuman punishment are prohibited by law and generally are not prac-
 ticed. However, there were increased press allegations, confirmed by attorneysan-
 dling civil rights cases, of police mistratment of suspects. The mistreatment ranges
 from excessive force during arrests to beatings of suspects in custody. Some victims
 have sued and been compensated for personal injury with financial rewards. While
 police officials are rarely prosecuted, in December the authorities formally charged
 an officer with assault'court proceedings were scheduled for early 1993.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest,  etention, or E Pe.-Under the Constitution, detained persons
 have the right to a judicial determination of the legality of their detention.  thouh
 the time limit for making this determination is not specified in law, in practice it
 is usually made within 24 hours. Bail is commonly granted. The Public Gathering
 Act, which replaced the Public Order At on the basis of recommendations from the
 Garrioch Committee, no longer allows for indefinite detention without charge or
 trial.
 Exile is legally prohibited and not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Mauritius' judicial system, modeled on that of
 Great Britain, consists of the Supreme Court, which has appellate powers,a an
 series of lower courts. Final appeal may be made to the Judicial Com te in the
 United Kingdom and is routinely made in the cases of death sentences. About 50
 percent of Supreme Court rulings referred to the Privy Council, the Judicial Com-
 mittee s precursor, were reversed. There are no political or military courts.

 The President, in consultation with the Prime Minister, nominates the Chief Jus-
 tice and, in consultation with the Chief Justice, nominates the senior puisne (associ-
 ate) judges. The President nominates other judges on the advice of the Judicial and
 Legal Service Commissions. The legal system has consistently provided fair, public
 trials for those charged with crimes. Defendants have the right to private or court-
 appointed counsel. The judiciary is also charged under the Constitution with ensur-
 ing that new laws are consistent with democratic practice.
 While a number of recent legal decisions have gone against the Government, legal
 specialists and opposition politicians have warned against undue influence by the
 executive over the judiciary.
 There were no political prisoners in Mauritius in 1992.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 sanctity of the home is guaranteed by law and generally respected in practice. The
 search of personal property or premises is allowed only under clearly specified condi-
 tions by court order or by police decision if an illegal act has been committed. There
 have been credible reports that the Government's intelligence apparatus occasion-
 ally opens mail and carries out surveillance of local opposition leaders and other
 major figures. In September, after a staff member of the Mauritius Broadcasting
 Corporation alleged that a letter addressed to him had been opened, the Supreme
 Court ruled that the Corporation, a government organization, cannot open the per-
 sonal mail of its employees.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press is protected by the
 Constitution and local tradition and is respected in practice. Debate in the National
 Assembly is lively and open. Over a dozen privately owned daily, weekly, and
 monthly newspapers present varying political viewpoints and freely express par-
 tisan views. However, newspapers are subject to the constraints of strict libel laws,
 which, under the 1984 Newspaper and Periodicals (Amendment) Act, inhibits the
 ability of the press to criticize the Government. In 1991 two journalists were
 charged with giving out false information concerning a sea captain accused of fish-
 ing in Mauritian waters. The charges against the journalists were dismissed in Feb-
 ruary, but in March an appeal was filed by the Director of Public Prosecutions,
 which was pending at the end of the year.
 The Government owns the two television and three radio stations which broadcast
 in 12 languages and dialects. Television and radio tend to reflect government edi-
 torial and programming policies, and opposition politicians frequently accuse the
 broadcasting corporation of political bias in its local news coverage. The political op-
 position successfully challenged the television stations to permit its candidates pro-
 gramming time on the eve of general elections in September 1991.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Mauritians enjoy the right to
 form associations, including political. parties, trade unions, and religious organiza-
 tions, although in practice all such organizations need government approval in order
 to operate officially. Mauritius has a multitude of such private organizations. Politi-
 cal, cultural, and religious assemblies are commonplace.
 Although police permission is required for holding demonstrations and mass meet-
 ings, such permission is rarely refused. The adoption of the Public Gathering Act
 in July 1991 further extended the right of assembly. Under the Act, political
 groupings have successfully challenged police denials of permits for public assem-
 blies.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Ther is no state religion in Mauritius. Hindus are a ma-
 jority, but Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, and others openly practice, teach, and
 proselytize without prejudice. All religious institutions receive state subsidies in pro-
 portion to their memberships. There is no state-sponsored discrimination against
 any ethnic or religious community. The Government facilitates the travel of
 Mauritians who make the hajj. Foreign missionaries are not allowed to enter the
 country without a prior request from a local religious organization.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 atriation.-There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the country.
 oreign travel and emigration are also unrestricted. However, there is no blanket
 guarantee of repatriation, and there are no general criteria for processing repatri-
 ation applications. Applications from Mauritians abroad who lost their citizenship
 after acquiring a second nationality (estimated to be several thousand) are handled
 on a case-by-case and sometimes arbitrary basis. This remains an issue of political
 debate as more Mauritians abroad seek to reclaim their Mauritian citizenship.
 
 
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right and ability to change their government through demo-
 cratic means. Mauritius is governed by a freely elected, unicameral National Assem-
 bly, with executive direction coming from the Council of Ministers, currently headed
 by Prime Minister Sir Anerood Jugnauth, whose Alliance coalitions won elections
 in 1983, 1987, and 1991. The President, in accordance with the advice of the Prime
 Minister, has the right to designate the person charged with forming a new govern-
 ment following parliamentary elections or in a parliamentary crisis. Parliamentary,
 municipal, and village council elections are held at regular intervals. All citizens 18
 years of age and over have the right to vote and run for office.
 In the National Assembly, up to 8 members are appointed through a complex
 "best loser" system designed in part to ensure that all ethnic groups are adequately
 represented. The governing (three-party) Alliance coalition now controls 59 of the
 66 seats. The four major political parties and the smaller parties often match the
 ethnicity or religion of their candidates to the composition of particular electoral
 constituencies.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups monitor developments without governmental restric-
 tion. There have been no known requests by international organizations to inves-
 tigate human rights violations in Mauritius.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Although Mauritius has a Hindu majority,"the country's active press and strongly
 egalitarian traditions mitigate against discrimination in all forms. However, ten-
 sions based on ethnicity and caste do exist.
 Traditionally, women in Mauritius have occupied a subordinate role in society, but
 the Government has tried to promote equality by eliminating various legal restric-
 tions, e.g., in laws dealing with emigration and inheritance and, in 1990, by remov-
 ing a legal bar to women serving on juries. Also, in 1989 the Government appointed
 "equal employment opportunity officers" in the major ministries to ensure the pro-
 motion of women's interests. Nonetheless, women still cannot transmit citizenship
 to their foreign-born children, and foreign husbands of Mauritian women cannot
 automatically obtain residency and work permits (as can foreign wives of Mauritian
 men). While societal pressures toward women pursuing professional careers are di-
 minishing, less than one-third of the students at the University of Mauritius in 1991
 were women, with even a smaller percentage in traditionally male-dominated dis-
 ciplines.
 According to the Ministry of Women's Rights and Family Welfare, physicians, at-
 torneys, and religious and charitable organizations, violence against women is prev-
 alent, although no reliable statistics have been gathered. There are no special provi-
 sions in Mauritian law concerning family violence. Police are generally reluctant to
 become involved in cases of.wife beating. In June 1989, the Ministry of Women's
 Rights and Family Welfare established a family counseling service, managed by the
 National Council of Women, one of whose principal tasks is to provide counseling
 and legal advice in cases of spousal abuse. Also, a Mauritian nongovernmental orga-
 nization, S.O.S. Women, provides assistance to abused women and works to sen-
 sitize the Mauritian population on issues concerning spouse abuse. In 1992 the
 founders of S.O.S. Women launched a separate organization, Rape and Incest Aid,
 to confront these related issues.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Mauritius has an active trade union movement. Al-
 most 300 unions represent about 110,000 workers, more than one-fourth of the work
 force. Of the 300 unions, 110 have less than 50 members. Workers are free to form
 and join unions and to organize in all sectors, including in the Export Processing
 Zone (EPZ) which employs about 90,000 workers. However, in practice there are a
 variety of constraints under the 1973 Industrial Relations Act (IRA), such as the
 need to obtain government approval to register new unions. Unions have also been
 deregistered in the EPZ in recent years. Less than 10 percent of EPZ workers are
 believed to be unionized. Unions can and do press wage demands, establish ties to
 domestic political parties and international organizations, and address political is-
 sues.
 In theory unions have the right to strike. However, in labor disputes the IRA re-
 quires a prestrike 21-day cooling-off period followed by binding arbitration, which
 h. th. effmt of makiing most strikes illegal. Participation in a strike not approved
 
 
 by a court is sufficient grounds for dismissal. Refusal to follow IRA procedures dur-
 ing a mid-1988 textile plant strike led to the imprisonment of three union leaders
 for several days and in 1990 to the firing of 14 strike leaders of the Central Elec-
 tricity Board Staff Association and the caning in of the Special Mobile Force to oper-
 ate the power stations. In July, 800 contract employees of the Public Development
 Works Corporation went on strike to protest emp oyment terms and conditions and
 lost their jobs as a result. The Government contended that the strike was illegal;
 at the end of 1992 the Government's action had not been challenged in the courts.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-While the right of association
 is guaranteed by law, the collective bargaining process has been distorted in Mauri-
 tius.
 The IRA addresses collective bargainin  and allows it in theory, but in practice
 its provisions for establishing wages bear ittle resemblance to the traditional collec-
 tive bargaining process, an the Government's restraints on that process render it
 ineffective.
 The Government has established a National Remuneration Board (NRB) whose
 chairman is appointed by the Minister of Labor. The NRB establishes minimum
 wages for 26 categories of private sector workers (sugar, tea, transport, etc.) which
 apply equally to workers in the EPZ. Although originally established to set mini-
 mum wages for nonunion workers, the NRB has broadened its powers and now is-
 sues remuneration orders that establish minimum wages bonuses, housing, and
 transportation allowances, and other benefits for almost all private sector workers.
 About 85 percent of all private sector workers (including unionized workers) are cov-
 ered by RB orders. Employers and unions are free to negotiate wages and benefits
 above the minimums established by the NRB, but this is rare.
 NUB remuneration orders set minimum wages by sector but also establish a wage
 structure based on length of service and job classification. NUB orders thus set
 wages for skilled and experienced workers whose earnings are well above the mini-
 mum .wage. Wages and benefits for civil servants are established by the Pay Res
 search Bureau (PRB) which prepares a wage scale for the civil service on the basis
 of the Chesworth Report recommendations. The Prime Minister promised publica-
 tion of the latest PR B report dun the electoral campaign in September 1991, but
 it remained unpublished in 1992. Acoalition of labor federations calling itself the
 PUB Front has demanded publication of the report and threatened slowdowns or
 strikes. Thus far, aside from p~ress conferences and public marches attracting small
 crowds, no action has been taken.
 The Government has also established a tripartite committee, including employer
 and trade union representatives, which meets once a year and is chaired by the
 Minister of Finance. It can recommend only wage increases based on inflation. Its
 recommendations are not always unanimous, however, and the Government makes
 the final decision based on all the information it receives. The highest increase rec-
 ommended and ado pted in 1992 was 5 percent.
 The International Labor Organization (L) noted again in 1991 that the IRA
 does not give workers' organizations sufficient protection against acts of interference
 as provided for by ILO Convention 98 on the right to organize and collective bar-
 gaining. The Garrioch Committee submitted its review of the IRA to the Govern-
 ment in May 1992. At the end of 1992, the Government had not published the re-
 port or amended the IRA, although in September the Prime Minister promised that
 the IRA would be amended based on the recommendations of the report.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Fored or ompulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and not practiced. However, under the IRA the Minister of Labour
 can refer industrial disputes to compulsory arbitration, enforceable by penalties in-
 volving compulsory labor provisions. The ILO continues to criticize this as being in
 conflict with ILOConvention 105 on forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum work age for em-
 ployment of children is 15. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing child
 aor laws. In practice, there is minimal enforcement of these laws. While there are
 cases of children under the iAe of 15 working illegally in the EPZ, the large, estab-
 lished EPZ factories do not hi~re children uncder 15. In fact, it is unusual to see em-
 ployees much younger than 18.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages are legislated, differing along
 employment sector and gender lines. Women are paid less in the agricultura sector
 on the assumption that their productivity is lower in this labor-intensive work. In
 the EPZ, the minimum wage is equal for men and women. Conditions of employ-
 ment, including wage and leave conditions, are generally sufficient to afford an ac-
 ceptable standard of living for workers in the agricultural, service, and manufactur-
 ingsectors. However, the current statutory rate paid for unskilled labor is barely
 su-ffcient to provide a worker with a minimum standard of living, and much de-
 
 
 175
 penda on the additional benefits offered. The Government mandates minimum wage
 increases each year based on inflation.
 The standard legal workweek is 45 hours, but excessive overtime continues to be
 a problem in the EPZ. Following complaints that EPZ employers imposed long hours
 of overtime on employees-about 10 to 20 hours per wee, making for a 55- to 65-
 hour workweek-the Government established a committee to address these issues,
 but by the end of 1992 it still had not issued a report. In addition, some EPZ em-
 ployers still require women to work at night.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, and working conditions are in-
 spected by Ministry of Labor officials. Enforcement is minimal and ineffective due
 to the small number of inspectors.
