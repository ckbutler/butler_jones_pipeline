 VANUATU
 Vanuatu, a South Pacific island natibnWith a population of
 170,000, became independent in 1980, after many years of joint
 British-French rule. It has a parliamentary system of
 government with a prime minister and a 46-member parliament.
 The President has largely ceremonial powers, except when he is
 acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Vanuatu's
 citizens are divided by a variety of languages, by its
 separation into more than 80 islands that make up the nation,
 and by the colonial experience. Over time Vanuatu has largely
 overcome these differences to forge a strong sense of
 nationhood. Political legitimacy is based on majority rule,
 supported by both Melanesian and Westerntradition. The
 civilian authorities control the small police and paramilitary
 mobile forces.
 Because the Vanuatu economy is dependent on international
 trade, it is vulnerable to shifts in world market prices. In
 the past, tourism earned more foreign exchange than all exports
 combined. The downward trends in tourism and foreign
 investment, started by cyclone Uma in early 1987 and
 exacerbated by civil strife in 1988 and subsequent political
 uncertainty, were completely reversed in 1991. Tourism and
 Vanuatu's offshore banking center report record earnings and
 continue to lead other sectors of the economy in growth.
 Restrictions on freedom of speech and press, freedom of
 assembly, and women's rights were the principal human rights
 problems in 1991. The-courts played an important role in
 resolving a major political crisis in 1991 (see Section 3).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Neither the Government nor any organized:group resorted to
 political or other extrajudicial killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Constitutional provisions against torture and cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment are observed in practice and enforced by
 the courts. While the law provides that prisoners'shall. have
 recourse to an Ombudsman, that position has not been filled
 since Vanuatu became-independent. Former Prime Minister Lini
 announced his intention to appoint an Ombudsman in August 1991,
 but by year's end none had been appointed.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were no reports of arbitrary arrests in Vanuatu. Arrest
 is by warrant. The constitutional provision that suspects must
 be informed of charges and given a speedy hearing before a
 judge is observed in practice. There is no exile.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The courts uphold constitutional provisions for a fair public
 trial, presumption of innocence until guilt is proven,
 prohibition against double jeopardy, the right of habeas
 corpus, and appeal to the Supreme Court. The courts are free
 of military or executive interference. Even during the
 constitutional turmoil of December 1988 and the subsequent
 trial of the members of the "interim government" (see Section
 3), the courts functioned freely, and their authority was
 upheld without question. The Government acquiesced without
 complaint in the appellate court's ultimate dismissal of
 charges against the four convicted members of the "interim
 government." There were no reports of arbitrary or unfair
 exercise of judicial authority in 1991. There are no political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is no arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home,
 or correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including'
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 press, there are significant restrictions in practice. The
 Government controls the country's national newspaper and
 manages the only national radio. There is no independent
 newspaper or radio. In the past the previous government denied
 its opponents access to the media.
 In 1991 both the state-owned national radio and newspaper
 defied government efforts to prevent them from reporting the
 views of then-Prime Minister Lini's political opponents. The
 Government responded to the refusal of the manager of Radio
 Vanuatu to accept government censorship by retiring him
 involuntarily. Government news censorship was sharply
 criticized by the Pacific Islands News Association and the New
 York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. In response to
 complaints of government censorship, the Vanuatu High Court
 issued an order in August against any government prohibition or
 restriction on the broadcasting and publication of statements
 relating to the Vanua'aku party leadership struggle.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Permits must be obtained to hold public demonstrations and
 rallies. Although permits are not generally refused,
 opposition leaders complain that government restrictions on the
 timing and venue of rallies are politically motivated.
 There are no restrictions on the formation of political parties
 or other groups. The politicians who had left or been ejected
 from the then-ruling Vanua'aku party have formed their own
 political parties and are free to compete in elections.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is protected by law and has been generally
 respected in practice. Missionaries of various Christian
 denominations work without restriction. However, prompted by
 former Prime Minister Lini's concerns that charismatic'and

 VANUATU
 evangelical groups undermine the traditional culture, the
 Constitutional Review Committee will consider restrictions on
 the activities of other than established religious groups. The
 Committee is expected to complete its recommendations and
 submit them to Parliament in early 1992.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Vanuatu citizens are free to travel internally and
 externally and to return from abroad without restrictions.
 However, the previous Government continued the practice of
 arbitrarily revoking the residency permits of foreigners who
 displeased high-level party or government leaders and their
 supporters. In 1991 a blow was struck against this practice
 when two foreign businessmen successfully challenged the
 revocation of their residency permits in court.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have the-right freely to-change the government through
 periodic multiparty elections. Numerous candidates competed in
 parliamentary elections in 1983, 1987, and 1991; both the
 campaigns and voting were considered by outside observers to
 have been fair. Elections to provincial and local councils-
 have also been freely contested and fair. However, measures
 under consideration by the Constitutional Committee, including
 extending the terms of the President and Prime Minister, could
 seriously undermine Vanuatu's democratic system.
 Beginning with a violent protest march by antigovernment
 demonstrators in May 1988, Vanuatu underwent a period of
 domestic political turmoil. Subsequent ejections and
 resignations of antigovernment members from Parliament led the
 President to attempt to sack the Vanua'aku Party Government,
 install a caretaker "interim government," and call for a new
 general election. After the Vanuatu Supreme Court declared the
 President's action illegal, the Government arrested the
 President and his five-man "interim government" on charges of
 sedition, incitement to mutiny, unlawful assembly, and
 conspiracy to overthrow the Government. They were tried in
 February 1989, and four of the six were convicted; however, all
 were freed in April 1989 by the Appeals Court for lack of
 sufficient evidence.
 From independence until December 16, when a new government was
 installed, the Vanua'aku Party had been the primary
 policymaking body, and its decisions were implemented by the
 Government. A major rift within the Vanua'aku Party erupted in
 April 1991 as a result of former Prime Minister Lini's
 increasingly autocratic behavior evidenced by the firing of
 most of his ministers when they declined to sign loyalty
 oaths. In August 1991, the Vanua'aku Party replaced Father
 Lini as its leader at an extraordinary session of the Party
 Congress, an act which he unsuccessfully challenged in court.
 Following Parliament's no-cofifidence vote in September, Father
 Lini was replaced by Donald Kalpokas who was elected by a
 coalition of 5 Tan Union Party and 20 Vanua'aku Party members
 of Vanuatu's 46-member Parliament. After elections on December
 2, Kalpokas was in turn replaced by a coalition of the Union of
 Moderate Parties and the National United Party, formed by Lini
 after his ouster by Kalpokas. The elections appeared to be
 free and fair.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although there are no restrictions on the formation of local
 nongovernmental human rights organizations, none has been
 founded to date. There were no requests for investigations by
 outside human rights organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Most of the population is comprised of Melanesians whose
 ancestors probably migrated from New Guinea. The small
 minorities of Chinese, Fijians, Vietnamese, Tongans, and
 Europeans, generally concentrated in the two towns and on a few
 plantations, experience discrimination with regard to land
 ownership. Although there have been allegations of corrupt
 practices by members of the Government, there is no evidence to
 suggest a pattern of ethnic discrimination in the provision of
 basic services. However, there are reports of discrimination
 in hiring and the provision of services against both persons
 and communities suspected or known to support opposition
 political candidates.
 While women have'equal rights under the law, they are only
 slowly emerging from a traditional culture characterized by
 male dominance, a general reluctance to educate women, and a
 widespread belief that women should devote themselves primarily
 to childrearing. There are no women leaders in Vanuatu's
 municipal or village councils, churches, or Chambers of
 Commerce. In 1991 there was one female Member of Parliament.
 Nevertheless, an increasing number of women are finding work in
 the unskilled, semiskilled, and service occupations. Members
 of the National Council of Women have expressed concern that
 the Constitutional Review Committee established in September
 1990 may recommend strengthening the legal authority of village
 chiefs, who are viewed as a primary obstacle to the attainment
 of social, political, and economic rights by women. Should the
 Parliament approve such a recommendation, it would be a major
 setback to new efforts to improve the status of women in
 Vanuatu.
 While no accurate data are available, violence against women,
 particularly wife beating, is reportedly common. Several
 severe cases have been reported in which victims have died.
 Although there are no specific laws against spouse beating, the
 courts have dealt severely with such cases, using common law
 assault as a basis for imposing punishment. However, very few
 cases of wife beating are brought to the attention of the
 authorities, and even fewer are actually prosecuted. Usually
 the cases are dropped by the women involved before going to
 court. The police are reluctant to intervene in what are
 considered purely domestic matters.
 The majority of women in Vanuatu enter into marriage through
 "bride price payment." On those islands where the custom of
 paying "bride price" is observed, there is often a feeling that
 the bride is the property of the husband and may be dealt with
 as he chooses. The National Council of Women is working to
 educate women about their rights and to urge establishment of
 legal protection for women against abuse and neglect.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Vanuatu's workers have the right to organize unions, choose
 their own representatives, and strike, but strikes have seldom
 occurred, due in part to high rates of unemployment. Unions
 may not affiliate with international labor federations without
 government permission. The fundamental legislation
 establishing the right to organize into unions, setting out the
 scope of union activity, and providing for the arbitration and
 conciliation of labor disputes consists of the Trade Union Act
 of 1983 and the Trade Disputes Act of 1983. There are some 20
 trade unions, grouped under an umbrella organization, the
 Vanuatfi Trade Union Congress, which is a member of the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The trade
 unions are independent of the Government.
 b. The.Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions in Vanuatu exercise the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. The high percentage of the population still
 engaged in subsistence agriculture and fishing, however, serves
 as a deterrent to extensive union activity. There are no
 export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and there have
 been no reports that either is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children under 12 years of age are not permitted to work
 outside of family owned agriculture, where many children assist
 their parents. Employment of children from 12 to 18 years of
 age is restricted by occupational category and conditions of
 labor--such as shipping and nighttime employment. In general,
 the high level of adult unemployment discourages the use of
 child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Vanuatu has a legislated minimum wage, which is effectively
 enforced by the Labor Department. There are also minimum wages
 for agricultural workers tied to the market prices for copra
 and cocoa. Most workers are not in the wage economy and are
 thus outside the scope of the minimum wage laws. For those
 covered by them, they provide an adequate standard of living
 within the local context. There are laws to regulate the
 rights to sick leave, annual vacations, and other conditions of.
 service. Vanuatu's Employment Act, enforced by the Labor
 Department, includes provisions for safety standards and a
 maximum workweek of 44 hours.
 The major occupational health hazard in Vanuatu is malaria.
 For those workers involved in coconut production, falling nuts
 are a not infrequent cause of injury and in some cases death.
