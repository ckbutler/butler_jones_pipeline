 ITALY
 Italy is a longstanding multiparty parliamentary democracy. Executive authority
 is vested in the Council of Ministers, headed by the President of the Council (the
 Prime Minister). The Head of State (the President of the Republic) nominates the
 Prime Minister after consulting with leaders of all political forces in Parliament.
 Parliament was elected in free and democratic elections in March 1994. The judici-
 ary is independent but continues to be subject to occasional political pressures.
 The armed forces are under the control of the Government and Parliament. There
 are four separate police forces under different ministerial or local authorities. Under
 exceptional circumstances, the Government may call on the army to provide secu-
 rity. The armed forces were assigned to patrol along the southern coastline of Puglia
 to counter illegal immigration. They also replace the police in general guard duties
 in regions with a high level of organized crime, such as those around Naples and
 in Sicily, thus freeing police resources for investigative and related activities. There
 were a number of credible reports that some members of the security forces commit-
 ted abuses.
 Italy has an advanced, industrialized market economy, and the standard of living
 is high. Small and midsized companies employ some 70 to 80 percent of the work
 force. Major products include machinery, textiles, apparel, transportation equip-
 ment, food, and agricultural products. The Government owns a substantial number
 of enterprises in finance, industry, transportation, and services, but privatization is
 moving forward at a measured pace.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. The law and
 the judiciary generally provide effective means of dealing with instances of individ-
 ual abuse. However, there were problems in some areas. There continued to be re-
 ports of police abuse of detainees, although abuse of inmates by prison guards de-
 clined. Prisons are overcrowded and the pace of justice remains slow. Discrimination
 against women, abuse of children and discrimination and sporadic violence against
 immigrants and other foreigners are problems. However, Parliament passed new
 legislation to regulate the often criticized practice of preventive detention. The Gov-
 ernment is taking steps to combat violence against women.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 Two Turin police officers were brought to trial on manslaughter charges in 1994
 for beating a suspect to death after his arrest in December 1993. In January a court
 acquitted troth officers, finding that the one officer's use of physical force had been
 within the limits of the the law. The suspect's family appealed in April.
 In March the commandant of a carabinieri barracks near Padua was sentenced
 to 2 months' imprisonment for "abuse of authority." The court ordered him to pay
 compensation of approximately $6,250 (10 million lire) for the September 1993
 death of an 11-year-old Romani detainee and the wounding of his 13-year-old cousin.
 The Padua judiciary also convicted a carabinieri officer involved in the same death
 of manslaughter. The court gave him a suspended sentence of 1 year and 5 months'
 imprisonment. He was also ordered to pay approximately $2,175 (3.5 million lire)
 in compensation to the child's family. In September a court-martial expelled him
 from the carabinieri and gave him a suspended sentence of 3-months' imprisonment.
 The case of an Iranian opposition leader killed in March 1993 remains unsolved.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and cruel or degrading punishment. However, there have
 been some reports of abuse by police. Amnesty International (AI), the U.N. Human
 Rights Commission (UNHRC), the U.N. Committee Against Torture, and the Coun-
 cil of Europe's European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (ECPT) reported
 instances in which police abused detainees at the moment of arrest or during the
 first 24 hours in custody, before detainees saw an attorney or a judicial authority.
 Examples of mistreatment included kicking, punching, prolonged beating with ba-
 tons, or deprivation of food. A high proportion of these cases involve non-European
 Union immigrants (mostly Africans), Romani people, and people held in connection
 with drug-related offenses. The U.N. Committee against Torture and the UNHRC
 expressed concern over a possible trend towards racism. Al, UNHRC, and the UN
 Committee Against Torture noted that although authorities routinely investigate
 complaints of mistreatment in detention, some of the investigations lack thorough-
 ness. The U.N. Committee and UNHEC also questioned whether appropriate sanc-
 tions were imposed on those found guilty. Italy has ratified all of the principal inter-
 national instruments prohibiting torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment or punishment, but the ECIT and the UNHRC recently recommended that the
 authorities take more effective steps to safeguard detainees and inmates from poor
 treatment. The ECPT visited prisons in October 1995, but its report is not yet avail-
 able. The ECPT first inspected prisons in March 1992. A report by AI in April cited
 several specific instances of mistreatment by law enforcement and prison officers,
 including the November 1993 beating by three carabinieri police officers of a Nige-
 rian detainee. According to AI, a court gave the three Carabinieri a suspended sen-
 tence of 12 months' imprisonment. The court also ordered that the sentences not be
 recorded in the standard information certificates which the central records office
 supplies to third parties.
 Inf September a public prosecutor in Rome initiated proceedings against a police
 officer accused of mistreating a 13-year-old in September 1993.
 The number of allegations of abuse of prisoners by guards is decreasing. In July
 a court acquitted the director of a jail who had been charged with placing in isola-
 tion a prisoner whom a doctor had recommended receive hospitalization. The de-
 tainee has appealed the decision.
 in December 1994, the Naples judiciary committed to trial 71 prison officials of
 the Secondigliano prison, including the chief warden, on charges of mistreating
 some 300 inmates in early 1993. A court hearing for 65 of the defendants, all of
 them prison guards, has been scheduled for early 1996. Hearings for the remaining
 six defendants are yet to be scheduled.
 Prison conditions meet international levels and would not, in theory, pose a seri-
 ous threat to life or health. However, the prison population exceeds the maximum
 capacity of the nation's prisons by some 50 percent: in some cass the number of
 inmates is two or three times greater than capacity. Overcrowding creates problems
 of poor sanitation and strains medical services. AIDs is a major problem, although
 the law allows judges to release prisoners whose detention would prevent access to
 appropriate treatment or would endanger the health of other inmates. According to
 data of the Association of Prison Doctors, more than 5 percent of the total prison
 population is HIV positive.
 
 
 904
 Inmates engaged in hunger strikes, seeking improvements in conditions. There
 were 36 suicides by prisoners as of September, compared with 51 in 1994.
 The Government permits independent monitoring of prison conditions by par-
 liamentarians, local human rights groups, the media, and other organizations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In August Parliament passed major new
 legislation on preventive or investigative detention. The new law was a clear re-
 sponse to growing political concern that the previous law had allowed excessive use
 of the practice. Public attention was focused on the issue by the "clean hands inves-
 tigations." (These were nationwide investigations into kickbacks and corruption,
 which began in February 1992, and which implicated politicians of many parties as
 well as officials of private and public companies.) Many claimed that investigators
 abused preventive detention to extract confessions or seek information to incrimi-
 nate others.
 The new law specifically adds that preventive detention can be imposed only as
 a last resort, or if there is clear and convincing evidence of a serious offense, such
 as crimes involving the mafia, or these related to drugs, arms, and subversion. In
 these cases, a maximum of 2 years of preliminary investigation is permitted. Except
 in extraordinary situations, preventive custody is not permitted for pregnant
 women, single parents of children under 3 years of age, persons over 70 years of
 age, or those who are seriously ill.
 Detainees are allowed prompt and regular access to lawyers of their choosing and
 to family members. If a detainee is indigent, the State provides a lawyer. The pre-
 liminary hearing judge's interrogation of an accused person must be conducted with-
 in 5 days, or the defendant must be released.. Interrogation by a magistrate of a per-
 son in custody must be recorded on video or audio tape, or the statements cannot
 be utilized in any proceedings. 'Te prosecutor is required to include in his request
 for preventive measures all evidence favorable to the accused. In addition, the de-
 fense may present any favorable evidence directly to the court.
 Preventive custody can be imposed only for crimes punishable by a maximum sen-
 tence of not less than 4 years.
 There is no provision for bail, but judges may grant provisional liberty to suspects
 awaiting trial. As a safeguard against unjustified detention, panels of judges ("lib-
 erty tribunals") review cases of persons awaiting trial and decide whether continued
 detention is warranted. Despite there measures, as of mid-1995, over 40 percent of
 inmates were in pri.on because they were awaiting either trial or the outcome of
 an appeal, rather than because they had been sentenced. The average waiting pe-
 riod for trials is about 18 months, but can exceed 24 months. Preventive detention
 thus sometimes runs longer than the penalty for the crime. The Constitution and
 law provide for restitution in cases of unjust detention.
 Punishment by exile abroad is not practiced, and the law prohibits domestic exile.
 e. Denial of Fair and Public Trial.-The judiciary is fbrmally autonomous, but the
 Constitution gives the Justice Minister the right to propose disciplinary action
 against magistrates. Heated friction between magistrates and the Justice Minister
 developed in several cases where this right was exercised.
 The law provides for trials to be fair and public, and the authorities observe these
 provisions. The law grants defendants the presumption of innocence. Trials are pub-
 lic, and defendants have =ccess to an attorney sufficiently in advance to prepare a
 defense. Defendants can confront witnesses. All government-held evidence is nor-
 mally made available to defendants and their attorneys. Defendants can appeal ver-
 dicts to the highest appellate court.
 Cumbersome procedures slow the pace of justice. A revised Code of Criminal Pro-
 cedure which took effect in 1989 sought to streamline the process, but it proved inef-
 fective. Parliament is working to amend it.
 There is a broad public perception that magistrates are sometimes swayed by
 their political or other interests. Since 1993, more than 290 magistrates have come
 under judicial investigation on charges of corruption, collusion, or mafia-related
 crimes. At least 15 were arrested and several others were committed to trial. The
 number of magistrates accused of involvement with the mafia is growing with the
 increasing number of ex-mafia members who are becoming state witnesses.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 safeguards the privacy of the home, and the authorities respect thisprovision.
 Searches and electronic monitoring may be carried out only under judicial warrant
 and in carefully defined circumstances. There have been no reports of any other
 kinds of violations of privacy.
 
 
 905
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and the
 press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press,
 an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to en-
 sure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government does not re-
 strict the right of peaceful assembly, including protests against government policies,
 except in cases where national security or public safety is at risk. Permits are not
 required for meetings, but organizers of public demonstrations must notify the po-
 lice in advance. Professional and employer associations organize and operate freely.
 While allowing general freedom of association, the Constitution and law prohibit
 clandestine associations, those that pursue political aims through force, that incite
 racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination, or that advocate fascism.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. The Government subsidizes the Roman
 Catholic Church, the Adventist Church, and the Assemblies of God by allowing tax-
 payers to elect to designate a fixed percentage of their tax payment to one or an-
 other of these. In November 1993, the Buddhist community applied for the same
 funding, but the Government has not yet responded.
 Roman Catholic religious instruction is offered in public schools as an optional
 subject. Those students who do not want to attend the "hour of religion" may take
 an alternative course. Some schools pllow free time as an option.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution and law provide for these rights, and the Government
 respects them in practice. Citizens who leave are guaranteed the right to return.
 The Constitution forbids deprivation of citizenship for political reasons.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Italy usually does not grant
 asylum or permanent refugee status. Applicants are granted temporary residence
 permits that must be renewed periodically and that carry no guarantee of future
 permanent status. The Government does not force applicants to return to countries
 in which they presumably would face persecution. There were no reports of forced
 expulsion of any one having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 All citizens over the age of 18 have the right to vote, by secret ballot, for the 630
 members of the Chamber of Deputies. Those over age 25 have the right to vote for
 315 of the 325 members of the Senate, which also has 10 nonelected members, such
 as former Presidents of the Republic. Elections must be held every 5 years, or soon-
 er if the President of the Republic so orders.
 Parliament and a few representatives of regional bodies jointly elect the President
 of the Republic for a 7-year term. The Constitution states that the President need
 not be a member of Parliament, but must be over age 50. The President nominates
 the Prime Minister, who is the head of the executive and who in turn selects the
 cabinet members.
 There are no restrictions in law on women's participation in government and poli-
 ties. Fewer women than men, however, are office holders. In 1995 a woman was
 Minister of Foreign Affairs but this was the only cabinet position occupied by a
 woman of the total of 22. Women hold 29 of 325 Senate seats, and 95 of 630 seats
 in the Chamber of Deputies, including its presidency.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without Government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex (except with regard to
 hazardous work-see below), religion, ethnic background, or political opinion, and
 provides some protection against discrimination based on disability, language, or so-
 cial status. However, societal discrimination persists to some degree.
 Women.-The law protects women from physical abuse, including from members
 of their family. Spousal rape is legally regarded the same as any other rape. De-
 tailed data on domestic violence are not available, but media reports are common.
 
 
 906
 The total number of cases filed with the courts was 866 for 1993, 869 for 1994, and
 194 for the first quarter of 1995.
 Law enforcement and court officials are not reluctant to bring perpetrators of vio-
 lence against women to justice, but victims often do not press charges due to fear,
 shame, or ignorance of the law. In addition, technicalities of the law can make con-
 viction uncertain. The Government provides a hot line through which abused women
 can obtain legal, medical, and other assistance. The Government advertises this
 service actively. Women's associations maintain several shelters for battered women.
 The media report cases of trafficking in women, often involving forced prostitu-
 tion. The women (as well as their exploiters) are usually illegal immigrants and are
 therefore reluctant to contact the police. Nevertheless, the police have been able to
 make arrests on several occasions.
 There are a number of government offices which work to ensure women's rights.
 The Equal Opportunity Commission is in the Office of the Prime Minister. Another
 such commission in the Labor Ministry focuses on discrimination and women's
 rights in the workplace. The Labor Ministry has a counselor who deals with these
 problems at the national level, and similar officials serve with regional and provin-
 cial governments. Many of these counselors, however, have linted resources for
 their work.
 Some laws intended to protect women from hazardous work keep them out of jobs
 (such as underground work in mines, quarries, or tunnels) that some feel they can
 do. Maternity leave, introduced to benefit women, does add to the cost of employing
 them, with the result that employers sometimes find it advantageous to hire men
 instead.
 Women generally receive lower salaries than men for comparable work. They are
 underrepresented in many fields, such as management or the professions (women,
 for example, account for only one fourth of magistrates). Women are laid off more
 frequently than men.
 While the law does not specifically prohibit sexual harassment, labor agreements
 covering broad sectors of the economy, in both the private and public sectors, do con-
 tain clauses which address the problem.
 Women enjoy legal equality with men in marriage, property, and inheritance
 Tere are many groups actively and effectively involved in promoting women's
 rights. Most are close to labor unions or political parties.
 Children.-The Government demonstrated a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through well-funded programs of public education and health
 care. During 1995 the Government took additional steps: (a) the creation of a Na-
 tional Observatory on Minors (collecting data and cases); (b) the establishment of
 a National Center for the Protection of the Child (located in Florence), and; (c) bet-
 ter coordination between the central government and the regions. By the end of
 1995, the first report on minors will be issued by the center in Florence.
 Societal abuse of children is a problem. The National Statistical Office estimated
 that 600,000 children below the age of 15 suffered abuse of some kind within the
 last 2 years. A toll-free number to help abused children under 14 years of age re-
 eived 127,000 calls in the period from November 1994 through May 1995. Social
 workers counsel abused children and are authorized to take action to protect them,
 including placing them in shelters.
 People With Disabilities.-A 1968 law requires almost all employers of 35 or more
 persons to staff 15 percent of their workforce with disabled persons, but as yet em-
 ployers have filled only about 4 percent of their positions with disabled persons.
 A 1971 law requires public buildings to be made accessible to the physically
 handicapped, but compliance in schools and other buildings is still not universal.
 A 1992 law sets forth the rights of disabled persons, provides for various kinds
 of assistance to them, imposes fines on employers who do not comply, and author-
 izes the Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labor to enforce this law. However,
 a seminar in February 1994 concluded that this law had not yet significantly bene-
 fitted the over 2 million permanently disabled people because the relevant institu-
 tions were still not equipped to implement it.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Immigrants and other foreigners face dis-
 crimination. Some were even subjected to physical attack. The Romani people en-
 counter difficulties finding places for their groups to stay. The city of Rome opened
 a camp for them in December 1994, and it now holds fifteen families. Eight new
 camps are planned, but the Romani population around Rome is between 5,000 and
 6,500.
 The Forum of Foreigners continues its work on behalf of immigrants and foreign
 residents. It has a hot line to report incidents of violence against foreigners. Other
 
 
 907
 nongovernmental organizations such as Caritas provide a broad range of assistance
 to immigrants throughout the country.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides for the right to establish trade
 unions, join unions, and carry out union activities in the workplace. Trade unions
 are free of government controls and no longer have formal ties with political parties.
 The right to strike is embodied in the Constitution and it is frequently exercised.
 A 1990 law restricts strikes affecting essential puflic services such as transport,
 sanitation, and health. Unions associate freely with international trade union orga-
 nizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively, and these rights are re-
 spected in practice. By custom (though not by law), national collective bargaining
 agreements apply to all workers regardless of union affiliation.
 The law pro&iits discrimination by employers against union members and orga-
 nizers. It requires employers who have more than 15 employees and who are found
 r ilty of antiunion discrimination to reinstate the workers affected. In firms with
 ess than 15 workers, an employer must state the grounds for firing a union em-
 ployee in writing. If a judge deems these grounds spurious, he can order the em-
 ployer to reinstate or compensate the worker.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and it does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law forbids employment of
 children under 15 years of age (with some limited exceptions), but child labor is still
 a problem, although a diminishing one. Illegal child labor occurs more frequently
 in commercial agriculture than in other sectors. There are also specific restrictions
 on employment in hazardous or unhealthful occupations of males under age 18, and
 females under age 21. Enforcement of minimum age laws is effective only outside
 the extensive 'underground7 economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages are not set by law but rather
 by collective bargaining agreements. These specify minimum standards to which in-
 dividual employment contracts must conform. When an employer and a union fail
 to reach agreement, courts may step in to determine fair wages on the basis of prac-
 tice in comparable activities or agreements.
 The law provides a maximum workweek of 48 hours, with no more than 6 days
 worked per week and 8 hours per day, except that the latter can be exceeded in
 some specified kinds of jobs. Most collective agreements provide for a 36- to 38-hour
 workweek. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours a day or an average of 12 hours per
 week.
 The law sets basic health and safety standards and guidelines for compensation
 for on-the-job injuries. European Union directives on health and safety have also
 been incorporated into domestic law; some have already taken effect, and others will
 enter into force in 1996. Labor inspectors are from local health units or from the
 Ministry of Labor. However, they are few, given the scope of their responsibilities.
 Courts impose fines and sometimes prison terms for violation of health and safety
 laws.
