 LIBYA
 The Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is a dictatorship that has been
 ruled by Colonel Mu ammar A1-Qadhafi (the "Brother Leader and Guide of the Revo-
 lution") since 1969, when he led a military coup to overthrow King Idris 1. 1 Borrow-
 ing from Islamic and pan-Arab ideas, Qadhafi created a political system that rejects
 democracy and political parties and purports to establish a "third way" superior to
 capitalism and Communism. Libya's governing principles are predominantly derived
 from Qadhafi's "Green Book." In theory Libya is ruled by the citizenry through a
 series of popular congresses, as laid out in the Constitutional Proclamation of 1969
 and the Declaration on the Establishment of the Authority of the People of 1977,
 but in practice Qadhafi and his inner circle control political power. Qadhafi is aided
 by extragovernmental organizations-Revolutionary Committees and a Comrades
 Organization-that exercise control over most aspects of citizens' lives. He uses
 extrajudicial killing and intimidation to control the opposition abroad and summary
 judicial proceedings to suppress it at home. The Government continues to repress
 banned Islamic groups and exercises tight control over ethnic and tribal minorities,
 such as Berbers and the Warfalla tribe. The judiciary is not independent of the Gov-
 ernment.
 Colonel Qadhafi publicly called for violence against opponents of his regime after
 violent clashes between Islamic activists and security forces in Benghazi in Septem-
 'The United States has no official presence in Libya. Information on the human rights situa-
 tion is therefore limited.

 ber 1995. Outbreaks of violence between government forces and Muslim militants
 have continued to plague eastern Libya since that time.
 Libya maintains an extensive security. apparatus consisting of several elite mili-
 tary units, including Qadhafi's personal -bodyguards, local Revolutionary Commit-
 tees, and People's Committees, as well as the "Purification" Committees, which were
 formed in 1996. The result is a multilayered, pervasive surveillance system that
 monitors and controls the activities of individuals. The various security forces con-
 tinued to commit numerous serious human rights abuses.
 The Government dominates the economy through complete control of the country's
 oil resources, which account for almost all export earnings and approximately 30
 percent of Libya's gross domestic product. Oil revenues constitute the principal
 source of foreign exchange. In March Qadhafi announced that 75% of the 1997/98
 fiscal year budget will be spent on investment and development, but much of the
 country's income has been lost to waste, corruption, attempts to develop weapons
 of mass destruction, and to acquire conventional weapons. Despite efforts to diver-
 sify the economy and encourage private sector participation, the economy continues
 to be constrained by a system of extensive controls and regulations covering prices,
 credit, trade, and foreign exchange. The Government's mismanagement of the econ-
 omy has caused high levels of inflation, increased import- prices, and hampered eco-
 nomic expansion, which has resulted in a decline in the standards of living for the
 majority of citizens in recent years. Unemployment is estimated to be 30% and is
 expected to increase.
 The Government's human rights record remains poor. Citizens do not have the
 right to change their government. Security. forces arbitrarily arrest, detain, and tor-
 ture prisoners during interrogations or for punishment. Prison conditions are poor,
 and many political detainees are held for years without charge.-The Government re-
 stricts the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, and religion. Citizens
 do not have the right to a fair public trial, to be represented by legal counsel, to
 be secure in their homes or persons, or to own private property. There -were reports
 of mass expulsions of foreign workers and residents to neighboring countries in
 1997, and the regime again contemplated the return of the approximately 30,000
 Palestinians currently residing in Libya. Traditional attitudes and practices con-
 tinue to discriminate against women, and female genital mutilation (FGM) is still
 practiced in remote areas of the country. The Government discriminates against and
 represses certain minorities and tribal groups. The Government restricts basic work-
 er rights.
 Libya continues to be subject to economic and diplomatic sanctions imposed by the
 U.N. Security Council in connection with the bombings of Pan Am flight 103 over
 Scotland in 1988 and the bombing of UTA flight 772 over Chad in 1989. Libya made
 no progress in complying with- the U.N. resolutions regarding the bombing of Pan
 Am 103. Libya mounted an aggressive international diplomatic campaign to have
 the U.N. sanctions lifted and violated U.N. sanctions prohibiting flights into or out
 of Libya four times during the year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Violent clashes between the security
 forces and militant Islamist opposition groups continued in 1997. The clashes were
 predominantly concentrated in the eastern region of Libya and resulted in an unde-
 termined number of deaths. In response to continued attacks against the regime and
 a prison mutiny that occurred in Benghazi in 1996, the Government maintained
 tightened security measures, made hundreds of arrests, and conducted military op-
 erations in the areas where insurrection occurred. Government forces killed a num-
 ber of people, but there were no definitive estimates of the total killed in these gov-
 ernment attacks.
 Qadhafi uses extrajudicial killings and intimidation to control the opposition
 abroad, and summary judicial proceedings to suppress domestic dissent. There have
 been reports of Libyan security forces hunting down and eliminating dissidents liv-
 ing abroad (see Section 1.b.).
 A large number of offenses, including political offenses and "economic crimes," are
 punishable by death. A 1972 law mandates the death penalty for any person associ-
 ated with a group opposed to the principles of the revolution, as well as for other
 acts such as treason, attempting to change the form of government by violence, and
 premeditated murder. The Green Book" of 1988 states that "the goal of the Libyan
 society is to abolish capital punishment", but Qadhafi has not acted to abolish the
 death penalty and its scope has increased. In July 1996, a new law went into effect
 that applies the death penalty to those who speculate in foreign currency, food,
 
 
 1524
 clothes, or housing during a state of war or blockade and for crimes related to drugs
 and alcohol.
 On January 2, two civilians and six army officers were executed, the civilians by
 hanging and the army officers by firing squad; while at least five others were given
 prison sentences, all convicted on chaes of being American spies, treason, cooper-
 ating with opposition organizations, and instigating violence to achieve political and
 soc  a as. The eight executed men were arrestedwith dozens of others in connec-
 tion with a coup attempt by army units composed of Warfalla tribe members in Oc-
 tber 1993. The men were convicted by the Supreme Military Court and they report-
 edly did not have lawyers for their trial. The convicted persons were allegedly kept
 in secret locations and tortured throughout their incarceration to obtain confessions
 of criminal activity.
 The U.N. Special Rnpprteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Executions
 noted that last year "the apparent lack of respect for fair trial standards in trials
 leading to the imposition of capital punishment in Libya.d
 Libya continues to be subject to economic and diplomatic sanctions imposed by the
 U.N. Security Council in connection with the bombings of Pan Am flight 103 over
 Scotland in 1988, which killed 259 people on bard and 11 people on the ground,
 and the bombing of UTA fight 772 over Chad in 1989, which killed 171 people.
 These U.N. Security Council resolutions require that Libya fulfill the following con-
 ditions: ensure the appearance in a U.S. or Scottish court of those charged in the
 Pae Am 103 case; cooperate with U.S., British, and French investigations into the
 Pan Am and UTA bombings; pay compensation; and renounce terrorism and support
 for terrorism.
 Libya again faled to make any progress in 1997 towards comlyin with the de-
 mands of the U.N. Security Council resolutions relating to the Pran Am 103 bomb-
 ing. The Qadhafi regime undertook aggressive international diplomatic initiatives to
 garner support from international organizations and individual countries for propos-
 als that would require the U.N. Security Council to negotiate Libyan compliance
 with the resolutions. As part of the Government's strategy of attacking the U.N. Se-
 curity Council resolutions, the regime violated the sanctions against air travel to
 and from the country four times during the year; Qadhafi was on two of these
 Sn 1996 the Government took limited steps to address the U.N. Security Council
 resolutions concerning the bombing of UTA flight 722. In March 1996, Qadhafi
 wrote a letter to French President Jacques Chirac pledging cooperation in resolving
 the UTA bombing short of extraditing the suspects or compromising Libya's sov-
 ereignty. France's chief antiterrorism  magistrate, Jean-Louis Brugiere, visited
 Libya in an effort to investigate the incident and concluded his investigation in May.
 Judg Brugiuere charged the second in command of the Libyan intelligence service,
 Aba allah Senousi (mrother-in-law of Qadhafi), with ordering the TA bombing and
 charged five other Libyan agents for their involvement. He identified the other sus-
 pects as Abdesslam Issa Shibari, Abdesslam Hamouda, Libyan diplomat Abduiash
 Elazragh, and intelligence operatives Thrahim Naeli and Musbah Arbas. Judge
 Brugiuere issued international arrest warrants for the six Libyans and indicated
 that the suspects would be tried in absentia. A trial is expected in early 1998.
 In spite of the Government's violent repression of resistance, opposition groups
 continue to surface and stage attacks on Qadhafi and his regime. or exame, on
 February 17 opposition grups attacked an elite military camp at Suq al-Khamis,
 killing several Libyan soldiers. Along with military strikes, opposition groups report-
 edly attempted to kill government officials as well. On July 29, an attempt was
 made on the life of a high-ranking security official in Benghazi. In January there
 were unconfirmed reports of an attack on Qadhafi himself.
 b. Disappearance.-The Libyan regime actively engages in the abduction and
 elimination of those persons whom Qadha fi calls "stray dogs," or political dissidents
 in exile. A number of Libyan oppositionists have disappeared inside and outside of
 the country's borders in recent years, and their whereabouts and welfare remain un-
 known.
 In 1993 Libyan dissident Mansour Kikhiya disappeared from Cairo. There is cred-
 ible information that following his abduction, Kikiya was executed in Libya in
 early 1994.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although Libya is apiarty to the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,
 Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Tuishment, security personnel reportedly
 torture prisoners during interrogations or for punishment. Government agents peri-
 odically detain and reportedly torture foreign workers, particularly those from sub-
 Saharan Africa. Torture reports are difficult to orroborate because many prisoners
 are held incommunicado.
 
 
 1525
 Methods of torture reportedly include: chaining to a wall for hours, clubbing, elec-
 tric shock, the application of corkscrews in the back, lemon juice in open wounds,
 breaking fingers and allowing the joints to heal without medical care, suffocation
 by plastic bags, deprivation of food and water, and beatings on the soles of the feet.
 The law calls for fines against any official using excessive force, but there are no
 known cases of prosecution for torture or abuse.
 There is insufficient information to make a determination on overallprison condi-
 tions, but a mutiny in July 1996 at the Abu Salim prison was caused by inmates
 protesting poor conditions. The prisoners went on a hunger strike and captured
 guards to protest the lack of medical care, overcrowding, and inadequate hygiene
 and diet prvided at the facility. Security units were dispatched to suppress the up-
 rising and hundreds of people were left dead after the week-long incident; as many
 as 100 of them killed by security forces.
 The Government does not permit prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Security forces arbitrarily arrest and de-
 tain citizens. By law the Government may hold detainees incommunicado for unlim-
 ited periods. It holds many political detainees incommunicado in unofficial detention
 centers controlled by members of the Revolutionary Committees. Hundreds of politi-
 cal detainees, many associated with banned Islamic groups, are reported to be held
 in prisons throughout Libya, but mainly in the Abu Salim prison in Tripoli. Many
 have been held for years without charge. Hundreds of other detainees may have
 been held for periods -too brief (3 to 4 months) to permit confirmation by outside ob-
 servers. It was reported that many political detainees were released early in the
 year, most of whom had been students and had been detained for the last 5 to 10
 years.
 Security forces maintained their intense campaign to arrest suspected members
 and sympathizers of banned Islamic groups and to monitor activities at mosques fol-
 lowing a continued series of violent clashes in eastern Libya (see Section L.a.). Some
 practicing Muslims have shaved their beards to avoid harassment from security
 services. Qadhafi has publicly denounced Libyan "mujaheddin" (generally, conserv-
 ative Islamic activists who fought with the Afghan resistance movement against So-
 viet forces) as threats to the regime.
 The 1994 Purge Law was established to fight financial corruption, black
 marketeering, drug trafficking, and atheism. Enforcement of the Purge Law by the
 "Purification" Committees began in June 1996 and continued through mid?-1997.
 Scores of businessmen, traders, and shop owners were arbitrarily arrested, with the
 closure of dozens of shops and firms on charges of corruption, dealing in foreign
 goods, and funding Islamic fundamentalist groups. As part of the campaign to im-
 plement the Purge Law, the wealth of the middle class and affluent was targeted
 as well. The Government marked the beginning of Raniadan in January by releas-
 ing an undetermined number of people arrested by the "Purification" -Committees
 in 1996, but the regime acknowledges that it still holds 29 of the detainees for fur-
 ther investigation (see Section 1.f.).
 On March 8, the Libyan General Peoele's Congress approved a collective punish-
 ment law for accomplices to crimes of obstructing the people's power, instigating
 and practicing tribal fanaticism, possessing, trading in or smuggling unlicensed
 weapons, and damaging public and private institutions and property." The new law
 provides that "any group, whether large or small," including towns, villages, local
 assemblies, tribes, or families, be punished in their entirety if they are accused by
 the General People's Congress or Committee of sympathizing, financing, aiding in
 any way, harboring, protecting, or refraining from identifying perpetrators of such
 crimes. Punishment under the collective punishment law ranges from the denial of
 access to utilities (water, electricity, telephone), fuels, food supplies, official docu-
 ments, and participation in local assemblies, to the termination of new economic
 projects and state subsidies.
 The Government does not impose exile as a form of punishment; to the contrary,
 Qadhafi seeks to pressure Libyans working or studying abroad to return home and
 the regime pursues dissidents in exile (see Section 1.b.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is not independent of the Govern-
 ment.
 There are four levels of courts: summary courts, which try petty offenses; the
 courts of first instance, which try more serious crimes; the courts of appeal; and the
 Supreme Court, which is the final appellate level.
 Special revolutionary courts were established in 1980 to try political offenses.
 Suchtrials are often held in secret or even in the absence of the accused. In other
 cases, the security forces have the power to pass sentences without trial, especially
 in cases involving political opposition. The U.N. Special Rapporteur has note a lack
 
 
 1526
 of fairness in trials of capital cases (see section L.a.). In the past, Qadhafi has in-
 cited local cadres to take extrajudicial action against suspected opponents.
 The private practice of law is illegal; all lawyers must be members of the Sec-
 retariat of Justice.
 According to Amnesty International (AI), approximately 22 persons were convicted
 and imprisoned for political offenses during 1995. AI estimates there are at least
 1,000 political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government does not respect the right to privacy. Security agencies often disregard
 the legal requirement to obtain warrants before entering a private home. They also
 routinely monitor telephone calls.
 The security agencies and the Revolutionary Committees oversee an extensive in-
 formant network. Libyan exiles report that mere family ties to suspected regime op-
 ponents may result in government harassment and detention. The Government may
 seize and destroy property belonging to "enemies of the people" or those who "co-
 operate" with foreign powers. In the past, citizens have reported that Qadhafi has
 warned members of the extended family of any regime opponent that they too risk
 the death penalty.
 The collective punishment law passed by the General People's Congress in March
 made into law Qadhafi's previous threats of punishment for families or communities
 that aid, abet, or do not inform the regime of criminals and oppositionists in their
 midst (see Section 1.d.).
 The Purge Law of 1994 provides for the confiscation of private assets above a
 nominal amount, describing wealth in excess of such an undetermined nominal
 amount as the fruits of exploitation or corruption. In May 1996, Qadhafi ordered
 the formation of hundreds of "Purge" or "Purification" Committees composed of
 young military officers and students. The Committees, backed by thousands of Revo-
 lutionary Committees, implemented the Purge Law through mid-1997. The "Purifi-
 cation" Committees reportedly seized some "excessive" amounts of private wealth
 from members of the middle and affluent classes; the confiscated property was
 taken from the rich to be given to the poor, in an effort to appease the populace
 and to strengthen Qadhafi's power and control over the country. The activities of
 the "Purification" Committees largely ended by May in reaction to increasingly vio-
 lent public reactions to their intrusive tactics.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The authorities tolerate some difference of opin-
 ion in People's Committee meetings and at the General People's Congress, but in
 general, severely limit freedom of speech. This is especially true with regard to criti-
 cism of Qadhaii or his regime. Infrequent criticism of political leaders and policies
 in the state-controlled media is interpreted as a government attempt to test public
 91nion, or weaken a government figure who may be a potential challenger to Qa-
 The regime restricts freedom of speech in several ways: by prohibiting all political
 activities not officially approved, by enacting laws so vague that many forms of
 speech or expression may be interpreted as illegal, and by operating a pervasive sys-
 tem of informants that creates an atmosphere of mistrust at all levels of society.
 The State owns and controls the media. There is a state-run daily newspaper, Al-
 Shams, with a circulation of 40,000. Local Revolutionary Committees publish sev-
 eral smaller newspapers. The official news agency, JANA, is the designated conduit
 for official views. The regime does not permit the publication of opinions contrary
 to government policy. Such foreign publications as Newsweek, Time, the Inter-
 national Herald Tribune, Express, and Jeune Afrique, are available, but authorities
 routinely censor them and may prohibit their entry onto the market.
 The Government restricts academic freedom. Professors and teachers who discuss
 politically sensitive topics face a risk of government reprisal.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Public assembly is permitted
 only with regime approval and in support of the regime's positions.
 Despite these restrictions, members of the Warfalla tribe staged several informal
 protests in 1995 to protest the regime's decision to carry out the death penalty
 against tribe members involved in the 1993 coup attempt. The Government re-
 sponded by arresting hundreds of tribe members, and expelling others from the mili-
 tary and security forces. On January 2, eight Warfalla tribe members arrested for
 involvement in the 1993 coup attempt were executed and at least five others were
 given prison sentences for allegedly being American spies (see Section L.a.).
 The last display of public discontent and resentment towards the Government oc-
 curred when a riot broke out over a penalty called at a soccer match in Tripoli on
 July 9, 1996. The rare instance of public unrest began when a contentious goal was
 
 
 1527
 
 scored by the team that Qadhafi's sons supported and the referee called the play
 in their favor. The spectators reportedly started chanting anti-Qadhafi slogans after
 the referee made the call and Qadhafi's sons and their bodyguards opened fire in
 the air, then on the crowd. The spectators panicked and stampeded out of the sta-
 dium and into the streets, where they stoned cars and chanted more anti-Qadhafi
 slogans.
 The Government officially admitted that 8 people died and 39 were injured as a
 result of the soccer riots, but there were reports of up to 50 deaths caused by the
 gunfire and the stampede of the crowd.
 The Government limits the right of association; it grants such a right only to in-
 stitutions affiliated with the regime. According to a 1972 law, political activity found
 by the authorities to be treasonous is punishable by death. An offense may include
 any activity that is "opposed to the principles of the Revolution"
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government restricts freedom of religion. Libya is
 overwhelmingly Muslim In an apparent effort to eliminate all alternative power
 bases, the regime has banned the once powerful Sanusiyya Islamic sect. In its place,
 Qadhafi established the Islamic Call Society (ICS), which is the outlet for state-ap-
 proved religion as well as a tool for exporting the Libyan revolution abroad. In 1992
 the Government announced that the ICS would be disbanded; however, its director
 still conducts activities, suggesting that the organization remains operational. Is-
 lamic groups at variance with the state-approved teaching of Islam are banned.
 Members of some minority religions are allowed to conduct services. Services in
 Christian churches are attended by the foreign community. A resident Catholic bish-
 op, aided by a small number of priests, operates two churches. In March the Vatican
 established diplomatic relations with Libya, stating that Libya had taken steps to
 protect freedom of religion. The Vatican hoped tobe able to more adequately ad-
 dress the needs of the estimated 50,000 Christians in the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government usually does not restrict the internal movement of
 Libyan citizens, but is known to impose blockades on those cities and regions (pri-
 marily in the east) where antigovernment attacks or movements originate. In 1996
 after the escape of some 400 prisoners-during which residents purportedly
 harbored escapees-the town of Dirnah was sealed of by government troops and also
 had its water and electricity cut off. The Government also requires citizens to obtain
 exit permits for travel abroad and limits their access to hard currency. A woman
 must have her husband's permission to travel abroad. Authorities routinely seize
 the passports of foreigners married to Libyan citizens upon their entry into the
 country.
 The right of return exists. In fact, the regime often calls on students, many of
 whom receive a government subsidy, and others working abroad to return to Libya
 on little or no notice. Students studying abroad are interrogated upon their return.
 Some citizens, including exiled opposition figures, refuse to return. There have
 been reports of Libyan security forces hunting down and eliminating dissidents liv-
 ing abroad (see Section L.a.).
 The Government arbitrarily expels noncitizens (see Section 6.e.). In September
 1995, the Government expelled approximately 1,000
 Palestinian residents to signal its displeasure with the signing of the Interim
 Agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Palestin-
 ians were forced to live in makeshift camps along the Egyptian border. The Govern-
 ment allowed the Palestinians living in the border camps to return to Libya, but
 over 200 Palestinians elected to remain, hoping to travel to the West Bank and
 Gaza or resettle in Egypt. The governments of Egypt and Israel refused to accept
 the Palestinian refugees in 1996, leaving them stranded in the deteriorating and
 squalid conditions of the once temporary border encampments. They were forcibly
 removed from their encampments to another location in country by Libyan police
 and military authorities in April.
 The Government expelled 132 Algerians in November.
 The Government is not a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relat-
 ing to the Status of Refugees or its 1967 Protocol, and therefore, does not grant asy-
 lum, first asylum, or refugee status to foreigners in Libya. The U.N. High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UN-CR) reported that by April 1996, there were over 3,000
 refugees of concern to the UNHCR in Libya, including some 2,000 Somalis, 750 Eri-
 treans, 325 Sudanese, and 300 Ethiopians. The Government officially contacted the
 UNHCR Liaison Officer in Tripoli in 1995 in an effort to facilitate the repatriation
 of Arab and African refugees to their country of origin. The UNHCR assisted in the
 repatriation of 168 Eritreans and 129 Ethiopians from Libya in the first 4 months
 of 1996.
 
 
 1528
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to-change their government. Major government de-
 cisions are controlled by Qa afi,. his close associates, and committees acting in his
 name. Political parties are banned. Qadhafi appoints military officers and official
 functionaries down to junior levels. Corruption and favoritism, partially based on
 tribal origin, are major problems, adversely affecting government efficiency.
 In theory, popular political participation is provided by the grassroots People's
 Committees, which send representatives annually to the national General People's
 Congress (GPC). In practice,, the GPC is .a rubber stamp -that approves all rec-
 - ommendations made by-Qadhafi.
 Qadhafi established the Revolutionary Committees in 1977. These bodies pri-
 marily consist of Libyan youths who guard against political deviation. Some Com-
 mittees have engaged in show trials of regime opponents; in other cases, they have
 been implicated in the killing of opponents abroad. The Committees approve all can-
 didates in elections for the GPO.
 There is no reliable information on the representation of women and minorities
 in the Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Qadhafi regime continues to prohibit the establishment of any independent
 human rights organizations. Instead, it created the Libyan Arab Human Rights
 Committee in 1989, the Committee has yet to publish any nown reports.
 - The regime does not respond substantively to appeals from Amnesty International
 -(AID on behalf of detainees. In 1994 the regime described AI as a tool of Western
 interests and dismissed its work as neocolonialist. AI representatives last visited
 Libya in 1988.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,.Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on these factors. However, the
 Government does not enforce these prohibitions, particularly discrimination against
 women and tribal minorities.
 Women.-Although little detailed information on the extent of violence against
 women, it remains a problem. In general the intervention of neighbors and extended
 family members tends to limit reports of domestic violence. Abuse within the family
 is rarely discussed publicly, due to the value attached to privacy in society.
 The Constitutional Proclamation of 1969 granted women total equality. Despite
 -this legal provision traditional attitudes and practices prevail and discrimination
 against women persists, which keeps them from attaining the family or civil rights
 guaranteed them. A woman must have her husband's permission to travel abroad
 (see Section 2.d.).
 Although their status is still not equal to that of men, most observers agree that,
 with the advent of oil wealth in the 1970's, the opportunity for women to make nota-
 ble social progress has increased. Oil wealth, uranization, development plans, edu-
 cation programs, and even the impetus behind Qadhafi's revolutionary government
 have all contributed to the creation of new employment opportunities for women. In
 recent years, a growing sense of individualism in some segments of society, espe-
 cially among the educated young, has been noted. For example, many educated
 young couples prefer to set up their own households, rather than move in with their
 fparents, and view polygamy with scorn. Since the 1970's the level of educational dif-
 ferences between men and women has narrowed.
 In general, the emancipation of women is a generational phenomenon: urban
 women under the age of 35 tend to have more" "modern" attitudes toward life and
 have discarded the traditional veil; at the same time, older urban women tend to
 be more reluctant to give up the veil or the traditional attitudes towards family and
 employment. Moreover, a significant proportion of rural women still do not attend
 school and tend to instill in their children such traditional beliefs as women's sub-
 servient role in society.
 Employment gains by women also tend to be inhibited by lingering traditional re-
 strictions that discourage women from playing an active role in the workplace, and
 by the resurgence of Islamic fundamentalist values. Some observers have noted that
 even educated women tend to lack self-confidence and social awareness and seek
 only a limited degree of occupational and social participation with men.
 The ambiguous position of women is illustrated by Qadhafi's own attitudes and
 utterances. His development plans have made an effort to include women in the
 
 
 1529
 modern work force, yet he has criticized women's emancipation in the West, includ-
 ingtheir employment gains.
 Children.-The Government has subsidized education (which is compulsory to age
 15) and medical care, improving the welfare of children in the past 25 years. How-
 ever, declining revenues and general economic mismanagement have led to cut-
 backs, particularly in medical services. Some tribes located in remote areas still
 practice female genital mutilation (FGM) on young girls, a procedure that is widely
 condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and psy-
 chological health.
 People With Disabilities.-No ififormation is available on the Government's efforts
 to assist people with disabilities.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Arabic-speaking Muslims of mixed Arab and
 Berber ancestry comprise 97 percent of the population. The principal non-Arab mi-
 norities are Berbers and blacks. There are frequent allegations of discrimination
 based on tribal status, particularly against Berbers in the interior and Tuaregs in
 the south. Qadhafi manipulates tribes to maintain his grip on power by rewarding
 some tribes with money and government positions and repressing and jailing mem-
 bers of various other tribes. Qadhafi also attempts to keep the tribes fractured by
 pitting one against another.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Independent trade unions and professional associa-
 tions are prohibited and workers do not have the right to form their own unions.
 The regime regards such structures as unacceptable "intermediaries between the
 revolution and the working forces." However, workers may join the National Trade
 Unions' Federation, which was created in 1972 and is administered by the People's
 Committee system. The Government prohibits foreign workers from joining this
 union.
 The law does not provide workers with the right to strike. There have been no
 reports of strikes for years. In a 1992 speech, Qadhafi affirmed that workers have
 the right to strike but added that strikes do not occur because the workers control
 their enterprises.
 The official trade union organization plays anactive role in the International Con-
 federation of Arab Trade Unions and the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity. It exploits international trade union contacts to engage in propaganda efforts
 on behalf of the regime. The Arab Maghreb Trade Union Federation suspended the
 membership of Libya's trade union organization in 1993. The suspension followed
 reports that Qadhafi had replaced all union leaders, in some cases with loyal fol-
 lowers without union experience.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining does not
 exist in any meaningful sense because the labor law requires that the Government
 must approve all agreements.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-In its 1995 report, the Inter-
 national Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts stated that "persons ex-
 pressing certain political views or views ideologically opposed to the established po-
 itical, social, or economic system may be punished with penalties of imprisonment
 * . . involving . . . an obligation to perform labor." The situation in 1997 remains
 largely the same. The 1995 ILO report also noted that public employees may be sen-
 tenced to compulsory labor "as a punishment for breaches of labor discipline or for
 participation in strikes even in services whose interruption would not endanger the
 life, personal safety, or health of the whole or part of the population." The Govern-
 ment informed the ILO in 1996 that legislation was enacted to abolish these provi-
 sions and submitted a report to the ILO, but the ILO has not yet commented on
 it.
 There have been credible reports that the Government has arbitrarily forced some
 foreign workers into involuntary military service or has coerced them into perform-
 ing subversive activities against their own countries. Libyans, despite the Penal
 Code which prohibits slavery, have been implicated in the purchase of Sudanese
 slaves, who are largely southern Sudanese women and children who were captured
 by Sudanese government troops in the war against the southern rebellion.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for employment of children is 18. Education is compulsory to age 15.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The labor force is approximately 1.2 million
 workers (including 161,000 foreign workers) in a population of 5.2 million. Wages,
 particularly in the public sector, are frequently in arrears. A public wage freeze im-
 posed in 1981 remains in effect and has seriously eroded real income. The average
 wage appears inadequate to provide a worker and family with a decent standard
 
 
 1530
 
 of living. The average wage is about $750 (270 Libyan dinars) per month at the offi-
 cial exchange rate, but is only worth $100 at the unofficial exchange rate.
 The legal maximum workweek is 48 hours. The Labor Law defines the rights and
 duties of workers, including matters of compensation, pension rights, minimum rest
 periods, and working hours. Labor inspectors are assigned to inspect places of work
 for compliance with occupational health and safety standards. Certain industries,
 such as the petroleum sector, try to maintain standards set by foreign companies.
 There is no information on whether a worker can remove himself from an unhealthy
 or unsafe work situation without risking continued employment.
 The Labor Law does not accord equality of treatment to foreign workers. Foreign
 workers may reside in Libya only for the duration of their work contracts, and may
 not send more than half of their earnings to their families in their home countries.
 They are subject to arbitrary pressures, such as changes in work rules and con-
 tracts, and have little option but to accept such changes or to depart the country.
 Foreign workers who are not under contract enjoy no protection.
 In May the U.N. Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, cited inad-
 equate housing, threats of imprisonment to those accused of disobeying disciplinary
 rules, and accusations of causing a variety of societal problems as some of the prob-
 lems in Libya's treatment of foreign laborers.
 The Government uses the threat of expulsion of foreign workers as leverage
 against countries whose foreign policies run counter to Libya's. The Government ex-
 pelled approximately 1,000 Palestinan residents in late 1995 to signal its displeas-
 ure with tbe agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization,
 and in May 1996, the regime threatened to expel thousands of Palestinian workers
 for political and economic reasons (see Section 2.d.).
 Over 130 Algerians were expelled in November (see Section 2.d.).
