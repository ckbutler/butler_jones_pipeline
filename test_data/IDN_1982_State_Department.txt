 INDONESIA
 Indonesia has a limited representative government dominated by
 the military. The world's fifth most populous nation, Indonesia
 contains a wide diversity of ethnic, social, linguistic, and
 religious groups. The Government stresses national unity
 through a secular political philosophy. The themes of public
 policy emphasize independence, economic development, public
 order, and nationalism. According to 1982 World Bank per capita
 income statistics, Indonesia has moved, albeit barely, into the
 category of middle income developing countries.
 Indonesia became an independent constitutional democracy in
 1945, but experienced periods of political disruption and autho-
 ritarianism during Sukarno's tenure as President. In 1965, an
 unsuccessful attempt by the Indonesian Communist Party to seize
 power resulted in significant and prolonged social disruption
 and violence. Memories of the events of that time significantly
 color official Indonesian attitudes toward acceptable limits of
 political dissent. Three of the four national elections since
 independence have been held by the current Government, including
 parliamentary elections on May 4, 1982. Indirect election of
 the President by the Supreme Consultative Assembly will take
 place in March 1983.
 Decision-making through a process of consultation and consensus
 is ingrained in the Indonesian political process. This non-
 confrontational, consensus-building approach is considered by
 most Indonesians to befit a pluralistic and economically-
 developing society. In Indonesia, group considerations come
 ahead of individual ones. Because of the unique features of
 their society and national experience, Indonesians tend to
 stress the rights of society as a whole over those of the
 individual. At the same time, there is a long tradition of
 personalized rule derived from the colonial and pre-colonial
 periods. Additionally, the fear of separatist revolts --
 whether ethnic, religious or rooted in geography -- has
 resulted in greater power for the central Government, which
 has been determined to maintain and promote national unity and
 integration.
 During 1982, several positive human rights developments took
 place. Concerned local groups and, occasionally, the media
 continued to focus public attention throughout Indonesia on
 the preservation and improvement of civil and human rights.
 Several leading Indonesian human rights figures joined in the
 establishment in Manila of an Asian Human Rights Council, and
 ties with international human rights organizations were
 broadened and deepened. The new Criminal Procedures Code,
 promulgated on the last day of 1981, was implemented during
 1982, and, although there have been initial problems, the legal
 profession regards the new code as potentially an important
 advance in the protection of the rights of the accused.
 Parliamentary elections in May drew wide participation.
 Despite some concerns expressed about special advantages
 enjoyed by the government-backed political yrouping and rumors
 of manipulation of ballot tabulations, the elections appear to
 reflect public sentiment.
 During and immediately after the election campaign, the govern-
 ment temporarily suspended the licenses of two publications as
 a result of their reporting on election events. One was closed
 eight weeks and the other four months. In September, Parliament
 passed a new press law which government officials claim will
 make suspension of press licenses rare, as well as rationalize
 the current system of press self-censorship.

 East Timor continues to be the focus of human rights attention.
 Particular interest centered on the question of the approxi-
 mately 3,700 detainees on the island of Atauro and the
 conditions of their detention. During 1982 there were some
 positive developments in this regard. In February, the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) began visits to
 prisons in Dili and elsewhere in Timor and to the Atauro Island
 detention facility. These visits facilitated some family
 reunifications and the location of some persons previously
 thought to be missing. Also in 1982, the Indonesian Government
 authorized a number of visits to East Timor by foreign
 journalists, scholars, and diplomats, many of whom visited
 Atauro Island and areas previously alleged to be experiencing
 serious food shortages. The Indonesian Government continued
 its intensive development efforts during the year; East Timor
 is the largest per capita recipient of domestic development
 funds among Indonesia's 27 provinces.
 The Indonesian Government continues to provide one of the
 region's two processing centers for Indochinese refugees and
 accepts first asylum refugees pending their resettlement in
 third countries.
 For the longer term, there is a trend toward greater codifi-
 cation and clarification of the rights and obligations of
 individuals and those of the state. The passage and implemen-
 tation of the Criminal Procedures Code is but the most obvious
 example of this trend. There is an apparent trend toward less
 direct involvement in the election process by the Indonesian
 military, although the basic defense law enacted in 1982 for
 the first time made a matter of law the dual role of the
 military both as a defense and security force and as an active
 participant in the national socio-political process. Restric-
 tions on political expression remain, and there is continuing
 concern among human rights groups over government powers of
 detention without trial.
 I. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Killing
 Killing for political motives either by government or political
 organizations has not been a feature of Indonesian political
 life since the serious disruptions of 1965/66. Although between
 10-20 persons were reportedly killed in acts of campaign
 violence before the May 4, 1982 elections, there is no reason
 to suspect that any of these killings represented an organized
 conspiracy by either the Government or political groups.
 In the last week of the campaign, government security forces
 were given "shoot to kill' orders to prevent disruption of the
 campaign or voting. Several demonstrators were killed when
 troops attempted to disperse them on the last Sunday of the
 campaign, but election day passed without reports of violence
 from any of Indonesia's 27 provinces.
 b.   Disappearance
 Since incorporation of the territory of Portuguese Timor into
 Indonesia in 1976, concern has been expressed by international
 human rights organizations about disappearances and mistreat-
 ment of East Timorese. Amnesty International, in particular,
 has emphasized several specific cases. During a trip to East
 Timor in February 1982, representatives of the ICRC were able
 to visit the Dili prison and Atauro Island where supporters of
 the dissident Fretilin organization are detained. As a result
 of this visit and earlier work in East Timor, the ICRC, in
 conjunction with the Indonesian Red Cross, has succeeded in
 establishing the whereabouts of many missing persons and
 reuniting some separated family members.
 
 
 709
 It is noteworthy that the number of allegations of physical
 mistreatment and disappearance has declined since the period
 of fiercest fighting between Indonesian and Fretilin forces
 (1976-79).
 During 1982, there were no new allegations of disappearance of
 members of alleged extremist Muslim groups classified by the
 Government as subversive. Over the course of the year, in a
 series of widely reported trials, suspected Islamic extremists,
 some of whom had been reported missing, were tried and convicted
 on criminal charges arising out of anti-government activity,
 including terrorism, and charges of seeking to topple the
 Government and constitutional order.
 c.   Torture
 Indonesia's legal codes make no specific reference to torture
 or cruel punishment. Some former detainees have alleged beatings
 and other abuse of accused criminals and of some political
 dissidents, particularly alleged Indonesian Communist Party
 members and extremist Muslims.
 In late 1982, the press reported two instances in which police
 may have tortured persons in their custody. Details about the
 first case, in the city of Ambon, are sketchy. The second case,
 which took place in Jakarta, involved the possible torture/
 beating of a 19-year old high school.student who later died.
 The press was instrumental in bringing the second case to light
 and reported that the four police officers allegedly involved
 would be tried to determine whether they were responsible for
 the student's death. Commenting on the case, Indonesia's chief
 security official denied police had tortured the student and
 reiterated the official policy that torture by authorities is
 *intolerable.'
 Other than these two cases, there were apparently no allegations
 of torture. Widespread publicity given to charges of torture,
 as in these and earlier cases, and news of disciplinary action
 by the police against offenders, as occurred in 1981, may have
 had a salutary effect in inhibiting potential police abuses.
 In addition, human rights groups have indicated they believe
 there is a continuing trend toward better treatment of
 prisoners. Nevertheless, lapses in treatment of prisoners
 obviously do occur, and there are variations in attitudes by
 locality, particularly in remote provinces.
 Visitors to East Timor during 1982 have found no current
 evidence to suggest abuse of persons detained or imprisoned
 there.
 d.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Overcrowded prisons, minimal food rations, and occasional
 mixing of political detainees with ordinary criminals have
 given rise to charges of. abuse of prisoners. Student detainees
 generally have enjoyed special facilities, as do certain other
 classes of political prisoners. separate detention facilities
 are maintained for women.
 Allegations of inhumane treatment of prisoners in Atauro
 detention center in East Timor have not been substantiated by
 visitors there. There is, however, concern about the adequacy
 of health care and the monotony of diet for detainees.
 There were no reported incidents of summary execution in 1982.
 In December 1981, President Soeharto commuted to life imprison-
 ment (with the possibility of parole) the death sentences of
 the two most prominent individuals convicted of involvement in
 the abortive communist coup attempt of 1965. At least twenty
 persons, sentenced to death for their involvement in the coup
 attempt, remain in prison with their sentences held in abeyance.
 
 
 '710
 
 During 1982, several extremist Muslims associated with the
 hijacking of an Indonesian airliner from Sumatra to Bangkok
 in 1981 and a bloody attack on a Bandung police station were
 tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. All have appealed.
 Meanwhile, in early 1982, President Soeharto rejected an appeal
 for clemency from a convicted Muslim extremist in Medan,
 Sumatra, but the prisoner has not yet been executed.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The rights of habeas corpus, bail bonding, and legal counsel
 are included in the new Criminal Procedures Code promulgated in
 December 1981, but they do not apply in cases involving alleged
 subversion or corruption. In security and subversion cases,
 the period of detention has no legal limit.
 Experience with the new Criminal Procedures Code since its
 promulgation on December 31, 1981 has been mixed. During the
 first half of 1982, lawyers complained that police, prosecutors,
 and judges had not yet familiarized themselves with the code.
 In one prominent slander case brought against a former chairman
 of the Lawyers' Association, the accused, though charged under
 the new Criminal Procedures Code, was nonetheless denied access
 to counsel during interrogation and his family was not allowed
 to know his whereabouts or visit him, both actions being
 apparent violations of the code. Despite mixed experiences
 with the new code, most lawyers are pleased to have updated
 criminal law procedures. Law enforcement and judicial officials
 publicly have aired views that some sections of the code may
 require revision, but there are as yet no proposals in this
 respect before Parliament.
 The Indonesian Government has in the past detained oppositionist
 students and their advisors, other political activists, and
 persons accused of corruption. A few have been brought to
 trial, and most have been released after questioning. During
 the past few years, detentions have fallen into two groups:
 students and opposition leaders arrested during the protests
 surrounding the electoral process in 1977-78 and suspected
 Muslim extremists believed to have instigated or participated
 in illegal anti-Government activites, ensuing acts of violence
 or criminal acts such as robbery and murder. Alleged Muslim
 extremists are often detained under subversion statutes for
 periods ranging from several days to (in rare cases) several
 years. The number of such detainees tends to increase in
 politically sensitive periods, such as the 1982 election
 campaign. In late 1982, Indonesian human rights observers
 estimated the number of detained Muslim extremists to be
 between 400 and 500.
 All political prisoners detained in connection with the failed
 1965 coup, with the exception of several hundred persons tried
 and convicted of specific criminal offenses, were released by
 December 1979. While questions about conditions of the released
 political prisoners are not a matter of considerable public
 interest or concern in Indonesia, their status and efforts to
 reintegrate them into society are sometimes raised by foreign
 and domestic humanitarian organizations. Objection has been
 made to the fact that the identification cards of ex-prisoners,
 while similar to those required of all Indonesians, carry
 special identifiable markings and that, reportedly, in some
 parts of the country former prisoners are periodically required
 to report their movements. Of more concern are limitations on
 employment opportunities for former prisoners. By government
 edict they may not join the civil service, the armed forces,
 or be employed by 'essential industries.' In August 1982,
 Indonesia's chief security official told a gathering of
 government officials charged with supervision of released
 detainees that the former prisoners were free once again to
 work at their old professions (such as journalists, doctors,
 
 
 lawyers), but that employers were obliged to report to proper
 authorities their hiring of ex-detainees.
 There is still no central authority concerned with collecting
 information on the welfare of ex-prisoners. Reports on them
 are, therefore, impressionistic, based on limited or skewed
 samples, but there is a perception that the percentage of
 former prisoners unemployed is higher than for the bulk of the
 population, and that other social opportunities open to them
 remain more limited. There are unconfirmed reports that
 discrimination has extended to their families, who have also
 been denied educational and employment opportunities.
 Allegations of arbitrary arrest in East Timor fall into two
 categories: persons arrested and detained in prisons on the
 main island of Timor and persons detained on the island of
 Atauro, located off the north coast of Timor. An ICRC team
 visited East Timor in February to begin a program of prison
 visitation both at prisons on the mainland and at the Atauro
 island detention center.
 In mid-November, the number of detainees on Atauro was believed
 to be about 3,700. The Indonesian authorities state that they
 intend to resettle these detainees in new villages on the
 mainland, as the agricultural base on Atauro cannot support
 the detainee population. Several hundred Atauro detainees have
 already been resettled at Cailaco, in southwestern East Timor.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Law 14 of 1970 states: 'Court investigation sessions are open
 to the public unless regulated separately by the law." This
 applies only to courts of first instance, not to appeals
 courts, where hearings are conducted primarily on the basis of
 legal briefs, with no personal appearances. It has been left
 to the discretion of judges to decide when court sessions
 should be closed in the reported interest of national security,
 public order, or propriety. In practice most trials are open.
 There have been occasional complaints, however, that in the
 past, particularly in some security and political cases, public
 attendance was discouraged by the requirement that those
 wishing to attend register and sign their names.
 Indonesian law provides for the creation of military "extra-
 ordinary courts" by the President to try civilians in unusual
 cases. In fact, military courts have only been established
 twice to try civilians: the first time to try separatists
 involved in regional rebellions of the late 1950's, and the
 second time to try persons implicated in the September 30, 1965
 unsuccessful coup attempt. A 1950 law gives the Ministers of
 Defense/Security and Justice power to extend the jurisdiction
 of military courts over civilians in undefined cases, but as
 far as is known, this provision has never been employed.
 In recent years, most suspects and detainees have been provided
 with legal counsel. Under the new Criminal Procedures Code,
 accused persons may be advised by counsel during initial inter-
 rogation, and they have the right to counsel in cases where
 they face a "heavy" sentence, i.e., five or more years'
 imprisonment or a fine in excess of 100,000 rupiah ($140).
 In practice, police and prosecutors are interpreting the law to
 "permit" an accused to have legal counsel during interrogation
 rather than acknowledging a "right" to counsel. On the other
 hand, human rights observers in Indonesia say counsel is being
 provided during trials, as stipulated in the new code. Funds
 have been budgeted for the payment of lawyers' fees, and the
 new system is operating well, particularly in larger cities,
 while in remote areas this provision of the new code is being
 implemented more slowly, in part due to a lack of trial lawyers.

 712
 Individuals and civil rights organizations have charged that
 fair trials have been denied because of corruption within the
 judiciary. In 1981, several judges involved in corrupt activi-
 ties were suspended and put on trial. Arrests and suspensions
 continued in 1982, although attorneys expressed concern that
 the anti-corruption program might be losing steam.
 Some critics have charged that the legal system is not insulated
 from political interference. Prosecutors and judges are civil
 servants and as such are required to join the government
 employees association. Although the judiciary is theoretically
 independent, in 1982 there were reports of government agencies
 and officials ignoring subpoenas, and in several cases judges
 overruled defense counsel requests to subpoena government
 officials.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Judicial warrants for searches of private property are required
 except for suspected subversion, economic crimes, and
 corruption.
 Forced entry by security authorities has been alleged, but no
 cases came to light in 1982. One human rights organization has
 contended that cases of *bugging' are quite common but evidence
 to substantiate such claims is lacking.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Indonesia's:1945 Constitution states that the freedom of
 association and assembly and of expressing thoughts orally
 and in writing shall be prescribed by statute. Opposition
 sentiments are publicly expressed. Opposition elements
 continued to use parliamentary and other legal procedures and
 publications to register protests about policies and leaders.
 Labor and farm representatives have petitioned to the Parlia-
 ment concerning alleged government abuses. The media in some
 cases have informal instructions not to publish the views of or
 news about oppositionists, and government security officials on
 several occasions during 1982 forbade opposition figures giving
 sermons or public speeches.
 The press, which is largely privately-owned, is carefully
 monitored and a system of *self censorship,* with journalists
 and publishers recognizing the l]mits of permissibility,
 generally prevails. Journalists complain, however, that
 in some instances they have been instructed orally by
 government officials to refrain from reporting certain
 newsworthy developments.
 In 1982, two leading publications had their licenses temporarily
 suspended for their coverage of national elections. "Tempo,'
 Indonesia's largest circulation weekly news magazine, had its
 license suspended for eight weeks, allegedly for violating an
 informal "consensus" on what kind of news was appropriate to
 report during the election period. Immediately after the
 election, the Department of Information suspended the publi-
 cation license of the Muslim daily newspaper "Pelita" after
 it published unofficial voting results in violation of an
 instruction that only official vote'counts from the Election
 Institute could be reported. The Muslim daily was closed for
 over four months and only permitted to reappeared after
 substantial, government-approved changes were made in its
 editorial staff.
 In September 1982, Parliament passed a new press law which
 replaced the existing publication permit with a publication
 business permit. The new law also established a Press Council
 
 
 713
 composed of journalists, scholars, and government officials,
 which will be empowered to determine what news is put to
 print. It is unclear how and when the Council will operate.
 Implementing regulations for the new law have not yet been
 issued, and it is too early to tell what the impact will be.
 However, public comment on the press law indicates that
 publishing concerns are likely to be more careful in screening
 sensitive press reports and commentary for fear all of their
 publications might be suspected. On the other hand, the
 government may be more reluctant to suspend the publishing
 permits of large media firms because of the likely public
 reaction against prohibiting publication of non-political
 publications of these companies.
 The Government is sensitive to foreign press coverage of
 internal Indonesian affairs, and this has led to its refusal to
 extend residence permits for some foreign journalists. In 1982
 the residence permit of the last resident Australian journalist
 expired and was not renewed, reflecting Indonesian Government
 pique over Australian media coverage, particularly with respect
 to East Timor.
 The Government censors foreign films and publications. Readers
 thus occasionally find portions inked out of foreign magazines
 and newspapers, or certain editions are not circulated at all.
 Communist writings are prohibited, as are lurid magazines or
 pictures. Published materials in Chinese cannot be imported,
 and Chinese characters are blotted out of foreign news photos
 and advertising. While the Government has permitted former
 political prisoners to publish articles in leading magazines
 and newspapers, two books written by one of Indonesia's most
 prominent novelists, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, were banned and
 confiscated because of alleged subversive content. On the
 other hand, a collection of his other writings appeared in
 1982 and is freely distributed.
 Some government interference with academic inquiry exists,
 including controls which are exerted during periods of
 political sensitivity such as election time. During the
 March-June 1982 election period, foreign and domestic
 researchers were forbidden to do field work. Some Indonesian
 academics lost their teaching positions in 1982, apparently
 because of their participation in oppositionist political
 activities, and some have been barred from travelling abroad
 for conferences or study tours. Highly qualified young people
 seeking to find jobs in the public sector, including.state
 universities, have seen their applications ignored, presumably
 because of their past involvement in dissident student
 organizations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is limited by government policy.
 Public assembly is freely permitted for social and ceremonial
 occasions and, as long as there is no perceived risk of
 violence, for sanctioned political occasions (e.g., rallies
 by the three active political groupings). Restrictions on
 assembly are sometimes tightened during periods of higher
 political tension or in response to local outbursts of violence
 (e.g., a brief anti-Chinese riot in South Sulawesi in late
 November).
 Trade unions in Indonesia are accepted because of their long
 history (since 1908) and respected role in the independence
 struggle. At the same time, they are suspect by the Government
 and many private Indonesians because of the almost complete
 domination of the trade union movement by communists in the
 late 50's and early 60's. The prevailing view is that trade
 unionism should not interfere with efforts to promote economic
 development through industrialization and foreign investment.
 
 
 714
 At the same time, there is a general recognition among know-
 ledgeable Indonesians that many labor disputes are the result
 of real economic pressures, trade unions are an important gauge
 of such pressures, and therefore blanket suppression of trade
 unions would make such pressures and their consequences harder
 to foresee and lead to greater instability in the long run.
 Finally, there is widespread public sympathy, frequently
 reflected in the press, for the poverty of the Indonesian
 worker and the efforts of trade unions to relieve it.
 Unions in Indonesia have the right to negotiate and organize.
 The latter is qualified because the national trade union
 federation and its members were created and are still
 subsidized by the Government. The Government installs labor
 leaders of its own choosing, especially at the national level.
 Indonesian labor law provides for the right to strike if govern-
 ment permission is granted but the government machinery for
 handling requests for permission to strike is extremely
 cumbersome. The practical result is that almost all strikes in
 Indonesia are technically illegal. Nevertheless, according to
 ILO statistics, strikes doubled or tripled in 1979-1981.
 This pattern persisted in 1982. Moreover, strikes are becoming
 increasingly effective as better-educated and more militant
 labor leaders appear, especially at the local level.
 The Government's reactions to this trend have been variable,
 cautious, and frequently improvised. It is not unusual for the
 Government to react by arresting all strikers or by shutting
 down the union concerned. Generally, however, its approach is
 to exert pressure on the leadership of the union federation and
 the relevant national union, on the local government panel for
 the resolution of labor disputes, and frequently on management.
 Strike leaders are occasionally detained for a day or two at a
 time.
 Although they occupy their positions at the Government's
 pleasure, the leaders of the federation and the national trade
 unions generally see themselves as neither wholly committed to
 their members' desires and grievances in the Western trade
 union leader model nor simply as specialized government
 bureaucrats as in communist countries. Rather, they seek to
 find a middle way between the demands of government and of the
 workers. The Government's ultimate control introduces a heavy
 bias in its favor in this process. This bias, and government's
 willingness to impose its power, are in turn somewhat restrained
 because both senior trade union leaders and the Government
 recognize that the former must retain their credibility with
 the workers if unions are to be useful in restraining labor
 disputes. This factor, together with the upward pressure on
 them from activist local leaders, gives senior trade union
 leaders considerable incentive and leverage in making
 government and management take heed of worker proble~s and
 demands.
 Reliable figures on the unionization of all work force sectors
 are not available. Government employees, including communica-
 tions, national airlines, national oil company, and utilities
 workers, are not permitted to unionize. The following work
 force sectors are more than 50 percent unionized: textile
 and garment, chemical and pharmaceutical, metal and ceramic,
 machine assembly, electronic, oil and mining (private sector),
 tourism, and merchant seamen.
 Indonesian unions are permitted to maintain relations with most
 international governmental and non-governmental trade union
 organizations.
 Indonesia has in recent years not been c nsured by the Inter-
 national Labor Organization (ILO). The ILO has repeatedly
 questioned Indonesia's compliance with forced labor standards
 in its treatment of political detainees and plantation workers.
 
 
 715
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is guaranteed by the 1945 Constitution, and
 the first tenet of the five-point state ideology, Pancasila,
 specifies belief in the Supreme Being. Although the Indonesian
 population is overwhelmingly Muslim, no discrimination is
 directed against those of other faiths, and many members of
 minority religions rank high in government councils. Despite
 government policies designed to promote religious tolerance,
 tensions between Muslims and other religious groups
 occasionally surface.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Exit permits are required of persons leaving the country, but
 they are usually obtainable without difficulty upon presentation
 of identification papers, though fee payments are high.
 There has been some criticism of government denial of exit
 permits to leading members of opposition groups and dissident
 academicians.
 In 1981, there was a flurry of charges concerning an existing
 and extensive 'black list* of persons prohibited from travelling
 abroad. In February 1982, a spokesman for the Immigration
 Directorate General, while not specifical-ly addressing the
 question of a Oblack list," confirmed that some individuals
 were not allowed to leave Indonesia if their overseas activities
 might, in the Government view, endanger. national stability.
 According to the spokesman, in 1981 approximately'12,000
 persons were denied permission to leave the country.
 In certain overcrowded areas, the.Government requires permits
 to change residence, primarily to control the further movement
 of population from the rural areas into the cities. Permits
 are not difficult to obtain for persons able to prove they have
 employment. Former detainees are required to notify authori-
 ties of travel outside their home areas. There have been
 charges from abroad that former political detainees associated
 with the 1965 coup attempt have been forced to participate in
 government transmigration programs to the outer islands but
 Indonesia's chief security official has announced that former
 detainees in fact are discouraged from doing so.
 Travel between East Timor and other parts of Indonesia is
 limited, and a Government permit is required to enter or leave
 the province. There are also restrictions on movement within
 East Timor, especially in areas where dissident Fretilin
 guerrillas are known to operate. East Timorese seeking to
 leave Indonesia frequently encounter difficulties in obtaining
 exit permits.
 In 1976, following the integration of East Timor into Indonesia,
 1,565 Portuguese citizens were repatriated from East Timor.
 In mid-1982, the list of Portuguese nationals still wishing to
 go to Portugal contained several hundred persons. Those wishing
 to migrate to Australia totalled about 150. However, between
 September 1981 and April 1982, seventy-six Cape Verdians
 departed, apparently representing all of that nationality who
 wished to leave. Despite the reduction in numbers of persons
 awaiting permission to leave, movement of persons within and
 out of East Timor remains a problem.
 A few Indonesians remain in communist countries where they
 chose to reside after the 1965 upheaval.. Permission from the
 Government must be obtained through Indonesian embassies abroad
 for them to return home. Such permission is determined on a
 case-by-case basis.
 
 
 716
 The Indochinese refugee camp on Indonesia's Galang Island has
 been developed by the Government and United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) into an excellent refugee
 facility. In addition to accepting nearly 74,000 first asylum
 refugees since 1975 pending their resettlement in third
 countries, the Indonesian Government has provided one- of the
 region's two processing centers to hold and provide
 resettlement acculturation for refugees transferred from camps
 in other first asylum countries and en route to resettlement
 countries, principally the US. The transfer of refugees to
 Galang began in July 1980 and has continued with sporadic
 interruptions when the Government of Indonesia regards Its
 refugee population as growing too fast and requiring larger
 acceptance rates by resettlement countries. Indonesia has
 not accepted any Vietnamese for permanent resettlement.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Indonesia has a limited representative government dominated by
 the military. All adult citizens except prisoners and members
 of the armed forces are enfranchised; 96 out of 460 seats In
 Parliament are reserved for appointed members of the armed
 forces, as active duty servicemen are barred from voting or
 running.for office. Elections for Parliament are held every
 five years,:with the last election held in May 1982.
 The President is elected by the Supreme Consultative Assembly,
 consisting of. the Parliament plus an equal number of appointed
 members in a special sitting every five years. The next is set
 for March 1-11, 1983. The 1975 law on political parties limits
 the number to three: -a Muslim party, an association of former
 nationalist and Christian parties, and the government-sponsored
 party or *functional group" (GOLKAR). GOLKAR won the 1971
 election with 62.8 percent of the vote, the 1977 election with
 62.1 percent, and the 1982 elections with 64.3 percent.
 Political activity by the parties in the period between
 elections is centered largely on national and regional
 legislative bodies because of a prohibition on operations at
 the village level. This restriction is lifted during the
 election campaign. The Communist Party and the Masjumi, a
 Muslim party involved in separatist rebellions in the late
 1950's, have been banned. Members of the foimer and some
 leaders of the latter are not allowed to run for office.
 In the May 1982 election, in which Members of Parliament were
 chosen:on the party list system similar to that of West
 European countries, over 90 percent of eligible voters partici-
 pated. All parties were able to present their views and to
 appeal for public support. East Timorese participated in
 national elections for the first time.
 The balloting on May 4 was generally considered to be open and
 free of systematic intimidation. There were post-election
 rumblings about manipulation of vote counts in some areas,
 particularly Jakarta, but no formal protests were filed.
 An informal opposition group consisting of retired military
 officers, some elements of th6 Muslim community, and former
 student leaders, formed in early 1980, continues its efforts
 to influence the Parliament, and indirectly the public, by
 submitting petitions critical of government leadership.
 Although Indonesian women traditionally are important income
 earners for their families and modern legislation guarantees
 them equal treatment, they are still not prominently represented
 in the decision-making process. There has been improved parti-
 cipation of women's groups in development-related projects
 involving nutrition, family planning, and home economics.
 However, no woman has held a full cabinet portfolio since 1966.
 Although well-represented in the professions (academic,
 
 
 717
 judicial, and medical) they hold only two ambassadorships and
 no governorships, top offices in the national assembly, or
 executive positions in provincial governments.
 At the rural level, women are giving up traditional economic
 pursuits, but are not always considered in adoption of modern
 techniques such as mechanized farming. While Indonesia has
 comprehensive labor legislation to protect female wage earners,
 women do not always receive equal pay for equal work.
 The Javanese, who comprise about forty-five percent of the total
 population, have a preeminent role in the country's political
 leadership as a result of historical and cultural factors.
 Other ethnic groups are represented at the highest levels of
 Government, but non-Javanese ethnic groups are generally
 under-represented in the mid- and lower-levels of the military
 and bureaucracy., There is deep resentment of the Chinese
 minority which plays a disproportionately large role in the
 nation's economic life. This racial tension periodically is
 translated into anti-Chinese violence, such as occur.red in
 Central Java in November-December 1980 and in Aceh in November
 1981 and in South Sulawesi in November 1982. Government regu-
 lations prohibit the operation of all-Chinese public and
 private schools and institutions of higher education, teaching
 in the Chinese language, the formation of exclusively Chinese
 cultural groups and trade associations, and the use of Chinese
 characters on sign boards or in publications. Social groups
 which may be effectively all-Chinese, associated with Buddhist
 and other religions, are not proscribed, however.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Government has allowed visits by the ICRC to some prisons
 and detention centers, and during 1982 allowed additional
 visits to individuals sentenced for complicity in the 1965
 abortive coup attempt. In recent years, Amnesty International
 representatives have been refused access to Indonesia because
 of the Government's disagreement with findings of the
 organization's reports and Amnesty's public criticisms of
 Indonesia.
 In February 1982, three prominent Indonesian human rights
 activists participated in the establishment of the *Asian
 Council of Fundamental Human Rights' and in the UNESCO Human
 Rights Teachers' Association. However, a late April meeting
 of the Lawasia Human Rights Standing Committee in Jakarta was
 postponed after government officials, citing election campaign
 atmospherics, declined to permit it.
 Large scale relief efforts in East Timor by the ICRC and
 Catholic Relief Services have been phased out as a result of
 improved economic conditions on the island. The ICRC continues
 to operate programs in East Timor with the Indonesian Red Cross,
 and the ICRC Jakarta representative has access to the province
 to oversee these activities. Catholic Relief Services is
 building an agricultural development project in East Timor,
 with nearly unrestricted access to the area for the project
 manager. The United Nations International Children's emergency
 Fund (UNICEF) has had a program in East Timor since early
 1982. During 1982, the Indonesian Government greatly increased
 access to East Timor by foreign journalists, academics,
 diplomats and others.
 For the past decade, a private, Jakarta-based Legal Aid
 Institute has contested human rights violations by defending or
 representing aggrieved parties in open court and by stimulating
 press attention and discussion. There are now locally-staffed
 Institute offices in many larger Indonesian cities, and other
 
 
 718
 legal assistance groups have begun to appear as well. In 1982,
 the Institute issued the second in what is now considered an
 annual series of reports concerning human rights developments
 in Indonesia in 1980.
 Indonesia is not party to any of the United Nations human rights
 conventions except for the UN Convention on the Political Rights
 of Women, which it ratified in 1958. Although it is not party
 to the UN protocol relating to refugees, it nonetheless has been
 generous in providing first asylum to Indochinese refugees and
 the site for a refugee processing center.
 United Nations resolutions have been adopted in recent years,
 over Indonesian opposition and by annually diminishing margins,
 expressing concern over the situation in East Timor and
 reaffirming the right of the people there to self-determination.
 Amnesty International in its 1982 report covering calendar year
 1981 expressed concern for prolonged detention without trial of
 Muslim political activists and the treatment of those arrested
 in connection with the 1965 coup attempt. Freedom House charac-
 terizes Indonesia as *Partly Free.*
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation.
 Indonesia's economic performance since the late 1960's has been
 impressive: GNP has grown at an average rate of about 7.5
 percent; foreign and domestip investment has increased; agri-
 cultural production has expanded by four percent per year; the
 beginnings of a modern industry are now in place; and the basic
 infrastructure has been improved. Nevertheless, very difficult
 problems remain. Per capita GNP is still estimated at only
 around $520 and over 50 percent of the population lives at
 levels below the World Bank's absolute poverty base.
 Because of the disruption of World War II, the subsequent
 struggle for independence, and the emphasis on political rather
 than economic issues until the late 1960's, Indonesia's infra-
 structure deteriorated and several indices of economic
 well-being actually declined from pre-World War II levels.
 Population pressures have increased, particularly on Java,
 Bali, and Madura, and, although the birth rate has declined
 substantially, over-population continues to pose serious
 obstacles to providing job opportunities for the growing
 labor force and assuring food self-sufficiency.
 Although agriculture is th4 most important sector of the
 domestic economy, accounting for over 30 percent of the GNP
 and employing about 60 percent of the labor force, petroleum
 exports of over one million barrels a day dominate the external
 economy. The oil sector generates over 65 percent of the
 Government's revenues and nearly 75 percent of the nation's
 gross export earnings. Total oil and gas revenues, however,
 provide less than $135 annually for each of Indonesia's nearly
 150 million people. During 1982, the World Bank announced that
 Indonesia had moved into the category of middle income develop-
 ing nations based on per capita income figures.
 In 1982, the population stood at 147,755,000. The infant
 mortality rate has improved from 159 per 1,000 in 1960 to 126
 in 1970 and 114 in 1979. Life expectancy at birth was 39 years
 in 1960, 46.7 in 1970, and 53.1 in 1980.
 The island of Java has approximately 80 million people and one
 of the highest population density rates in the world; 53 percent
 of rural families on Java are landless. Indonesia's family
 planning program has lowered birth rates and reduced population
 growth to less than two percent at present, down from 2.1
 percent in 1980. It is also seeking to reduce Java's population
 pressures and to increase agricultural production through an
 
 
 719
 accelerated transmigration program to the outer islands; nearly
 five percent of the budget is devoted to manpower and trans-
 migration.
 Agricultural output has increased by about 3.8 percent annually
 during the past decade, one of the best agricultural perfor-
 mances of any major developing country. The percentage of
 caloric supply available for consumption relative to nutritional
 requirements has risen from 89 in 1960 to 92 in 1970 and to 105
 in 1977. As a result of rising consumption, however, Indonesia
 remains a large grain importer despite inpreased agricultural
 production. During the past few years, the Government
 increasingly has stressed non-rice production, particularly
 in areas not suited to rice cultivation.
 Development has been hindered by limited availability of
 qualified medical personnel and health facilities. The ratio
 of physicians per capita has, however, increased from 1:41,000
 in 1960 to 1:12,000 in 1981, with over 1,000 doctors being
 graduated each year. The number of regional health centers,
 maternal child health centers, and polyclinics has been �
 increasing. There are now over 4,300 public health centers
 throughout the country, with at least one in every sub-
 district, about 50 percent of which are staffed with at least
 one physician.
