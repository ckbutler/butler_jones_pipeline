 BAHRAIN
 Bahrain has been ruled since the late 18th century by the
 Al-Khalifa family, which dominates the society and Government.
 Bahrain's written Constitution lays out a separation of powers
 between the Prime Minister, the National Assembly, and the
 courts. Political rights (including the right of election) and
 other human rights are enshrined as ideals but they do not
 provide a judicial check on the authorities. How and whether
 these rights are guaranteed is subject to subsequent
 legislation. The provision confirming the Amir as hereditary
 ruler of Bahrain ratifies the continued supremacy of the
 Al-Khalifa family. In fact, the National Assembly was
 suspended in 1975, 20 months after it first met.
 Bahrain's leadership has been increasingly torn between two
 aims. On one hand, it desires to foster the open social and
 commercial environment needed to attract international
 business. On the other hand, it wants to protect the ruling
 family's preeminence, prevent potential sectarian violence, and
 thwart efforts by Iran and other revolutionary states to
 destabilize Bahrain. Bahrainis are divided between Shi'a and
 Sunni Muslim religious communities. The Shi'a form a majority
 of about two-thirds of the native population; the remaining
 one-third of the population as well as the ruling family is
 Sunni. Despite being a minority, the Sunni overshadow the
 Shi'a in wealth and influence. Most Bahrainis are Arab, but a
 significant minority are of Iranian origin. While extreme
 poverty is rare and the Government makes great efforts to
 assure employment, the Shi'a and Bahrainis of Iranian origin
 are disadvantaged as groups with respect to Sunnis and those
 with Arab ties going back many generations. This economic
 disparity has given the Iranian revolution potential appeal
 with these groups and encouraged Iran to support antiregime
 activities in Bahrain. An Iranian-sponsored coup attempt in
 December 1981 caused the Government to implement extraordinary
 security measures as it sought to meet the threat of violence.
 The Government now appears more confident that it will not
 again be surprised by dissidents and security measures have
 become less repressive. At the same time, however, there was
 no perceptible movement toward reconvening the National
 Assembly, despite considerable attention on this issue among
 domestic political circles.
 Joint worker/management committees in eight private and
 state-owned companies and a national workers committee began
 functioning in 1983. While these institutions operate within
 very constrained limits, they reintroduce the concept of
 elected representation, which is a positive development.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom fromt
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were no known instances of unlawful or arbitrary
 deprivation of life in 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 Some persons detained by the security forces for investigation
 of suspected illegal political activity have not been
 immediately accounted for. Periods of detention incommunicado
 can be lengthy, but relatives are usually able to find out if
 
 (1203)
 
 
 1204
 and where the detainee is'being held. Permanent disappearance
 at the hands of the security forces does not take place.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Physical abuse is common during arrest and interrogation.
 Under normal incarceration, physical mistreatment rarely occurs
 after interrogation. It is not known what happens during
 detention in security prisons (where questioning may continue
 after sentencing) since visits by relatives or other
 non-Government persons are not allowed. Medical examinations
 by nonprison doctors have also been denied. Policemen
 sometimes beat a suspect as a matter of course after stopping
 him for questioning or arrest, whether or not the subject has
 offered any resistance. At present the evidence is
 insufficient to confirm whether this practice is pursuant to
 systematic policy or merely indicative of inadequate discipline
 among police personnel. Since the Government cannot find
 sufficient Bahrainis to serve as police officers, it is forced
 to hire foreigners, usually Pakistanis, Yemenis, and Arabian
 Peninsula Bedouins. The gratuitous nature of reported cases of
 physical abuse by the police suggests that they result
 primarily from poor training and discipline in the police
 force, exacerbated by the lack of empathy between foreign
 policemen and native Bahrainis. In its 1983 annual report,
 Amnesty International expressed concern about reports of the
 use of torture in Bahrain, particularly on the 73 prisoners
 convicted of plotting the coup attempt.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Participation in political activities outside the narrow
 confines tolerated by the regime is carefully scrutinized by
 the police and political activists are often detained for
 questioning. Periods of detention for antiregime political
 activity are usually short, although detainments for periods of
 one or two months without'formal charges being brought are not
 unknown. In addition, there are between 15 and 20 persons
 currently detained indefinitely without trial for political
 activities. Activities of a political nature which can bring
 arrest include membership or suspected membership in
 "subversive organizations," expression of extreme antiregime
 opinion in a public setting, or engaging in public acts of
 defiance against the regime. Examples of acts that would lead
 to arrest also include painting slogans on walls, joining
 demonstrations against public authority, possessing or
 circulating antiregime propaganda, or harboring persons
 committing such acts. There is no right of habeas corpus.
 Although exile is banned by the Constitution, in 1982 the
 Government expelled Bahraini residents of Iranian origin, some
 of whom were from families that had lived in Bahrain for
 generations. Included among them were around 200 Bahrainis who
 were suspected of being in sympathy with the coup attempt.
 Fewer Beahrainis are believed to have been expelled in 1983 but
 their number is unknown.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Shari'a courts in Bahrain confine themselves to questions of
 family law and inheritance. A person arrested may be tried in
 either a civil court or a security court. The two are very
 different. Civil trials provide procedural guarantees
 
 
 1205
 including open trial, right to counsel (including legal aid for
 indigents), and right to appeal. Security courts, where the 73
 accused of plotting the coup attempt were tried, lack the
 rights to a public trial and appeal. Amnesty International
 expressed concern that the right to counsel also was impaired
 by not allowing the defense counsel adequate opportunity to
 prepare their cases or to cross-examine prosecution witnesses.
 Sentences imposed by the security court can be referred to the
 Amir for clemency, which is not customarily allowed from the
 civil courts.
 The charges against the 73 persons implicated in the December
 1981 coup were all related to planned acts of violence. Other
 persons have been put on trial for attempting to form
 unauthorized political or labor organizations. No such trials
 have been reported in 1983, but there are estimates that
 between 60 and 80 persons are currently serving sentences for
 nonviolent political activities.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Prior authorization for entry of private premises must come
 from senior levels in the Ministry of Interior, but there
 appears to be no judicial oversight. International telephone
 calls are routinely monitored and the police commonly open
 mail. Bahrainis, particularly among lower economic classes and
 groups with political leanings toward the Iranian revolution or
 leftist causes, fear police informer networks and this
 undoubtedly inhibits their political expression. Political
 ideas associated with Western democracy are generally not
 suppressed, perhaps because they currently do not have the
 revolutionary potential of Islamic fundamentalism or Marxist
 ideology. Members of the privileged classes openly discuss
 ways to broaden political participation in an evolutionary
 fashion.
 Although Islam is Bahrain's official religion and social
 pressure works to assure public conformity with Islamic
 precepts (for example, requiring women to be completely covered
 in public), restrictions based on religious custom are not
 enforced by the state.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Bahrainis are free to express political views informally, but
 any attempt to give them wider circulation in the media is
 subject to regulation. Criticism of the Government's
 performance in some areas--such as the adequacy of municipal
 services, the need to move Bahrainis into jobs held by skilled
 foreign workers, or better ways to encourage economic
 development--is tolerated and commonly seen in the press.
 Criticism of the Amir, attempts to mobilize the public into
 unauthorized political associations, and subject matter deemed
 pornographic.or un-Islamic are all prohibited.
 Under security and publication laws the Ministry of Information
 has broad authority to censor the local media, to screen
 foreign publications, and to determine who may and who may not
 practice journalism. Despite these laws, Bahrain is open to
 Western news periodicals, and several news agencies have
 regional offices in Manama. As recently as 1980, media
 
 
 1206
 censorship has taken the form of shutting down a publication
 temporarily. There have not been closures of newspapers since
 then because editors fully understand the rules and abide by
 them.
 All radio and television stations are government owned.
 Newspapers are privately owned. The editor of the largest
 paper is a former Ministry of Information official and his
 publication is regarded as semiofficial.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public political demonstrations are prohibited in Bahrain.
 While the Constitution recognizes the right of workers to
 organize, trade unions are illegal. However, the Government
 has encouraged the formation of elected workers' committees in
 some major businesses, and elections to these committees began
 in 1982. Committee representatives are empowered to bargain
 with management over wages and working conditions. The
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs acts as arbiter if no
 agreement is reached. Fifteen percent of the work force will
 soon be represented by these committees, which in turn choose
 members of a National Committee. This body represents Bahrain
 in international labor organizations. Expatriate workers
 (about 60 percent of the work force) may vote and stand for
 election on local committees but may not serve at the national
 level.
 The worker/management committees that the Government is
 fostering are not independent trade unions and there is little
 chance they will be allowed to evolve in accordance with U.S.
 or West European trade union models. Neither strikes nor any
 activity deemed political is permitted. The Government reviews
 the list of candidates before election and occasionally strikes
 out names.
 A nu\bar of independent professional organizations covering
 varios groups exist in Bahrain. In line with the size of the
 country and its level of development, these organizations are
 generally small and limited in scope. For the most part, they
 limit themselves to their own professional concerns and do not
 address political issues.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion of Bahrain. A variety of
 Islamic and Christian sects maintain places of worship and
 freely practice their religion in Bahrain. The teaching of
 non-Islamic religions outside of the confines of recognized
 religious establishments is not permitted. Bahrainis may
 convert from one religion to another, but attempts to convert
 Muslims to other faiths is traditionally resisted by Muslim
 society. Although the ruling family is of the Sunni sect,
 there are Shi'a religious societies which promote the study of
 Islam and serve as social and sports clubs. The largest of
 these, with about 1.600 members, is the Islamic Enlightenment
 Society. Members of the Shi'a sect have been subjected to job
 discrimination, and the numerous and active Shi'a religious
 establishments are subjected to close vigilance by the security
 forces. At times, the police have forcefully broken up Shi'a
 religious processions which commemorate ancient Shi'a-Sunni
 religious battles. In the past such events have turned to
 political protest and even violence. Police continue to
 monitor such religious activities closely, but no incident of
 
 
 1207
 police interference occurred in 1983.
 Membership in the Sunni sect generally confers a more favored
 status on Bahraini nationals and on Muslim non-Bahrainis
 Sunnis are given preference for employment that involves
 national security interests.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bahrainis are free to move within the country, to travel
 abroad, and to emigrate. Shi'a Bahrainis are permitted to make
 pilgrimages to Shi'a holy sites in Iran, although their numbers
 are carefully controlled because of fears of subversion of
 Shi'a pilgrims by Iranian intelligence authorities. Refugees
 are not forced to return to homelands from which they fled but
 generally are asked to move on quickly to a third country for
 resettlement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 At present there are no elections for government positions.
 The average Bahraini is able to influence the political process
 only by means of informal contact with senior officials and by
 attending public audiences of the Amir. No political parties
 are permitted and none exist openly. There are two clandestine
 political groups with ties to Iran which attract younger
 militant Shi'as:  the Islamic Front for the Liberation of
 Bahrain. the group responsible for the 1981 coup attempt, and
 the Islamic Call Party. Both advocate overthrow of the
 Government and establishment of an independent Islamic
 republic. Both groups are believed to have several hundred
 members. There are also two underground leftist groups--the
 Popular Front for the Liberation of Bahrain and the National
 Front for the Liberation of Bahrain--which have ties with
 revolutionary Arab regimes in the area and some Soviet
 support. Both groups call for violent revolution and probably
 have several hundred members each.
 The Government has tolerated editorials talking about democracy
 and popular participation in general terms that do not
 specifically call for new National Assembly elections. There
 are no indications that an elected Parliament will soon be
 reestablished.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Bahrain has not been the subject of resolutions or
 investigations by official international human rights
 organizations. No private human rights group is known to have
 visited Bahrain this past year. The last indication of the
 Government's attitude toward such investigations was in 1982
 when Amnesty International sent a team to observe the trial of
 those accused of plotting the coup attempt. The team was able
 to meet with government officials and defense counsel but was
 not allowed to attend the closed trial. There are no
 non-governmental organizations in Bahrain established to
 protect individual liberties.
 Amnesty International in its 1983 report expressed concern
 about imprisonment of prisoners of conscience and detention
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 77
 
 
 1208
 without trial, torture, and ill-treatment of prisoners.
 Freedom House has rated Bahrain "partly free." Bahrain has not
 played a prominent role in international organizations nor has
 it worked in cooperation with private organizations in the
 human rights area.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Government has devoted a major part of its resources to
 meeting the economic and social needs of Bahrain's population.
 Non-Bahraini guest workers are generally not entitled to the
 same legal or social benefits that Bahrainis enjoy. According
 to the last census conducted in 1981, Bahrain's population was
 350,798, of which about 32 percent, including about 60 percent
 of the labor force, was non-Bahraini. The population growth
 rate for the native population is 3.9 percent. Free public
 health care is available to all residents. Free education and
 subsidized housing are available only to Bahrainis. The
 Government's social insurance plans and protection against
 unfair labor practices primarily benefit Bahrainis. Many
 foreign unskilled workers have little bargaining leverage and
 often work at salary rates and under working conditions that
 would not be acceptable for Bahrainis but are better than those
 available to the guest workers in their home countries.
 The right to private property is protected. While foreigners
 other than citizens of Gulf Cooperation Council countries are
 not normally permitted to own real estate in Bahrain, their
 rights to possess other personal property are protected under
 law.
 Life expectancy in Bahrain is about 67 years. World Bank
 statistics show an infant mortality rate of 46 per 1,000 live
 births for 1983. The Ministry of Health gives this rate to be
 23 per 1,000. Food and safe drinking water are available in
 adequate supply to the entire population, and an ongoing
 sewerage project promises to improve public sanitation. The
 prices of basic food items are subsidized by the Government.
 Approximately 73 percent of Bahrainis between ages of 4 and 19
 attend primary or secondary schools; 48 percent are female.
 The literacy rate is currently estimated to be 74 percent
 (above age 10). The Government has begun a campaign to
 eiadicate remaining illiteracy.
 P:r capita income in 1981 was about $7,200 and it is now
 estimated at over $9.000. Income distribution patterns are
 skewed in favor of the ruling family and allied merchant
 families. There is no significant domestic taxation. Although
 statistical data are not available, it is generally recognized
 that there is some poverty in Bahrain at the village level and
 among some of the foreign temporary worker communities. The
 Government, faced with declining oil revenues, receives
 financial support and project grants from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
 and the United Arab Emirates. From the 1982-83 budget, 13
 percent was allocated to education, 10 percent to health, 7.6
 percent to housing, and 24 percent to social services.
 The Government continues to place strong emphasis on
 Bahrainization of most sectors of the economy, but currently
 both menial and high-skilled positions tend to be held by
 expatriate employees. The Government plans to train 10,000
 Bahrainis over the next 10 years in order to replace foreign
 workers holding skilled jobs, but this effort is thwarted by
 
 
 1209
 higher salaries in other Gulf States that attract many skilled
 Bahrainis to work outside Bahrain.
 Bahraini women have traditionally constituted a *separate
 society" in accord with Bahrain's Islamic heritage. The
 integration of male and female societies began with the
 development of a modern economy, and women have increasingly
 taken on roles previously reserved for men. The number of
 Bahraini women in the work force increased from about 1,000 to
 12,000 between 1970 and 1980, and they now constitute 12
 percent of all Bahraini workers. The Government encouraged the
 trend toward equality and has enacted special labor laws to
 encourage female entry into the work force. The Government
 itself is a leading employer of women. Most of these positions
 are clerical, but a small number of senior positions are held
 by women. Labor law grants women 60 days paid maternity leave
 and nursing periods during the work day. Women may not be
 discharged for marriage and pregnancy. Many legal rights of
 concern to women are subject to Shari'a law; women have rights
 to their own property but daughters receive less inheritance
 than sons, and widows must share their husband's estate with
 their children. While a wife may divorce, she must specify
 grounds for the plea, whereas a man may divorce without cause.
 In the case of a male child, custody remains with the mother
 until he reaches the age of 12; a girl stays with her mother
 until she marries. Women are allowed to drive and appear in
 public without male escort. Permission from a male family
 member is sometimes required to leave the country, however.
