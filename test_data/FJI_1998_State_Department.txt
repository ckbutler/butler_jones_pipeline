 FIJI
 Fiji made continued progress toward restoration of a more representative and
 democratic government, as the amended Constitution approved in 1997 came into
 effect in July. The provisions that amend the 1990 Constitution encourage multieth-
 nic government while protecting traditional Fijian values. Under the amended Con-
 stitution, the Prime Minister and the President can be of any race, and for the first
 time, in addition to the communally allocated seats, ther  e  open seats not al-
 located to any racial community in the lower house of Parliament. The judiciary is
 independent.
 The Constitution also includes a strengthened bill of rights and a compact de-
 signed to protect the rights of all citizens. It alters the official name of the country
 to "Republic of the Fiji Islands" and designates all citizens 'Fiji Islanders," avoiding
 designations speciing ethnicity. However, it preserves the paramountcy of indige-
 nous Fijian interests, which cannot be subordinated to the interests of other commu-
 nities. Elections must take place no later than 1999.
 The new Constitution is expected to promote greater political stability. Nonethe-
 less, ethnicity remains a dominant factor in Fijian life and affects the country's poli-
 tics, economy, and society. The population is a multiracial, multicultural mix, with
 indigenous Fijians comprising 51 percent, Indo-Fijians (descendents of immigrants
 from the Indian subcontinent) around 42 percent, and Asians, Caucasians and other
 Pacific Islanders making up the rest of the population of over 775,000. The ethnic
 division is particularly evident in the private and public sectors, where business is
 largely controlled by Indo-Fijian families while government ministries and the mili-
 tary are largely led by indigenous Fijians.
 The Fiji Military Forces (FMF), a small professional force, comes under the au-
 thority of the Ministry for Home Affairs, as do the police. A separate unit, the Fiji
 Intelpublice    i  i  limited statutory powers to search people and property,
 monitor communications, and access financial records, also comes under authority
 of the Ministry. There continue to be credible reports of human rights abuses by
 individual police officers.
 Sugar and tourism constitute the malnstays of the economy, accounting for more
 than half the nation's foreign exchange earnings. The Government is seeking to de-
 velop the service ian        nufacturing industries. Private investment increased
 after several stagnant years, but is still well below the 12 percent gross domestic
 product level achieved prior to the political disturbances in 1987.
 The principal human rights problem, while significantly addressed in the revised
 Constitution, remains ethnically based discrimination. Although the new constitu-
 tional provisions reduce the factors that abridge the right of citizens to change their
 government, there is continuing protection for indigenous Fijian interests through
 government hiring practices, education policies, land tenure preferences, and con-
 stitutional safeguards. Other human rights problems include occasional police bru-
 tality, informal constraints on the freedom of the press, efforts to restrict public
 comments by the diplomatic corps, discrimination and cases of violence against
 women, and instances of abuse of children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of poitically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Police sometimes abuse detainees; the authorities have punished some of the offend-
 ing officers, but these punishments have not been sufficient to deter all police
 abuses. The Police Department's internal affairs unit investigates complaints of po-
 lice brutality.
 Prison authorities have struggled to meet minimum international standards with-
 in the limits of local financial restraints. Prison conditions are Spartan, and food
 and sanitation are limited. The Government permits visits to prisons by church
 groups and family members.
 The law permits corporal punishment as a penalty for criminal acts, but this pro-
 vision is seldom invoked.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Law of Arrest and Detention pro-
 vides that a person may be arrested only if police believe that a breach of the crimi-
 nal law has been or is about to be committed. Arrested persons must be brought
 before a court without "undue delay." This requirement is taken to mean within 24
 hours, with 48 hours as the exception (such as when an arrest is made over the
 weekend). Rules governing detention are designed to ensure fair questioning of sus-
 pects. Defendants have the right to a judicial review of the grounds for arrest; in
 urgent cases, defendants may apply to a judge at any time, whether he is sitting
 or not. Incommunicado and arbitrary detention, both iegal, did not occur.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent under the Constitu-
 tion and in practice. There were no credible reports of courts having been influenced
 by the executive.
 The judicial structure is patterned on the British system. The principal courts are
 the magistrate courts, the High Court, the Court of Appeal, and the Supreme Court.
 There are no special courts; military courts try only members of the armed forces.
 Magistrate courts continue to try the large majority of cases. In addition to its juris-
 diction in serious civil and criminal cases, the High Court is granted special interest
 jurisdiction on behalf of the public and is empowered to review alleged violations
 of individual rights provided by the Constitution.
 Defendants have the right to a public trial and to counsel. Trials in the High
 Court provide for the presence of assessors (citizens randomly selected to represent
 the community); cases in magistrate court do not. In litigation involving lesser com-
 plaints, a public legal advisor assists indigent persons in domestic or family law
 cases. The right of appeal exists but is hampered by continuing delays in the ap-
 peals process. Bail procedures mean that most defendants do not experience any
 pretrial detention.
 The law sometimes treats women differently from men. In some instances, there
 is a presumption of reduced competence and thus reduced responsibility. For exam-
 ple, only women can be charged with infanticide (if a man kills an infant the act
 is treated as murder, a more serious charge). A female defendant in an infanticide
 case is presumed to have diminished mental capacity, and sentences are reduced or
 suspended accordingly.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In gen-
 eral the Government respects the privacy of the home. However, the Intelligence
 Service has powers, within specific operational guidelines, to search persons and
 property, access private financial records, and monitor mail and telephones when a
 warrant is issued by the National Security Council. The Intelligence Service con-
 ducts surveillance of persons it believes represent a security threat.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech is generally respected. The
 Government at times criticizes the media for its coverage of sensitive issues, par-
 ticularly if the Government perceives the coverage as resulting in a diminution of
 respect for authority. There are credible reports of attempts by individual members
 of the Government to pressure editors or otherwise interfere with the independence
 of the press.
 Nevertheless, political figures and private citizens can and do speak out against
 the Government. Although the Public Order Act and other acts prohibit actions that
 are likely to incite racial antagonism, there were no reported arrests for such public
 statements.
 Legislation pertaining to the press is contained in the Newspaper Registration Act
 (NRA) and the Press Correction Act (PCA). Under the NRA, all newspapers must
 be registered with the Government before they can publish. Although the Govern-
 ment has never used the PCA, the act gives the Minister of Information sole discre-
 tionary power to order a newspaper to publish a "correcting statement" if, in the
 
 
 Minister's opinion, a false or distorted article has been published. Should the news-
 paper refuse to publish the Minister's correction, it can be taken to court, and if
 found guilty, fined approximately $700 (individual persons convicted under the act
 may be fined approximately $150 or imprisoned for 6 months or both). The PCA al-
 lows the Government to arrest anyone who publishes "malicious" material. This in-
 cludes anything the Government considers false news that could create or foster
 public alarm or result in "detriment to the public."
 The media operate without prior censorship but with considerable self-censorship.
 Newspapers occasionally print editorials critical of the Government and occasionally
 do investigative reporting. They widely report statements about the political situa-
 tion by opposition figures and foreign governments. The letters-to-the-editor col-
 umns of the two daily newspapers also frequently carry political statements from
 a wide cross section of society, including members of the deposed precoup govern-
 ment, which are highly critical of the Government, its programs, and the Constitu-
 tion. Criticism, albeit muted, of the once sacrosanct traditional chiefly system is ap-
 pearing more frequently. However, the Government still views comments about indi-
 vidual chiefs with disfavor.
 An active local organization, the Fiji Islands Media Association (FIMA), is an affil-
 iate of the regional Pacific Islands News Association (PINA). Both FIMA and PINA
 pressed for better training and the establishment of codes of ethics for journalists.
 In a show of tangible support for strengthening the media, the Government uncondi-
 tionally provided housing for the Fiji Journalism Training Institute. The formerly
 dormant Fiji News Council has been reorganized and is active again. The Council
 strives to promote high journalistic standards, enhance the image of the media, safe-
 guard its independence, and resolve complalnts from the public.
 Fiji's television news production is owned and operated by Fiji One, the only
 noncable television station. Fiji One in turn is owned by private individuals and in-
 terests, and 51 percent by a trust operating on behalf of Fiji's provincial govern-
 ments. The Government's attempt to open the television market to new entrants is
 being challenged in court.
 In August the Government sought to require foreign diplomatic representatives to
 submit all public address requests for approval by the Foreign Ministry and to pro-
 vide advance copies of speech texts. The Government also stated that foreign diplo-
 matic representatives are obliged not to comment on politically sensitive issues such
 as the Constitution, land issues, and relations between communities, citing the need
 to respect the sovereignty of the State and noninterference in internal matters.
 While academic freedom is generally respected, government work permit stipula-
 tions and University of South Pacific (USP) contract regulations have effectively de-
 terred university employees from participation in domestic politics. Reports indicate
 that the Government is investigating allegations that two foreign USP journalism
 lecturers violated the terms of their work permits by writing paid articles critical
 of the state of democracy in Fiji for Internet web pages and publications not associ-
 ated with USP. Student groups organize freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides the
 right to assemble for political purposes, subject to restrictions in the interest of pub-
 lic order. Permits for public gatherings must be obtained from the district officer.
 The Government does not always grant permits for large outdoor political meetings
 or demonstrations, particularly if the police advise of difficulties with the antici-
 pated crowd size or their ability to assure public safety.
 The Government routinely issued permits for rallies organized by political parties,
 religious groups, and groups opposed to government policies.
 All opposition party headquarters operate without government interference. Politi-
 cal organizations operate and issue public statements and did so repeatedly and
 openly throughout the year.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitutional provision of freedom of religion is
 honored in practice. The Government does not restrict foreign clergy and missionary
 activity or other typical activities of religious organizations.
 There were allegations in 1997 that police were slow to respond to incidents of
 desecration of Hindu temples (see Section 5).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict freedom of movement within the
 country or abroad. Occasional detentions at the airport occur, but the courts order
 redress where this is warranted. Citizens are free to emigrate, and over 40,000 have
 done so since 1987. The Government does not restrict their return if they choose
 to do so, and has, in fact, encouraged those who left after the coups to return.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. In
 
 
 900
 the past it has been reluctant to grant first asylum without assurances that the asy-
 lum seeker would be moved to a third country.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The constitutional amendments are a significant step toward the restoration of a
 more representative and democratic government. The amended Constitution reduces
 the ethnically based factors that abridge the right of citizens to change their govern-
 ment. Under its provisions the prime minister and president can be of any race. It
 establishes a 71-member lower house with 25 open seats and 46 seats allocated to
 different ethnic communities. The open seats, which are unprecedented, have been
 established by an electoral commission and apportioned into districts of approxi-
 mately equal population. Of the 46 communal seats, 23 are allotted to indigenous
 Fijians, 19 to Indo-Fijians, 3 are "general voter" (for the most part Caucasians and
 East Asians) seats, and 1 is allotted to the Rotumans (an ethnically distinct Polyne-
 sian people), roughly proportional to the different communities' representation in
 the population. The amended Constitution also contains an alternate vote system
 for elections to the lower house, to replace the winner takes all system of the pre-
 vious constitution. Although the Review Commission recommended a mostly elected
 Senate it remains an appointed body; the President appoints its 32 members with
 the Great Council of Chiefs nominating 14 members, the Prime Minister 9, the op-
 position leader 8, and the Council of Rotuma I member.
 Included in the amended Constitution is a strengthened bill of rights and a com-
 pact among the people to protect their respective rights and interests, which, how-
 ever, acknowledges that the paramountcy of indigenous Fijian interests cannot be
 subordinated to the interests of other communities. In July Parliament passed a
 new emergency powers act that can be invoked if Parliament determines that there
 is a threat to the life of the nation. International media organizations criticized the
 new law due to concern that the Government could close or censor publications dur-
 ing times of crisis.
 Fiji has an increasing number of active political parties. The ethnic Fijian SVT
 (or Fijian Political Party) forms the core of the Government's parliamentary major-
 ity. Two small parties representing primarily Caucasians, Asians, and other Pacific
 Islanders, also have members in the Cabinet. The Fijian Association Party formally
 left the government coalition during the year but its two cabinet members retained
 their positions. Two predominantly Indo-Fijian parties, the National Federation
 Party (NFP) and the Fiji Labor Party (FLP) make up most of the opposition. The
 leader of the opposition is the parliamentary' leader of the NFP. A number of new
 parties also have been formed to contest general elections, which are scheduled to
 e held in 1999. The new Constitution mandates that all parties that gain more
 than 10 percent of parliamentary seats in general elections are to be invited to par-
 ticipate in a government of national unity.
 Women in both the Fijian and Indian communities have functioned primarily in
 traditional roles, although an increasing number of women are rising to prominent
 positions in politics and public service. Five women sit in Parliament. The two
 women in the lower house are members of the Cabinet, with one the Deputy Prime
 Minister. Women also play important roles in Fiji's chiefly system and can be chiefs
 in their own right. The President's wife is one of Fiji's three highest ranking chiefs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no local groups that focus solely on human rights matters, but the wom-
 en's rights movement, the labor movement, and various political groups (including
 organized political parties) are engaged in promoting human rights. There are also
 several small, foreign-based organizations that concentrate on human rights causes
 in Fiji, including the Coalition for Democracy in Fiji (with offices in New Zealand
 and Australia) and two United Kingdom-based groups, the International Fiji Move-
 ment and the Movement for Democracy in Fiji.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The amended Constitution probibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, place
 of origin, political opinion, color, religion, or creed, and provides specific affirmative
 action provisions for those disadvantaged as a result of such discrimination. In the
 compact included in the amended Constitution, there is specific provision for affirm-
 ative action and "social justice" programs to secure effective equality of access to op-
 portunities, amenities, and services for the Fijian and Rotuman people, and for all
 disadvantaged citizens and groups.

 901
 Women.-Women in Fiji are actively addressing the problem of domestic violence.
 Reliable estimates indicate that 10 percent of women have been abused in some
 way, and this abuse is a major focus of the women's movement. Fiji police have
 adopted a "no drop" rule, according to which they will prosecute cases of domestic
 violence even when the victim does not wish to press charges. However, in at least
 one case, the police reportedly exhibited great reluctance to investigate and pros-
 ecute a policeman who had beaten his wife into a coma.
 There is a small but active women's rights movement, which has pressed for more
 serious punishment for rape. Courts have imposed sentences that vary widely but
 are generally lenient. Women have sought to have all rape cases heard in the High
 Court where sentencing limits are higher.
 Suva, the capital, and Ba, Labasa, and Lautoka have privately funded women's
 crisis centers, which offer counseling and assistance to women in cases of rape, do-
 mestic violence, and other problems, such as child support payments. There is, over-
 all, a growing awareness of the abuse of women's rights.
 Constitutional changes a pproved in 1997 are designed to redress the imbalance
 in spousal and offspring rights between male and female citizens. Under the amend-
 ed Constitution, male and female citizens enjoy equal rights relating to the granting
 of residence for spouses, registration of children, and racial designation of children
 with regard to electoral rolls and ethnic communal property.
 In general women in the Fijian community are more likely to rise to prominence
 in their own right than are women in the Indo-Fijian community. Women have full
 rights of property ownership and inheritance, and a number have become successful
 entrepreneurs. Women are generally paid less than men, a discrepancy that is espe-
 cially notable in the garment industry. Garment workers, most of whom are female,
 are subject to a special minimum wage that is considerably lower than that in other
 sectors.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare but has
 limited financial resources to carry out the commitment. In addition the legal sys-
 tem is at times inadequate to protect the rights of children, as children's testimony
 is inadmissible unless corroborated by an adult. Societal changes have undermined
 the traditional village and extended family based social structures; an outgrowth of
 this evolution has been a child abuse problem. The Government in 1993 created a
 Child Welfare Committee to address these problems, but it is likely to remain reluc-
 tant to become directly involved in what are generally perceived to be "family mat-
 ters."
 School is not mandatory.
 Corporal punishment is administered in some schools and homes. The Ministry
 of Education has guidelines for the administration of such punishment by principals
 and head teachers. A number of incidents involving alleged beatings of children in
 reli*ious schools were reported in the media. In at least one instance, a family initi-
 atedcourt action against a teacher who reportedly had beaten a child for lack of
 discipline. There is credible information that not all abuses are reported or pun-
 ished.
 People With Disabilities.-Legal discrimination against physically disabled per-
 sons in employment, education, and the provision of other state services does not
 exist. However, there is no legislation or mandated provision for accessibility for the
 disabled. Several small voluntary organizations promote greater attention to the
 needs of the disabled.
 Religious Minorities.-Police continued to investigate a small number of cases
 that involved desecration of Hindu temples in 1997.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The stated purpose of two military coups in
 1987 was to ensure the political supremacy of the indigenous Fijian people and to
 protect their traditional way of life and communal control of land. To this end, the
 Government initiated a number of constitutional and other measures to ensure eth-
 nic Fijian control of the executive and legislative branches. The Government also
 successfully raised the proportion of ethnic Fijians and Rotumans in the public serv-
 ice to 50 percent or higher at all levels, but most dramatically at the senior level:
 Indo-Fijians now represent only 10 percent of the highest levels of the civil service.
 The amended Constitution seeks to redress this imbalance by specifically noting
 that "the composition of state services at all levels must be based on the principle
 of reflecting as closely as possible the ethnic composition of the population."
 Control of land is a highly sensitive issue. Ethnic Fijians currently hold,
 communally, about 83 percent of land, the State holds another 8 percent, and only
 the remaining 9 percent is freehold land. The British colonial administration insti-
 tuted the present land ownership arrangements to protect the interests of the indig-
 enous Fijians whose traditional beliefs, cultural values, and self-identity are tied to
 the land. Most cash crop farmers are Indo-Fijians, who lease land from the ethnic
 
 
 Fijian landowners through the Native Land Trust Board. Many Indo-Fijians, par-
 ticularly farmers, believe that the absence of secure land tenure discriminates
 against them. Most current leases are expected to expire by 2000. A parliamentary
 select committee has been established to review agricultural land tenure agreement
 issues.
 , ndo-Fijians are subject to occasional harassment based on race. There have been
 o credible allegations of government involvement in such incidents, which the po-
 lice have investigated, sometimes resulting in arrests.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law protects the right of workers to form and
 join unions, elect their own representatives, publicize their views on labor matters,
 and determine their own policies, and the authorities respect these rights in prac-
 tice. However, the law permits restrictions to be applied in government employment
 and in the interests of defense, public safety, public order, public morality, or public
 health, or to protect the rights and freedoms of other persons. An estimated 55 per-
 cent of the paid work force is unionized.
 All unions must register with, but are not controlled by, the Government. The
 only central labor body is the Fiji Trade Union Congress (FTUC), which was closely
 associated with the opposition Fiji Labour Party until mid-1992. It currently takes
 a more independent political stance. The FTUC is free to associate internationally
 and does so. While certain unions remain ethnically based, both Indo-Fijians and
 ethnic Fijians hold leadership roles in the trade union movement. The FTUC par-
 ticipates, along with the employer's federation, in the Government's Tripartite Eco-
 nomic Strategies Committee.
 Strikes are legal, except in connection with union recognition disputes. The Gov-
 ernment remains involved in certifying union strike balloting, which can be an
 elaborate process given the distance between some of the island locations. A 1-day
 national labor protest occurred on April 23. The strike was initiated by the FTUC
 to protest against layoffs, a wage freeze, and the discontinuance of a checkoff system
 for union dues. Sporadic labor unrest occurred throughout the year in a number of
 workplaces.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law recognizes the right
 to organize and bargain collectively. Employers are required to recognize a union
 if more than half of the employees in a workplace have joined it. Recognition is de-
 termined by union membership rather than by an election. The Government has the
 power to order recalcitrant employers to recognize unions and has done so. Key sec-
 tors of the economy, including sugar and tourism, are heavily organized. Following
 the May 1992 return to accountable government, the Government lifted wage guide-
 lines,-inA unrestricted collective bargaining on wages is now the norm.
 Wage negotiations are still generally conducted on an individual company or en-
 terprise basis, although negotiations on an industrywide basis are on the increase.
 A government proposal to introduce such negotiations has been supported by em-
 ployers but opposed by unions.
 The law specifically prohibits antiunion discrimination. In practice the unions
 generally are successful in preventing discrimination against workers for union ac-
 tivities, but the law does not mandate that fired workers be reinstated.
 Export processing zones (EPZ's) are subject to the same law as the rest of the
 country. The FTUC, however, has been unsuccessful in obtaining collective bargain-
 ing agreements in EPZ's and claims that intimidation of workers by employers is
 widespread. The FTUC sees union recognition as the single labor/management issue
 that does not have effective legal recourse. The FTUC argues that because of alleged
 illegal and intimidatory practices in EPZ's, including threats of loss of work for
 those active in organizing workers, the FTUC is unfairly prevented from represent-
 ing workers in EPZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, including forced and bonded labor by children, and there were
 no confirmed reports that it is practiced. However, there were media reports that
 a form of bonded labor may be practiced on a remote copra plantation on an outer
 island. Other media reports indicate that forced labor conditions may exist in cer-
 tain garment manufacturing plants.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Children
 under the age of 12 may not be employed in any capacity. "Children" (under age
 15) may only be employed outside of school hours in family enterprises and not in
 the industrial sector. "Young persons" (ages 15 to 17) may be employed in certain
 occupations not involving heavy machinery and with specified hours and rest
 breaks. Enforcement by the Ministry for Labor and Industrial Relations generally
 
 
 is effective, except for family members working on family farms or businesses and
 "self-employed" homeless youths.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children and enforces this
 prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.). School is not mandatory.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. Certain
 sectors have minimum wages set by the Ministry for Labor and IndustrialRelations,
 which effectively enforces them. Minimum wage levels will generally support a bare-
 ly adequate standard of*living for a worker and family in all sectors except for the
 garment industry, in which the starting hourly wage, $0.50 (FJ$0.72) for learners
 and $0.65 (FJ$0.94) for others, is based on the assumption that workers are young
 adults or married women living at home and not supporting a household. There are
 no regulations specifying maximum hours of work for adut males. Women can do
 night work in factories and overtime but are prohibited from underground work in
 mines. Workers in certain industries, notably transportation and shipping, have
 problems with excessive hours of work. Indo-Fijians, who generally require a cash
 income to survive, are more vulnerable to pressure to work long hours than are eth-
 nic Fijians. Many ethnic Fijians can and do return to their villages rather than
 work what they consider excessive hours. Particularly in the garment industry, mi-
 grant workers, predominantly Chinese or Filipino, are increasing in number (pres-
 ently estimated at around 1,000-2,000 persons) and are a largely unregulated work
 force.
 There are workplace safety regulations, a Workmen's Compensation Act, and an
 accident compensation plan. A tribunal sets awards for workers injured on the job.
 Government enforcement of safety standards under the direction of the Labor Min-
 istry suffers from a lack of trained enforcement personnel, -but unions do a reason-
 able job of monitoring safety standards in organized workplaces. The International
 Labor Organization's (ILO) 1992 recommendations cited the need to improve work-
 ing conditions, particularly in the garment industry. The Government, supported by
 the FTUC, passed occupational health and safety legislation, which came in to effect
 in 1997. The Government continues to work with the ILO to address working condi-
 tions.
