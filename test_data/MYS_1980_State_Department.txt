 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia has a multi-ethnic and democratic society in which
 Malays dominate political affairs while ethnic Chinese and,
 to a lesser extent, ethnic Indians still play leading roles
 in the economy. The government places among its highest
 priorities avoiding a repetition of severe violence such as
 followed the May 1969 elections when several hundred persons
 were reported to have died in communal riots in Kuala Lumpur.
 The Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) has been engaged in an
 armed struggle with the government since 1948. Three
 thousand CPM guerillas are to a large degree contained in
 sanctuaries in Southern Thailand through coordinated
 Malaysian-Thai operations, although some armed insurgents
 operate in isolated units on Malaysian territory.
 The latter's efforts against the Malaysian government
 include ambush and attacks on military units as well as
 assassinations and acts of terrorism. The last serious
 upsurge was in 1975, but the government counter-insurgency
 effort continues to suffer large numbers of Malaysian police
 and military personnel killed or maimed annually.
 Human rights conditions in Malaysia have not changed
 appreciably over the past few years. An independent
 judiciary and a functioning parliamentary system safeguard
 most fundamental human rights. The Malaysian government,
 citing security reasons, including the insurgent threat
 and the possibility of renewed communal violence, maintains
 legislation which makes legal the arrest and detention
 without trial of persons suspected of subversive activity
 or for other activities that threaten general civic order.
 Amnesty International in its 1980 report claims that some
 1,000 Malaysians are detained under the Internal Security
 Act of 1960 (ISA).
 Malaysia has made major progress in economic and social
 development in the 22 years since gaining independence.
 It is one of the most prosperous developing countries in
 Asia with an average per capita gross national product (GNP)
 of $1467 in 1979.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 7 of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia prohibits
 torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment. A 1979 Amnesty International report claims that
 prisoners held under the ISA suffered serious ill treatment
 in some cases amounting to torture. Mistreatment of
 detainees is punishable; as a result of the last confirmed
 instance in 1977, several policemen were sentenced to jail
 for causing the death of a suspect during interrogation.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 As noted above, such behavior is constitutionally prohibited
 even in times of "public emergency which threatens the life
 of the nation." Article 4, Part II, of the constitution
 stipulates against any derogation of the relevant protective
 provisions.
 
 
 658
 Summary executions are not carried out and convictions
 which carry the death penalty are automatically subject
 to appeal to the federal court or the pardons board.
 Executions were carried out in 1980 for the first time
 since 1971. (The constitutionality of trials under the
 Internal Security Act regulations was reaffirmed by Act
 of Parliament in January 1979.) Seven persons, reported
 to be communist insurgents, were executed after conviction
 for possession of firearms; the eighth was a convicted
 narcotics trafficker. According to the government, there
 are now 62 persons under sentence of death with their appeal
 to federal court or the pardons board still pending.
 Of these 62 persons, 46 have been sentenced under the
 ISA, 10 for drug offenses and six for possession of
 firearms.
 Poor living conditions and inadequate medical attention
 during incarceration have been reported by former detainees
 or relatives of detainees. According to Amnesty International,
 some persons detained under the ISA are held in solitary
 confinement.
 c. Disappearances
 The government reserves the right to refuse requests for
 information on specific individuals detained under security
 legislation. There is no evidence of abduction, secret
 arrests or clandestine detention although some detainees
 have reported not knowing where they were being held during
 certain periods of confinement.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Malaysian constitution provides for the proclamation of
 a state of emergency during which individual rights can be
 limited by law. A state of emergency has existed since it
 was proclaimed in May 1969 during communal rioting.
 Legislation granting extraordinary powers to the govern-
 ment enables arrest and imprisonment without benefit of
 trial or the right of habeas corpus.
 The Malaysian government considers the CPM threat and
 continuing-communal tensions to justify the use of emergency
 powers, first embodied in regulations by the British, and
 later extended and made more comprehensive by Malaysian
 legislation. These regulations permit arrest and detention
 without open trial of persons suspected of subversive
 activity and other actions contributing to domestic
 instability. Known as the Internal Security Act (ISA)
 and the Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime)
 Ordinance, 1969 (E.O.), they provide for initial preventive
 detention for up to two years. A person detained under
 the emergency laws has no recourse to the courts but as
 soon as possible after arrest must be told the reason and
 given an opportunity to challenge the detention order.
 Under the ISA, challenges to detention must be heard within
 three months by a three-man advisory board. If the detention
 is upheld, the case is periodically reviewed beyond the
 initial two-year period. According to constitutional
 provision, the executive may refuse on national security
 grounds to.disclose facts in a particular case, including
 reasons for overruling an advisory board recommendation.
 There have been reports of instances in which bills of
 particulars have been denied to detainees. Cases under the
 ISA often follow a cycle of arrest, detention, recantation
 and release.
 
 
 659
 Amnesty International issued a report in 1979 which
 stated that more than 1,000 persons were currently detained
 under the ISA, more than 50 of them for periods longer than
 eight years. The Malaysian government reported in late 1978
 that there were 89 detainees held for more than five years.
 In October 1980, the Malaysian government released one of
 its longer term detainees, Syed Husin Ali, a member of the
 Malaysian People's Socialist Party and a sociology professor
 at the University of Malaya. He had been arrested in
 December 1974.
 The Emergency Ordinance, while enacted in the wake of the
 May 1969 racial disturbances, has been most often used
 against narcotics traffickers and other serious criminals in
 the absence of effective laws against conspiracy. The E.O.,
 which has no provision for renewal, provides that after two
 years imprisonment a period of two years of "restricted
 residence" in a remote area of the country may be ordered.
 In addition to the ISA and E.O., the government also uses
 the Emergency (Essential Powers) ordinance, 1969, designed
 to deal with terrorism and political violence, which
 provides the basis for regulations that substantially
 diminish the rights of the accused by allowing an in
 camera trial, anonymous witnesses and a presumption of
 guilt. These regulations are used in a limited number
 of security cases when the accused is brought to trial
 rather than simply detained under the ISA.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Modeled on the British judiciary, the Malaysian courts are
 generally regarded by the public and the legal community as
 committed to the rule of law and not susceptible to pressure
 from the executive. Defendants have the right to counsel
 and lawyers are able to represent dissidents without penalty
 to themselves. Most civil and criminal cases are tried
 under this judicial system and thus public trial and a fair
 hearing occur in all but a small minority of cases.
 In non-security related cases, the courts apply criminal
 law and procedures including strict rules of evidence.
 Defendants are fully aware of charges against them prior
 to trial. Persons detained for security reasons and certain
 classes of crimes, however, are held and given hearings
 under special procedures outside the ordinary court system
 which do not afford basic legal safeguards.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home is generally limited to cases involving
 security legislation. In its counter-insurgency effort
 against the CPM, the government makes extensive use of its
 powers under the Internal Security Act to enter and search
 the homes of suspects.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The Malaysian government has demonstrated consistently
 its high level of commitment to meet the economic rights
 of its people. Malaysia has made significant economic
 advances in the two decades since independence. It had
 a per capita gross national product of $1,467 in 1979.
 The multi-ethnic but Malay-dominated coalition government
 has demonstrated its concern for raising the standard of
 living of all citizens and has made the alleviation of
 rural poverty -- mostly ethnic Malay -- the primary goal
 
 
 660
 of its domestic policy. Among current programs are rural
 development initiatives, extensive government scholarships
 for children of the poor and programs to improve health
 care, housing and rural nutrition. Elementary education
 is available to all Malaysians and the literacy rate is
 about 70 percent.
 Women in Malaysia enjoy legal rights to equal employment
 opportunity, although social custom often limits those
 rights in practice. The government encourages parity
 in education, and a growing number of women are enrolled in
 institutions of higher education. Fifty percent of the
 students in the University of Malaya Law Faculty are women.
 The still small but increasing number of educated Malaysian
 women can readily find key positions in business, the
 professions, the civil service and politics.
 Malaysia has provided temporary asylum to more than 140,000
 Vietnamese refugees as well as to over 100,000 Philippine
 Muslim refugees. It has been doing so in spite of domestic
 fears of a residual refugee population which could upset the
 ethnic balance in the country.
 The government continues efforts, including investigation
 and prosecution, against corruption, which exists but is not
 pervasive.
 Malaysia has a free market economy with limited government
 intervention. There is a progressive income tax. Article
 13 of the constitution guarantees the right to private
 property ownership.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Tension.,between Malays and Chinese led to race riots in
 1969 and the suspension of parliamentary democracy for
 two years. Since then, under the Constitution (Amendment)
 Act, 1971, certain "sensitive" topics touching on ethnic
 origins or privileges may not be discussed specifically
 in public or in the parliament. The state of emergency
 legally proclaimed during the 1969 communal rioting
 continues in effect. The emergency laws are designed
 to reduce the risk of communal violence by forbidding
 any public exacerbation of racial tensions.
 Radio and television are government controlled. The media
 are constrained by the constitutional prohibitions against
 discussions of certain ethnically sensitive topics and,
 mindful of the need for annual renewal of publishing
 licenses, the press is circumspect in its treatment of
 government policies. Issues of foreign publications have
 on rare occasions been removed from circulation. There are
 no other restrictions on what may be printed, however, and
 the activities and statements of opposition political
 figures and domestic political developments are covered.
 Moreover, the press reports on violations of legal standards
 and acts as an informal ombudsman, as do the parliamentary
 opposition and the active Bar Association.
 The government practices affirmative action on an extensive
 scale in favor of the politically dominant but economically
 weaker ethnic Malays. Many non-Malays consider this policy
 discriminatory. As a result of these extensive affirmative
 action programs and policies, non-Malay opportunities for
 education, government employment, and participation in
 
 
 661
 selected economic activitles are carefully apportioned.
 This practice is based both on constitutional provisions and
 government policies. On the other hand, most Malays, as a
 result of the social, cultural and economic system prevailing
 in the country, have historically been excluded from most -
 areas of modern economic activity. The goal of government-
 supported affirmative action programs is to modify the
 earlier pattern of ethnic economic discrimination while
 pursuing a successful economic development program and
 thereby eventually providing increased opportunities for all
 Malaysians.
 While the state religion of Malaysia is Islam, and Malaysian
 Muslims are legally bound by Muslim religious laws, the
 federal government itself does not discriminate against
 practitioners of other religious faiths, which in Malaysia
 include Hinduism, Buddhism, Chinese religions and Christianity.
 Concern and controversy has been engendered by the attempts
 of Malaysian Muslim fundamentalists to extend the enforcement
 of Islamic laws against non-Muslim Malaysians and even other
 nationalities. The government has regularly declared in
 parliament in response to the fundamentalist challenge that
 it would not accede to demands for wider enforcement of
 Muslim law, pointing out that Malaysia is a multi-religious
 country. The judiciary has also spoken Out against replacing
 common law with Islamic law.
 The Malaysian constitution guarantees the right to freedom
 of peaceable assembly end association, although the consti-
 tution also grants the government extensive powers to limit
 those rights by legislation, in the interests of security
 and public order. In practice, the Societies Act and trade
 union legislation require that most organizations be
 registered with the government and thus subject to close
 control. In the wake of the communal disturbances of 1969
 the government passed laws greatly limiting the right to
 public assembly by large groups.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The government permits free domestic and foreign travel,
 including emigration. Persons wishing to travel abroad
 must obtain passports, which have been denied in a few
 cases on security grounds. The government also restricts
 travel to China by ethnic Chinese citizens. Travel between
 Peninsular Malaysia and the Borneo States of Sabah and
 Sarawak is constitutionally subject to control by the
 state governments as the result of conditions imposed by
 the Sabah and Sarawak governments at the time of their
 accession to the Federation. The autonomous Sabah and
 Sarawak governments have on several occasions arbitrarily
 denied entry to opposition politicians and journalists
 from Peninsular Malaysia and abroad. Malaysian citizens
 are not barred from returning to the country after residence
 abroad, although certain acts performed may lead to loss of
 citizenship.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Malaysia is a parliamentary democracy based on the British
 model, with a prime minister and cabinet responsible to
 parliament. The Head of State is a constitutional monarch
 elected for a five-year term by the sultans of those
 Malaysian states which are sultanates (nine of thirteen)
 from among their own members. The bicameral parliament
 consists of a senate (with both appointed and elected
 
 
 662
 members) and an elected house of representatives, where a
 small but vocal opposition criticizes the government
 regularly. Legislative power is further divided between
 federal and state legislatures. State executive admini-
 strations attend to matters of local concern. Elections on
 the basis of universal suffrage are held at no more than
 five-year intervals as specified by the constitution.
 The last national parliamentary elections were held in
 July 1978, when the ruling National Front coalition won
 131 of 154 seats. In parliamentary and state assembly
 elections, the National Front takes full advantage of its
 incumbency, and in recent elections, it has prohibited
 public rallies, a factor which inhibits the opposition.
 Even the opposition concedes, however, that votes are cast
 freely and secretly and are recorded accurately. In the
 national elections, the success of one major opposition
 party (the Democratic Action Party), which doubled its
 representation from 8 to 16 seats, tends to support this
 belief. Other opposition parties are the Islamic Party
 and the People's Socialist Party.
 The position of women in Malaysian society is relatively
 unrestricted within the constraints of Islam and other
 Eastern cultures in the country. Women have full voting
 rights. Malaysia now has two women as full cabinet ministers:
 Welfare Services, appointed in 1978, and Public Enterprises,
 appointed in 1980.
 The Malaysian government permits some trade union activity
 although labor legislation circumscribes union behavior.
 Some of these laws concerning collective bargaining (and the
 ISA itself) have brought Malaysia's implementation of
 International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions on
 collective bargaining and coerced labor under ILO scrutiny.
 In 1979, the ILO noted that the national Joint Labor
 Advisory Council now had before it worker and employer
 proposals for amendment of the industrial relations act
 of 1967 to broaden the scope of collective bargaining.
 There are some 284 trade unions with a total of about
 520,000 members. Most of the unions are members of the
 Malaysian Trade Union Congress, an active member of the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Except
 when vital public services are involved, the freedom to
 strike exists and is used. The Malaysian government in
 1980 introduced amendments to the labor relations statutes
 which were interpreted as "anti-union" provisions. After a
 heated public debate and pressure from the MTUC, the
 ministry of labor relented and withdrew most of the
 objectionable changes. Most union leaders were satisfied
 with the resultant law.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigations of
 Alleged violations of Human Rights
 In 1979 the Malaysian Bar Council issued a report which
 was critical of practices regarding detention under the
 ISA. The report was allowed to circulate freely and the
 prime minister addressed it in a speech to the Bar Council.
 In 1978 the University of Malaya's law faculty added a
 course on human rights in its curriculum.
 The government's position on the 1979 Amnesty International
 report was that the report failed to acknowledge fully the
 threats with which the government must deal firmly.
 The Malaysian government classified the 1979 report as
 
 
 663
 a subversive publication under the ISA, thereby prohibiting
 possession or dissemination of the report. The government
 continues to maintain that extraordinary measures, with
 appropriate legal safeguards to prevent abuses of the
 ISA, are necessary to deal with continuing subversive
 efforts, the specter of multi-ethnic strife and the
 potential for disruption by or exploitation of Islamic
 extremist elements such as the small group of Muslim
 fanatics who attacked a police station in October 1980,
 wounding and maiming several people.
 There were no known outside investigations of the general
 human rights situation in Malaysia during 1980.
