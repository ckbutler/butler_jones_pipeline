 LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic is an authoritarian, one-party state ruled
 by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP). Although the 1991 Constit!tion
 outlines a system composed of executive, legislative, and judicial branches, in prac-
 tice the LPRP continued to influence governance and the choice of leaders thrdugh
 its constitutional "leading role" at alw levels. The 99-member National Assenrby,
 elected in December 1997 under a system of universal suffage, selected the Presi-
 dent and Prime Minister in Februa ry t ica    is subject to executive influehce.
 The Ministry of Interior (MOt) maintains internal security but now shares the
 function of state control with party and mass front organizations. The control func-
 tion has shifted from being the sole responsibility of the MOI and the olice to a
 shared role with the Party. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for the
 monitoring and oversight of foreigners working in Laos. The MOI includes local po-
 lice, security police (including border police), communication police, and other ared
 
 
 972
 police units. The armed forces are responsible for external security, but also have
 some domestic security responsibilities that include counter-terrorism and counter-
 insurgency activities. Civilian authorities generally maintain effective control over
 the security forces. There continue to be credible reports that some members of the
 security forces occasionally committed human rights abuses.
 Laos is an extremely poor country. After the LPRP came to power in 1975, 10 per-
 cent of the population (at least 360,000 persons) fled the country to escape the Gov-
 ernment's harsh political and economic policies. The economy is principally agricul-
 tural; 85 percent of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture. Per capita
 Gross National Product is estimated at $300 per year. Since 1986 the Government
 largely has abandoned its Socialist economic policies.. Economic reforms have moved
 the country from a moribund, centrally-planned system to a market-oriented econ-
 omy open to foreign investment with a growing legal framework, including laws to
 protect property rights.
 The Government's human rights record deteriorated in the first half of the year,
 and serious problems remain. Citizens do not have the right to change their govern-
 ment. Prison conditions remain harsh, and police used arbitrary arrest and deten-
 tion. Lengthy pretrial detention is a problem. The judiciary is subject to executive
 influence, suffers from corruption, and does not ensure citizens due process. The
 Government infringed on citizens' privacy rights. The Government restricts freedom
 of speech, assembly, and association. The Government closely monitors the press.
 The Government restricts freedom of religion and arrested and detained at least 40
 Christians and animists. Some societal discrimination against women and minori-
 ties persists. The Government restricts some worker rights. However, it permitted
 increased access to the foreign press and the Internet, and actively supported a pol-
 icy of encouraging greater rights for women and minorities. There was increased
 participation by women in government. The Government has begun to focus on the
 problem of trafficking in women and children.
 An organized Hmong insurgent group was responsible for the killing of 16 civil-
 ians in three incidents in Vientiane and Xieng Rhouang provinces. These incidents
 appeared to be acts of deliberate terror against those not supporting resistance to
 the Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated or other extrajudicial killings by gov.ernment officials during the year.
 However, one political prisoner imprisoned under harsh conditions died in custody
 due to a chronic disease; the Government had ignored pleas that he be moved to
 a prison with better medical facilities (see Section 1.c.). Isolated reports of deaths
 at the hands of security forces in remote areas, usually in connection with personal
 disputes and the personal abuse of authority, could not be substantiated.
 Attacks by armed bands on official and civilian travelers continued in the central
 and north central regions. The attacks apparently involved a mixture of factors in-
 cluding insurgency, clan rivalry, robbery, and reaction to encroaching development.
 The Government remained concerned about the safety of foreigners in remote areas,
 although there were no attacks on foreigners during the year. In January a Hmong
 resistance group carried out a terrorist attack on an army truck carrying civilians
 in Vientiane province, near the Saysomboun Special Zone, killing nine persons, in-
 cluding five Hmong civilians. In October a Hmong resistance force attacked the dis-
 trict capital of Phaxay, Xieng Khouang province, killed two civilians and a militia-
 man, looted the village, and burned down 44 houses. In November Hmong resist-
 ance forces attacked a truck on the road from Phaxay and killed nine persons.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution and the Penal Code prohibit torture, and the Government gen-
 erally respected these provisions in practice; however, on occasion, members of the
 security forces subjected detainees to abusive treatment. For example, in March Lao
 authorities, some wearing police uniforms, detained a foreign citizen and three fam-
 ily members in an unofficial detention center for 4 days. The Government did not
 file charges against the four persons. The officials reportedly kept the four persons
 in locked, windowless rooms and subjected them to long and arduous interrogation
 before releasing them. The Government offered no explanation for this treatment.
 There is no evidence to suggest that the Government is investigating the incident
 seriously.
 The Government chose not to address numerous reports that were made by
 groups outside the country of massive human rights abuses by government authori-
 
 
 973
 ties. Most of these reports could not be confirmed through independent sources.
 However, there continue to be credible reports that, on occasion some members of
 the security forces committed human rights abuses, including arbitrary detention
 and intimidation. There were unconfirmed reports that some security forces were re-
 sponsible for beatings.
 Prison conditions generally are harsh. Food rations are minimal, and most pris-
 oners rely on their families for their subsistence. The Government discriminates in
 its treatment of prisoners, restricting the family visits of some and prohibiting visits
 to a few. There are unsubstantiated reports that a few jails place prisoners in wood-
 en stocks for extended periods. Medical facilities range from poor to nonexistent.
 Unlike the case in 1997, there were no reports that inmates sometimes resorted to
 bribing guards to obtain food and medicines. Prison conditions for women are simi-
 lar to those for men. In February political prisoner Thongsouk Sasanghi died of com-
 plications from diabetes while in official custody under harsh conditions in a remote
 prison. His death led several international human rights groups to note their long-
 standing requests to the Government to move him and two other political prisoners
 to a prison with better conditions, including more modern medical facilities. At
 year's end, the Government continued to ignore these humanitarian pleas.
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of prison conditions. In
 September the Government pardoned 144 prisoners on humanitarian grounds.
 d.Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for arrest warrants
 issued by the prosecutor, and the Constitution provides for due process procedures;
 however, in practice, the Government does not respect these provisions fully. Police
 exercise wide latitude in making arrests, relying on exceptions to the requirement
 for arrest warrants for those in the act of committing a crime or for "urgenV' cases.
 Length of detention without pretrial hearing or charges is unpredictable, and access
 to family or a lawyer is not assured. There is a functioning bail system, but its im-
 plementation is arbitrary. A statute of limitations applies to most crimes. Alleged
 violations of security laws have led to lengthy pretrial detentions without charge
 and minimal due process protection of those detained. There were no reports of pre-
 trial detention for expressions of hostility to the regime.
 On January 30, authorities without warrants arrested 44 persons allegedly while
 in the act of committing a crime: Gathering in a group to create social turmoil (see
 Section 2.d.).
 In March authorities detained members of a foreign family without charge for 4
 da  (see Section 1.c.).
 Tn June 1997, 13 members of a group of returnees were detained without charges,
 with 10 being released in December after they were held in excess of the 1-year
 limit for detention while under investigation (see Section 2.d.).
 Government authorities arrested and detain at least 40 religious believers and
 their spiritual leaders, at times holding them in custody for months (see Section
 2.c.).
 Three former government officials detained in 1990 for advocating a multiparty
 system and criticizing restrictions on political liberties were not tried until 1992.
 That same year, the court finally tried and handed down life sentences to three men
 detained since 1975 for crimes allegedly committed during their tenure as officials
 under the previous regime (see Section i.e.).
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the independence
 of the judiciary; however, senior government and party officials wield influence over
 the courts, although likely to a lesser degree than in the past. Some corrupt mem-
 bers of the judiciary appear to act with impunity. The National Assembly Standing
 Committee appoints judges; the executive had appointed the Standing Committee
 through 1998.
 The Lao People's Courts have three levels: District; municipal and provincial; and
 a Supreme Court. Decisions of both the lower courts and separate military courts
 are subject to review by the Supreme Court.
 The Constitution provides for open trials in which defendants have the right to
 defend themselves with the assistance of a lawyer. The Constitution requires au-
 thorities to inform persons of their rights. The law states that defendants may have
 anybody represent them in preparing a written case and accompanying them at
 their trial and-only the defendant may present oral arguments at a criminal trial;
 however due to lack of funds, most defendants do not have lawyers. Defendants
 enjoy a presumption of innocence; however, in practice, lawyers face severe restric-
 tions in criminal cases. Most trials are little more than direct examinations of the
 accused; however, apparently judges no longer hold preconceived views of a trial's
 outcome. Trials for alleged violations of some security laws and trials that involve
 state secrets, children under the age of 16, or certain types of family law are closed.
 
 
 974
 
 There are five known political prisoners. Three prisoners from the pre-1975 re-
 gime are serving life sentences after their trials that did not appear to be conducted
 according to international standards. Two former government officials detained in
 1990 for advocating a multiparty system and criticizing restrictions on political lib-
 erties were not tried until 1992; they are serving 14-year sentences based on their
 1992 convictions (see Section l.a.).
 Because some political prisoners may have been arrested, tried, and convicted
 under security laws that prevent public court trials, there is no reliable method to
 ascertain accurately their total number. There have been no reports of other politi-
 cal prisoners in the last few years.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government imposes some limits on these rights. Security laws allow the Govern-
 ment to monitor individuals' private communications and movements; however, the
 Government continued to relax many elements of state control during the year, and
 the use of these practices appears to be on the decline. The spectrum of personal
 freedoms accorded to citizens has expanded over the past few years in tandem with
 liberalization of the economy.
 The Constitution prohibits unlawfil searches and seizures; however, police at
 times disregarded constitutional provisions to safeguard citizens' privacy, especially
 in rural areas. Security police may not authorize their own searches; they must
 have approval from a prosecutor or court. However, in practice they did not always
 obtain prior approval. The Penal Code generally protects privacy, including mail,
 telephone, and electronic correspondence.
 Political groups other than mass front organizations approved by the LPRP are
 forbidden. Ministry of Interior forces no longer routinely monitor citizens' activities;
 in their place, a loose militia has responsibility for maintaining public order and re-
 porting "bad elements" to the police. Militia usually concern themselves more with
 street crime and instances of moral turpitude than with political activism. A spo-
 radically active system of neighborhood and workplace committees play a similar
 monitoring role on an informal and irregular basis.
 The Government does not permit the public sale of some leading foreign maga-
 zines and newspapers. However, minimal restrictions on publications mailed from
 overseas are loosely enforced (see Section 2.a.).
 The Government allows citizens to marry foreigners, but only with its prior ap-
 proval. Although 'the Government routinely grants permission, the process is bur-
 densome. Marriages to foreigners without government approval may be annulled,
 with both parties subject to fine.
 The Government displaced internally hundreds of persons during the year, mainly
 as a result of organized infrastructure development programs. The Government pro-
 vides compensation to displaced persons in the form of land and household supplies.
 In May the Government announced that it no longer supported the single policy of
 resettlement to solve the problem of highland "slash-and-burn" methods that de-
 stroyed forest areas and resulted in habitat damage. By year's end, nongovern-
 mental organizations (NGO's) working in this area noted more flexibility by the
 Government toward the aisposition of infrastructure-related and other government-
 planned resettlements. However, some local administrators forced highlander
 groups to resettle in lowland areas to control their use of farming methods that de-
 stroy forest areas in the pursuit of increased food security.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press; however, the Government severely restricts political speech and
 writing in practice. The Government also prohibits most criticism that it deems
 harmful to its reputation. The Penal Code forbids slandering the State, distorting
 party or state policies, inciting disorder, or propagating information or opinions that
 weaken the State. The Government has shown more tolerance of general criticisms
 aimed at good governance or improved public service, and citizens who lodge legiti-
 mate complaints with government departments generally do not suffer reprisals. A
 greater variety of critical articles and broadcasts in the media reflects this attitude.
 All print and electronic media are state-owned and controlled. Local news in all
 media reflects government policy, and only rarely hints at differences of opinion.
 Television talk shows and opinion articles refer only to several differences in admin-
 istrative approach. Translations of foreign press reports generally are without bias,
 and access to Thai press, radio, and television is unhindered. Other Asian and many
 Western newspapers and magazines are available through private outlets that have
 government permission to sell them.
 Authorities also prohibited the dissemination of materials deemed to be indecent,
 to undermine the national culture, or to be politically sensitive. Films and music
 
 
 975
 recordings produced in government studios must be submitted for official censor-
 ship. However, in practice, most foreign media are easily available. Government en-
 forcement of restrictions on nightclub entertainment, which had been tightened in
 1997, relaxed during the year.
 Citizens have 24-hour access to Cable News Network and the British Broadcast-
 ing Corporation, among other international stations accessible via television satellite
 receiving dish. The Government requires registration of satellite dishes and a one-
 time licensing fee for their use, largely as a revenue-generating scheme, but other-
 wise makes no effort to restrict their use.
 Foreign journalists must apply for special visas; increasingly the Government al-
 lows foreign journalists wider access to sources and permits them freer domestic
 travel.
 The Constitution provides for academic freedom; however, the Government re-
 stricts it, although it has relaxed its restrictions in certain areas. Lao and Western
 academic professionals conducting research in Laos may be subject to restrictions
 on travel and access to information and Penal Code restrictions on publication. As
 the sole employer of virtually all academic professionals, the Government exercises
 some control over their ability to travel on research or study grants. However, the
 Government, which once limited foreign travel by professors, actively seeks out
 these opportunities worldwide and approves virtually all such proposals. On rare oc-
 casions, the Government did not permit government employees who were not party
 members to accept certain research or study grants, apparently because they had
 chosen not to join the LPRP.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, but the Government continues to restrict this right in practice.
 The Penal Code prohibits participation in an organization for the purpose of dem-
 onstrations, protest marches, or other acts that cause turmoil or social instability.
 Such acts are punishable by a prison term of from I to 5 years.
 In February a group of 150 Hmong farmers from Pha Thao village assembled in
 Vientiane to protest unresolved land problems without government reprisal. Central
 government officials agreed to appoint a committee to review the problems; the com-
 mittee resolved most of the farmers' grievances by year's end. This demonstration
 was one of the largest since 1975.
 On January 30, authorities arrested 44 persons gathered at a Christian Bible
 study session in a private home in Phonekheng Village, Vientiane Municipality. It
 charged 13 of those arrested with participating in a group assembly for the purpose
 of creating social turmoil, asked the five foreigners in the group to leave the coun-
 try, and released 26 other persons. The 13 Christians were tried and convicted in
 March for violating the Penal Code, and three were released for time served. The
 Vientiane Municipal Court record indicates that the judge considered one statement
 made by a member of the group to be critical of the Government. The Government
 also stated in court and elsewhere that the group was using religion as a guise for
 its real purpose: Creating social turmoil. At year's end, eight of the Christians re-
 mained in jail, with sentences of from 2 to two-and-one-half years (see Section 2.c.).
 Although the Constitution provides citizens with the right to organize and join as-
 sociations, the Government restricts this right in practice. The Government reg-
 isters and controls all associations and prohibits associations that criticize it. Al-
 though the Government restricts many types of formal professional and social asso-
 ciations, in practice, informal nonpolitical groups can meet without hindrance. Indi-
 viduals who had formed the Foundation for Promoting Education, a private vol-
 untary organization in Vientiane Municipality in 1997, were active during the year
 and awarded prizes for educational achievement and scholarships to needy students.
 The group is supported by private contributions and operates independently under
 its own charter, but reports to the Ministry of Education. In April the Lao Buddhist
 Fellowship Association, which reports to the National Front, formed the Buddhist
 Promotion Foundation.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion; how-
 ever, in practice the Government restricts freedom it. The Constitution prohibits "all
 acts of creating division of religion or creating division among the people." The Party
 and Government appear to interpret this section narrowly, thus inhibiting religious
 practice by all persons, including the Buddhist majority and a large population of
 animists. Although official pronouncements accepted the existence of religion, they
 emphasized its potential to divide, distract, or destabilize.
 The Constitution notes that the state "mobilizes and encourages" monks, novices,
 and priests of other religions to participate in activities "beneficial to the nation and
 the people." The LPRP Lao National Front for Reconstruction is responsible for
 overseeing all religions.
 
 
 The Government's tolerance of religion varied by region. In general central gov-
 ernment authorities appeared unable to control or mitigate harsh measures that
 were taken by local or provincial authorities against the practices of members of mi-
 nority religious denominations. Although there was almost complete freedom to wor-
 ship among unregistered groups in a few areas, particularly in the largest cities,
 government authorities in many regions allowed properly registered religious groups
 to practice their faith only under circumscribed conditions. In other areas, such as
 Luang Prabang, Bokeo, and Attapeu, the authorities arrested and detained religious
 believers and their spiritual leaders without charges. In more isolated cases, provin-
 cial authorities instructed their officials to monitor and arrest persons who pro-
 fessed belief in Christianity, Islam, or the Baha'i faith. For example sources re-
 ported that, in Luang Prabang province, the authorities forced some Christians to
 sign renunciations of their faith. In a southern province,police refused to release
 a Lao Christian who was arrested for proselytizing until the detainee had pledged
 not to proselytize again. Although authorities tolerate diverse religious practices in
 the southern Laos panhandle, a pattern of petty local harassment persists. Converts
 must pass a gauntlet of harsh government interviews. Groups of coreligionists seek-
 ing to assemble in a new location are thwarted in attempts to meet, practice, or cel-
 ebrate major religious festivals.
 In March the Vientiane municipal court convicted 13 Christians and sentenced
 them to prison terms of from 2 months to 3 years for exercising their rights of
 peaceful assembly and free speech in a Bible study session. Police in January ini-
 tially arrested 44 persons for simply assembling without permission in an unregis-
 tered meeting place; they eventually released 31 persons. The prosecutor later con-
 victed the remaining 13 persons of the more serious criminal code violation of gath-
 ering in an assembly to create social turmoil (see Section 2.b.). By year's end, there
 was some small improvement. Authorities made fewer arrests related to religious
 activities, and resolved a few longstanding cases. They also released at least nine
 detainees.
 The Catholic Church is unable to operate effectively in the highlands and much
 of the north. It has, however, an established presence in five of the most populous
 central and southern provinces, where Catholics are able to worship openly. There
 are three bishops in Vientiane, Thakhek, and Pakse. The status of the Catholic
 Church in Luang Prabang center remains in doubt; there appears to be a congrega-
 tion there but, due to local obstructionism, worship services may not always be con-
 ducted readily.
 Over 100 Protestant congregations conduct services throughout the country. The
 Lao National Front has recognized two Protestant- groups, the Lao Evangelical
 Church, the umbrella Protestant church, and the Seventh Day Adventist Church.
 The Front strongly encourages all other Protestant groups to become a part of the
 Lao Evangelical Church. The Government has granted permission to four Protestant
 congregations from the approved denominations to have church buildings in the
 Vientiane area.
 The Party controls the Buddhist clergy (Sangha) in an attempt to direct national
 culture. After 1975 the Government attempted to "reform" Buddhism and ceased to
 consider it the state religion, causing thousands of monks to flee abroad, where most
 still remain. The Government has only one semireligious holiday-Boun That
 Luang-also a major political and cultural celebration. However, it recognizes the
 popularity and cultural significance of Buddhist festivals, and many senior officials
 openly attend them. Buddhist clergy are featured prominently at important state
 and party functions. The Lao National Front directs the Lao Buddhist Fellowship
 Association,, which adopted a new Charter in April. The Front continues to require
 monks to study Marxism-Leninism, to attend certain party meetings, and to com-
 bine with their teachings of Buddhism the party-state policies. In recent years, some
 individual temples have been able to receive support from Theraveda Buddhist tem-
 ples abroad, to expand the training of monks, and to focus more on traditional
 teachings.
 There remains a continuing suspicion on the part of authorities toward some
 parts of the Lao religious community other than Buddhism, including some Chris-
 tian groups, in partbecause they do not share a similar high degree of direction
 and incorporation into the government structure. Authorities especially appear to
 suspect those religious groups that gain support from foreign sources, aggressively
 proselytize among the poor or uneducated, or give targeted assistance to converts.
 The Government permits major religious festivals of all established congregations
 without hindrance. Two mosques and a Baha'i center operate openly in Vientiane.
 The Government prohibits foreigners from proselytizing, although it permits for-
 eign nongovernmental organizations with religious affiliations to work in the coun-
 try. Although there is no prohibition against proselytizing by citizens, there has
 
 
 been increased local government investigation and harassment of citizens who do so
 under the constitutional provision against creating division of religion. The Govern-
 ment restricts the import of foreign religious texts and artifacts. The Government
 requires its permission for formal links with coreligionists in other countries; how-
 ever, in practice, the line between formal and informal links is blurred, and rela-
 tions generally are established without much difficulty.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights; however, the Government
 restricted some of these rights in practice. Citizens who travel across provincial bor-
 ders are required to report to authorities upon their departure and arrival. Citizens
 who seek to travel abroad are required to apply for an exit visa; however, the Gov-
 ernment grants these routinely. Foreigners are restricted from traveling to certain
 areas, such as Saysomboun Special Zone, an administrative area operated by the
 military forces, for safety and security reasons.
 Hmong insurgent group attacks on civilians in vehicles traveling in the north-cen-
 tral areas impede travel, especially along parts of Route 13, Route 7, and Route 1.
 Bandits operate in the same area (see Section l.a.). The Government attempts to
 ensure safety on these roads.
 Citizens are free to emigrate; exit visas are required, and the Government grants
 these routinely.
 More than 27,800 citizens who sought refugee status in Thailand, China, and
 other countries have returned to Laos during the last decade for permanent resettle-
 ment under monitoring by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 There were no new returnees during the year. The Government cooperates with the
 UNHCR in assisting the groups' reintegration into society. These returnees gen-
 erally have been treated the same as other citizens,
 The Constitution provides for asylum and the protection of stateless persons
 under the law, which has included first asylum. There were no known cases during
 the year of asylum seekers being returned to a country where they feared persecu-
 tion.
 The Government has a longstanding policy of welcoming back virtually all those
 among the 10 percent of the population who fled after the change in government
 in 1975. Many have visited relatives, some have stayed and gained foreign resident
 status, and some have reclaimed Lao citizenship successfully. A small group tried
 in absentia in 1975 for antigovernment activities does not have the right of return.
 The Government announced in November that it would accept the return of asylum
 seekers now in Thailand only on a voluntary basis. The Government has insisted
 on reviewing the backgrounds of any person being repatriated formally.
 One group of 177 refugee returnees who had entered Laos on an irregular basis
 in 1997 rather than wait for organized repatriation have not been allowed to change
 their residence and are for the time being restricted to movement within 1 day's
 journey of their settlement inside Houaphan province. At year's end, eight men
 among the group remained in detention without charges.
 Some refugee returnees carry identification cards with distinctive markings, os-
 tensibly for use by authorities. These distinctive identification cards tend to rein-
 force a pattern of societal discrimination against them.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the ability to change their government The Constitution le-
 gitimizes only a single party, the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, which must ap-
 prove all candidates for local and national elections. Candidates need not be LPRP
 members.
 The Constitution provides for a 99-member National Assembly elected every 5
 years in open, multiple-candidate, fairly tabulated elections, with voting by secret
 ballot and universal adult suffrage. The National Assembly chooses a standing com-
 mittee and, upon the committee's recommendation, elects or removes the President
 and Vice President. The standing committee also has powers over elections (includ-
 ing approval of candidates), supervision of administrative and judicial organizations,
 and the sole power to recommend presidential decrees. Activities of the standing
 committee are not fully transparent.
 The National Assembly, upon the President's recommendation, elects the Prime
 Minister and ministers of the Government. The Government carried out this con-
 stitutional process in a transparent manner in February, following National Assem-
 bly elections in December 1997. In that election, 159 candidates competed for 99
 seats. Four candidates had not been nominated by the LPRP; one winning can-
 didate, among these four, was not an LPRP or front organization member.
 
 
 The National Assembly may consider and amend draft legislation, but may not
 propose new laws. The Constitution gives the right to submit draft legislation to the
 National Assembly standing committee and the ruling executive structure.
 Women increased their representation in the National Assembly in 1997 from 9
 percent to 20 percent, as 20 of the 27 female candidates won seats. Four members
 of the 49-member LPRP Central Committee are women, 2 of whom are also mem-
 bers of the 7-member Standing Committee in the National Assembly. There are no
 women in the Politburo or the Council of Ministers.
 The number of ethnic minority members in the-National Assembly-9 Lao Soung
 (highland tribes) and 26 Lao Theung (mid-slope dwelling tribes)-matches their pro-
 portions in the general population. Men of lowland Lao origin dominate the upper
 echelons of the Party and the Government. Nonetheless, the President, two Deputy
 Prime Ministers, three ministers, and 35 members of the National Assembly are be-
 lieved to be members of ethnic minority groups.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no domestic nongovernmental human rights organizations, and the
 Government does not have a formal procedure for registration. Any organization
 wishing to investigate and publicly criticize the Government's human rights policies
 would face serious obstacles if it were permitted to operate at all. The Government
 cooperates on an uneven basis with international human rights organizations.
 A human rights unit in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Department of Inter-
 national Treaties and Legal Affairs has responsibility for inquiry into allegations of
 human rights violations. This government unit occasionally responds to inquiries re-
 garding individual cases and makes recommendations regarding human rights ini-
 tiatives such as training of government officials.
 A government committee formed in June, chaired by a Deputy Prime Minister and
 representing five ministries, organized a range of public activities to celebrate the
 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
 In September at the invitation of the Government, a special U.N. Rapporteur on
 trafficking in children visited various locations and made inquiries into possible in-
 cidents of child prostitution and child pornography.
 The Government maintains contacts with the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC), and government officials received ICRC training on human rights law
 in October. The Government has permitted U.N. human rights observers to monitor
 the treatment of returning refugees in all parts of the country without interference.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law for all citizens with-
 out regard to sex, social status, education, faith, or ethnicity. Children are similarly
 protected. Although the Government took action when cases of discrimination came
 to the attention of high-level officials, the legal mechanism whereby a citizen may
 bring charges of discrimination against an individual or organization is neither
 widely developed nor widely understood among the general population.
 Women.-There are reports that domestic violence against women occurs, al-
 though it is not widespread. Sexual harassment and rape are reportedly rare. In
 cases of rape that are tried in court, defendants generally are convicted.
 The Government only recently has focused on the trafficking of women and chil-
 dren across its borders. Although there are no reliable data available on the scope
 and severity of the problem, there are indications that the numbers are consider-
 able. The Government has increased monitoring and educational programs provided
 by the Lao Women's Union and the Youth Union, both party-sanctioned organiza-
 tions, designed to educate girls and young women about the schemes of recruiters
 for brothels and sweatshops in Thailand and elsewhere. In the past, the Govern-
 ment has prosecuted some persons for involvement in such recruiting activities.
 During the year, law enforcement agencies conducted raids of entertainment estab-
 lishments accused of fostering prostitution.
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for women, and the Lao Women's
 Union operates nationally to promote the position of women in society. In July the
 Women's Union began a special program on gender and the law in an effort to both
 broaden public understanding of human rights and provide legal counseling for
 women in distress. Discrimination against women is not generalized; however, vary-
 ing degrees of traditional culturally based discrimination persist, with greater dis-
 crimination practiced among some hill tribes. Many women occupy -responsible posi-
 tions in the civil service and private business, and in urban areas their incomes are
 
 
 often higher than those of men. The Family Code prohibits legal discrimination in
 marriage and inheritance.
 The Government has increased support for the position of women in society in de-
 velopment programs, some of which are designed to increase the participation of
 women in the political system.
 Children.-Government resources are inadequate to provide fully for children's
 basic health and educational needs. Education is compulsory through the fifth
 grade, but children from rural areas and poor urban families rarely comply with this
 requirement. Violence against children is prohibited by law, and subject to stiff pun-
 ishments. Reports of the physical abuse of children are rare.
 The Government is increasingly concerned about Lao children being lured for sex-
 ual exploitation and slave labor in other countries and has established a National
 Commission on Mothers and Children, chaired by the Foreign Minister (see Section
 6.c.). The Commission, working with the Lao Women's Union, Youth Union, Justice
 Ministry, and Labor Ministry, has conducted workshops around the country de-
 signed to make parents and teenagers aware of the dangers. At the Government's
 invitation, a special U.N. Rapporteur on Trafficking in Children visited in Septem-
 ber (see Section 4).
 People With Disabilities.-With donor assistance, the Government is implement-
 ing limited programs for the disabled, especially amputees. The law does not man-
 date accessibility to buildings or government services for disabled persons.
 Religious Minorities.-The enhanced status given to Buddhism       in Luang
 Prabang-famed for its centuries-old Buddhist tradition and numerous temples-ap-
 parently led some local officials there to act more harshly toward minority religious
 sects, particularly toward Christian and Baha'i, than in other areas of the country
 (see Section 2.c.).
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution provides for equal rights
 for citizens of all minorities, and there is no legal discrimination against them. How-
 ever, societal discrimination persists.
 Approximately half the population is ethnic Lao, also called "lowland Lao." Most
 of the remainder is a mosaic of diverse upland hill tribes whose members, if born
 in Laos, are Lao citizens. There are also ethnic Vietnamese and Chinese minorities,
 particularly in the towns. There is a small community of South Asian origin. The
 implementation in 1994 of the 1990 Law on Nationality provided a means for Viet-
 namese and Chinese minorities to regularize their Lao citizenship. The Government
 encourages the preservation of minority cultures and traditions; however, due to re-
 mote location and difficult access, minority tribes have little voice in government de-
 cisions affecting their lands and the allocation of natural resources.
 The Hmong are one of the largest and most prominent highland minority groups.
 Societal discrimination against the Hmong continues, although there are a number
 of Hmong officials in the senior ranks of the Government. In recent years, the Gov-
 ernment has focused assistance projects in Hmong areas in order to overcome dis-
 parities in income along regional and ethnic lines. Some international observers
 claim that governmental policies aimed at assimilating the Hmong into larger soci-
 ety-such as regional boarding schools-are not respectful of Hmong native culture;
 others see this approach as an avenue out of centuries of poverty.
 A group of 150 Hmong farmers assembled in Vientiane in February to petition
 the Government regarding land problems (see Section 2.b.).
 During the year, the Government continued to assist citizens, largely members of
 ethnic minorities, who returned to Laos after having fled in 1975. Central and local
 government officials worked with organizations such as the UNHCR to provide land
 and a sustainable level of economic security. Repatriated Hmong generally face no
 greater discrimination than those Hmong who remained. Two U.N. observers who
 monitored repatriation efforts reported no serious incidents of abuse or discrimina-
 tion during the year.
 Under the Constitution, aliens and stateless foreign citizens-are protected by "pro-
 visions of the laws," but do not in fact enjoy rights provided for by the Constitution.
 During the year, there were isolated cases of persons of Lao ethnic background who,
 as citizens of other nations suffered discrimination when arrested or detained, and
 were denied due process, apparently on the basis of their Lao ethnic background.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the 1990 Labor Code and a 1995 prime min-
 isterial decree, labor unions can be formed in private enterprises as long as they
 operate within the framework of the officially sanctioned Federation of Lao Trade
 Unions (FLTU), which in turn is controlled by the LPRP. Most of the FLTU's 78,000
 members work in the public sector, overwhelmingly as public servants.

 The State employs the majority of salaried workers, although this situation is
 changing as the Government reduces the number of its employees and privatizes
 state enterprises, and as foreign investors open new factories and businesses. Sub-
 sistence farmers comprise an estimated 85 percent of the work force.
 Strikes are not prohibited by law, but the Government's ban on subversive activi-
 ties or destabilizing demonstrations makes a strike unlikely (see Section 2.b.), and
 none were reported during the year. However, the Labor Code does not prevent tem-
 porary work stoppages, and a few such incidents involving small groups of workers
 occurred.
 With advice from the International Labor Organization (ILO), including a foreign
 expert provided by the ILO to work with the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare,
 the Government has revised the Labor Code in an effort to clarify the rights and
 obligations of workers and employers.
 The FLTU is free to engage in contacts with foreign labor organizations, which
 during the year included the ASEAN Trade Union and the Asia-Pacific American
 Labor Alliance. The FLTU is a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions
 (WFTU).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no right to organize
 and bargain collectively. The Labor Code stipulates that disputes be resolved
 through workplace committees composed of employers, representatives 6f the local
 labor union, and representatives of the FLTU, with final authority residing in the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare. Labor disputes are infrequent. The Govern-
 ment set's wages and salaries for government employees, while management sets
 wages and salaries for private business employees.
 The Labor Code stipulates that employers may not fire employees for conducting
 trade union activities, for lodging complaints against employers about labor law im-
 plementation, or -for cooperating with officials on labor law implementation and
 labor disputes. Workplace committees are one mechanism used for resolving com-
 plaints.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 labor except in time of war or national disaster, when the State may conscript labor-
 ers. The code also applies to children under age 15, and generally is enforced effec-
 tively. However, reports that children are being lured into other countries for sexual
 exploitation and slave labor continued, although there were fewer such reports than
 in 1997 (see Section 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Under the
 Labor Code, children under the age of 15 may not be recruited for employment.
 However, many children help their families on farms or in shops. The Labor Code
 accordingly provides that children may work for their families, provided that such
 children are not engaged in dangerous or difficult work. Such employment of chil-
 dren is common in urban shops, but rare in industrial enterprises. The Ministries
 of Interior and Justice are responsible for enforcing these provisions, but enforce-
 ment is ineffective due to a lack of inspectors and other resources. Education is com-
 pulsory through the fifth grade, but this requirement rarely is observed in the rural
 areas or among the urban poor. The Labor Code prohibits forced and bonded labor
 performed by children under age 15, and the law generally is enforced effectively;
 however, there were reports that children were lured into sexual exploitation and
 slavery abroad-(see Sections 5 and 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code provides for a broad range of
 worker entitlements, including a workweek limited to 48 hours (36 hours for em-
 ployment in dangerous activities), safe working conditions, and higher compensation
 for dangerous work. The code also provides for at least 1 day of rest per week. Em-
 ployers are responsible for all expenses for a worker injured or killed on the job,
 a requirement generally fulfilled by employers in the formal economic sector. The
 daily minimum wage is $0.35 (1,400 kip), which is insufficient to provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. Most civil servants receive inadequate
 pay. However, few families in the wage economy depend on only one breadwinner.
 Some piecework employees, especially on construction sites, earn less than the mini-
 mum wage. Many are illegal immigrants, particularly from Vietnam, and are more
 vulnerable to exploitation by employers. Although workplace inspections reportedly
 have increased, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare lacks the personnel and
 budgetary resources to enforce the Labor Code effectively. The Labor Code has no
 specific provision allowing workers to remove themselves from a dangerous situation
 without jeopardizing their employment.
