 BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
 The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed from one of six constituent
 republics of the former Yugoslavia. Citizens endorsed independence in a 1992 ref-
 erendum. President Alija Izetbegovic heads the multiethnic collective presidency of
 a parliamentary democratic government elected in 1990. Within days of independ-
 ence, Serbian nationalist militias, supported by elements of the former Yugoslav na-
 tional army (JNA), launched attacks throughout northern and eastern Bosnia, and
 Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) leader Radovan Karadzic declared the establish-
 ment of the "Republika Srpska" or "Serb Republic."
 Seventy percent of the Bosnian Republic remained under Serbian occupation until
 the Bosnian government and Croatian offensives in August. During 4 years of war
 an estimated 263,000 people were killed, and two-thirds of the country's prewar pop-
 ulation of 4  million was uprooted and dispersed as either refugees or displaced
 persons. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegona, rebel Serb forces, and rep-
 resentatives of the international community wielded varying forms of authority over
 various areas of the country during the year.
 The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegoa was established in March 1994, trans-
 forming the internal structure of the Bosnian territories under Bosniak and Croat
 control Although the parliaments of the Federation and the Republic differed slight-
 ly in their makeup the      Minister and cabinet ministers governed in the name
 of both the Republic and the Federation. Federation structures have for the most
 part not yet been implemented. The signing of the Federation agreement in March
 1994 led to an effective trc and even some military coordination, between the
 Bosnian and Croat artners. However, the situation in Mostar remains tense de-
 spit   e Euro   pean  nion's (EU) Administrator's efforts, and both sides have yet to
 implement fuily an agreement to arrange for the return of Bosniaks and Croats to
 four key cities.
 The Republga Srpska, headed by SDS leader Karadzic and headquartered in Pale
 near Sarajevo, controls the territory held by the nationalist Serbs. Althou  a ar-
 lament exists, the Pale government is run by a small group of military and civilian
 authorities dedicated to an extreme nationalist ideology, who control an elaborate
 
 
 police and security structure and an army inherited from and still supplied by the
 ormer Yugoslavia.
 The self-proclaimed "Croatian Republic of Herceg-Bosna," was the institutional
 wing of the Croatian Defense Council (HVO) and Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ),
 as well as a rival claimant to territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina until the Wash-
 ington Agreement in March 1994, which led to formation of the Federation. It con-
 tinued to exist through much of western Herzegovina and some of central Bosnia
 as a provisional Croatian authority within the Federation, pending formation of can-
 tons as prescribed by the Federation Constitution. Under a separate agreement
 reached in Dayton, Herzeg-Bosna is to be dissolved, and that process is already
 under way. The -VO appears to be directly under the command of the army of Cro-
 atia (HV). For example, HVO commander and indicted war criminal Tihomer
 Blaskic was recently appointed by Croatian President Tudjman to the Inspectorate
 General of the HV. This, along with the fact that Bosnian Croats have dual citizen-
 ship with Croatia and are able to vote in Croatian elections, brings into question
 the degree of the HDZ's independence from Croatia.
 The Bosnian Serb occupation of the U.N. 'safe area" of Srebrenica in July resulted
 in one of the worst single reported incidents of genocidal mass killing of members
 of an ethnic or religious grup in Europe since World War II. This massacre, com-
 bined with the Bosnian Serb intensive shelling of civilian Sarajevo and continuing
 ethnic cleansing galvanized NATO into making a decisive military intervention.
 Massive NATO bombing of Bosnian Serb military targets and unrelated Bosnian
 government and Croatian ground assaults allowed the Federation to reclaim nearly
 20 percent of Bosnia's territory. The changed battlefield circumstances, plus an in-
 tensive diplomatic effort led by the United States and its Contact Group partners
 (Russia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and France) led to the negotiation of a com-
 prehensive peace agreement in November 1995 near Dayton, Ohio; the agreement
 was formally signed in December in Paris.
 The complex and difficult process of political reconciliation among Bosnia's three
 major religious/ethnic groups--Bosniaks (Muslims), Serbs (Orthodox), and Croats
 (Catholics)-is scheduled to move forward as outlined by the Dayton agreement. The
 agreement provides for the continuity of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a single state with
 two constituent entities, the Bosnian Federation and the Republika Srpska (Serb
 Republic). The agreement provides for a central government with a bicameral legis-
 lature, a three-member Presidency, a Council of Ministers, a Constitutional Court,
 and a central bank. The agreement provides the central government with control
 over foreign policy, foreign trade, customs policy (but not collection, a federation
 function), immigration, monetary policy, communications, and the financing of gov-
 ernment operations. Defense, however, remains under the control of the respective
 entities.
 Under the Dayton Agreement, 51 percent of Bosnia's territory lies within the
 Bosniak-Croat Federation, and 49 percent within the Republika Srpska. The Dayton
 agreement provides for the reunification of Sarajevo withn the Federation and the
 linkage of Gorazde to the Federation by a secure land corridor. All of Bosnia's people
 are accorded the right to move freely throughout the country. Refugees and dis-
 placed persons are accorded the right to reclaim their property or receive just com-
 pensation. The Government is committed to respect human rights, allow human
 rights monitors unrestricted access to their territory, support the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in the search for missing persons, release all
 combatants or civilians held in relation to the conflict, and cooperate fully with the
 international investigation and prosecution of war crimes and other crime against
 humanity.
 Free and democratic elections are scheduled to be held throughout Bosnia in the
 latter half of 1996. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
 (OSCE) is responsible for supervising the preparation and conduct of these elections.
 The Dayton agreement provides that all adults listed in the 1991 Bosnian census
 are eligible to vote; refugees and displaced persons have the right to vote in their
 original place of residence, unless they choose to vote elsewhere.
 The Bosnian Army (ABiH) is the military arm of the Republic. It is a multiethnic
 fighting force, comprised predominantly of Bosnian Muslims, but also Croats, Serbs,
 and Bosnians of mixed ethnicity. In the course of the war it developed from a citizen
 militia into an army. The ABiH generally respected citizens' human rights, although
 it did commit some violations. Foreign mercenaries and Bosnian Muslims who called
 themselves "mujahadein," fought alongside the ABiH. Some "mujahadein" report-
 edly harassed Christians in central Bosnia. Under the terms of the Dayton Agree-
 ment, all foreign forces are to depart Bosnia. Under the November 10 Dayton Agree-
 ment Implementing the Federation, defense matters were to become a Federation
 
 
 793
 responsibility, and the forces of the Bosnian Army (ABiH) and those of the Bosnian
 Croats (HVO) were to be joined.
 The Bosnian Serb army (BSA) is the military arm of the Republika Srpska. Amal-
 gamated in 1992 from Serbian paramilitary bands, local rural militias, and elements
 of the JNA, it continued its pattern of using terror tactics against Sargjevo and
 other civilian areas within sniper or artillery range. It also attacked, kidnaped, and
 harassed the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), cut utilities to Sara-
 vo in violation of U.N. Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 900, and blockaded de-
 eries of humanitarian assistance. Mercenaries from Russia, Greece, and Ukraine
 fought alongside BSA foea.-_
 UNPROFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina exercised limited and sporadic authority
 in specific areas, including control of some border points and control of air space
 and some overland movement, as well as police powers and other quasi-govern-
 mental functions.
 The Dayton agreement provided for the establishment of the NATO Implementa-
 tion Force (IFOR), which is headed by a US. commander. IFOR's role is to enforce
 the military aspects of the settlement, including the separation of forces. The parties
 committed themselves to withdraw their forces behind an aged cease-fire line
 within 30 days of signature of the agreement and withdraw allheavy weapons and
 forces to barracks within 120 days. All parties are required to cooperate fully with
 IFOR, which has unimpeded freedom of movement throughout Bosnia.
 The Dayton agreement paves the way for international assistance to help rebuild
 the economy. An estimated 25 percent of industrial facilities and infrastructure, and
 probably a greater percentage of housing, have been lost. Most industrial facilities
 that were not damaged by the fighting were shut down due to lack of labor, utilities,
 raw materials, and spe parts.The passage of 3 years without maintenance poses
 additional problems for rebuldin g the industrial base. The health sector has lost
 most of its doctors and nurses. The number of hospital beds has fallen by 35 per-
 cent, and infant mortality has doubled since 1990. There is some agricultural pro-
 duction in contiguous Federation territory, minimizing the need for humanitarian
 food assistane there. Bsniaks complamned that traders in the Croat area, which
 lies between the Bsniak sector and t&e Adriatic coast, monopolized trade and infor-
 mally taxed humanitarian assistance convoys in this area at the Bosniaks' expense.
 Sara'evo and Gorazde, which suffered from a Serb blockade-as well as Srebrenica
 and  epa before their fall and Bihac before its liberation-were almost completely
 dependent upon humanitarian assistance for most of the year. The German mark
 remains the de facto currency in Bosniak territory. The Serbs were able to feed
 themselves in Serb-occupied territory, but lack of markets and raw materials shut
 down most industry there as well. The Dayton agreement allows for the organiza-
 tion of a comprehensive international reconstruction program to rebuild Bosia's
 shattered physical infrastructure and revive the economy.
 Although all sides committed human rights violations during 1995, the Serbs-
 through continued ethnic cleansing, mass murders, and attacks on civilian areas--
 were responsible for the overwhelming majority of abuses. The Federation Govern-
 ment's policy and more open society allowed the collection of detailed information
 about human rights problems at all levels of society, while the more closed and re-
 pressive Republika Srpska restricted the efforts of human rights observers.
 Prison conditions were poor. There were credible reports that the BSA, and to a
 lesser extent the HVO and ABiH, seized civilians to use in trade with other armies
 for prisoners and commodities such as food and fuel. In some cases, the rising com-
 modity value of humans for trade reportedly resulted in improved treatment of the
 human commodities-mostly military-age males--to bring a higher price. In all
 three armies, local commanders appeared to exercise a significant degree of inde-
 pendence from their senior commanders.
 The HVO was credibly accused of human rights abuses against Bosniaks and
 Serbs and conducted a scorched earth campaign in territory to be ceded to the
 Bosnian Serbs in the Dayton agreement. HVO forces on occasion killed civilians and
 shelled civilian areas. Some local Croat paramilitary units retained a considerable
 criminal element, especially in areas such as Kiseliak, Vitez, and Prozor. The HVO
 also attracted mercenary elements who were implicated in human rights abuses.
 The Serb expulsion of Bosniaks and Croats from Serb-controlled territory-"ethnic
 cleansinge--continued in varying degrees until May, when the recapture of western
 Slavonia in Croatia by the Croatian army led to an influx of Serb refugees into
 northern Bosnia. Paramilitary groups, with assistance from local Serb authorities,
 accelerated the ethnic cleansing ofnon-Serbs in that area b forcible evictions,
 killings, rapes, beatings, and general harassment. In July the Serb attack and sei-
 zure of theU.N. safe area of Srebrenica became the most massive and savage single
 act of ethnic cleansing in the 4-year history of the war. The Serb overrunning of
 
 
 794
 the Zepa safe area followed a few days later. The Serbs continued to lay siege to
 cities, deliberately shell civilian areas and hospitals, withhold food deliveries, and
 cut off utilities. They also continued to execute noncombatants and run detention
 camps in which they executed some prisoners and tortured others. They employed
 rape as a tool of war forced large numibers of civilians to flee to other regions, razed
 villages to prevent the return of displaced persons, and blocked international relief
 efforts, including attacks on relief personnel.
 Respect for human rights is a fundamental part of the Dayton agreement and a
 key to the reconciliation process. The agreement provides for the establishment of
 a Human Rights Commission (consisting of a human rights chamber and ombuds-
 men) to enforce the entities' human rights obligations. The OSCE will organize a
 system of international observers to monitor the human rights situation and facili-
 tate the election process throughout the country.
 The agreement commits Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia to cooperate fully with the
 international investigation and prosecution of war crimes and other crimes against
 humanity. The new Bosnian Constitution obligates all authorities, including the
 Republika Srpska, to obey orders of the U.N. war crimes tribunal for the Former
 Yugoslavia, which was established at The Hague in 1994. Accused war criminals
 who refuse to obey the tribunars orders are forbidden from holding elective or ap-
 pointive office. The tribunal continued to indict suspected war criminals and inves-
 ti ate the extent to which atrocities and genocide were a matter of low-level loss
 of control or of high-level policy. By punishing the individuals responsible for the
 atrocities, victims will feel less need to take revenge into their own hands and at-
 tack innocent members of other ethnic groups.
 The tribunal has indicted 52 individuals thus far, 45 of whom are Bosnian Serbs,
 including "President' Karadic and his top military commander General Ratko
 Mladic, and 7 who are Bosnian Croats. Further indictments are expected in early
 1996.
 With the comingof peace and IFOR, the significance of the Hague tribunal has
 become apparent. For example, Serb mayors of some towns in northern Bosnia re-
 portedly had begun seeking expert advice on how to justify their actions while atroc-
 ities were taking place in their towns. In addition, both the Bosnian Serbs and the
 Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have announced that they would conduct their own
 war crimes trials, in a transparent attempt to avoid surrendering their people to
 the Hague tribunal. Bosnian Croats under indictment have not yet been appre-
 hended.
 Wartime conditions stalled the democratization process in Bosnia. The 1990 free
 elections brought about the victories of etlmic-based parties: the Party of Democratic
 Action (SDA) of President Izetbegovic, the HDZ, and Karadzic's SDS. The SDA and
 HDZ dominate in Federation territory. Opposition parties claimed that the SDA and
 HDZ systematically replaced minorities and non-party members of their own ethnic
 groups with the party faithful in senior positions in the economy and military. In
 Serb-held territory, the SDS controlled both the media and political activity and did
 not permit dissent.
 The Bosnian Federation Human Rights Ombudsmen appointed by the OSCE, a
 committee of three (a Bosniak, a Croat, and a Serb), have done impressive work
 monitoring the human rights situation and bringing cases of abuse to the Bsniak
 and Croat Governments. However, the Ombudsmen have no enforcement power, and
 authorities treat them with varying degrees of indifference and hostility. The Om-
 budsmen say that were it not for international backing Federation authorities would
 disband them immediately.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Illing.-The Bosnian government forces did
 not as a matter of policy commit political or other extrajudicial killings, There are
 credible reports that Bosnian army troops murdered some of the followers of
 Bosniak renegade Fikrat Abdic, who fled to Croatian territory and were taken pris-
 oner by the Croatian army following the liberation of the Bihac enclave. The Cro-
 atian forces reportedly allowed Bosnian army troops to cross their lines and enter
 the camp of 20,000 (soldiers and families) where they killed some of the refugees
 and harassed others in revenge for their role in the siege of Bihac. In December a
 joint police force made up of Croat, Bosnian, and Turkish police was formed to cre-
 ate a safe environment for the refugees to return to Velika KMadusa. There were also
 credible reports that the administration of Hrasnica, a majority Serb district of Sa-
 raevo controlled by the Government, seized over 150 Serb males in 1994 for forced
 la or on the front lines, the majority of whom were killed in the line of fire (see
 
 
 795
 Section I.c.). Government troops also shelled a Serb refugee column in August (see
 Section 1.g.).
 There a-- reliable reports that HVO forces occasionally killed Serb civilians, most-
 ly elderly men but occasionally women and children, who were unable to flee when
 their towns were shelled.
 Republika Srpska was responsible for by far the most massive, egregious, and
 well-organized killings targeted on members of an ethnic group, including one of the
 worst single reported incidents of genocidal mass killing in Europe since World War
 U. Serb military and paramilitary forces continued to terrorize Bosnian civilians
 through shelling, sniping, attacks on hospitals, and other military action (see Sec-
 tion 1.g.). The Serb seizure of Srebrenica, began at 3:15 a.m. on July 6 with an in-
 tensive bombardment of civilian targets in the enclave, causing chaos among the
 populace which had nowhere to retreat. In the next few days the shelling continued
 and Serb forces closed in, taking control of U.N. observation posts one by one and
 taking 55 U.N. troops hostage. The desperate civilians fled, many on foot, to the
 U.N. base in the neighnbring vTillage of Potocari.
 On July 10 most of the military-age civilian males, and a number of ABiH sol-
 diers, correctly concluded that they would be slaughtered if they were captured.
 They decided that their best chance of survival would be to try to walk 50 kilo-
 meters through Serb territory to the nearest government lines. Groups of varying
 sizes totalling from 10,000 to 15,000, including some women and children, departed
 over July 10 to 12. The various columns broke up into smaller groups as Serb forces
 attacked them. Survivors who reached safety in the Tuzla area reported mass execu-
 tions of ABiH soldiers and civilian males. According to one report, the Serbs am-
 bushed a group of about 2,000 in a confined area near Kamenica, killing most. Ac-
 cording to some reports, Serbe dressed in U.N. uniforms they had stolen from
 UNPROFOR troops joined the column and knifed or strangled individuals. Many of
 the men surrendered to the Serbs; some were killed after they surrendered. Others
 reportedly committed suicide rather than surrender and face the possibility of tor-
 ture. There are numerous, credible reports that many of those who surrendered
 were taken to places of mass execution north of Srebrenica. The systematic way in
 which prisoners were moved to execution sites, and the presence of trailers and bull-
 dozers (to transport corpses and to dig mass graves) indicate that the mass killings
 were planned well in advance. More than 7,000 remain unaccounted for and pre.
 sumed dead.
 By July 12, 3,000 to 4,000 civilians were packed into the U.N. base and another
 24,000 were gr uped around the base. By this time, according to reports gathered
 by Human Rights Wath/Helsinki, Serb soldiers had killed at least 99 people in-
 cuding 20 to 30 women and children, and Bosnian Serb troops were freely waking
 inside the camp among the civilians, with the U.N. troops reduced to bystanders.
 Some Serbs donned U.N. uniforms, drove white U.N. jeeps, and thus disguised lured
 the refugees out of hiding to their deaths, according to U.N. and press reports.
 The deportation of civilians began on July 13. Those men who did not leave on
 July 10 were separated from the women and children, including boys younger than
 16 and men in their 70s. Bosnian Serb commanding General Ratko Mladic arrived
 that afternoon with the Serb press. With the cameras rolling and Serb soldiers
 handing out bread and water, Madic told the refugees that they would be cared for.
 Once the press departed the mass killings began in earnest. According to numer-
 ous and corroborated reports collected by the U.N., ICRC, and other international
 observers, eyewitnesses saw bodies of dead civilians along the road, many with their
 throats cut; others had been shot in the back of the head. On the morning of July
 14 two women who left their camp to look for water told Human Rights Watch/Hel-
 sinki that on their way back along the same path at around 8:00 a.m. they saw 10
 dead males, some of whom they recognized, with their throats slashed. Witnesses
 reported seeing military-age men being taken off of buses and taken out of sight,
 and then hearing gunfire. Local Serb civilians confirmed to international journalists
 that the kilhns took place, and identified locations, such as the school in Karakaj,
 where the victims were held pending their execution. Members of the UNPROFOR
 battalion that was to protect Srebrenica reported seeing an estimated 1,000 ABiH
 soldiers confined in a soccer stadium north of Nova Kasaba on July 13 and hearing
 about 45 minutes of continuous shooting from the stadium beginning at about 2:30
 a.m. on the morning of July 14.
 According to an eyewitness who survived by pretending to be dead, some 2,000
 civilian Muslims were Vacked into a warehouse in Kravica 2 days after Srebrenica
 was overrun: Serb soldiers then fired automatic weapons and rocket propelled gre-
 nades into the building. Mass killings of civilian Muslims also took place at deten-
 tion sites in Konjevic Polje, Potocari, and Karakaj. Dutch soldiers saw Serbs kill un-
 armed Muslims and masses of dead bodies. On July 15 Dutch troops saw 30 bodies
 
 
 on the road between Nova Kasaba and Bratunac and on July 17 saw approximately
 100 bodies on two trailers coming from the direction of Srebrenica. A local man
 interviewed by journalists said he saw about 500 killed while he lay hiding in reeds
 along the main road to Nova Kasaba. Eyewitnesses reported that Serb army com-
 mander General Ratko Mladic was present at some of the mass executions of civil-
 ian Muslims, cradling an AK-47 rifle. Serb paramilitary groups, including the Drina
 Wolves, Seselj Militia, Specialna Policia, White Eagles, and Arkan Tigers reportedly
 were also present.
 Similar atrocities may have occurred during the occupation of the Zepa safe-area,
 although a greater percentage of Zepa's population has been accounted for.
 Mass killings of non-Serbs as part of ethnic cleansing also took place in Bahia
 Luka, Prijedor, Bosanski Novi, and Bosanska Dubica in September and October, in
 p art to make room for Serb refugees who fled from the Croatian reoccupation of
 Krajina. Croats reportedly were particular targets for revenge. U.N. and other inter-
 national observers collected numerous accounts of killings and other atrocities.
 In addition to mass killings, the Bosnian Serbs most often shot or slit the throats
 of their victims. Beatings to death were also frequently reported. Reports of gro-
 tesque cruelty were also common. For example, a Bosniak woman described to
 Human Rights Watch/Helsinki how at Potocari Serb soldiers slit her son's throat be-
 fore her eyes and forced her to drink his blood. Victims of mass expulsions in the
 Bahia Luka     edor area in October reported that in some cases captives were
 forced to walk across mine fields or to cross rivers where the older and weak
 drowned. Many sick or wounded captives died because Bosnian Serb authorities de-
 nied them access to medical treatment. There are reports of suicides by non-Serbs
 who were traumatized by the brutality they experienced. In Potocari on July 12 a
 14-year-old Bosniak girl hung herself with her scarf after she and her 12-year old
 cousin were raped by Serb soldiers.
 One Bosniak woman reported that she was forced out of her Bosanska Dubica
 home at gunpoint by paramilitary forces wearing black stockings over their heads,
 was beaten by them, and dragged away by her hair. At the town square where she
 was held before her expulsion, she witnessed two women and three men beaten to
 death. In another case, all four members of a retarded family were killed because
 they failed to understand that they were supposed to leave their home and get onto
 a bus.
 In May Bosnian Serbs shot down a helicopter carrying Bosnian Foreign Minister
 Irfan Lubjankic and Deputy Justice Minister Izet Muhamedagic from Bihac to Sara-
 jevo. All seven persons aboard were killed. During the siege of Zepa, Serb com-
 mander Mladic lured Bosnian garrison commander Palic out of the enclave with an
 invitation to talk with him under UNPROFOR auspices. Mladic's forces killed the
 commander on his way back to the enclave, and Madic publicly took credit for the
 killing.
 b. Disappearance.-Thousands of citizens are believed to be missing. During the
 year and following the ethnic cleansing in Srebrenica and northern Bosnia, the total
 will likely reach into the tens of thousands. The ICRC estimates that as many as
 7,000 are missing from Srebrenica alone, and many thousands more are missing
 and unaccounted for since the     g     of the conflict. Accurate statistics are dif-
 ficult to obtain because the number of-missing is constantly in flux as some are
 found and others are displaced or captured. The accuracy of any estimate suffers
 from the inability of many Bosnian citizens to come to the Red Cross to register
 those missing. In addition, since some families were completely wiped out, many
 missing citizens may simply have no one left to inquire about them. The Red Crss
 believes that these missing persons fall into different categories: some have escaped
 but have failed to contact relatives, some have been killed, and some remain in work
 camps that the ICRC has not been able to visit. An accurate accounting will likely
 not be possible for months, and possibly years, after the war's end. The majority
 of those who disappeared in 1995 came from Srebrenica and areas subjected to eth-
 nic cleansing in the Banja Luka area of northern Bosnia from August to October.
 Local Bosnian officials in Bugojno have yet to provide satisfactory information on
 the whereabouts of 26 prominent Croats who disappeared when the ABiH took the
 town in late 1993.
 There was no resolution of the longstanding case involving the disappearance of
 approximately 180 Bosniak men from Hadzici in June 1992. Pendin information on
 the whereabouts of these men, the Bosnian Government continued to detain for a
 third year approximately 150 Bosnian Serbs in a grain silo in the nearby town of
 Tarcin. (The men were released in January 1996.)
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for the right to freedom from torture and cruel or inhu-
 man treatment or punishment. The Federation Government and its authorities do
 
 
 797
 
 not condone such actions, although there were some credible reports that incidents
 took place.
 There were reliable reports that Serbs were used as forced labor on the front lines
 at a battle at the covered market Gusica Hala near Stup in June or July. Men from
 Hrasnica and other detention centers reportedly were tied together, to prevent es-
 cape, and sent to remove mines and build sandbag walls. Two reportedly were
 killed, and a number of wounded were traded in a prisoner exchange.
 Non-Serb and international observers in Serb-held territor credibly reported
 that Serb authorities and Serb civilians, with the support of the authorities, rou-
 tinely used cruel and egding treatment to further ethnic cleansing. For example,
 Bsnian Serbs beat a 61-year old Prijedor man 10 times over a 3-year period for
 refusing to abandon his house. He was finally expelled. Serb authorities in Baja
 Luka arrested, beat, and tortured Banja Luka community leaders in Mali Logor bar-
 racks in what was viewed as an attempt to further ethnic cleansing (see Section
 1.d.).
 Serb forces routinely used rape, to accelerate the precess of ethnic cleansing. Sta-
 tistics are difficult to obtain because of the cultural stigma, especially for Muslim
 women, that comes with the victim's acknowledgement that she was raped.
 Numerous civilians who fled or were expelle from the Banja Luka area in Sep-
 tember and October reported that they had been robbed, beaten, raped, threatened,
 and forced to pay to keep men from being taken for forced labor on the front lines
 (many were ten despite the payment). Many civilians held in  drced labor on the
 front lines were killed in the line of fire. According to one Muslim from Banja Luka
 who was forced to work on the front lines, laborers were sometimes forced to sleep
 in the trenches during the winter and would sometimes freeze to death overnight.
 Serb refugees from other parts of Bosnia and Krajina, with the help of local Serb
 authorities, forced non-Serb families out of their homes. Non-Serbs were not able
 to work or receive a slary legally or to obtain medical insurance. As a result many
 non-Serbs in the Banja LukalPnjedor area could not obtain medicines, which were
 available. Many therefore suffered and died from lack of medicine and medical
 treatment. For example, there were credible reports of diabetics attempting to use
 herb mixtures as a substitute for insulin, with unsuccessful results. Many were ex-
 pelled from their homes but not permitted to leave Serb-held territory. Many of
 them live under bridges, in caves, and on the streets, according to U.N. sources.
 Bosnian Serb authorities in Prijedor and other towns in the Banja Luka area
 forced Muslims to wear white arm bands and painted their houses with white
 stripes. Serb soldiers sometimes cut crosses into the heads of Croats with knives.
 According to the Federation Ombudsmen, conditions in government prisons are
 poor and well below international standards, though not life-threatening. Food,
 clothing, and soap are in chronic short supply. To a limited extent, there are ac-
 counts of beatings and mistreatment by officials in government detention centers.
 Women minors, and the mentally retarded are sometimes kept in the same facili-
 ties with adult male criminals. Prisoners of war (POW's), civilians seized for use in
 exchanges, and common criminals are usually segregated.
 In government prisons, access to prisoners being held for criminal offenses was
 generally adequate, according to human rights lawyers. However, the ABiH began
 refusing access to its detention centers following an influx of prisoners taken during
 its offensive in August. Local observers believe these prisoners will be traded for
 Bosniak prisoners.
 There are credible accounts of prisoners being brutalized and murdered in Serb
 detention facilities. Republika Srpska authorities allowed the ICRC access to pris-
 oners held in detention centers already known to the ICRC, but many observers be-
 lieve the Serbs have secret detention and forced labor centers where abuses con-
 tinue.
 Serb authorities released well-known Serbian scholar and poet Vladimir Srebrov
 in November. The Republika Srpska's most famous political prisoner, Srebrov in
 1992 went to Serb-controlled lidza and publicly called on Bosnian Serbs to be loyal
 to the Bosnian government. He was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in jail for
 being an 'enemy of the Serbian nation." Srebrov said that he was kept in solitary
 confinement much of the time and beaten on a regular basis, "no less than once per
 week, sometimes every day." Those who beat him said that they would "teach him
 to become a Great Serbian." His health deteriorated and he lost nearly 100 pounds
 in the course of 1 year. He said that Kula prison, where he was kept, was being
 used as a "Potemkin village" to show Western visitors that prisoners of the Serbs
 were being treated properly, and that probably no killings had occurred there since
 1992. Srebrov stated that he had heard from other prisoners that killing, torture
 (including skinning alive, putting out of eyes, hacking off of limbs), and inhumane
 conditions had been commonplace at other Serb prison camps functioning at various
 
 
 798
 times since 1992, including Manjaca, Omarska, Keraterm, Tomasica, and Trnopolje.
 He also noted that prisoners were segregated by ethnic group (Serbs, Croats, and
 Bosniaks) with Serbs receiving the best treatment and Bosniaks the worst. Inter-
 national humanitarian aid was not distributed to prisoners except in token amounts
 on days when international visitors were present. When not in solitary confinement
 Srebrov was sometimes kept with Serb common criminals, many of whom were
 eventually sent to work on the front lines. Srebrov noted that the greatest acts of
 brutality came from uneducated rural Serbs who were "guzla patriots." (The guzla
 is a two-stringed instrument used to accompany songs of Serb exploits against the
 Turks, with whom the Bosniaks are identified.) These people were reportedly the
 most vulnerable targets for Serbian leader Karadzic's hate propaganda.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile-There are credible reports that military
 police in Sarajevo sometimes arrested civilians, particularly Serbs and Croats, but
 also Bosniaks. The military police told inquir riends and relatives not to inquire
 about those arrested "if they know what's good for them.* It is illegal for military
 police to arrest civilians.
 The authorities continued to detain approximately 150 Bosnian Serbs in Tarcin,
 pending resolution of longstanding disappearances (see Section 1.b.). (The detainees
 were released in January 1996.)
 Throughout the war and continuing in 1995 both Federation forces and Republika
 Srpska authorities routinely seized civilians for use in exchanges for POW's or com-
 modities such as fuel, food, and alcohol. However, the Federation reportedly reduced
 this practice to a great extent in 1995. According to the Federation Ombudsmen,
 military-age men bring the highest value; there are reports that military-age men
 have been traded for two women or children. The trades are frequently arranged
 by local military commands without the involvement of the ICRC or UNPROFOR.
 There are credible reports that people bribe those conducting the exchanges to
 move their relatives who are held by the other side to the top of the priority list
 of captives for whom the exchanges are made. Bribes for military-age males report-
 edly range from $100 to $750. This practice contributed to the process of ethnic
 cleansing by further concentrating the members of the three ethnic groups in their
 respective areas. There are no reliable statistics on the number of prisoners held
 or exchanged, but there are a number of reports of exchanges of over 100 people
 at a time. Prisoners are being released in accordance with the Dayton peace agree-
 ment.
 Arbitrary arrest was a common experience for non-Serbs in Serb-held areas. Serb
 authorities in Banja Luka arrested 5 Bosnian Muslim community leaders in August
 1994 and another 10 in February on charges of espionage. Many local Muslims be-
 lieve that the arrests were an effort to 'decapitate the community as part of ethnic
 cleansing. The leaders were held in Mali Logor barracks and beaten and tortured.
 Three were reportedly released in 1995 as part of a prisoner exchange. There is no
 further word on the welfare of the others. Bosnian Serbs also detained foreign jour-
 nalists (see Section 2.a.) and nongovernmental organization (NGO) employees, in-
 cluding physicians from "Doctors Without Borders.'
 The Government does not have a policy of forced exile, although most Serbs have
 fled government-held territory.
 Tens of thousands of Bosnians were seized, detained, and forcibly removed to Fed-
 eration territory in the ethnic cleansing process in 1995, including at least 37,000
 from Srebrenica and Zepa and at least 26,000 from northern Bosnia, with more than
 10,000 still unaccounted for and presumed dead. As of mid-December, Serb ethnic
 cleansing had left only about 20,000 non-Serbs in Serb-held north Bosnia, from a
 pre-war population of over 500,000. In Serb-held east Bosnia, after the fall of
 Srebrenica and Zepa (and excluding the Gorazde enclave), fewer than 1,000 remain,
 many of whom are members of mixed marriage families.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Republic's Constitution provides for an inde-
 pendent judiciary, extends the judiciary's independence to the investigative division
 of the criminal justice system, and establishes a judicial police force that reports di-
 rectly to the courts. However, these provisions have not yet been implemented, and
 the executive appears to exercise authority over the judiciary. For example, on Sep-
 tember 9 the Ministry of Finance issued a decree ordering government banks not
 to pay those who had won grievances in court against government enterprises. The
 legal system is designed to uard against discrimination against ethnic minorities
 by ensuring adequate diversity of representation on the bench. However, according
 to numerous observers, the ruling SDA and HDZ parties are "packing" the courts
 with party loyalists, thus undermining the independence of the judiciary. All court
 appointments in the Tuzla area reportedly must be approved by the local SDA per-
 sonnel chief.
 
 
 799
 The Constitution establishes a judicial hierarchy based on municipal courts, which
 have original jurisdiction in most civil and criminal cases, and cantonal courts,
 which have appellate jurisdiction over the canton's municipalities, as well as three
 federal courts (Constitutional, Supreme, and Human Rights). The Constitution pro-
 vides for open and public trials, the appintment of judges for terms which end
 when they reach age 70, and internal admiinistration of the judicial branch. How-
 ever, the court structures outlined in the Federation agreement have yet to be im-
 plemented.
 The Constitution provides for the right to fair criminal proceedings. There is a
 functioning appellate system, and the accused has the right to legal counsel.
 In 1995 the 1egal system was essentially the same as that of the former Socialist
 Republic of Bosma, with modifications for the wartime situation which are restric-
 tive of basic rights. For example, the Law on Implementation of the Law on Internal
 Affairs gives the police the discretion to arrest and detain for 5 days anyone they
 believe may be a danger to the State. Police also have the authority to expel people
 to and from different regions of the country if they deem a suspect to be a danger
 to the State. The Law on Refugees defines refugees as "victims of the aggressor,"
 which is interpreted to be the Bosnian Serb. Therefore people forced out of their
 homes by the HVO or ABiH are not entitled to refugee status. The Law on Amend-
 ments to the Criminal Law defines the prevention of refugees from returning to
 their homes as a criminal act. Under these laws, it is not a criminal act for the
 ABiH to prevent Crats that it expelled-or for the HVO to prevent Bosniaks that
 it expelled-frm returning home. However, under the Dayton Agreement, all refu-
 gees and displaced persons have the right to return to their homes voluntarily.
 According to international relief workers based in Pale, the Bsnian Serbs also
 use a m   ied form of the Yugoalav Republic of Bosnia's criminal code. There have
 been no credible reports that the Bosnian Government holds political prisoners. In
 November the Serbian authorities released poet Vladimir Srebrov (see Section 1.c.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The Re-
 public's Constitution provides for the right to privacy, protection of the family and
 of children, and property. Governmental respect for these rights was the rule rather
 than the exception in 1995. Authorities nevertheless monitored communications that
 o mii   y or other national security concerns.
 The persistence of the Serb policy of ethnic cleansing throughout the year in vary-
 in  degrees constituted sustained arbitrary interference with family and home. In
 a formal communication to the IC C on August 14, Bosnian Serb authorities gave
 assurances that minorities were free to stay or leave territories under their control
 and that they would not be subject to harassment nor would families be separated
 in the course of evacuation or men be seized for labor on the front lines. All of these
 commitments were violated massively and systematically from August through De-
 cember in the Serb-held areas of northern Bosnia.
 More than 26,000 Bosniaks and Croats were forced from their homes during this
 period. A great many of the refugees reported a similar pattern of events. Ser so-
 diers or police would forcibvly enter their homes without notice and threaten the
 family members with death if they did not leave immediately. Often, no time was
 allowed for packing and valuables, including property titles, were stolen on the spot.
 In some cases military-age men would be separated and taken away, members of
 the family would be beaten, and sometimes killed or raped in the course of the evic-
 tion. One 17-year-old Muslim girl from Sanaki Most told U.N. officials that she man-
 aged to run away with her sisters aft  er parents had been killed in the course
 of expeing them from their home on e ptember 21. She was later captured by sol-
 diers of paramilitary leader Zeliko Raznatovic ("Arkan) and raped.
 In some cases these atrocities would take place en route to the Bosnian lines.
 During the week of Soptember 19-26, according to eyewitness reports collected by
 the U.N., nearly 1,500 Muslim residents of Dobj were forced out of their homes on
 very short notice, gathered in a sports stadium, and from there bused to an area
 near the confrontation line and forced to walk some 10 to 15 miles in very difficult
 conditions. Several elderly people died of exhaustion. Some of the displaced showed
 clear signs of severe physical abuse.
 Families were often told that they could ransom their men for as much as $400
 to $500, but even when the money was paid, the men were never released. Many
 refugees reported that they were harassed in the weeks prior to their expulsions by
 the paramilitary forces of "Arkan and Vojislav Seselj, leader of the Radical Party
 of Serbia. The harassment included threats, beating, murder, rape, and destruction
 famiembian authorities in Serb-ocupied territories continued a policy of sum-
 marily confiscating the property of mixed-marriage couples with sons who had ei-
 ther fled abroad or to Federation territory.

 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Boanian government forces are under orders to honor the Geneva Conven-
 tion and subject to discipline if they violate it. ABiH forces generally respected
 international human rights standards. UNPROFOR observers reported that ABiH
 forces shelled a refugee column in Donji Zirovac on August 8. There are credible re-
 ports that ABiH soldiers, with the cooperation of Croatian forces, harassed and mur-
 dered followers of renegade Muslim leader Abdic while they were confined to a de-
 tention camp in Croatia (see Section L.a.).
 Croatian forces also were responsible for indiscriminate killing. During HVO
 offensives in western Bosnia in September and October, HVO forces shelled civilian
 areas in Bosanski Novi, Bosanska Dubica, Knezica, Svodna, and Doboj.
 International observers agree that Serb forces continued to violate international
 humanitarian law on a massive scale, especially during the takeover of Srebrenica
 and Zepa and the mass expulsions from northern Bosma throughout autumn. Serb
 forces used rape as a tool of war, and as a means to accelerate ethnic cleansing.
 Compiling statistics for 1995 is difficult due to the Serb authorities' usual refusal
 to cooperate with international human rights groups, U.N. agencies, and the ICRC,
 in addition to the sheer number of those killed, missing, and displaced by Serb ac-
 tions. Thorough documentation may well require months and possibly years. How-
 ever, the overwhelming number of credible eyewitness reports collected by local and
 international human rights observers leaves no doubt that Serb forces committed
 mass killings in the ethnic cleansing of Srebrenica in July and in the Banja Luka
 Prijedr area in Auguist September, and October (see Section l.a.).
 According to UNHCR reports, the arrival the he paramilitary forces of Zeliko
 Raznatovic, or "Arkan," in Sanski Most on September 21 led to the mass expulsion
 of Bosniaks from the area. Forced expulsions, as well as killings, continued well into
 December. According to credible reports more than 100 individuals were killed in
 October at a cement factory in Sanfki Moat.
 Some of the distraught survivors of the Srebrenica massacre, upon reaching safety
 in the Tuzla area, forcibly expelled 160 Serb families from their homes and killed
 4 Serb civilians. Tluzla authorities prevented the further spread of violence against
 local Serbs.
 There are reports that large numbers of non-Serbs were killed in Serb-run deten-
 tion camps (see Section 1.c.).
 Throughout 1995 the BSA continued to ound Bosnian populations centers with
 mortars and automatic weapons ire, causing the death of thousands of civilians.
 The BSA continued to target noncombatant and populated areas for shelling and
 _sniing to maintain a constant atmosphere of terror and vulnerability The ppu-
 lation centers most affected were Srebrenca, Zepa, Sarajevo, Grazde, Tuzia. From
 January through mid-October, Serbian gunners, including snipers, killed over 1,500
 Sarajevo civilians and wounded more than 7,300. On October 3, a Serb cluster bomb
 killed 10 civilians and injured 34 in Zivinice, a town near Tuzla. In Sarajevo the
 most deadly results from a single projectile came in a downtown Sarajevo market-
 place on August 28 when one shell killed 41 people and wounded more than 70 oth-
 ers. In June and July, Serb shelling appeared to be deliberately timed for when the
 greatest number of people would be on the street and most vulnerable. One school
 was hit twice during that period.
 In addition to firing directly on civilians during the year the BSA fired directly
 on humanitarian aid convoys and on UNPAOFOR troops escorting them. It choked
 off assistance at various times to the eastern enclaves, Sarajevo, and (through its
 Krajina Serb allies) Biha.
 Bosnian Serb authorities continued to defy UNSC Resolution 900, which specifi-
 cally provides for the uninterrupted supply of utilities to Sarajevo, by cutting off the
 supply of basic utilities as part of their strategy of pressuring and demoralizing the
 population of Sarajevo.
 Additionally, perpetrators of grave violations of international humanitarian law
 could be indicted by the UaN. war crimes tribunal.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speeh and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press. The Government partially respects this right in the majority of Fed-
 eration territory; authorities in HD -ontrlled Hereg-Bosna do not respect it at
 all.
 Continued wartime conditions have limited the development of truly independent
 media in Federation territory. Although there are some, in general the ruling SDA
 and HDZ political parties exert considerable influence over the media. Many private
 radio stations broadcast locally in Federation territory; a smaller number of private
 television stations serve local markets in Sarajevo, Zenica and Tuzla. Only state tel-
 
 
 801
 evision which is controlled by the ruling SDA party, is broadcast throughout
 Boaniak territory as well as parts of Croat territory and the Republika Srpska.
 The development of independent media also was constrained by the wartime lack
 of start-up capital, paper, and supplies and the rising world price of newsprint. Few
 of the media are commercially viable; some survive through the sponsorship of pri-
 vate organizations, cultural societies, and political parties, others with help from
 Western aid organizations. Western television broadcasts such as Cable News Net-
 work and Sky News are available to those with satellite receivers. In HDZ-con-
 trolled Herceg-Bosna, the media are part of the HDZ structure but not as strictly
 censored as in the Serbian Republic. Croatia supplies transmissions of Radio Split
 to the inhabitants of Herceg-Bosna.
 Some independent media have complained about government intimidation. Studio
 99's radio and television transmitter mysteriously caught fire and burned down fol-
 lowing the station's show of support for an SDA rival of President Izetbegovic. The
 station was off the air for 7 days. An independent magazine complained that it and
 its sponsors were harassed by government financial police. In Tuzla the editorial
 staff of the radio station Chameleon was drafted for military duty following broad-
 casts critical of the Government.
 Foreign journalists in Sarajevo and elsewhere on Federation territory generally
 were able to operate without problems. However, some said that it was difficult to
 gain access to territory recently taken from the Serbs, especially in Croat-controlled
 areas where the HVO tried to maintain tighter control over press activities.
 In the Republika Srpska the media are a propaganda tool of the ruling SDS party.
 Thepartys media voice, the Serbian Republic News Agency, Tanug (the news agen-
 cy of the Milosevic regime in Serbia), and other Serbian sources formed the basis
 for near total dominatin of both print and electronc information media. All foreign
 media are banned in the Republia Srpska. The public in Serb territory only has
 access to two choices: Bosnian Serb media from Pale or Serbian media from Bel-
 grade.
 The SDS strictly ensors the media in the Serb area. Sonja Karadzi the "Presi-
 dents daughter, is in charge of issuing safe-conduct passes for foreign journalists.
 Foreign journalists must work under significant restrictions, and face the possibility
 of being banned or arrested for researching stories that might be unfavorable to the
 Karadzic regime. Christian Science Momtor reporter David Rehde was held for
 nearly 2 weeks for researhingstories of mass killing. American reporters Tracy
 Wilkinson and Kit Reane, and British reporter Emma Daily were detained without
 charges and held incommunicado overnight. Two Turkish journalists, Munira A cim
 and Alija Kocak, were seized on October 7 and 2 weeks later were traded to the
 ABiH or Serb POW's. In March two journalists, a Bosnian Muslim and a Jor-
 danian-Bosnian dual national, were arrested and later exchanged for Serb POW's.
 Wartime conditions; lack of resources, and difficulty in maintaining contact with
 other academic communities constrained academic freedom. Serbs and Croats com-
 plained that SDA party favorites were mere likely to get promoted or obtain senior
 manageria positions.
 In sr    ontrolled areas, the authorities general lack of tolerance for dissent led
 to total control of the educational media. The curriculum in Serb-controlled areas
 has been revamped to teach solely Serb history, art, literature, etc. There has been
 no evidence of an intelld oa exseange of ideas in the media or other academic fo-
 rums in Serb-held territory since the 1992 invasion.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assoration.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of association, and the Government generally respected this right in prac-
 tice. Large gatherings, which might have attracted Serb shelling or sniping, were
 banned until Sertemberi
 While poelitica membership is not forced, membership in the ruling SDA and HDZ
 parties in Federation territory is increasingly viewed as a way to obtain housing and
 h   im-level jobs in the state-owned sector of the economy.
 In the Republika Sprska the SDS's control over security and police imposessevere
 limitatin   on the right to assemble and associate. Authorities orchestrated large
 demonstrations protesting the Dayton agreement in November. Although political
 membership is not forced, membership in the SDS is viewed as the means to obtain
 access to both jobs and housing.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, includ-
 ing private and public worship. However, within the Federation the authorities d
 not respect these rights in consistent fashion. In general, conditions for religious ob-
 servance were significantly better for non-Muslims in those parts of the Federation
 where Muslims dminated than they were for non-Catholics in areas where Croat
 dominated.
 
 
 The dominant political parties are both based on ethnic and religious identifica-
 tion: SDA-Muslhm and HIZ-Croat. Some members of these parties used religion
 or ethnicity as ideological litmus tests and a means of intraparty competition.
 The Republika Srpska continued systematically to eradicate the remaining traces
 of Muslim and Catholic jresence by demolishing religious and cultural sites. Accord-
 ing to government statistics, some 1,424 Muslim and 275 Catholic religious sites
 were destroyed during the war as part of ethnic cleansing by Bosnian Serbs, as well
 as 30 Orthodox and 6 Jewish sites.
 As part of ethnic cleansing in northern Bosnia in May, Father Blaz Markovic of
 Trn and two nuns were severely beaten and their church blown up. A week earlier
 the burned bodies of a local priest and a nun were found in the Catholic church in
 Presnace.
 In northern Bosnia Serb authorities required Muslims to wear white arm bands
 and marked their houses with painted white stripes. Serb soldiers sometimes cut
 crosses into the heads of Croats with knives (see Section 1.c.).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In practice, the ongoing hostilities effectively restricted the full exercise
 of these rights. The demands of mobilization and the dangers of crossing check-
 points and confrontation lines often made movement difficult. Moreover, as a matter
 of policy, the Government sought to avoid letting all would-be refugees flee to avoid
 both depopulating the country and creating massive resettlement problems through-
 out Europe. The Government declared that any citizen of any of the former Yugo-
 slav republics present in Bosnia as of April 6, 1992 was a Bosnian citizen and could
 not leave Bosnia without special permission, especially military-age males. Serbs
 and Croats in Sarajevo complained that it was more difficult for them to obtain per-
 mission to leave the city than it was for Bosniaks, and that the Government abused
 Article 33 of the Law on Travel Orders, which authorizes restrictions on the move-
 ment of possible terrorists, to discriminate against them. Sarajevo Serbs in particu-
 lar complained that government authorities arbitrarily denied them permission to
 cross the 'Peace Bridge" into Serb-controlled Saradevo even after they had scheduled
 a date to cross and paid the required fee (30 German marks). Bosniaks, too, com-
 plained about the difficulties in obtaining permission to leave, which was virtually
 impossible for military-age men of any ethnic group.
 Under the Dayton Agreement, all refugees-however defined-have the right of
 return or just compensation.
 Croat authorities so far have been slow to permit the agreed number of Muslims
 to resettle in Jsje and Stolac. As a clear demonstration of the bad faith that exists
 on both sides, lists of names of refugees accepted for return have included the
 names of people who died before the fighting began, and of refugees who have per-
 manently settled abroad. The Bosnian Government generally permits Croats to
 enter and travel in Muslim territory more easily than Croat authorities allow Mus-
 lims to cross into Croat areas. In addition to official obstacles, many refugees on
 both sides are afraid to return to their former homes, since they fear that they
 would no longer be welcome there.
 All sides have been credibly accused of 'ethnic engineering," the process of reset-
 tling refugees of one side's ethnic group into the homes of members of other ethnic
 groups in a given area to prevent the return of the other side's people to that area.
 On the Federation side, the Ombudsmen received numerous cases of Serbs, Croats
 or other minorities returning to their homes only to find that Bosniak refugees had
 been moved in. In some cases returning Bosniaks found that their property had
 been taken over by officials of the mostly-Bosniak SDA. A Bosniak woman returning
 to her home in Vrnograc near Velika Kiadusa told U.N. officials that the Mayor had
 moved into her house and refused to leave. The Government was generally
 unhelpful to the Ombudsmen in their attempts to resolve these cases. In one case
 an elderly Jewish woman, Viola Drucker, had left Sarajevo in 1992. When she re-
 turned in 1995, she found that her home was occupied by a Bosniak from Sarajevo
 whose family already had a house in Sarajevo. According to the Ombudsmen, the
 Government made an agreement with the Sarajevo Jewish community in 1992 to
 protect the homes of its members. The Rais el-Ulema, head of Sarajevo's Muslim
 community, intervened on Ms. Drucker's behalf but the Government still refused to
 return her property. In another case, a Bosniak woman returned to her house in
 Sarejevo to find an SDA official living there. The Government was also accused of
 seizing former JNA housing that had been purchased from the JNA under special
 agreement by JNA officers, especially housing owned by minority officers. President
 Izetbegovic decreed that the legal status of JNA housing be "frozen" until the end
 of the war. A number of the officers' families have already been evicted and the
 housing given to Bosniak refugees.
 
 
 803
 
 A common attitude within the Government and the SDA was summed upby the
 Secretary of the Sarajevo Municipality Committee for Housing Affairs when-he said,
 "Those who left the country abandoning their property shouldnot be protected." The
 assumption is that fleeing the war also indicates voluntary abandonment of prop-
 erty. The property issue is expected to take on greater importance in 1996 as the
 repatriation of refugees begins. Although better documented in the Bosniak side of
 the Federation, potential property claims exist throughout Bosnia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens of the Bosnian Federation have the right to change their government
 peacefully, both through direct elections and by amending the Constitution. The
 next elections are sheduled for the second half of 1996 and will be held throughout
 Bosnia and Herzegovina, as required by the Dayton Agreement.
 The delay in establishing the Federation's internal structure was compuounded by
 the nature of the Federation as a state of Bosniaks, Croats, and "others. Under the
 Constitution, power is to be shared primarily between Bosnians and Croats. How-
 ever, it became clear that, in practice, "Bosnians" actually meant the dominant Mus-
 lim political party SDA, and Croats" meant the dominant Croat party HDZ. Among
 the quasi-disfranchised "others" were non-SDA Muslims and non-HDZ Croats, along
 with Serbs who had been loyal to the multiethnic republic, Bosnians of mixed eth-
 nicity (estimated to make up 30 percent of the prewar Bosnian population), Jews,
 Roma, Vlachs, and the rest of Bosnia's varied ethnic  i
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics, although a few women
 occupy prominent positions. For example, a Serbian woman belongs to the Repub-
 lic's collective presidency, and a Bosniak woman heads Bosnian radio and television.
 Although people on territory controlled by the Serbian Republic have a theoretical
 right to change their government and actualy participated in "referendums," SDS
 control of the media and security apparatus effectively precludes true citizen partici-
 pation without intimidation. In the Republika Srpska women such as Karadzic's
 daughter, his wife (head of the Serbian Republic Red Cross), and one of his vice
 presidents occupy important posts.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In general, the Government permits international and NGO investigations of al-
 leged human rights violations, Herceg-Bosna authorities permit them to a much
 lesser extent, and the Republika Srpska is least responsive. Officials of the U.N. war
 crimes tribunal said that the Bosnian Government was cooperating fully with their
 investigations and inquiries, even in cases of accusations of war crimes by Bosnian
 forces, but cooperation by the Bosnian Croats and the Republika Srpska is far more
 limited.
 According to the Federation Agreement, three Ombudsmen, one Bosniak, one
 Croat, and one other were appointed for a 3-year term by the OSCE with the ap-
 proval of the Federation President and Vice President. Their mandate is to protect
 human rights and liberties as guaranteed by the Constitution. They monitor human
 rights abuses and seek to reverse the consequences of human rights violations, espe-
 cially ethnic cleansing. The Ombudsmen have broad investigative powers and may
 initiate or intervene in court proceedings. They may also seek redress for individual
 complaints. In 1995 they received thousands of individual complaints, mostly con-
 cerning violation of property rights and freedom of movement. The Ombudsmen
 have done substantial work in collecting and cataloging abuses, and have succeeded
 in resolving some cases. However, their actual power is quite limited, and govern-
 ment agencies usually ignore them with impunity, especially on cases involving the
 ruling SDA and HVZ parties. A Human Rights Commission, provided for in the
 Dayton Agreement, will work closely with the Ombudsman.
 The Bosnian Serbs generally refused to cooperate with any sort of investigation
 of alleged human rights abuses and made it clear, as in the case of American jour-
 nalist David Rohde, who was seized because of his investigations into the Srebrenica
 killings (see Section 2.a.), that such activity could be dangerous. However, Federal
 Republic of Yugoslavia President Slobedan Milosevic said he would urge the
 Bosnian Serb authorities to cooperate with the ICRC and other international organi-
 zations in investigating the fate of some 1,400 persons missing from Banja Luka,
 and to provide access to international investigative missions to sites of alleged
 human rights atrocities. These diplomatic efforts eventually led Serb authorities to
 grant the ICRC access to Bosnian Serb prisons known to the organization. However
 it is widely believed that there are other prisons still not known to international
 observers.
 
 
 804
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rel4gion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for freedom from discrimination based on race, color
 sex, language, religion or creed, political, or other opinions, and national or social
 origin. As described above, however, there were many cases of discrimination.
 Women.-Women continue to be subjected to rape and other forms of physical
 abuse. Rape was one of the most frequently used tools of ethnic cleansing by the
 Bosnian Serbs (see Sections 1.c. and 1.g.). In northern Bosnia a 76-year-old woman
 was raped in the process of expulsion from her home. In Srebrenica a 91-year-old
 woman was shot to death for not getting into a bus fast enough.
 Although accurate statistics are not available because of wartime conditions there
 appears to be little legal or social discrimination against women. Women hola some
 of the most responsible positions in society, including judges, doctors, and profes-
 sors. For example, a Muslim woman heads Bosnian radio and television. Women are
 entitled to 12 months' maternity leave and required to work no more than 4 hours
 per day until a child is 3 years old. A woman with underage children may not be
 forced to do shift work.
 Children.-There is no discrimination or societal pattern of abuse against chil-
 dren. It is too early to tell what the long-term effects of the privations of war will
 have on the next generation of Bosnians. In addition to the shortages of food and
 clothing, closing of schools, and an environment constricted by sniping and shelling,
 the loss of one or both parents and other relatives-often brutally before their
 eyes--will likely have a significant long-term effect on Bosnia's children.
 In the course of the war, nearly 17,000 children were killed, 35,000 wounded, and
 over 1,800 permanently disabled. In Sarajevo alone over 1,600 were killed, 15,000
 wounded, and over 350 permanently disabled. Many of those killed in Sarajevo were
 killed by snipers, who could easily distinguish between children and adults. In fact
 Serb snipers deliberately targeted children, and Serb artillery deliberately targeted
 schools and playgrounds for shelling. The elementary school in Alipasina Pale, a
 suburb of Saaeo was shelled twice in the spring;, the first attack killed four pu-
 pils and a teacher and wounded 34, the second attack killed 7 and wounded 8. The
 small playground above the main Sarajevo marketplace was also attacked twice; two
 children were killed in the first attack and 4 killed and 4 wounded in the second.
 None of these places were located near military targets.
 People With Disabilities.-By law the Government is required to assist people
 with disabilities in finding employment and protecting them against discrimination.
 In the current situation there are few jobs available, and approximately 12,000
 newly disabled victims of the war entering the job market. The Government had
 limited resources to address the special needs of the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic differences--complicated by religious
 differences--are at the heart of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and have been
 manipulated by both the SDS party and the HDZ to sustain concepts of a "Greater
 Serbiae and a "Greater Croatia." The serious human rights violations committed in
 Bosnia and Herzegovina-ethnic cleansing, rape, forced labor, forced relocation,
 extrajudicial killing-were largely perpetrated with the goal of establishing the su-
 periority and political domination of a particular ethnic group. No group was more
 victimized than Bosnia's Muslims.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of workers
 to form and join labor unions. The largest union is the Confederation of Independent
 Trade Unions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the heir of the old Yugoslav Communist
 Trade Union Confederation. Unions have the right to strike, but in practice mobili-
 zation and other emergency wartime measures generally restricted the exercise of
 this right. Moreover, the economic devastation and joblessness caused by the war
 thrughout much of the Federation allowed trade unions little opportunity to orga-
 nize and carry out their normal role.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for this
 right, but the practice of collective bargaining in labor-management negotiations
 was not significantly used in 1995.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Most Bosnians of productive age
 in the Federation were mobilized to serve either in the military or in supporting ca-
 pacities in connection with the war. Government authorities in practice tolerated a
 significant amount of independent freedom of choice in the selection of work to fulfill
 the obligations imposed by the mobilization decree. Reliable sources reported wide-
 scale use of prisoners for forced labor on the front lines by the Bosnian Serbs, and
 to a much more limited extent by the Federation (see Section 1.c.).

 According to reliable reports the Serbs maintain a number of forced labor camps
 not yet discovered by the ICRC or other international humanitarian oranizations.
 Non-Serb men and women in northern Bosnia, ages 12 to 60, were routinely forced
 to labor digging trenches, clearing mines, tilling fields, cleaning streets, etc. They
 received no compensation for this work.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of children remained 16. Bosnia had no effective social services agency to enforce
 the limit. Children sometimes assisted their families with farm work and odd jobs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum monthly wage is slightly more
 than $15 (20 German marks, the de facto currency), and $13 per month for pension-
 ers. In principle this wage level is guaranteed, but in reality it is meaning less as
 the economy is in a state of collapse. Workers were often not paid for all the work
 that they performed. The official wartime workweek is 7 hours per day, Monday
 through Saturday, though many people worked far more hours. Holidays are gen-
 erally ignored with the exception of New Year's and certain Muslim holidays.
 Occupational safety and health regulations were generally sacrificed because of
 the demands and constraints imposed by the war.
