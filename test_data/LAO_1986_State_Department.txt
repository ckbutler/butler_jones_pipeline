 LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) is ruled by a
 Communist Government established in December 1975 after an
 insurgency of 20 years supported by North Vietnam. The sole
 political party, the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP),
 takes its political ideology from Marx, Lenin, and Ho Chi
 Minh. It is dependent on Vietnamese and Soviet military and
 economic support to retain power. Laos' approximately 3.6
 million ethnically diverse people, scattered over more than
 91,000 square miles of rugged terrain, have no common national
 history and share few traditions. National institutions
 remain weak. The Fourth Party Congress held in November 1986
 failed to indicate the status of preparations of a
 constitution or even to repeat the 1982 Congress' goal to
 draft one as soon as possible. There is no codified body of
 law. No national elections have been held since the
 establishment of the regime.
 The Government is seeking to establish a Communist political
 and economic structure largely based on the Soviet and
 Vietnamese models. Laos' geographical position among far
 larger and mutually hostile neighbors, plus the incursions of
 resistance groups across the country's long and hardly
 defensible lines of communication, have imposed something of a
 siege mentality on the narrowly based Lao leadership. In
 1986, however, the impact of regional tensions on Laos
 lessened, and by late in the year there were indications that
 the Lao were seeking to improve relations with both Thailand
 and China.
 The Lao Government continues to be faced with a number of
 resistance groups seeking its overthrow, but they do not
 currently appear to present a serious threat. The
 approximately 50,000 Vietnamese troops in Laos regularly
 conduct operations with the Lao People's Army (LPA) against
 resistance groups and serve as the ultimate guarantor of the
 Government's survival. The state security apparatus, which
 reinforces central control through threats, intimidation,
 fear, and imprisonment is a primary source of human rights
 abuses.
 Laos is an extremely poor, underdeveloped country. Although
 it apparently met its food needs with a successful 1985/86
 crop year, nutritional levels remain barely adequate.
 Government intervention in general has led to various supply
 shortages and disruptions.
 Human rights violations continued in 1986, and the individual
 remained subject to the arbitrary control of the State and the
 LPRP. Compared with the period just after the Communist
 takeover, there have been very limited improvements in the
 human rights situation. In 1986 some people were released
 from reeducation camps, and the conditions of some who remain
 under detention reportedly improved. However, serious abuses
 such as arbitrary arrests and detention without trial
 continue. Government controls and pressures against private
 economic activity continue, although the Fourth Party Congress
 endorsed continuing use of the "positive" elements of the
 private sector for furthering economic development.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been reports that Lao government and Vietnamese
 patrols have fatally shot persons fleeing from Laos and those
 entering the country illegally, usually smugglers or suspected
 members of the Lao resistance, but in recent years such
 reports have decreased. Refugee reports of toxic weapon use
 by government or Vietnamese forces against villagers have
 virtually ceased.
 One incident which received international attention involved
 the killing by Lao forces on June 14, 1986, of 35 persons in a
 settlement in Ban Huai Pong, Thailand, just across the
 border. Complete details still are unavailable, but it
 appears certain that elements of the LPA entered Thailand at
 that time and massacred noncombatants, including women and
 children; allegedly, the motivation arose out of a local
 vendetta.
 An unknown number of people are killed annually in combined
 Lao/Vietnamese military operations against resistance forces.
 Many of the insurgents appear to be former Royal Lao Army
 troops and Hmong tribesmen. Both sides are reported to use
 brutal tactics, with the antigovernment forces attempting
 assassination and ambush of Lao, Vietnamese, and other
 Communist military and civilian personnel. There are also
 recurrent reports of attacks by bandit groups in isolated or
 interior areas on vehicles bearing government officials and on
 civilian buses. Official policy calls for the execution of
 resistance leaders, but no such executions were reported in
 1986.
 b. Disappearance
 Although there were numerous cases of secret arrest and
 removal of persons to "reeducation" camps in the first years
 of the present regime, disappearance has been reported only
 infrequently in the last several years and not at all in 1986.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 A relatively small number of "reeducation" prisoners continue
 to be held in harsh conditions. Former prisoners have
 reported that punishment for misbehavior could include brutal
 public beatings, shackling, deprivation of food, and
 sometimes, for those who tried to escape, execution. Some
 inmates have died from malnutrition. Lao government officials
 have publicly denied reports of mistreatment of persons in
 'reeducation camps."
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Lao Government continues to maintain a number of
 "reeducation camps" in which persons associated with the
 previous Government are imprisoned. Firm figures are
 unavailable, but detainees likely number over 1,000.
 Since 1979 conditions in most of the "reeducation" camps have
 improved, and a number of camps reportedly have been closed.
 
 
 761
 LAOS
 Most detainees now live in a kind of internal exile with
 severe restrictions on their freedom of movement. Generally,
 these conditions are no worse than those of poor Lao living in
 the countryside. Many reportedly have been assigned to
 collective farms or construction units inside their former
 camps. Some are on probation or cannot arrange necessary
 travel documents. Others who have lost property and families
 are reported to have chosen to remain in areas near the camps
 to begin new lives. In its 1986 Report, Amnesty
 International, citing an internal Lao government estimate,
 asserted that 5,000 people remained in "reeducation," and it
 continued to work on behalf of 40 persons confined in
 "reeducation camps."
 In 1986 government officials claimed, as they had in 1985,
 that nearly all soldiers and officials sent to "reeducation
 camps" in 1975-76 had been "released" and that "only a few"
 people remained under detention. In 1986 the Government
 permitted at least 85, and possibly as many as 119,
 "reeducation camp" prisoners to return to Vientiane.
 Those accused of hostility to the regime or of what the
 Government calls "socially undesirable habits," such as
 prostitution, drug abuse, idleness, and "wrong thought," are
 sent to "rehabilitation" centers, usually without trial. Most
 of these persons have been allowed to return to their homes
 after periods ranging from a few months to several years of
 hard labor, political indoctrination, and admission of guilt.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 No code of law exists in Laos, and there is no guarantee of
 due process. In addition to working on the rehabilitation of
 the court system, the Government in the last year transferred
 some personnel with legal backgrounds to the Justice Ministry,
 reportedly to speed up the revision of the pre-1975 law code.
 It has promulgated interim rules and regulations for the
 arrest and trial of those accused of specific crimes,
 including armed resistance to the Government. Although the
 regulations allow an accused person to make a statement
 presenting his side of the case, they provide no real
 opportunity for the accused to defend himself and do not
 permit bail or use of an attorney. Rather, the Government has
 issued instructions on how to investigate, prosecute, and
 punish wrongdoers. These instructions are applied
 capriciously and inconsistently. People can be arrested on
 the unsupported accusations of others and detained while the
 accusations are being investigated, without being informed of
 the charges or the identity of the person making the
 accusations. Investigations often take a long time unless
 family members and friends take a strong interest in the
 case. Government officials and their families easily can
 influence the judgments reached. There is some provision for
 appeal, although important political cases tried by "people's
 courts" are without an appeals process. Death sentences must
 be approved by the Council of Ministers. Lao regulations call
 for judgment to be given in public. This is, in effect, a
 public announcement of the sentence and not a public trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Search and seizure are authorized by the security bureaus
 themselves rather than by an impartial judicial authority, and
 government regulations, which are not always followed, provide
 
 
 762
 LAOS
 little protection for the persons affected. International and
 domestic mail is selectively opened on a routine basis. Mail
 from China and non-Communist countries is particularly
 suspect. Telephone calls frequently are monitored. Privately
 owned land may not be sold but may be inherited. Houses,
 appliances, and other private property can be sold only with
 difficulty in most cases, since the possession of large
 amounts of cash in this poor country draws immediate
 government suspicion. Inheritances cannot be passed on to
 relatives who have left the country as refugees and acquired
 another nationality.
 The Government makes no attempt to stop Lao from listening to
 foreign radio stations such as the Voice of America, nor from
 setting up antennas to bring in Thai television from across
 the Mekong River. The state security apparatus monitors
 family life extensively through a system of neighborhood
 wardens and informers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Lao press, owned by the Government and the LPRP, is
 dedicated to the dissemination of the official line. Only
 government officials and others whom the Government determines
 have a professional need are authorized to possess
 non-Communist foreign newspapers, magazines, and other
 publications. Neither written nor spoken expressions of
 opposition to the Government are permitted. Persons who have
 engaged, in such activity have been imprisoned. Most Lao are
 discouraged from serious discussion or association with
 foreigners. Academic freedom does not exist.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government controls all meetings and, except for
 religious, athletic, and communal events, organizes them.
 Individuals do not have the right to join together to promote
 nonregime-sponsored activities nor to protest government
 policies. All associations--such as those for youth, women,
 workers, and a "peace organization"--are government-controlled
 and authorized "mass organizations." These are organized to
 exercise government control and disseminate government
 policy. All professional groups are organized by the party,
 and their leadership is ordinarily drawn from party ranks.
 Lao associations are permitted to maintain relations with
 like-minded politically acceptable organizations in other
 countries, particularly those in Communist countries.
 Ordinary Lao citizens are permitted association or contact
 with foreigners only in unusual circumstances, usually
 involving their work.
 Trade unions are organized as "mass organizations" of the
 party without the right to engage in collective bargaining.
 They have no real influence in determining working conditions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Nearly all Lao are Buddhists or, in the case of most hill
 tribesmen, animists. In official statements, the Government
 has recognized the right of the people to free exercise of
 religious belief as well as the contributions religion can
 make to the development of the country.
 
 
 763
 LAOS
 Many Lao believe, however, that the Government is engaged in a
 long-term effort to subvert the role of religion because it
 considers the maintenance of temples and the activities of
 monks nonproductive and because it objects to an active group
 with an independent system of beliefs. This effort includes
 carefully controlling the education of young monks and
 compelling the Buddhist clergy to propagate elements of
 Marxist-Leninist doctrine. Further, since 1975, the
 Government has periodically taken over Buddhist and Christian
 places of worship for use as government schools, offices, fire
 and police stations, as well as political indoctrination
 centers and warehouses. While some limited restoration and
 construction of Buddhist temples has resumed, at least in the
 Vientiane area, this practice is seriously discouraged by the
 Government.
 In spite of these efforts, monks remain the only social group
 still entitled to special honorific terms of address, and even
 high party and government officials continue to use them. Lao
 Buddhist clergy were prominently featured among those invited
 to attend the opening session of the Fourth Party Congress.
 Religious festivals are permitted to take place without
 hindrance. Young people regularly enter into religious orders
 for short periods.
 Links may be maintained with coreligionists and religious
 associations in other countries only in cases approved by the
 Government, usually other Communist countries. Most
 traditional links to Thai Buddhists have been severed,
 although the Lao did host a leftist 10-member Thai Buddhist
 delegation in February. Missionaries are not formally banned
 from entering Laos to proselytize, but in most cases they are
 denied permission. Many top party officials still participate
 in religious ceremonies, but members of the military are
 forbidden even to have Buddhist funerals.
 Roman Catholics and Protestants are permitted to worship, but
 the activities of their churches are closely observed. A few
 church leaders remained under detention, either without being
 charged or for alleged antiregime activity.
 Since 1975 Christians have not been permitted to operate
 schools, seminaries, or associations, although a Catholic
 priest was ordained in 1986 after private study, and some
 short-term training sessions for local Protestant church
 leaders have been permitted. In Vientiane during August 1986,
 50 Lao children received confirmation in the Catholic church.
 overseas Catholic church officials visited Laos in 1986 to
 meet with local church leaders as well as government officials.
 The Government takes steps including the use of media to
 persuade hill tribe minority groups to abandon their "old
 fashioned" animist beliefs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Lao citizens must obtain permission from the authorities for
 all internal travel of any distance and in all cases when
 crossing provincial boundaries. Non-Lao residents in
 Vientiane must in principle obtain permission to travel
 outside it, and in practice, except for nationals of a very
 few other countries, such permission is rarely granted. A
 curfew is enforced intermittently in the capital and other
 major cities. Its rules change from time to time, often
 
 
 764
 LAOS
 without notice. Government officials have cited threats of
 "disorders" created by "reactionary elements" as the reason
 for the restrictions.
 Foreign travel is permitted for officials, students in
 government-approved programs, and some others who have access
 to foreign exchange. Lao rarely are permitted to study or
 train in non-Communist countries, even at their own expense.
 Exit visas, which are required, have been difficult to obtain
 in the past, but for some classes of applicants, especially
 the elderly, the process seems to be getting easier. Since
 1983 the number of Lao travelling to the West has increased.
 Border crossing permits are available for those with business
 in Thailand. Such permits, however, may be denied if the
 Government finds the business unnecessary.
 Although the Government has said that those wishing to
 emigrate will be allowed to do so, as a practical matter legal
 emigration is rarely authorized for ethnic Lao and, when it
 is, reportedly requires substantial bribes. Since 1975 over
 300,000 of the Lao who have fled Laos have registered as
 refugees in Thailand. An unknown number of other Lao who have
 fled the country have simply settled in with kindred ethnic
 groups.
 Some of those fleeing are fired upon and killed by Lao or
 Vietnamese border patrols as they attempt to cross the Mekong
 River. Government authorities have imprisoned many Lao
 seeking to leave the country illegally, although in some cases
 they have only been sent to short indoctrination seminars and
 then released.
 The Lao and Thai Governments have agreed to take back, on a
 case-by-case basis, those of-their respective citizens who
 have illegally crossed into the other country and now wish to
 return home. Since May 1980, when agreement was reached with
 Thailand and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) on a voluntary repatriation program, some 3,000 Lao
 voluntarily have returned to Laos under the auspices of the
 UNHCR. Those accepted for return receive several days of
 political indoctrination and then are released to return to
 their homes, where they are placed under the control of
 village authorities. The UNHCR provides basic necessities for
 the returnees and monitors their treatment and living
 conditions thereafter. In addition, perhaps as many as 10,000
 individuals have repatriated themselves without official
 involvement. There appears to be no pattern of official
 harassment or maltreatment of these voluntary returnees.
 The LPDR also has agreed in principle to take back Lao in
 Thailand whom the Thai have determined do not meet the
 requirements for refugee status. Procedures for the return of
 these Lao were being worked out in late 1986 with the help of
 the UNHCR.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Laos is ruled by a small elite of the LPRP, the sole party.
 There is neither freedom to participate in politics outside
 the party not popular choice of policies or officials. After
 the Communists seized power in May'1975, but before the
 establishment of the present regime in December of that year,
 local elections were held'in which voters chose from a list of
 candidates selected by the party. Reportedly, those local
 
 
 765
 LAOS
 officials not only constituted the National Council of
 People's Representatives, which proclaimed the LPDR, but also
 chose the Supreme People's Assembly, although the latter
 process was not publicized. There have been no national
 elections. A few "by-elections" have been organized to
 replace representatives who have died or been transferred.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Laos has refused to cooperate with the UN Secretary General's
 investigation of the use of chemical/toxin weapons in Laos.
 It also does not cooperate with private international
 organizations interested in human rights. It does
 occasionally permit visits by officials of international human
 rights organizations if the purpose of the visit is not
 specifically related to allegations of human rights
 violations. In the past, the Lao Government has permitted the
 UNHCR to investigate to a limited degree the status of Lao
 voluntarily repatriated from Thailand. In both 1985 and 1986,
 the Lao received a brief visit from a high UNHCR official.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Traditionally, women in Lao society have been subservient to
 men and often discouraged from obtaining an education. Today
 the active, Government-controlled Lao Women's Federation has
 as one of its stated goals the achievement of rights for women
 "equal" to those of men. The Government claims that a higher
 percentage of women make up the school population now than
 before 1975, and women are being encouraged to assume a
 greater role in economic and state-controlled political
 activity.
 Approximately half of the population in Laos is ethnic Lao,
 also called "lowland Lao"; 20 percent are tribal Thai; 15
 percent are Phoutheung (or Kha); and other mountain tribes
 constitute another 15 percent (Hmong, Yao, and others). The
 Lao Government is attempting to integrate these groups and
 overcome traditional antagonisms between lowland Lao and
 minority groups.
 The Hmong are split on clan lines. Many were strongly
 anti-Communist; others sided with the Communist Pathet Lao and
 the Vietnamese. The Government is repressive toward all
 groups that fought against it, especially those continuing to
 resist its authority by force. The Hmong tried to defend some
 of their tribal areas after 1975 and some continue to support
 anti-LPDR resistance groups. Vietnamese and Lao armed forces
 conduct military operations against both resistance groups,
 the tribally based ones in the north and the resistance forces
 from lowland Lao groups, mainly in southern Laos.
 The Government wants to resettle in the lowlands some ethnic
 minorities who now inhabit mountainous areas. After
 resettlement they would be under closer government control and
 engage in settled agricultural production rather than
 destructive slash-and-burn techniques. For this purpose, the
 Government has reportedly abandoned the use of force in favor
 of a voluntary program based on material inducements. The
 situation for local ethnic Chinese has been marked by
 Government suspicion and surveillance in the period after 1979
 when Sino-Lao relations deteriorated seriously. These
 
 
 766
 LAOS
 relations appear to be on the mend after a recent Chinese vice
 ministerial visit which should improve the atmosphere for the
 approximately 3,000 Chinese who remain in Laos. A majority of
 the Chinese community departed in the post-1975 period,
 largely for economic reasons. Those who remain have
 maintained Chinese schools in Vientiane and Savannakhet and
 Chinese associations in several provincial capitals.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Laos has set neither minimum wage, maximum workweek, nor
 safety or health standards for the workers in its almost
 entirely rural and agricultural economy. Public wages in
 particular remain extremely low. Workweeks typically are
 under 48 hours, with some exceptions, such as during urgent
 road-building or construction projects. Workplace conditions
 are not systematically exploitative, but they sometimes fail
 to protect workers adequately against sickness or accident.
 Work permits customarily are not issued to persons under age
 18, although children frequently work with their parents in
 traditional occupations such as farming and shopkeeping.
