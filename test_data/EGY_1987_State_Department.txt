 EGYPT
 Egypt is a republic in which the President and his party, the
 National Democratic Party (NDP), are the major political
 forces. The NDP commands large majorities in the two
 parliamentary institutions, the People's Assembly and the
 Shura (consultative) Council. Opposition parties, which in
 1987 increased their representation in the People's Assembly,
 monitor and criticize government policies and performance.
 The Cabinet is headed by a Prime Minister responsible to the
 President.
 Hosni Mubarak, vice president under Anwar Sadat, was elected
 President in 1981 after Sadat's assassination. He was elected
 to a second 6-year term by the People's Assembly in July; in
 accordance with the Constitution, his reelection was affirmed
 by a popular referendum in October. The governmental and
 legal systems are based on Egypt's Muslim and Arab heritage,
 as well as the experience of the 1952 revolution. Western
 influences are also present, reflected in the country's
 Napoleonic legal code.
 The state of emergency proclaimed after Sadat's assassination
 has been maintained through extensions decreed by President
 Mubarak, with the approval of the People's Assembly. Under
 it, the President and his delegate, the Minister of Interior,
 can suspend certain constitutional and legal safeguards
 normally associated with the protection of civil and political
 liberties.
 In 1987 the Government primarily applied the emergency
 legislation to Islamic radicals, several thousand of whom were
 arrested after the attempted assassination of a former Minister
 of Interior in May (most had been released by October).
 Leftists suspected of involvement in political violence were
 also apprehended under the emergency law, as were a number of
 drug smugglers and black market currency dealers. Islamic and
 leftist activists are generally able to pursue their social
 and political causes through legitimate channels such as the
 People's Assembly, the judiciary, and the press. The Muslim
 Brotherhood, a long-banned political organization advocating
 the establishment of an Islamic state in Egypt, was allowed to
 enter into a political alliance with two opposition parties
 and run a number of candidates in the 1987 parliamentary
 elections. Opposition parties of the left and the right
 function legally, and exert influence particularly through
 their newspapers. The opposition parties have called for
 amending the electoral law to allow direct election of
 parliamentary candidates, and for the amending of the
 Constitution to allow for direct presidential elections.
 The preservation of domestic order and the protection of
 national security interests are the responsibility of a number
 of different organizations, each having specific areas of
 responsibility and authority, although they may overlap to
 some extent. Three separate intelligence services are
 attached to separate ministries or executive authorities:
 General Intelligence (GI) is attached to the Presidency,
 Military Intelligence (MI) to the Ministry of Defense, and the
 General Directorate for State Security Investigations (GDSSI)
 to the Ministry of Interior. GDSSI is under the direct control
 of the Minister of Interior, but a number of other police
 departments, including the Central Security Forces used to
 protect public buildings, facilities and foreign missions, are
 the responsibility of Deputy Ministers of Interior.
 Investigations pertaining to national security matters may be
 
 
 1132
 EGYPT
 undertaken by any of the three intelligence agencies, depending
 on the nature of the case. Riot and crowd control is generally
 the responsibility of the Central Security Forces, although in
 some cases the army may be used for this purpose.
 Egypt's economy has diversified substantially over the past
 two decades, with the traditional agricultural base
 supplemented by the growth of industry, tourism, and petroleum.
 While the public sector continues to dominate the Egyptian
 industry, and an extensive network of food and energy subsidies
 remains a burden on public finances, Egypt is committed to
 economic liberalization and has targeted the private sector as
 the engine for future economic growth. Economic reform
 measures in 1987 included exchange rate unification,
 agricultural liberalization, an export promotion campaign, and
 budgetary controls. The Government's reform efforts were
 endorsed by the International Monetary Fund, thereby paving
 the way for a rescheduling of Egyptian
 debts.
 Reflecting increased security concerns in 1987, the Government
 retained some restrictions on political activities and
 continued its occasional use of emergency law authority to
 detain suspects affiliated with groups advocating violence. A
 series of armed attacks on public figures and American
 diplomats in the spring led to an unusually large number of
 arrests of Islamicextremists, but most were released after
 interrogation. In general, observers continued to credit the
 President in 1987 for protecting press freedoms, expanding
 political participation, and resisting curbs on political
 expression. He allowed previously restricted commentators to
 publish their views and opened up the electoral process to
 independent candidates holding a variety of political views.
 While some Christians wdre concerned by the potential threat
 to their rights posed by resurgent Islamic forces, the
 Government generally demonstrated its commitment to protecting
 minority rights. Coptic Pope Shenouda III, who has criticized
 the Government in the past, publicly commended President
 Mubarak and called on the Coptic community to support the
 President's reelection. Forty-eight members of the Baha'i
 faith remained free while appealing their conviction in May in
 a case that began in February 1985. The Baha'is were charged
 under a law, existing since Nasser, banning public Baha'i
 religious activities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of government-instigated killings for
 political reasons. A series of attempted assassinations
 occurred in Cairo during May and June. Gunmen shot and
 wounded former Interior Minister Abu Basha in front of his
 house in early May. Similar attempts were made by small
 groups of gunmen, armed with semiautomatic weapons, on the
 lives of a well-known magazine editor and another former
 Interior Minister, Nabawi Ismail. No one was killed in these
 incidents. After identifying the assailants as probable
 members of an extremist Islamic organization, the security
 services arrested several thousand suspected sympathizers of
 Islamic radicalism.
 
 
 1133
 EGYPT
 In August the security services killed one member and captured
 another leader of a radical Islamic group calling itself "The
 Survivors of Hell." Members of this group were later charged
 with responsibility for all three assassination attempts. In
 November the Public Prosecutor announced the arraignment of 33
 members of the group, accusing them of conspiracy to murder
 public figures, the murder of a police officer, and membership
 in an organization committed to the overthrow of the regime.
 In May a different group of gunmen fired on three U.S.
 diplomats riding in a car. All three escaped with superficial
 wounds. A group calling itself "Egypt's Nasserist Revolution"
 claimed responsibility for the attack. This group had
 previously claimed responsibility for three separate attacks
 in the past 3 years on Israeli diplomats in Cairo, which left
 two Israelis killed and several others wounded. In September
 the security services arrested a number of members of this
 terrorist organization. A press ban was imposed on the Public
 Prosecutor's pretrial investigation, but members of the
 organization were expected to go to trial in the near future.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although torture and other forms of mistreatment are forbidden
 by the Constitution and by law, there are periodic reports of
 torture and ill-treatment of prisoners. Detainees and
 prisoners who claim to have been tortured can and do appeal
 for redress to the courts or the Public Prosecutor. After
 investigations by legal and medical authorities, the appeals
 sometimes have concluded with the Government's denial of the
 alleged torture. In a few instances, the courts have awarded
 financial compensation to torture victims. More often, the
 Government has not revealed the findings of its investigations.
 Information gained through torture is not admissible in court,
 and the law provides that police and security officials
 convicted of torture are subject to punishment. However,
 reported cases of officials being penalized have been rare.
 In November 1984, the Public Prosecutor initiated a major
 investigation of torture incidents disclosed by the Supreme
 State Security Court in the Al-Jihad case that ended in
 September 1983. Although the defendants were accused of
 assassinating President Sadat and planning an uprising in
 Upper Egypt which they expected to spread throughout the
 country, the court cited torture as a factor in its decision
 to acquit 190 out of the 300 Al-Jihad defendants and reduce
 prison sentences for others. In September 1986, the
 prosecutor announced that torture charges against 44 police
 officers and 4 court assistants would be referred to criminal
 court. The prosecutor declared that, on the basis of 422
 reports of torture of the AI-Jihad defendants, 28 torture
 charges would be brought against the accused police officers,
 while the investigation into 22 other charges would be
 continued. The court suspended hearing the case in April,
 however, after the attorneys for the torture victims raised
 objections to the composition of the panel of judges, claiming
 that two were sympathetic to the defendants. A decision is
 still pending in the Cairo appellate court. If convicted, the
 accused officers could face sentences of 3 to 10 years of hard
 labor or imprisonment.
 
 
 1134
 EGYPT
 Allegations of torture appear periodically in the opposition
 press, and received renewed attention after the arrests of
 Islamic activists following the attempted assassination of Abu
 Basha in May. According to some reports, physical abuse of
 these detainees occurred but ceased in August after Abu
 Basha's presumed attackers were captured. The opposition
 newspaper Al-Wafd has accused Interior Minister Badr of using
 torture against Islamic activists suspected of involvement in
 subversive or violent activity. Al-Wafd has published
 photographs of the scarred bodies of Islamic activists who it
 says were victims of torture inflicted in Egyptian jails and
 prisons. The Egyptian Bar Association's Committee for the
 Defense of Freedom has also charged the security services with
 using torture against the defendaits in the 1986 video club
 arson cbses.
 In June the Ministry of Interior announced that three
 individuals had confessed to the attempted assassinaton of
 former Interior Minister Abu Basha. Subsequently, however,
 the establishment press reported that the suspects had
 retracted their confessions. Members of the "Survivors of
 Hell" were later arrested and fomally charged with this
 attempt and other acts of violence. In early December,
 several opposition papers launched a strong attack on the
 Ministry of Interior, charging that false confessions had been
 extracted from the three original arrestees under torture.
 The articles were accompanied by photographs of the three that
 purported to show the effects of the torture.
 In a newsletter dated June 22, Amnesty International (AI)
 repeated earlier expressions of concern over "reports of
 torture and ill-treatment in detention of alleged members and
 supporters of Islamic groups." AI noted in its 1987 annual
 Report that it had interviewed former prisoners who claimed to
 have been tortured in Tora and Abu Za'abal prisons in 1986,
 and thati"official forensic medical reports stated that in
 some cases, scars and injuries they had sustained were
 consistent with allegations of torture." AI has sought urgent
 assurances from the Government -that all possible measures are
 taken to ensure that torture does not occur, but noted in its
 1987 annual report that it has not received replies to its
 requests about torture.
 Prison conditions and treatment vary considerably; some
 facilities appear to lack adequate medical and sanitary
 facilities. Tora Prison, in which the Al-Jihad convicts are
 imprisoned, has a particularly bad reputation. Other prisons
 provide better living conditions and offer inmates recreational
 programs and vocational training.
 The Arab Human Rights Organization, in its annual report
 "Human Rights in the Arab Nation, 1987," criticizes what it
 terms "the supervision" by officers of the General Directorate
 for State Security Investigations (GDSSI) of the prison system.
 The organization claims that the alleged GDSSI presence in the
 prisons is a violation of Egyptian law, which provides for the
 prison authority to have sole responsibility for prison
 administration.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Two systems of criminal procedure are in effect: ordinary
 criminal procedures and the emergency law.  Under ordinary
 procedures, arrests follow investigations, and arrested
 persons are charged with violations of specific laws. With
 
 
 1135
 EGYPT
 the exception of certain applications of the emergency
 legislation, preventive detention is not practiced. Arrested
 persons have the right to a judicial determination of the
 legality of detention, and there is a system of bail. The
 ordinary law states that a detained suspect must be brought
 before a magistrate and formally charged within 48 hours of
 his arrest or else released. By and large, there is careful
 observance of constitutional and legal safeguards in the
 arrest and pretrial custody stages. Arrests occur openly and
 with warrants, and the accused are brought before an
 independent judiciary. The Government does not appear to
 practice incommunicado detention.
 The major exceptions to the normal procedures arise when the
 emergency law, which gives the Government extraordinary powers,
 is applied. The Constitution and the Emergency Law of 1958,
 as amended, empower the President, when security or public
 order are in peril, to invoke emergency powers authorizing the
 arrest and detention of persons suspected of being dangerous
 to state security, irrespective of provisions of the penal
 code. Detainees must be charged for specific violations of
 the penal code if brought to trial, but may be held under the
 emergency authority for the purpose of interrogation without
 charge. Egyptian law specifies a wide range of offenses
 deemed harmful to national security which may be tried before
 a parallel system of state security courts under the emergency
 law. In some cases, the President may order defendants in
 state security cases to be tried before military courts,
 although this prerogative is being challenged on constitutional
 grounds. Amendments to the emergency law in 1982 expanded the
 detainees, rights of appeal and provided for prompt redress,
 including judicial review, against improper treatment.
 Despite opposition complaints and hints from the Government
 that the law would be abolished, the NDP majority in the
 People's Assembly has repeatedly extended the law--most
 recently in April 1986 for a 2-year period.
 Under the emergency law a person may be held without charge or
 due process for two renewable 30-day periods. After the first
 30-day interval, the detainee is allowed to petition the state
 security courts for release. If the court approves the
 petition, the President or the Minister of Interior, acting as
 the President's deputy, may exercise a veto over the decision
 and keep the detainee in custody for another 30 days. Another
 circuit of the state security courts then reviews the case.
 If the second court orders the detainee's release, the
 executive must accept the ruling. However, the Minister of
 Interior may simply order the suspect's rearrest, thus
 allowing the Government the right of indefinite detention of
 suspects in state security cases through use of the emergency
 legislation. In 1987 there were many reports of cases of such
 repeated arrests, especially of Islamic activists. By October
 most had been released.
 The emergency law was invoked on a mass scale in May and June
 against suspected Islamic extremists and several hundred drug
 smugglers and black market currency dealers. Smaller numbers
 of members of underground leftist organizations were also
 detained, either for distributing banned political material or
 for interrogation in connection with the "Egypt's Revolution"
 case. There were also reports of radicals suspected of
 violence who were detained prior to the People's Assembly
 election in April and after sectarian disturbances. The
 ordinary rules for arrest, trial, and detention were applied
 in other instances.
 
 
 1136
 
 EGYPT
 The emergency legislation, and the exceptional powers it
 provides the Government, remain sources of controversy.
 Opposition parties of both the left and right assert that
 continued renewal of the state of emergency is inconsistent
 with President Mubarak's gradual liberalization of Egypt's
 political system. They argue that existing legislation is
 sufficient to deal with threats to the security of the State,
 and that the emergency legislation provides opportunities for
 abuses. Supporters of the Government respond that real
 threats to state security exist, as demonstrated by the series
 of assassination attempts of May and June, and that the
 Government needs the additional powers of detention, search,
 and seizure provided by the emergency law to confront this
 challenge.
 Exile is forbidden by law. There have been no reports of the
 use of forced labor, which is prohibited by law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Egyptian law provides for public trial and equal treatment
 before the law, and these legal safeguards are generally
 observed.. However, provisions for public trials do not apply
 in state security cases. Persons accused of certain security-
 related offenses, which may trigger emergency law provisions
 at the Minister of Interior's discretion, are usually tried in
 closed session in the state security courts. The courts,
 however, have procedural safeguards and seem to render
 verdicts without brooking interference; ultimately they have
 less independence than other courts because their decisions
 may be challenged by the executive. The judgements of the
 state security courts may be appealed to the Court of
 Cassations (Supreme Court). The law provides the President or
 his delegate, in this case a committee in the presidency, the
 authority to approve or disapprove all rulings of the state
 security court system. The security courts handled a variety
 of sensitive cases in 1987, at which all defendants were
 represented by lawyers actively defending them.
 No public statistics are available on the number of persons
 serving prison sentences for acts of violent protest or for
 membership in proscribed organizations espousing terrorism or
 the violent overthrow of the State. However, based on the
 convictions in the Al-Jihad proceedings as well as reports of
 trials in the opposition press, the number may reach 150 to
 200. The number of other detainees seems to have varied from
 several thousand during periods of tension to very few. The
 conviction and sentencing of nonviolent dissenters occurs
 rarely, if at all. The emergency law provides ample authority
 to detain without trial people believed to be planning violent
 acts against the Government, and has been used often to detain
 suspects for short periods of time for purposes of
 interrogation.
 While the judicial branch is not completely immune from
 executive branch influence, under Mubarak the judiciary has
 enjoyed an unprecedented degree of independence. Judges are
 an increasingly important group in Egyptian society, and they
 actively promote the rule of law. The High Judicial Council
 is empowered to override decisions by the Ministry of Justice
 regarding judicial appointments, promotions, and other
 personnel matters. The Council of State, a court system
 having jurisdiction over disputes between private citizens and
 government agencies, is independent of the Ministry of
 Justice, and the Council is effectively safeguarded against
 
 
 1137
 EGYPT
 arbitrary dismissal of its members. Certain officials who
 investigate the propriety of police charges against suspects
 also have been given judicial immunity to protect them from
 police pressure.
 In a number of major cases, the courts have taken decisions
 contrary to the desires of the executive branch, although some
 of the most politically sensitive of these decisions have not
 been implemented because of legal challenges by the Government.
 A decision by the Supreme Constitutional Court, determining
 that the 1983 amendments to the electoral law were
 unconstitutional, contributed to a government decision to
 dissolve the People's Assembly and hold new elections on the
 basis of a revised electoral law. The courts also have lifted
 the ban imposed by Sadat on political activity by both
 conservative Wafdist and leftist Nasserist politicians.
 A few important court decisions, however, have not been
 implemented. When the State Council Administrative Court
 ruled against the Ministry of Interior's calculation of the
 final results of the April People's Assembly elections, the
 Government blocked implementation of.the decision by
 initiating a series of appeals at different levels of the
 judicial system. The case will probably end up before the
 Supreme Constitutional Court. The Supreme State Security
 Court ruled in April that railroad conductors who went on
 strike in July 1986 had not violated the law. The
 Presidency's Committee for Verification of Judgments rejected
 the court's ruling and ordered the train conductors' case
 retried before another state security court.
 The trend toward increasing judicial independence is
 paralleled by a growing interest in developing a human rights
 curriculum in the universities. A number of them, including
 at least two provincial universities, have established human
 rights study centers attached to the faculties of law. The
 university curriculum is set on a nation-wide basis by the
 Higher Council for Universities, but individual professors
 have been free to integrate human rights issues into courses
 on international, civil, and criminal law. Egyptian jurists,
 legal experts, and human rights advocates have also been
 active in promoting an "Arab Covenant on Human Rights," and in
 urging other Arab governments to accept the draft charter.
 Two judicial institutions criticized by the opposition and
 others as superfluous and potentially dangerous to the
 judicial system are the Court of Ethics and its investigating
 agency, the Office of the Socialist Public Prosecutor.
 Created in 1980, the court is charged with trying offenders of
 "Socialist values." In 1987 the Court continued to focus on
 corruption and illegal business activities. The Office of the
 Socialist Public Prosecutor functions as investigator and
 prosecutor for the Court of Ethics. Its other tasks include
 approving candidates for elective positions in the trade union
 movement, professional syndicates, and the local government
 councils, as well as performing security checks on appointees
 to senior government positions. The Socialist Prosecutor may
 impose travel bans on officials under investigation, and may
 refer criminal cases to the public prosecutor.
 Article 2 of the Constitution states that Islamic jurisprudence
 is the principal source of law. The Government contends that
 95 percent of existing law is consistent with or derived from
 Islamic law, and senior officials in the Justice Ministry have
 described Islamic law as the "basis-of public order." However,
 literal application of Islamic law is limited to the Family
 
 
 1138
 EGYPT
 Status Courts, which have jurisdiction over such matters as
 divorce and inheritance for Muslims. In addition to Islamic
 law, these courts apply the codes of other religions in family
 matters if the parties are non-Muslim. In May 1985, the
 People's Assembly debated proposals for the implementation of
 the Shari'a (Islamic law) and voted by a large majority to
 conduct a law-by-law review of all statutes in order to change
 those conflicting with Islamic law. The review process is
 expected to require years to complete.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from arbitrary interference in private life by the
 State or by political organizations is provided for in the
 Constitution. Except when the emergency law is applied,
 police must obtain a warrant from the State Security
 Prosecutor before undertaking arrests, searches, or seizures.
 The warrant need not specify the material being sought in a
 search, and the material seized can be presented as evidence
 during trials. On occasion, the courts have dismissed cases
 when they determined warrants were issued without sufficient
 cause. Police officials who conduct searches without proper
 warrants are subject to criminal penalties.
 The emergency law empowers the President, or the Minister of
 Interior acting as his deputy, to authorize searches of
 persons or premises without following normal penal code
 procedures. Reports in the opposition press have referred to
 warrantless searches in connection with investigations of
 extremist organizations, both Islamic and leftist.
 The internal security services have the capability to monitor
 telephone and other private conversations of the political
 opposition and those suspected of illegal or subversive
 activity, and are believed to use it to some degree. Routine
 screening of correspondence, particularly international mail,
 also appears to take place. However, monitoring of
 correspondence or telephones legally requires the prior
 authorization of the State Security Prosecutor.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the
 press. People throughout Egypt openly express their views
 without fear of retribution on a wide variety of political and
 social issues, sometimes airing strong criticism of the
 Government. The Government has reacted, infrequently, to
 inflammatory remarks by some well-known extremists in public
 settings. A lrly debate of national issues and criticism of
 government officials is evident in the media and in the
 theater. A considerable quantity of commentary reflecting
 differences of opinion appears regularly in the major
 government-owned dailies and newsmagazines. The opposition
 party newspapers and the publications of Islamic groups
 contain a heavy dose of sensational stories and strong
 antigovernment criticism. The emergency law can be used to
 ban publications, but the only recent example involved a
 September issue of the opposition weekly Al-Ahali, which tried
 to publish an article concerning the ongoing investigation of
 the "Egypt's Revolution" organization. After that article was
 removed, Al-Ahali reappeared on the newstands. The press
 
 
 1139
 EGYPT
 syndicate criticized the security services for confiscating
 the newspaper without a written order from the Public
 Prosecutor.
 The opposition papers are free to publish stories supporting
 the political inclinations of their sponsoring organizations.
 Journalists and other persons slandered or maligned in the
 press may sue in court or, in the case of journalists, raise
 the matter with the press syndicate. By virtue of their
 positions, the President and members of the People's Assembly
 and the Shura Council may not sue for libel.
 Nonetheless, the Government occasionally exercises influence
 on the government-owned dailies and magazines, whose
 editors-in-chief are appointed and can be dismissed by the
 NDP-dominated Shura Council. The Council theoretically
 supervises the press to some extent through the Government's
 ownership of-the major nonparty newspapers and magazines and
 through the Higher Press Council. The latter, a 45-member
 body chaired by the Speaker of the Shura Council and composed
 of senior press figures, is not designed to facilitate press
 censorship, nor does it appear to be a very active body. One
 of the Higher Press Council's functions, however, is to
 approve applications for new publications; some applications
 to publish independently owned journals have been rejected or
 delayed for lengthy periods. This approval, however, is
 required only for publications appearing regularly on a set
 schedule. Items appearing irregularly are published without
 the Council's certification.
 There is no overt censorship. Nevertheless, journalists and
 editors working for the government-supported newspapers are
 occasionally "guided" by officials about the treatment of
 specific issues. Government guidance is given informally to
 senior editors and board chairmen by senior officials such as
 the Information Minister. This does not happen often; usually
 the editors know the policy and are aware of the limits which
 they are expected to observe. The Government does not give
 such "guidance" to the opposition press. Since Mubarak
 assumed the Presidency, there have been no confirmed reports
 of government action to silence press critics. Press coverage
 of the arrests of Islamic extremists and other sensitive
 topics during the year were not censored, and opposition press
 criticism of government policies ranging from the economy to
 the peace treaty with Israel is often virulent. No journalists
 have been arrested on political grounds, although moves have
 been taken to lift the parliamentary immunity of two opposition
 members of the People's Assembly so that they could be sued
 for libelous articles appearing in the opposition newspapers
 Al-Sha'ab and Al-Wafd. Two of the five Muslim and Coptic
 religious publications suspended by the Sadat government in
 1981 have yet to reappear in general circulation, despite a
 1982 court decision canceling the suspensions. The Muslim
 Brotherhood's Al-Daiwa remains banned, while the Coptic
 Orthodox Church's Al-Kiraza Al-Marqusiya is only circulated
 within church circles. The Government defends these
 restrictions on security grounds as important for maintaining
 communal peace.
 A wide variety of foreign reading matter in Arabic and other
 languages is available, although there are occasional reports
 of the seizure or censorship of foreign publications.
 In its 1987 Report, AI expressed concern that the state of
 emergency legislation appeared to be used to silence criticism
 
 
 1140
 EGYPT
 of the Government, and said this concern was increased by
 evidence that certain persons were arrested repeatedly.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Under the emergency law, the Government can place limitations
 on the constitutionally guaranteed right of assembly.
 Permission is required from the Interior Ministry to hold
 public meetings, mass political rallies, and protest marches.
 However, the Government has allowed opposition parties to hold
 meetings and rallies, usually stipulating that they be held
 indoors. In the campaign leading up to the April parliamentary
 elections, the opposition parties held some public rallies,
 generally without interference, although opposition sources
 complained that obtaining official permits to hold the rallies
 was often difficult. The Interior Ministry now usually allows
 Islamic organizations to organize public religious ceremonies
 on major holidays, but persons regarded as Islamic radicals
 may still be denied permission to organize public assemblies.
 Professional associations, in particular the bar association
 and the press syndicate, regularly criticize government
 policies in their pronouncements and occasionally sponsor
 protest activities. The associations operate largely free of
 government interference. In the most recent elections for the
 governing boards of the bar association and the commerce and
 engineers syndicates, there were no charges of official
 intervention.
 The law provides for workers' freedom to organize but does not
 allow collective bargaining. Strikes are strongly discouraged.
 About 20 to 25 percent of the work force is unionized. Every
 50 workers in a given activity can form a committee, which
 operates as a local union. Thesetlocals are affiliated with
 national unions, all 23 of which are required to affiliate
 with the sole labor federation, the Egyptian Trade Union
 Federation (ETUF). There have been complaints to the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) that requiring all
 unions to join a single national federation infringed upon
 workers' right of freedom of association. A Government
 commission is studying the possibility of amending the labor
 laws to bring them into conformity with the ILO Convention on
 Freedom of Association, but the Government has given no
 indication that it will accept the establishment of more than
 one labor federation.
 Although public discussion about changing the labor law
 continued in 1987, the debate largely focused on issues
 unrelated to the ILO. Growing tensions between ETUF President
 Saad Muhammad Ahmad and the Minister of Manpower culminated in
 Saad Ahmad's retirement. Government pressure on a number of
 ETUF leaders to retire led some to charge that government
 intervention in ETUF affairs was infringing on labor's
 independence.
 The trade'unions' principal function is to defend their
 membership's rights in dealing with management on such issues
 as wages and working conditions. Although setting wages
 through collective bargaining is prohibited, management is
 required to consult closely with unions for this purpose. The
 labor code also provides for a system of arbitration to
 resolve wage and working condition issues, but is silent on
 the right to strike. The law of national unity prohibits
 strikes that threaten the national economy; the train
 conductors who went on strike in 1986 were arrested under this
 
 
 1141
 EGYPT
 provision. In practice, strikes are discouraged by both
 government and trade union leaders.
 ETUF eschews membership in international labor organizations,
 except for the Organization of African Trade Union Unity, the
 Arab Labor Organization, and the International Confederation
 of Arab Trade Unions. However, the latter two suspended
 Egypt's membership. in response to the Camp David accords.
 Despite ETUF'S prohibition, some individual unions have
 affiliated with international trade union organizations. ETUF
 itself has signed various international trade union
 agreements, one of them with the AFL-CIO. There appear to be
 no restrictions on the international affiliations of
 professional associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 According to the Constitution, Egypt is an Islamic state which
 provides for freedom of religious expression and equality
 before the law, regardless of religion. Egypt has a tradition
 of religious toleration, and the authorities generally uphold
 the rights of religious minorities. Islam and Coptic
 Christianity are the two major religions. While most Egyptian
 Jews emigrated many years ago, those few who remain appear to
 practice their faith without restriction or harassment.
 Synagogues and churches are routinely provided police
 protection. Various Protestant sects operate, some with
 significant Egyptian membership, while others have a small
 following, largely among expatriates. All organized religions
 which are recognized may maintain links with coreligionists
 abroad. Those who engage in proselytizing Muslim Egyptians
 may be prosecuted for "despising a heavenly religion" (Article
 98f of the penal code) or under the broad terms of the law of
 national unity, even though missionary work is not specifically
 banned. Conversion from Islam, while officially not restricted
 or penalized, is discouraged by the Government. Because there
 is no civil marriage in Egypt, a non-Muslim man wishing to
 marry a Muslim woman must first convert to Islam, although a
 Muslim man may marry a non-Muslim woman without either party
 changing religion.
 In February 1985, the Government arrested 41 adherents of the
 Baha'i faith, which is not considered a recognized religion
 and is generally regarded by Muslims as apostasy from Islam;
 reportedly, within a week those arrested were all released.
 The press later reported that the State Security Prosecutor
 declined to try the Baha'is because their ostensible offense,
 belonging to an apostate religion, is not a crime under
 Egypt's penal code; instead, he transferred the case to
 another court for prosecution under statutes forbidding the
 use of religion to promote seditious ideas and for the
 violation of a 1960 law outlawing organized activities by
 Baha'is. In April, a Cairo district court found 39 of the
 Baha'i defendants guilty of violating the 1960 ban on the
 Baha'i "spiritual assemblies," and sentenced them to 2 years
 in prison and a fine. Two defendants who professed their
 faith in Islam were found innocent. The Baha'is remain free
 pending the resolution of an appeal to a higher court. It is
 not clear when a final decision will be reached in this case.
 If the appellate court upholds the verdict, the defense may
 raise a further appeal to the Court of Cassation.
 All recognized faiths can, in principle, establish places of
 worship, run schools, and train enough clergy to serve
 believers. Under a law dating back to the Ottoman era,
 
 
 1142
 EGYPT
 however, non-Muslims must obtain a series of permits
 culminating in a presidential decree to build or repair places
 of worship. Obtaining authorization can take years, and is
 often denied outright.
 Coptic Christians, the most significant indigenous religious
 minority, may constitute 10 percent of the population,
 although their numbers are a subject of controversy. The
 Government's official census for 1986 listed the total number
 of Christians at slightly over 2 million, but this figure
 almost certainly is a significant underestimation. Coptic
 church officials claim 7 million or more.
 Early in 1987, there were several outbreaks of sectarian
 violence in areas of Upper Egypt which have a large Coptic
 population, and two less serious incidents in the Delta.
 President Mubarak, other government leaders, and prominent
 members of the Muslim establishment responded by calling for
 national unity and condemning sectarian violence as alien to
 Egyptian national tradition and character. The Government
 also has continued its practice of taking precautions, such as
 posting security forces near Coptic churches. Pope Shenouda,
 the Coptic Orthodox Patriarch, paid a highly publicized call
 on the Sheikh of Al-Azhar during the Islamic holy month of
 Ramadan, and the Sheikh paid a return call on the Pope at the
 Coptic patriarchate in Cairo. Pope Shenouda also praised
 President Mubarak's efforts to promote national unity.
 Egyptian law prohibits the use of places of worship to
 criticize the State. The courts have not yet ruled on a
 challenge to the constitutionality of this restriction.
 Although the Government maintains that sermons by Islamic and
 Coptic religious figures are not censored, Muslim prayer
 leaders are occasionally detained and questioned for
 delivering allegedly inflammatory declarations in their
 mosques. The Ministry of Awqaf (religious endowments) has
 also been known to substitute imams for troublesome preachers
 at mosques under its control as well as to take over the
 administration of some privately run mosques considered to be
 the centers of antigovernment activity.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Egyptians are free to move within Egypt, except in
 well-defined military districts; there are additional
 restricted areas to which foreigners may not travel. Except
 for limitations affecting males who have not completed
 compulsory military service and restrictions imposed under the
 state of emergency, freedom of foreign travel and emigration
 is assured. Citizens who leave the country have the right to
 return. Some who left for political reasons have returned
 since President Mubarak assumed office. There are no known
 cases of citizenship being revoked for political reasons.
 Under the state of emergency, the Prime Minister has authority,
 which he may delegate to the Interior Minister, to restrict
 foreign or domestic travel. The opposition has alleged that
 this emergency authority has been used to prevent suspected
 Islamic militants from leaving the country. According to an
 Interior Ministry statement of April 1985, fewer than 500
 persons were subject to travel restrictions (in contrast to
 45,000 in the Nasser era). All restrictions were imposed by
 judicial order in accordance with penal code provisions and
 
 
 1143
 EGYPT
 most of the persons had criminal cases pending. The situation
 appeared materially unchanged in 1987.
 Egypt has a liberal policy on political asylum, and the
 extradition of those granted political asylum is prohibited by
 law. In September 1985, the Interior Minister testified to
 People's Assembly committees that Egypt had granted political
 asylum to 3,000 citizens of other Arab countries. Sudanese
 officials have sought the extradition of former Sudanese
 President Jaafar Nimeiri from Egypt in the Egyptian courts,
 thus far unsuccessfully.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Egypt's political system is characterized by a strong
 presidency. The President heads the National Democratic Party
 (NDP), which wields a substantial majority in the People's
 Assembly, but a number of opposition parties are allowed to
 organize, publish their views, and represent their followers
 in the People's Assembly and on the local level.
 In People's Assembly elections in April, the NDP won 348
 elected seats; while the center/right opposition New Wafd
 Party won 36 seats; and the Alliance of the Labor Party, the
 Liberal Party, and the semilegal Muslim Brotherhood won 56
 seats. Eight independent opposition candidates were also
 elected.             -
 The Alliance, now the largest opposition grouping, supported
 the reelection of President Mubarak to a second term, and has
 given selective support to government policies. It has,
 however, sharply criticized the Government's human rights
 record, especially the treatment of Islamic activists.
 The second largest of the five legally formed opposition
 parties is the New Wafd, a revival of the Wafd, one of the
 major political parties before the 1952 revolution which was
 suppressed by Nasser. The New Wafd legally resumed activity
 in 1983, following court decisions that restored its leaders'
 political rights and affirmed the party's legal status. The
 New Wafd generally supports the Government's foreign policy,
 especially the moves toward reintegration into the Arab world.
 The party has been critical of the Government's domestic
 policies. The Wafd abstained in the People's Assembly vote on
 the reelection of'the President, arguing that the office of
 ,the President should be contested in a direct election.
 The Communist Party has been banned since the early 1950's,
 although the National Progressive Unionist Grouping, a bloc of
 leftist factions including some Marxists, is legal. The NPUG
 publicly opposed President Mubarak's reelection. A 1977 law
 prohibits the formation of new parties based on religious or
 class lines, or whose platforms duplicate those of existing
 ones or include opposition to the Egyptian-Israeli peace
 treaty. The law also established the so-called Parties
 Committee which must approve the formation of new parties.
 Applicants are entitled to challenge in court an adverse
 decision by the Committee. In 1985 the sponsors of a proposed
 Nasserist party filed suit when the Committee turned down
 their application. The Administrative Court referred the case
 to the Supreme Constitutional Court where the matter remains
 pending. The Administrative Court stated that provisions of
 the 1977 parties law may be unconsti-tutional because of
 apparent contradictions with the political rights of citizens
 
 
 1144
 EGYPT
 and their right to freedom of expression. Nasserist party
 leaders continue to claim to be nearing completion of the
 party's legal establishment, arguing that the ban on forming
 new parties opposed to the peace treaty with Israel is
 unconstitutional.
 The People's Assembly comprises 458 members, of whom 10 are
 appointed by the President. The President did not appoint any
 opposition party members, in contrast to his action on the
 1984 Assembly when he appointed five opposition deputies. The
 Constitution reserves half of the elected seats for worker and
 peasant representatives. The People's Assembly debates and
 passes laws, and must approve the Government's budget and
 general policies. Both NDP and opposition deputies can and do
 strongly criticize the Government. Cabinet ministers appear
 before assembly committees. Assembly members occasionally
 call for parliamentary investigations of government actions or
 policies.
 In the April People's Assembly elections, the NDP and the four
 legal opposition parties all fielded candidates. About 2,000
 independents also competed for the 48 single-member
 constituencies chosen by direct vote that were instituted
 several months prior to the election. The opposition parties
 raised complaints about the Interior Ministry's supervision of
 the elections and caaculation of the final results, but the
 elections, in which about half of Egypt's approximately 14
 million voters cast ballots, were generally regarded as the
 freest and most competitive since the 1952 revolution. A
 number of. losing opposition candidates filed court cases -
 challenging the election results, and the State Council
 Administrative Court ruled that the NDP should give up.17
 seats to the Wafd and the Alliance opposition parties. The
 Government has appealed this ruling; the case is still pending.
 Despite the December 1986 amendment to the electoral law meant
 to address constitutional concerns, a major opposition
 complaint continues to focus on the party list system which is
 used to elect the bulk of Assembly delegates. In. each of the
 48 electoral districts, assembly seats were awarded in
 proportion to the number of votes for each party's list,
 subject to the requirement that a party receive at least 8
 percent of the total vote. The opposition parties have
 criticized this "8 percent" proviso as excessively high, and
 have filed court suits challenging its constitutionality on
 the grounds that it infringes upon the equal rights provisions
 of the Constitution.
 Political activity along religious lines is forbidden, and
 various Islamic and Coptic societies are legally proscribed.
 Although the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) is technically banned,
 its activities are tolerated so long as they do not threaten
 state security or foster sectarian tensions. In May 1985, the
 courts ruled that mere membership in the MB is not a criminal
 offense. An MB lawsuit, seeking restoration of its legal
 status, is still pending. Following its short-lived 1984
 alliance with the New Wafd, the MB in 1987 entered into a
 political agreement with the Labor and Liberal parties.
 Although a precise count is impossible because neither the MB
 nor the Government will provide a list of MB members, about 35
 MB members ran as part of the so-called Alliance and won seats
 in the People's Assembly elections in April.

 EGYPT
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has responded to some queries from AI and other
 international groups about human rights concerns, including
 requests for visits. Within the Government, primary
 responsibility for international human rights matters rests
 with the Foreign Ministry's Legal Office and Office of
 International Organization Affairs.
 Human rights groups in Egypt are increasingly active in
 promoting domestic and foreign human rights issues. Their
 activities cover such areas as prisoners' welfare and women's
 rights; some groups are also trying to mobilize public support
 on certain political issues. Local human rights groups include
 the Arab Human Rights Organization, the Egyptian chapter of
 the Arab Human Rights Organization, and the Society of Human
 Rights Supporters. The Egyptian chapter of the Arab human
 rights committee has contacted the Ministry of Interior
 directly on human rights issues. Women's rights groups
 actively lobbied for passage of the family status bill enacted
 by the People's Assembly in July 1985. The Government
 generally does not interfere with these organizations, though
 it reportedly did not permit the holding of one conference in
 Cairo sponsored by the Arab Human Rights Organization in 1986.
 In its 1987 Report, covering 1986, AI noted that it had
 received no replies to two requests it had made to the
 Government for information on torture in Egypt. AI's
 newsletter of June 22 reiterated previously expressed concerns
 over torture allegations and repeated its list of recommended
 safeguards. The newsletter also noted AI's concern at Egypt's
 practice of mass detention under the emergency legislation,
 arguing that changes should be made in legislation to ensure
 that persons engaged in nonviolent political activity are
 protected from arrest.
 Egypt has signed the Organization of African Unity's African
 Human Rights Charter and has reaffirmed its commitment to the
 U.N. Human Rights Declaration and respect for related
 international conventions.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The law provides for equality of the sexes. Women are
 increasingly well represented in medicine, law, education, and
 the military (in the medical units). They vote and serve in
 the People's Assembly and the Cabinet. However, a married
 woman must have her husband's permission to obtain her initial
 passport, A husband may rescind his permission and request
 that his wife's passport be canceled, but such cases are rare.
 A married or divorced woman also may not take her children
 abroad without her husband's permission. Under Islamic law,
 female heirs are entitled to one-half the amount of inheritance
 that male heirs can receive. However, male heirs have a duty,
 which females do not share, to provide for all the members of
 the family who need assistance. In rural areas and within
 more traditional communities, prevailing cultural values make
 it more difficult for women to pursue careers outside the
 home. In such households, by custom and tradition, women
 occupy a subordinate and dependent role. Although no recent
 
 
 1146
 EGYPT
 statistics are available, women employed in nonagricultural
 work are generally paid at about .65 to 75 percent of the rate
 received by men.
 The revised Family Status Law, enacted in July 1985 with
 strong support-from President Mubarak, amplified the legal
 basis for equality of the' sexed. The statute largely
 preserved women's right to divorce and divorced women's child
 custody and property rights, spelled out in a 1979 act which
 had been declared unconstitutional on narrow technical grounds
 by the Supreme Constitutional Court. Although the 1979 statute
 provided that a husband's second Marriage'was sufficient
 grounds for the first wife to obtain a divorce, the new version
 required p'roo that the second mairiage had caused her material
 psychological'harm. On the other hand, the new law also
 required the husband to declare second and subsequent
 marriages, with'failure to do so constituting grounds for
 divorce by Ehe first wife. The successor law retains the
 controversial provision that, in case of divorce, the woman
 has the option of retaining possession of the family residence
 or of receiving financial compensation.
 Coptic Christians work in all career fields, occupying many
 leadership positions in the business and professional
 communities. Copts continue to enjoy access to public
 employment, although there appear to be instances of
 discrimination. Coptic representation at the highest levels
 of government increased slightly--from 2 to 3 of 32 cabinet
 ministers and from 9 to 11 of 458 People's Assembly deputies--
 following this year's parliamentary elections and minor
 cabinet reshuffle. Copts seldom advance to the senior ranks
 of the military" security, or diplomatic services, but there
 are occasional exceptions.
 University officials have denied allegations that general
 admissions procedures were revised in the fall of 1984 in
 order to discriminate against Copts. Some Copts allege that
 they are discriminated against in admissions to some fields of
 medical study. There are also reports that universities have
 effectively blodked Coptic professors from becoming
 administrators and chairmen of certain departments. The
 Government has denied a request to establish a Coptic
 university.
 Though religious minorities face social prejudice and
 individual acts of discrimination from some Muslims, there is
 no evidence that these acts are officially inspired. President
 Mubarak has emphasized publicly the fV11 equality of Copts and
 other religious minorities. The courts' application of Islamic
 law to family matters in the Muslim community (marriage,
 inheritancd, personal property)--and the Islamic influences
 elsewhere in the legal system--have not affected the
 constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of Copts and other
 minorities.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Employers are required by law to provide acceptable terms and
 conditions of employment for their workers. The minimum wage
 is approximately $22 a month, and the regular workweek is
 fixed at 48 hours for factory workers. Government subsidies
 on basic necessities support all low wage earners.
 Employers are legally required to meet worker safety and
 health norms, which are modeled on the ILO's suggested
 
 
 1147
 EGYPT
 standards. There are special provisions for female workers.
 Employers who violate wage, hour, and safety and health
 provisions face civil and criminal penalties. Labor
 inspectors enforce these provisions with varying degrees of
 success. Employers are seldom prosecuted but independent
 sources confirm that the courts occasionally impose fines on
 offending companies.
 The minimum age for full-time employment is 12, which is also
 the minimum school-leaving age. Certain forms of dangerous or
 heavy labor, such as mining, are not legal for children aged
 12 to 18. There is evidence that the traditional practice of
 using underage children to perform full-time jobs continues,
 particularly in the rural areas. Growing numbers of children
 in urban areas work as families confront the need to boost
 their income. Newspaper articles in both the progovernment
 and opposition press have charged that several million
 children may be working full time in violation of the labor
 law.
