 SOUTH AFRICA
 South Africa'r governing institutions and society continued to consolidate the
 democratic transformation initiated by the historic 1994 elections. The Government
 comprises ministers from the African National Congress (ANC) and the Inkatha
 Freedom Party (IFP), but is dominated by the ANC. With the 1996 withdrawal of
 the National Party (NP) from the Government of National Unity, the Parliament
 took on a more central role in national debate. In addition to the 3 major parties,
 the 400-member National Assembly includes the Democratic Party, the Freedom
 Front, the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), and the African Christian Democratic
 Party. The new Constitution came into effect in 1997. The judiciary, including the
 Constitutional Court, is independent.
 The South African Police Service (SAPS) has primary responsibility for internal
 security, although the Government continues to call on the South African National
 Defense Force (SANDF) to provide support for the SAPS in internal security situa-
 tions. The SAPS continued its major restructuring and transformation from a pri-
 marily public order security force largely dedicated to enforcing apartheid laws, to
 a more accountable, community service oriented police force. The SANDF and the
 newly created SAPS border control and policing unit share responsibility for exter-
 nal security. The civilian authorities maintain effective control of the security forces.
 However, some members of these forces committed human rights abuses.
 South Africa has a diversified and productive economy whose mainstays are man-
 ufacturing, mining, and agriculture (augmented by service support industries),
 
 
 380
 which make up 24 percent, 8 percent, and 5 percent, respectively, of the gross do-
 mestic product of $115.86 billion (654.6 billion rand). Ownership of wealth remains
 highly skewed. The disparity between skilled and unskilled workers is considerable,
 as is the income distribution gap between urban and rural citizens. Officially, unem-
 ployment is just under 30 percent, although large numbers of persons, particularly
 blacks, are employed informally in retail or small-scale manufacturing operations.
 The economy is driven largely by market forces, although a few key industries re-
 main tightly controlled, including power generation, petroleum, and mining. The
 Government's "Growth, Employment and Redistribution" macroeconomic program
 provides a framework for economic restructuring to achieve enhanced growth. The
 numerous social and economic problems that developed largely during the apartheid
 era are expected to persist for many years.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 problems remain in several areas. Some members of the security forces committed
 human rights abuses, including killings due to use of excessive force and deaths in
 police custody. There were hundreds of political and extrajudicial killings, and polit-
 ical violence remained at about the same level as in 1997, both in KwaZulu-Natal
 and countrywide. Security forces were responsible for torture, excessive use of force
 during arrest, and other physical abuse. The Government has taken action to inves-
 tigate and punish some of those involved. In 1997 the Government established an
 Independent Complaints Directorate to investigate deaths as a result of police ac-
 tion, deaths in police custody, and police brutality. Prisons are seriously over-
 crowded. The judiciary is overburdened, and lengthy delays in trials and prolonged
 pretrial detention are problems. Discrimination against women and the disabled,
 and violence against women and children remained serious problems. Vigilante ac-
 tion and mob justice remained a problem. Parliament passed a number of laws
 aimed at addressing racial and gender discrimination, including employment equity
 legislation and a bill to recognize customary marriages.
 The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), created to investigate apartheid-
 era human rights abuses, make recommendations for reparations for victims, and
 grant amnesty for full disclosure of politically motivated crimes, completed all but
 its amnesty- and reparations-related work by midyear and presented its final report
 to President Mandela on October 29. The report criticized the former apartheid gov-
 ernment, as well as almost every group involved in the liberation struggle, including
 the ANC. Legislation was passed to allow the TRC to complete adjudication in 1999
 of the 7,060 amnesty applications received.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Police use of lethal force during ap-
 prehensions resulted in numerous deaths, and deaths in police custody also remain
 a problem. In April 1997, the Government established an Independent Complaints
 Directorate (ICD) to investigate deaths in police custody and deaths as a result of
 police action. The ICD reported 789 deaths as a result of police action during the
 year. Of these deaths, 758 occurred while in police custody, and 31 occurred as a
 result of police action. These figures represented a significant increase over the esti-
 mated 441 deaths as a result of police action that occurred in 1997. The ICD's report
 lists the subcategories under deaths in police custody to include natural causes, sui-
 cide, injuries in custody, injuries prior to custody, and possible negligence. The ICD
 experienced considerable resistance to its activities from the SAPS.
 In September South African soldiers, as part of a Southern African Development
 Community (SADC) military task force, intervened in Lesotho to quell an army mu-
 tiny and opposition protests. Over 40 opposition-allied civilians died as a result of
 fighting with the SADC troops.
 In its report, the TRC found that the former apartheid regime, including the Na-
 tional Party leadership and various state security agencies; the ANC and the armed
 wing of the ANC, the Umkhonto We Sizwe (MK); and the IFP were responsible for
 extrajudicial killings (see Section 4). The TRC granted amnesty to those responsible
 for the murder of U.S. student Amy Biehl and the 1993 St. James Massacre. In July
 former police minister Adrian Vlok testified that he had ordered the 1988 bombing
 of a church building in Johannesburg on direct instructions of then-President P.W.
 Botha.
 The South Africa Institute for Race Relations, a nongovernmental organization
 (NGO) that follows political and extrajudicial killings, reported 322 politically moti-
 vated killings during the first 11 months of the year, most of which occurred in the
 province of KwaZulu-Natal, compared with 425 for the same period in 1997.
 
 
 381
 The peaceprocess continued in KwaZulu-Natal. A special provincial bilateral IFP-
 ANC Peace Committee met regularly, seeking a settlement that would end political
 violence. The IFP and the ANC, as the parties with the largest numbers in the pro-
 vincial parliament, had the majority of the members on the Portfolio Committee on
 Safety and Security that intervened regularly at scenes of potential conflict to facili-
 tate peaceful solutions.
 After a period of relative peace at the beginning of the year in the province of
 KwaZulu-Natal, there was renewed violence beginning in May in areas identified by
 police as flash points, where sporadic attacks have occurred previously. The violence
 in KwaZulu-Natal resulted in hundreds of deaths during the year, and accounted
 for most of the country's political killings. Observers predict that killings could in-
 crease as political activity increases, party branches are launched, and political ral-
 lies held in the period prior to elections in 1999. There are several theories to ex-
 plain the resurgent violence, including the legacy of "wariordism" that fuels inter-
 party conflict; criminal elements involved in a mafia-like illegal trade in drugs,
 arms, and wildlife; and a shady "third force"ch combines criminal and conservative
 elements determined to undermine the new political order. Observers warn that a
 factor underlying and aiding such forces is the fact that the province is yet to be
 demilitarized and disarmed.
 Violence among warring taxi companies continued to be a major problem. Among
 those killed was James Zulu, a controversial Inkatha leader on the south coast, who
 also had substantial interests in the taxi industry.
 Violence in Richmond peaked in June and July after the acquittal of the UDM's
 Sifiso Nkabinde on 16 counts of murder and 2 counts of conspiracy to murder. More
 than 90 persons were killed in the space of those 2 months. A combined security
 force of between 400 and 500'police and army soldiers was deployed to stabilize the
 area. The regular police force in the area was replaced with a special "public order
 police" force to stabilize the region. The large build-up of the military and police re-
 sulted in reduced violence in the Richmond area. However, no arrests or convictions
 were made in connection with the violence.
 Vigilante action and mob justice remained problems. The Cape Town-based People
 Against Gangsterism and Drugs (PAGAD), an Islamic-oriented community-based or-
 ganization that called for stronger action against crime and drugs, continued to en-
 gage in acts of intimidation and violence against suspected drug dealers, gang lead-
 ers, and critics of PAGAD's violent vigilantism. PAGAD's earlier tactic of mass
 marches and drive-by shootings largely was replaced by pipe-bomb attacks. Homes
 of suspected drug dealers and gangsters were targeted, as were homes of anti-
 PAGAD Muslim clerics, academics, and business leaders. In one instance, a key wit-
 ness in the murder of a PAGAD leader was shot and killed by unknown gunmen.
 Two police stations were pipe-bombed, as was a foreign-based franchise restaurant
 (although PAGAD involvement in the latter incident is suspected, it has not been
 proven). Some 20 persons were killed and over 60 injured in over 150 pipe-bomb
 explosions. Taxi drivers in crime-ridden neighborhoods spearheaded a dozen in-
 stances of mob justice, publicly stripping and whipping suspected criminals before
 turning them over to police. Police arrested a few persons in connection with the
 vigilante violence, but there were no trials or convictions at year's end.
 In December an appeals judge acquitted and released 5 IFP members who had
 been convicted of participation in the 1995 Shobashobone massacre in which 18
 ANC members were killed.
 The murder of farm families in rural parts of the country also is a problem, and
 these killings have received considerable media attention. In the last several years,
 more than 560 farm owners, most of them white, have been killed mostly by black
 assailants. Between January and June, there were approximately 364 attacks on
 farms and small holdings, which resulted in about 65 killings. There is widespread
 concern that the white framers are being targeted for racial and political reasons,
 although no evidence exists that the murders are part of an organized political con-
 spiracy.
 There were occasional reports of killings linked to the continued practice of witch-
 craft in some rural areas. In the northern province, where traditional beliefs regard-
 ing witchcraft remain strong, officials reported dozens of killings of persons sus-
 pected of witchcraft. The Government has instituted educational programs to pre-
 vent such actions.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no new reports of politically motivated disappear-
 ances caused by government authorities or agents.
 In its report, the TRC found that the former apartheid regine was responsible
 for numerous abductions of political enemies in the country and neighboring coun-
 tries (see Section 4).
 
 
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution's Bill of Rights provides for the right not to be tortured, to be free
 from all forms of violence from either public or private sources, and the right not
 to be treated or punished in a cruel, inhuman, or degrading way. However, police
 tortured and otherwise abused suspects and detainees through beatings, suffocation
 with rubber tubing, electric shock, and rape. Broad efforts to reform police practices
 have reduced such activities substantially, and the ICD investigates reports of police
 misconduct and corruption (see Section L.a.). NGO's continued to conduct several
 human rights education programs for the SAPS.
 In July police at a Guguletu police station severely beat a Cape Town journalist,
 Thabo Mabaso, after he went to the station to report a traffic accident (see Section
 2.a.). The officers responsible were suspended pending further investigation. There
 had been no convictions by year's end.
 As a result of their actions during the Lesotho intervention (see Section 1.a.), 18
 SANDF soldiers were convicted of crimes including rape and destruction of property
 and sentenced to military detention.
 The SAPS continued to undergo sweeping, mostly positive change, including the
 institution of reforms designed to create partnerships between local police forces and
 the communities that they serve. Resignations and retirements of senior police offi-
 cials have permitted the infusion of new personnel at senior levels, from both inside
 and outside the SAPS; these appointments also have served to further affirmative
 action within the SAPS. However, the SAPS have been left with deficiencies in mid-
 level leadership and institutional memory that has been harmful to its overall per-
 formance. The first intake of new recruits since 1994 occurred in 1998.
 In its report, the TRC found that the former apartheid regime had engaged in the
 widespread use 'of torture and severe mistreatment of political opponents including
 sexual assault; abuse and harassment; the deliberate withholding of medical serv-
 ices, food, and water; and the mutilation of body parts (see Section 4). The ANC also
 was found responsible for the widespread use of torture against suspected enemy
 agents, prisoners, and mutineers.
 Two suspects arrested for a series of bombings in January 1997 that hit a mosque
 in Rustenberg and injured two persons were still awaiting trial at year's end (see
 Section 5).
 Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards; however,
 overcrowding remains a serious problem.
 In 1997 the Government commissioned the first of several planned "C-MAX" pris-
 ons in Pretoria. C-MAX prisons are designed to hold the country's most dangerous
 criminals. Human rights groups have raised serious concerns regarding C-MAX fa-
 cilities, including the Government's criteria for transferring prisoners from other
 prisons to a C-MAX facility and the restrictive, solitary conditions of the prisons
 themselves. No additional C-MAX prisons had begun operations by year's end.
 Juveniles between the ages of 14 and 18 accused of serious crimes including mur-
 der or rape are sometimes placed in pretrial detention in prisons with adult offend-
 ers (see Section 5).
 The Government permits independent monitoring of prison conditions including
 visits by human rights organizations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Bill of Rights prohibits detention
 without trial. It also provides that every detained person has the right to be prompt-
 ly informed of the reasons for the detention; to be promptly advised of the right to
 remain silent and the consequences of waiving that right; to be charged within 48
 hours of arrest; to be detained in conditions of human dignity, to consult with legal
 counsel at every stage of the legal process; to communicate with relatives, medical
 practitioners, and religious counselors; and to be released (with or without bail) un-
 less the interests of justice require otherwise.
 Courts and police generally acted in good faith to respect these rights, although
 there was a growing problem with bringing detainees to trial. According to the
 Human Rights Commission, prisoners wait on average for 6 months to be tried in
 the regional courts and 6 months to 1 year in the high courts; however, in extreme
 cases detention can extend to up to 2 years. This problem primarily is the result
 of an understaffed, underfunded, and overburdened judiciary (both magistrates and
 prosecutors), with more cases than can be handled efficiently. Parliament passed
 new laws in 1997 that mandated minimum sentences and the refusal of bail in most
 cases for certain serious offenses. Some human rights groups expressed concern with
 parts of the new laws, stating that they would harm judicial independence and limit
 civil liberties..
 In its report, the TRC found the former apartheid regime responsible for detaining
 political opponents without trial (see Section 4).
 There were no reports of forced exile.
 
 
 383
 
 In its report, the TRC found the former apartheid regime responsible for forcibly
 and illegally removing or banishing political opponents from the country (see Section
 4).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent and
 impartial judiciary subject only to the Constitution and the law, and the Govern-
 ment respects this provision in practice.
 Under the Constitution, the Constitutional Court is the highest court for inter-
 preting and deciding constitutional issues, while the Supreme Court of Appeal is the
 highest court for interpreting and deciding other legal matters. Generally, mag-
 istrates' courts and high courts are the courts of original jurisdiction in criminal
 cases.
 Judges try criminal cases. The jury system was abolished in 1969. The presiding
 judge or magistrate determines guilt or innocence. In November Parliament passed
 the Magistrates Court Amendment Act, which made it compulsory to have a panel
 of lay assessors hear cases along with a magistrate in cases involving murder, rape,
 robbery, indecent assault, and assault leading to serious bodily harm. Magistrates
 also are required to use their discretion in using assessors in an advisory capacity
 in bail applications and sentencing. In August Parliament established the Office of
 the National Director of Public Prosecutions (the so-called super Attorney General),
 who exercises national control over prosecution policy. Parliament also established
 nine provincial directors and offices to coordinate and streamline prosecutions.
 The Constitution's Bill of Rights provides for due process, including the right to
 a fair, public trial within a reasonable time of being charged and the right to appeal
 to a higher court. It also gives detainees the right to state-funded legal counsel
 when "substantial injustice would otherwise result." In practice the law functions
 as intended. A general lack of information on the part of accused persons regarding
 their rights to legal representation, and the Government's inability to pay the cost
 of those rights are continuing problems. In a March report, Justice Minister Dullah
 Omar expressed concern over 356,000 unpaid lawyer's accounts. There was public
 concern about the capacity of the criminal justice system to deal with the high-level
 of nonpolitical crime, as well as the continuing political violence in KwaZulu-Natal
 and elsewhere. The resurgence of vigilante justice (see Section l.a.) apparently was
 a result of doubts about the capacity of the police and the courts to address the seri-
 ous problem of common crime.
 The Government and legal bodies have acted to redress historic racial and gender
 imbalances in the judiciary and the bar. The ranks of judges, magistrates, senior
 counsels, and attorneys are more reflective of society, although they still fall far
 short of a representative composition.
 In its report, the TRC found that the former apartheid regime was responsible
 for deliberately falsifying or destroying evidence to be used in trials against security
 force personnel accused of killing political enemies.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 In 1994 the Redistribution of Land Rights Act established the Constitutional Land
 Court and the Commission on Restitution of Land Rights. The Court's mission is
 to settle cases previously vetted and evaluated by the Commission. Claims only can
 be filed for land dispossessions following the promulgation of the Natives Land Act
 of 1913, although this does not include dispossessions that occurred in 1913, which
 marked the year of the Government's most significant land redistribution in favor
 of whites. The various forms of compensation offered to claimants are the return of
 the original land, deed to another piece of land, financial remuneration, or pref-
 erential access to government housing. A deadline of December 31 was set for re-
 ceiving claims. There is no deadline for completion of the claim settlements, and the
 pace at which cases are moving is particularly slow. As of December, 63,455 cases
 had been received, of which 4,000 were accepted and are under investigation. Only
 31 claims have been resolved. A provision passed by Parliament in late 1997 was
 aimed at speeding up the process of allowing out-of-court settlements negotiated
 with the Ministry of Land Affairs.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. However,
 these rights can be limited by general law under some circumstances. Several apart-
 heid-era laws that remain in force pose a potential threat to the media. Neverthe-
 less, the press criticizes both the Government and the opposition.
 
 
 The media offer a broad range of~news, opinion, and analysis. Coverage of news
 and expression of opinion is vigorous. However, high-ranking government officials
 on occasion have reacted sharply to media criticism of government programs and
 problems, going so far as to accuse journalists of disloyalty. A few journalists fear
 that the Government would like to control the media. A larger number of journalists
 believe that the Government's sensitivity to criticism causes self-censorship in the
 media. The Government's deportation in May of an award-winning investigative
 journalist, Newton Kanhema, sent a chilling message to the rest of the media. In
 July police at a Guguletu police station severely beat a Cape Town journalist, Thabo
 Mabaso (see Section 1.c.).  -
 The state-owned South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) continues to
 own and control the majority of the television and radio outlets. However, the SABC
 maintains its editorial independence from the Government. The SABC is managed
 by black South Africans, provides broadcasting in the country's main African lan-
 guages, and its news programming offered balanced coverage of the Government
 and the leading opposition parties. In March the first private television license was
 granted by the Independent Broadcasting Authority CIBA) to Midi Television, a
 black-owned consortium made up of a number of associations and syndicates rep-
 resenting workers, women, and disabled persons. Midi Television holds majority
 ownership of the first commercial television station in the country, E-TV. Despite
 start-up difficulties, E-TV began broadcasting October 1; its schedule consists main-
 ly of foreign programs.
 In addition to E-TV, the SABC competed with-two pay-per-view broadcasters, M-
 NET and Multichoice several commercial radio broadcasters, and a large number
 of low-power, not-for-profit community radio stations. Community radio has more
 than 80 licensees (all granted since 1994), many of which are experiencing start-
 up and longevity problems. Nevertheless, community radio is providing first-time
 radio access to thousands of citizens, including election information and news tai-
 lored for specific interest groups.
 In 1997 a black-owned consortium acquired control of the country's leading black-
 oriented newspaper, The Sowetan and of a major, traditionally white-oriented pub-
 lishing business, Times Media Limited, thereby making major inroads into the his-
 tric monopoly of white South Africans over both print and electronic media. The
 investment group MIDI TV, which holds majority ownership of E-TV, is black
 owned. Black South Africans also are gaining access to the media through commu-
 nity radio and in upper-level management positions at the SABC.
 Severa laws remain in effect that permit the Government to restrict the publica-
 tion of informaon n about the police, te national defense forces, prisons, and mental
 institutions. Another law remains in force that could be used to compel reporters
 to reveal their sources. While these laws were not employed often, they still were
 perceived by journalists as a threat to freedom of the press. However, in a landmark
 judgement in September, the Supreme Court ruled that if journalists could prove
 that they had taken all the steps necessary to verify that the information they ob-
 tained was genuine and the articles published as a consequence were reasonable
 and not negligent in their reporting of the facts, journalists would not be liable if
 the information obtained was defamatory.
 There are several government agencies with media-related responsibilities. The
 South African Board of Censors reviews and passes judgment on written and graph-
 ic materials published in or imported into the country. The Board of Censors has
 the power to edit or ban books, magazines, movies, and videos, and regularly exer-
 cises that power, although with restraint. The Government recently created a new
 information service, the Government Communications and Information Services
 (GCIS), to coordinate and facilitate its communications with the citizenry.
 There are no official restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Mssodiation-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 The law contains provisions for the granting of refugee or asylee status in accord-
 ance with the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
 and its 1967 Protocol. In November the National Assembly and the National Council
 of Provinces passed the Refugees Bill-framework legislation that codified the coun-
 try's obligations under the U.N. Convention and its Protocol. The Refugees Bill stip-
 ulates that no person shall be expelled, extradited, or returned to any other country
 if they face persecution, due to race, religion, or political affiliation, or when "his or
 
 
 385
 her life, physical safety, or freedom would be threatened." The bill also stipulates
 that designated refugees lose their status if they voluntarily return to their country
 of origin, take citizenship of another country, or if the circumstances that caused
 their flight from the country of origin change. However, the bill stipulates that in
 order to renew their temporary residency permits, asylum seekers must return to
 the town in which they originally lodged their application to be recognized as refu-
 gees. Permits that are lost, stolen, or destroyed are not renewed. If found without
 a valid permit, asylum seekers are subject to arrest, detention and deportation. The
 bill is scheduled to go into effect in early 1999.
 In 1996 the Government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on the standardization
 of regional refugee policies, which is designed to shift more responsibility for han-
 dling refugee flows onto first-asylum countries in the region. The Government co-
 operates with the UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refu-
 gees. The Government provides first asylum, granting applicants the right to work
 and study. There were approximately 50,000 applications for refugee status by
 year's end. Of those claims, approximately 8,400 were accepted and 20,000 were re-
 jected. The rest are still outstanding. About 70 percent of the thousands of illegal
 immigrants deported during the year came from Mozambique. Despite numerous
 procedural safeguards, energetic efforts to combat a mounting illegal immigration
 problem occasionally resulted in the wrongful deportation of aliens legally in the
 country. However, no persons were forcibly returned to countries where they feared
 persecution. There also have been credible reports of overcrowded, unhygienic deten-
 tion facilities, beatings by security personnel in detention centers, and the theft of
 money and personal possessions from refugees by security personnel.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised the right to change their government in 1994 elections that ob-
 servers deemed to be substantially free and fair. The new Constitution went into
 effect in February 1997. Under its terms, the country retains a bicameral par-
 liament, an executive state presidency, and an independent judiciary, including a
 constitutional court.
 The current 400-member National Assembly was retained under the new Con-
 stitution. A new National Council of Provinces (NCOP), consisting of six permanent
 and four rotating delegates from each of the nine provinces, replaced the former
 Senate as the second chamber of Parliament. The NCOP, created to give a greater
 voice to provincial interests, must approve legislation that involves shared national
 and provincial competencies according to a schedule in the Constitution. An 18-
 member Council of Traditional Leaders, which the Constitution accords an advisory
 role in matters of traditional law and authority, was inaugurated in April 1997.
 Two parties, the ANC and the IFP, continued to share executive power following
 the National Party's withdrawal from the Government of National Unity and pro-
 vincial executives in 1996. This arrangement is expected to continue until elections
 in 1999. President Nelson Mandela continued in office as Executive Head of State,
 with Thabo Mbeki as the sole Executive Deputy President. The ANC fills 22 of the
 25 cabinet positions.
 In November the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) began a voter registra-
 tion drive in preparation for the 1999 elections. The first of at least 3 weekends set
 aside for voter registration was marked by several problems including the failure
 of electronic registration equipment, inadequate registration personnel due to insuf-
 ficient funds, a critical deficiency in voter education, including persons being di-
 rected to the wrong registration centers and confusion over necessary documentation
 for registration, and bad weather. President Mandela deployed several thousand
 uniformed SANDF members at registration centers nationwide to take the place of
 official registrars. Approximately 8.4 million voters were registered at year's end.
 A constitutional amendment extending the term of municipal councils from 4 to
 5 years to coincide with the terms of national and provincial legislatures was passed
 during the 1998 parliamentary session.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government. Over
 one-fourth of the National Assembly members are women, while in the NCOP, 9 of
 the 54 permanent delegates are women. Women currently occupy three of four par-
 liamentary presiding officer positions (speaker and deputy speaker of the National
 Assembly, deputy chair of the NCOP). Women hold 4 of 25 ministerial positions, as
 well as 8 of 13 deputy ministerial slots.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and
 publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials generally are
 cooperative and responsive to their views. Many organizations participate in govern-
 mental bodies that seek to gather public input and to fashion policies related to
 human rights.
 The government-created Human Rights Commission is tasked with promoting the
 observance of fundamental human rights at all levels of government and toughout
 the general poplation. The Commission also has the power to conduct investiga-
 tions, issue subpoenas, and hear testimony under oath. While commissioners were
 named in late 1995, the Commission's powers were not determined formally until
 May 1996. Its operations have been hampered by red tape, budgetary concerns, the
 absence of civil liberties legislation, several high-level staff resignations, and con-
 cerns about the Commission s broad interpretation of its mandate.
 The Office of the Public Protector functioned throughout the year. Its role is to
 investigate abuse and mismanagement by the Government. The Public Protector
 acts as an office of last resort where citizens report unfair treatment by government
 organizations. Such complaints generally take the form of concerns over lost pension
 checks or unfair hiring practices. The office handles an increasing number of com-
 plaints, but is hampered by a lack of funding and severe resource constraints.
 Under its 1995 enabling legislation, the TRC was empowered to look into apart-
 heid-era gross human rights abuses committed between 1960 and 1994, to grant
 amnesty to perpetrators of a broad range of politically motivated crimes, and to rec-
 ommend compensation for victims of human rights abuses. The TRC continued to
 operate freely throughout its third year, although a number of political parties and
 individuals filed court challenges against the Commission. Due to the volume of
 work, the TRC's original 2-year mandate was extended to allow full operations
 through July and the continuation of amnesty hearings into 1999.
 The TRC presented its 3,500 page final report to President Mandela on October
 29, with a codicil to be added upon completion of the amnesty process. The TRC
 received more than 21,000 statements from victims of human rights abuses and
 more than 7,060 applications from those seeking amnesty. In September the TRC
 notified more than 200 individuals, including current and former high-level govern-
 ment officials, that they would be named as perpetrators of human rights abuses
 in the report. Following a court challenge, findings on former State President F.W.
 De Klerk were excised from the report, pending_ a hearing scheduled for March
 1999. A last-minute bid by the ANC to delay publication of the report, pending a
 meeting with the TRC, was unsuccessful.'
 As expected, in its report, the TRC found the former apartheid regime to have
 been the primary abuser of human rights during the era of its rule. The TRC cited
 humerous immoral, and, even under its own laws, !illegal acts that the former gov-
 ernment undertook in its effort to maintain white-dominated control of the country.
 The TRC report noted that it had followed the internationally held position that
 -apartheid, was a crime against humanity and that it endorsed the concept that lib-
 eration movements were involved in a just war. However, the TRC held that just
 war did not legitimate the-perpetration of gross violations of human rights, and that
 individuals are responsible for violations committed. It found further that the State
 by virtue of its powers, resources, obligation, and privileges, must be held to a high-
 er standard of moral and political conduct than voluntary associations such as the
 liberation movements. However, the TRC also took seriously its mandate to consider
 all violations of citizen's rights on an equal basis by pointing out abuses committed
 by the ANC during its struggle. The TRC also singled out the IFP and its leader
 Chief Mangosutho Buthelezi for special attention, calling the .party the primary
 nonstate perpetrator of abuses from the late 1980's through 1994.
 The reactions of the various political parties were mixed. The ANC attempted to
 block the release of the report pending a modification of the findings against the
 ANC, but was ultimately unsuccessful. The IFP, the PAC, the Freedom Front, and
 the NP attacked the report's findings, while the Democratic Party and, the UDM
 welcomed its release.
 Major findings of the TRC report include: the primary perpetrator of gross human
 rights violations was the former State, including the Government, the civil service,
 and the security forces; the State was guilty of a range of abuses including
 extrajudicial killing, abduction, torture, severe mistreatment, cross border raids, and
 the training and arming of hit squads; the State Security Council, chaired by former
 President P.W. Botha, created a political climate that greatly facilitated wide-scale
 human rights abuses; the IFP was the primary nonstate perpetrator of gross human
 rights abuses from the late 1980's through to 1994; the South African Defense
 
 
 387
 Forces conspired with the IFP to train and deploy a paramilitary hit squad against
 opponents of the Government and the IFP in the KwaZulu homeland. The ANC,
 PAC, and other liberation movements, and their armed wings, were responsible for
 a number of gross violations, including the execution without due process of muti-
 neers in camps abroad; the killing and maiming of civilians, particularly white
 farmers, in certain MK operations, including land mine campaigns; and the torture
 of suspected enemy agents. Rightwing opposition groups committed gross violations
 in the early 1990's against those perceived to oppose Afrikaaner self-determination
 and were mobilizing to derail the democratic process; the United Democratic Front
 facilitated or failed to take measures to prevent gross violations by affiliates or sup-
 porters, including "necklacing", the placing of a burning tire around the necks of po-
 litical opponents.
 Among those found accountable for gross violations by virtue of their leadership
 positions were former President P.W. Botha, former Defense Chief Magnus Malan,
 former Law and Order Minister Adrian Vlok, former SADF head General Constand
 Viljoen, Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) leader Eugene Terreblanche, and
 IP leader Mangosotho Buthelezi. The Commission reserved special criticism for
 Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's role in sponsoring the Mandela United Football Club,
 which essentially was a group of bodyguards accused of a number of extrajudicial
 killings of suspected enemy agents, torture, assaults and arson. Following a court
 challenge, the TRC tempo  y excised its findings on former President F.W. De
 Klerk pending a hearing on the issue scheduled for March 1999. The TRC also
 found institutions such as the legal fraternity, faith communities, the media, busi-
 ness, and others guilty of acts of omission that contributed toward a culture of im-
 punity in which gross violations of human rights were tolerated.
 Hearings were also held on a number of topics including the apartheid-era chemi-
 cal and biological warfare program and the 1986 plane crash that killed
 Mozambican President Samora Machel. A number of high-level government officials
 testified before the Commission on the operations of the former State Security Coun-
 cil (SSC) chaired by then-President P.W. Botha. In August a regional court sen-
 tenced Botha to a 12-month suspended jail sentence and a fine of approximately
 $1,785 (10,000 rand) for repeatedly refusing to respond to TRC subpoenas to testify
 regarding his role in the 850. Botha may still be called to testify in the Commis-
 sion's amnesty hearings.
 By year's end, approximately 7,120 amnesty applications were filed with the TRC
 and some 1,500 cases remained to be heard. An estimated 80 to 90 percent of all
 applications were from those already incarcerated. A year's end, amnesty had been
 granted to approximately 130 applicants including former members of government
 security forces, of the IFP, of both the ANC and PAC liberation movements, and of
 members    of  conservative  rightwing  groups   such  as   the   Afrikaner
 Weerstandsbeweging (AWB). Amnesty was granted in a number of high-proffie
 cases, including to those responsible for the murder of U.S. student Amy Biehi in
 1993, and the 1993 St. James church massacre. Decisions in aproximately 2,600
 amnesty cases, including the killing of ANC activist Ruth First, SACP leader Chris
 Hani, black consciousness leader Steve Biko, and human rights lawyer Griffiths
 Mxenge, and the bombings of Khotso and COSATU houses still were pending at
 year's end. John Coetzee, Head of the Security Branch from 1980 to 1983 and Na-
 tiona Police Chief from 1983 to 1987 also is awaiting a decision on his request for
 amnesty. In midyear, the Cape Town High Court declared the applications of 37
 high-prfie ANC members to bive i  in    they did not provide detais of specific
 acts or which amnesty was being requested. Discussions continue between the ANC
 and the TRC on submission of further information on these and a number of other
 ANC applications.
 The TRC report also stated that those who had not sought amnesty should be
 prosecuted  for their crimes. Investigations  were launched  against Winnie
 Madilizela-Mandela. The TRC report also counseled against the grant of a general
 amnesty for human rights abusers. Other key recommendations called for a rec-
 onciliation summit to be scheduled in 1999, increased counseling services for victims-
 of trauma and consideration of a mechanism for restitution, such as a wealth tax.
 The Cabinet and Parliament still must approve the TRC's recommendations for an
 overall payment formula for reparations, which include monetary compensation as
 well as community support and legal and symbolic reparations. TRC officials com-
 pleted their findings on which of the 21,000 victims who filed statements qualified
 for reparations under the reparation policy. Interim assistance was given to those
 considered to be in the greatest financial difficulty. The processing of applications
 from eligible victims continued through year's end. The TRC officially expressed con-
 cern regarding delays in implementing reparations measures along with doubt
 about the levelof government support for reparations funding.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of race religion, disability,
 ethnic or social origin, color, age, culture, language, 'sex, pregnancy, or marital sta-
 tus. Legal recourse is available to those who believe they have been: discriminated
 against, but entrenched attitudes and practices, as well as limited resources, limit
 the practical effect of these protections.
 Women.-There is a high rate of violence against women, and such violence in-
 cludes rape, assault and battery, and domestic violence. Approximately 36,400
 women reported being raped during the year; of those, 1 percent were raped by their
 spouse. Police sources believe that a majority of rapes are still unreported.
 Parliament passed a new Domestic Violence B   in   ovember. The bill expands
 the definition of victims of domestic violence, facilitates the serving of protection or-
 ders on abusers, provides places of safety for victims, allows police to seize firearms
 at the scene and arrest abusers without a warrant, and compels medical, edu-
 cational, and other practitioners working with children to report abuse immediately.
 The Prevention of Family Violence Act of 1993 defines marital rape as a criminal
 offense, and it allows women to obtain injunctions against their abusive husbands
 and partners in a simpler, cheaper, and more effective manner than under previous
 legislation. However, the implementation process is inadequate, as .the police g en-
 er-ally are unwilling to enforce 'the Act. As a consequence, a limited number of
 women pressed complaints under the law, despite government and NGO efforts to
 increase public awareness of it.
 While some progress has been made, the number of shelters for battered women
 remained insuffcient. The SAPS continued to operate new units that deal specifi-
 cally with domestic violence, child protection, and sexual violence, which are in-
 tended, in part, to inreas  e         e      in the police, and thereby lead to in-
 creased reporting of such crimes. However, these units were often hampered by a
 lack of training among officers.
 Discrimination against women remains a serious problem despite legal and con-
 stitutional protections. Progress was made in bringing customary law in line with
 constitutional provisions. In November Parliament passed a new bill, the Recognai-
 tion of Customary Marriages Bill, that recognizes customar    marriages, voth
 monogamous and polygynous, but it does not adress religious marriages, which are
 not recognized under law. The bill includes a number of safeguards for women and
 children, including requiring a minimum age of 18 and the consent of both spouses
 to enter into such marriages and a court decree to dissolve them. The bill als a-
 dresses inequities of property arrangements under some customary laws. Par-
 liament  also passed the Maintenance Bil in November, which tightens procedures
 for child support payments and improves the ability of caregivers, most of whom are
 women, to collect maintenance payments from partners. Other legislation, such as
 the Em ployment-Equity Act, which was passed in October, and the Basic Conditions
 of Employment Act, which was passed in November, introduced measures to counter
 discrimination against women in the workplace. The 1997 Interim Protection of In-
 formal Land Act protects persons who have insecure and informal rights and inter-
 ests in land; many women are in this category. There are 12 known women's private
 investment companies in thecountry.
 A number of governmental and nongovenerita organizations monitor and pro-
 mote women's rights. The Office on the Status of Women, located in the Deputy
 President's office, coordinates departmental gender desks, which develop strategies
 to ensure integration of gender concerns in policy and planning. The Commission
 on Gender Equality (CGE), a constitutionally mandated body, is authorized to inves-
 tigate allegations of gender discrimination and make recommendations to Par-
 liament on any legislation affecting women. As with some of the other statutory
 watchdog bodies, the CGE continued to be hampered by a lack of funding. The
 Women's National Coalition, an umbrella organization of women's groups from
 labor, political parties, trade unions, and religious, cultural, and professio nabodies,
 monitors and promotes women's equity and issues of interest to women.
 Polygyny continues to be practiced by several ethnic groups. Exacting a bride
 price ("lobola") is also a traditional practice of some ethnic groups.
 Children.-The Constitution stipulates that cbildren have the right "to security,
 education, basic nutrition, and basic health and social services." The Government
 remains firm in its commitment to provide these services and has made some
 progress toward developing the mechanisms for delivering them, including improve-
 ments in the provision of education and a campaign against child abuse. However,
 the demand for such services far outstrips the resources available.
 The Schools Act and the National Education Policy Act, passed by Parliament in
 1996, provide greater educational opportunities for disadvantaged cbildren-tradi-
 
 
 389
 tionally black children-though a uniform system for the organization, governance,
 and funding of schools. It mandates compulsory education from ages 7 to 15 and
 ensures that children cannot be refused admission to public schools due to a lack
 of funds. The new school funding formula, based on norms and standards tied to
 physical resources and performance, shifts 75 percent of nonpersonnel resources to-
 ward the 40 percent most needy schools. Student populations on university cam-
 puses are becoming more representative of the country's racial profile, with pre-
 viously all-white universities reaching out to recruit students from black and colored
 communities. The enrollment of black students has risen from nearly zero percent
 of total enrollment during the previous regime to 30 to 40 percent at prestigious
 universities, including the University of Pretoria.
 Social programs known as "Presidential Initiatives," which were included in the
 former Reconstruction and Development Program, continue to receive government
 support. These initiatives offer free health care to pregnant women and to children
 under 6 years of age and provide nutritious meals for primary school children.
 Violence against children remains widespread. While there has been increased at-
 tention to the problem by the Government, the public, and the media, a lack of co-
 ordinated and comprehensive strategies to deal with such crimes continues to im-
 pede the delivery of needed services to young victims.
 Traditional circumcision rituals are still practiced on teenage boys in rural areas
 of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal and resulted in the hospitalization, mutila-
 tion, or death of several youths.
 Child prostitution is on the rise, primarily in Cape Town, Durban, and Johannes-
 burg. An increase in the number of children who live on the streets has contributed
 to the growing number of child prostitutes. The child sex industry increasingly has
 become organized, with children either being forced into prostitution or exploited by
 their parents to earn money for the family.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, traditionally
 still is practiced in some rural areas of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, al-
 though it is not thought to be widespread. There is no legislation that addresses
 FGM; however, a person who subjects another to FGM is subject to the common-
 law offense of assault.
 Legislation passed in 1995 prohibiting the detention of unconvicted juveniles in
 prisons, police cells, or lock-ups. A 1996 law gave courts limited discretion to detain
 in prison 14- to 18-year-old children who were awaiting trial for serious crimes such
 as murder or rape. The measure was expected to be temporary pending the estab-
 lishment of "places of safety" for the detention of juveniles. However, due to delays
 in the establishment of such centers, provisions of the 1996 law lapsed midyear.
 Amid concerns that dangerous juvenile offenders were being released to return to
 the streets, additional legislation was passed late in the year to regulate limited
 pretrial detention of juvenile offenders accused of serious crimes. The law states
 that any child under the age of 14 must be released within 24 hours into the cus-
 tody of a parent or guardian when possible.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis
 of disability. Society continues to promote an increasingly modem concept of persons
 with disabilities as a minority whose civil rights must be protected. The Govern-
 ment attempts to ensure that all government-funded projects take account of the
 needs of disabled citizens. However, in practice government and private sector dis-
 crimination in employment of the disabled still exists. According to an NGO, the Af-
 firmative Action Monitor, less than two-thirds of companies target the disabled as
 part of their affirmative action programs. The law mandates access to buildings for
 persons with disabilities, but such regulations rarely have been enforced, and public
 awareness of them remains minimal. The Employment Equity Act requires private
 firms with more than 50 workers to create an affirmative action plan with provi-
 sions for achieving employment equity for the disabled. The National Environmental
 Accessibility Program, an NGO comprising disabled consumers as well as service
 providers, has established a presence in all nine provinces in order to lobby for com-
 pliance with the regulations and to sue offending property owners when necessary.
 Religious Minorities.-In December a synagogue in Wynberg was bombed. The in-
 vestigation was ongoing at year's end.
 The People Against Gangstrism and Drugs, an Islamic-oriented community-based
 organization, continued to engage in acts of intimidation and violence against sus-
 pected drug dealers, gang leaders, and critics of PAGAD's violent vigilantism (see
 Section L.a.). PAGAD also targeted the homes of anti-PAGAD Muslim clerics, aca-
 demics, and business leaders.
 In January 1997, a mosque in Rustenberg was bombed in a series of bombings
 that also struck a post office and general store and injured two persons. Authorities
 
 
 arrested two suspects for the bombings, but their trials were still pending at year's
 end.
 IndigenoUs People.-The Constitution provides for the recognition of "the institu-
 tion, status, and role of traditional leadership," and requires the courts to "apply
 customary law when that is applicable, subject to the Constitution and any legisla-
 tion that specifically deals with customary law."
 The Constitution further permits legislation for the establishment of provincial
 Houses of Traditional Leaders and a National Council of Traditional Leaders, to
 deal with matters relating to traditional leadership, the role of traditional leaders,
 indigenous and customary law, and the customs of communities observing a system
 of customary law. Six provinces have established houses of traditional leaders.
 Under the terms of the Constitution and implementing legislation, the National
 Council of Traditional Leaders was inaugurated in April 1997. The Council is to ad-
 vise the Government on matters related to traditional authorities and customary
 law. However, much work remains to be done to integrate traditional leadership and
 customary law into the formal legal and administrative system.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution and Bill of Rights prohibit
 discrimination on the basis of race, ethnic or social origin, and culture. The Govern-
 ment continued efforts to reorganize and redesign the educational, housing, and
 health care systems to benefit all racial and ethnic groups in society more equally.
 The Government has instituted an effective affirmative action program, and, under
 the Employment Equity Act, also requires private firms with more than 50 employ-
 ees to institute affirmative action programs. According to a 1996 Department of
 Labor survey, 82 percent of private sector firms already have instituted affirmative
 action programs.
 According to-the Affirmative Action Monitor, affirmative action policies have had
 little impact on the top echelons in business. Based on a consultants' survey in
 1996, one-third of the organizations with no affirmative action program did not in-
 tend to implement one. Twelve percent of the companies surveyed stated that they
 had experienced a drop in standards or deterioration in quality of work due to af-
 firmative action. However, the country's black majority increasingly is making in-
 roads into the previously all-white entrepreneurial sector through pooled invest-
 ments and acquisitions.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association
 and the right to strike, and these rights are given statutory effect in the 1996 Labor
 Relations Act (LRA). All workers in the private sector are entitled to join a union.
 Most workers in the public sector, with the exception of members of the South Afri-
 can National Defense Force, the National Intelligence Agency, and the South Afri-
 can Secret Service, also are entitled to join a union. No employee can be fired or
 discriminated against because of membership in or advocacy of a trade union. Union
 membership has continued to decline steadily in the last few years as a result of
 job layoffs and declining employment, including in sectors that have been heavily
 unionized, such as mining. According to official estimates, there are 248 registered
 trade unions and between 30 and 40 unregistered trade unions, with a total approx-
 imate membership of 2.9 million persons, about 30 percent of the formally employed,
 economically active population.
 The largest trade union federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions
 (COSATU), is aligned formally with theAfrican National Congress (ANC) and the
 South African Communist Party (SACP). Over 60 former COSATU members serve
 in national and provincial legislatures and administrations, and scores more entered
 local government. However, the ANC largely excluded COSATU members from its
 election lists for the 1999 elections. COSATU's closest rival, the Federation of
 Unions of South Africa (FEDUSA), is an apolitical, multiracial federation that was
 formed in 1997 by merging several smaller worker organizations. A relatively minor
 labor federation, the National Council of Trade Unions, while officially independent
 of any political grouping, has close ties to the PAC and the Azanian Peoples Organi-
 zation.
 The LRA seeks to create an industrial relations regime that is stable and recog-
 nizes that basic worker rights need to be protected. The act protects workers against
 unfair dismissal, recognizes their right to form trade unions, provides for the right
 to strike, and establishes a simple set of procedures that protect striking workers
 from the threat of dismissal. Essentially, for a strike to proceed, all that is required
 is that a dispute be referred for conciliation. If conciliation fails to resolve the dis-
 p ute, then a trade union is entitled to advise an employer of an intent to strike.
 uch a strike is not liable to criminal or civil action. Organized labor also has the
 right to engage in "socioeconomic protest," whereby workers can demonstrate, with-
 
 
 out fear of losing their jobs, in furtherance of broader social issues. The LRA also
 allows employers to hire replacement labor for striking employees, but only after
 giving 7 days' notice to the striking trade union. Employers have the right to lock
 out workers if certain conditions are met.
 The LRA applies to public sector as well as private sector workers. Public sector
 employees, with the exception of essential services and the three components of the
 security services, also are provided with the right to strike. While this right first
 was asserted in the Public Sector Labor Relations Act of 1993, the LRA simplifies
 and rationalizes collective bargaining in the public sector and the resort to indus-
 trial action.
 The Government does not restrict union affiliation with regional or international
 labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law defines and protects
 the rights to organize and bargain collectively. The Government does not interfere
 with union organizing and generally has not interfered in the collective bargaining
 process. The IRA statutorily entrenches "organizational rights," such as trade union
 access to work sites, deductions for trade union subscriptions, and leave for trade
 union officials, which strengthens the ability of trade unions to organize workers.
 Union participation as an equal partner with business and government in the Na-
 tional Economic Development and Labor Council, a tripartite negotiating forum, en-
 sures a direct voice for labor in the formulation of economic, social, and labor policy.
 The LRA allows for the establishment of workplace forums that are intended to
 promote broad-based consultation between management and labor over issues such
 as work organization, corporate downsizing, and changes in production processes.
 The forums, in order to receive statutory protection, can be established by trade
 unions only in businesses with more than 100 employees. Although trade unions in
 less than a handful of factories have established workplace forums, the intent of the
 law is to build wide support within the trade union movement and business for such
 cooperative workplace relationships.
 To further reduce the adversarial nature of labor relations, the LRA also created
 a Commission for Conciliation, Mediation, and Arbitration (CCMA). Since its incep-
 tion in November 1996, the CCMA has resolved successfully many disputes referred
 to it and remains critical to the emergence of a less confrontational business cli-
 mate. The CCMA also gradually is beginning to play an interventionist role by get-
 ting involved in disputes before they deteriorate into a full-fledged strike or lockout.
 A labor court and a labor appeals court are other important creations of the LRA.
 The labor court has jurisdiction to resolve disputes that the CCMA is unable to me-
 diate to the satisfaction of both parties. Notwithstanding the existence of the CCMA
 and specialist courts for labor disputes, the thrust of industrial relations is to mini-
 mize the need for judicial intervention in labor relations, leaving it to the contend-
 ing parties themselves to resolve disputes whenever possible.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor by either adults or
 children is illegal under the Constitution and is not practiced.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits the employment of minors under the age of 15. However, the law gives
 discretionary powers to the Minister of Welfare to exempt certain types of work to
 allow individual employers or groups of employers to hire children under certain
 conditions (for example, on weekends and holidays when they are not in school).
 This is common practice in the agricultural and informal sector. Child labor also is
 used in the informal economy.
 The fact that children between 15 and 18 years of age are not protected by child
 labor laws has caused some debate within the Government. Labor Director General
 Sipho Pityana has stated that there were about 200,000 children working in 1997,
 mostly in the agricultural sector of the brick-making industry. Some working chil-
 dren are as young as 5-years-old. This figure did not include unpaid domestic work
 or children working in the informal sector. Child labor figures for the informal sec-
 tor are nearly impossible to quantifyr, since the Government has yet to identify the
 size of the informal sector's contribution to employment and the economy in general.
 The Government states a continuing commitment to abolishing child labor through
 new legislation and improving the enforcement of current child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legally mandated national mini-
 mum wage. Instead, unionized workers in the formal sector of the economy set wage
 rates on an industry-by-industry basis through annual negotiations with employer
 organizations. Such wages generally are sufficient to provide a decent standard of
 living for a worker and family. In those sectors where workers are not organized
 sufficiently to engage in the collective bargaining process, the Wage Act gives the
 Minister of Labor the authority to set wages. While the Wage Act does not apply
 
 
 392
 to farm laborers or domestic workers, the Government regulates such wages. How-
 ever, income disparities between skilled and unskilled workers and the income dis-
 tribution gap between rural and urban workers means that many workers are un-
 able to provide a decent standard of living for themselves or their family.
 The Basic Conditions of Employment Act, which went into effect in December
 1997, standardizes time and one-half pay for overtime, establishes a 45-hour work-
 week and longer maternity leave for women (4 months instead of 3). A ministerial
 determination exempted businesses employing fewer than 10 persons from certain
 provisions of the act concerning overtime and leave.
 Occupational health and safety issues are a top priority of trade unions, especially
 in the mining and heavy manufacturing industries. Although attention to these
 issues has increased significantly, including passage in 1993 of the Occupational
 Health and Safety Act, the country's industrial and mining processes are dangerous
 and sometimes deadly. Government attempts to reduce mining fatalities culminated
 in the 1996 Mine Health and Safety Act, which went into effect in January 1997.
 The act provides for the right of mine employees to remove themselves from work
 deemed dangerous to health or safety. Moreover, it establishes a tripartite mine
 health and safety council and an inspectorate of mine health and safety tasked with
 enforcing the act and monitoring compliance with its provisions. The act specifically
 makes it an offense for a company to discriminate against an employee who asserts
 a right granted by the act (for example, to leave a hazardous work site) and requires
 mine owners to file annual reports that provide statistics on health and safety inci-
 dents for each mine being worked.
 There are no laws or regulations in other industries that permit a worker to re-
 move themselves from work situations deemed dangerous to their health or safety.
