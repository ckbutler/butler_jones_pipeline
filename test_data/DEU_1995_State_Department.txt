 GERMANY
 The Federal Republic of Germany is a constitutional parliamentary democracy
 with an independent judiciary; citizens periodically choose their representatives in
 free and fair multiparty elections. The head of the Federal Government, the Chan-
 cellor, is elected by the lower house of Parliament. The powers of the Chancellor
 and of the Parliament are set forth in the Basic Law (Constitution). The 16 states
 enjoy significant autonomy, especially as concerns law enforcement and the courts,
 education, the environment, and social assistance.
 Law enforcement is primarily a responsibility of state governments, and the police
 are organized at the state level. The jurisdiction of the Federal Criminal Office is
 limited to international organized crime, especially narcotics trafficking, weapons
 smuggling, and currency counterfeiting. Police forces in general are well trained,
 disciplined, and mindful of citizens' rights, although there were occasional instances
 of police abuse.
 Germany's highly advanced economy affords its residents a high standard of liv-
 ing. The economy has been growing over the past2 years, recovering from a deep
 recession earlier in the decade which followed the postreunification boom. This
 growth, however, has resulted in an oniy gradual reduction of unemployment
 through mid-1995. In the East, where economic integration and growth continued
 particulariy strongly, employment has increased mre noticeably than in the West.
 Nonethele, overall unemployment in eastern Germany remains significantly high-
 er than in the country's western half as the region continues to grapple with adjust-
 ment to free market conditions. Unemployment in the East affects women dis-
 proportionately mere than men.
 The Government fully respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law and
 judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse. How-
 ever, there were instances of admitted police abuse of prisoners, frequently foreign-
 ers. Although violence or harassment directed at foreigners continued to occur with-
 in society as a whole, the number of incidents declined markedly, as was the case
 in 1994. Official data show that the number of violent offenses of all kinds by right-
 wing extremists decreased by 14 percent in the first 6 months of 1995 compared
 with the same period in 1994. Rightwing violence against foreigners decreased by
 27 percent. Rightwing extremist violence rose sharply after German unification but
 peaked in 1992 and has since been declining. Still, there were a significant number
 of attacks on property or persons, and foreigners were the victims somewhat mere
 often than not.
 Anti-Semitic incidents increased but remained few in absolute terms. Most in-
 volved graffiti or distribution of anti-Semitic materials. The synagogue in Luebeck
 firebombed in 1994, was subjected to another arson attack on May 7, but the alleged
 perpetrator was apparently not acting for political or anti-Semitic reasons. The over-
 whelming majority of the perpetrators of attacks on foreigners or anti-Semitic acts
 were frustrated, apolitical youths and a small core of neo-Nazis. All the major politi-
 cal parties and all the highest officials of the Federal Republic denounced violence
 against foreigners and anti-Semitic acts.
 Women continue to face wage discrimination in the private sector. The Govern-
 ment is taking serious steps to address violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 Some murders occurred among rival factions of Iranians, Kurds, Turks, and other
 foreign nationals. The federal and state authorities sought to find and prosecute the
 perpetrators of such crimes and pressed charges in several trials.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is not mentioned in the Basic Law, but it is forbidden by law.
 There continue to be serious allegations of police brutality against foreigners.
 Hamburg officials instituted investigations of over 80 police and other officials for
 possible mistreatment of arrested foreigners; 16 were eventually charged. The Ham-
 burg chief of police went into early retirement shortly thereafter. A policeman
 
 
 870
 charged with mistreating an Iraqi asylum seeker during the 1994 Ascension Sunday
 antiforeigner violence in Magdburg was found innocent.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Basic Law prohibits arbitrary arrest,
 detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition. To make an ar-
 rest, police must obtain a judicial warrant. By the day after arrest, police must
 bring the suspect before a judge and lodge a charge. The court must then either
 issue a warrant stating the grounds for detention or order the person's release.
 There is no preventive detention. If there is evidence that the suspect might flee
 the country, police may detain the suspect for up to 24 hours pending a formal
 charge The right of free access to legal counsel has been restricted only in the cases
 of terrorists suspected of having used contacts with lawyers to continue terrorist ac-
 tivity while in prison. Only judges may decide on the validity of any deprivation of
 liberty. Bail exists but is seldom employed; the usual practice is to release detainees
 unless there is clear danger of flighWt outside the country. There is no use of forced
 exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Basic Law provides for the right to a fair
 trial, and an independent judiciary vigorously enforces this right. The court system
 is highly developed and provides full [egal protection and numerous possibilities for
 judicial review. Ordinary courts have jurisdiction in criminal and civil matters.
 There are four levels of such courts (local courts, regional courts, higher regional
 courts, and the federal Court of Justice), with appeals possible from lower to higher
 levels. In addition, there are four types of specialized courts. adminstrative, labor,
 social, and fiscal courts. These courts are aaso established on different levels, with
 the possibility for appeal at the next higher level.
 Separate from these five branches of jurisdiction is the Federal Constitutional
 Court, which is not only the country's Supreme Court but an organ of the Constitu-
 tion with special functions defined in the Basic Law. Among other things, it reviews
 laws to ensure their compatibility with the Constitution and adjudicates disputes
 between constitutional organs on questions of competencies. It also has jurisdiction
 to hear and decide a claim based on the infringement of a person's basic constitu-
 tional rights by a public authority. The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and
 efficient judicial process.
 There wee no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Prnvacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Basic Law prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these
 prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Basic Law provides for freedom of the
 press, and the Government respects this right in practice. There is no official censor-
 ship. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic po-
 litical system, combine to ensure freedom of speech and the press, including aca-
 demic freedom. Nazi propaanda and that of other prescribed organizations are ile-
 gal. Statements endorsing Nazism are also illegal. Several persons were indicted for
 making statements or distributing materials that were alleged to fall into these cat-
 egories, including two American citizens, one of whom was said to be the producer
 of the maor    of neo-Nazi material imported into Germany.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 The Basic Law permits baing political parties found to be "fundamentally anti-
 democratic." A 1950's ruling by the Federa Constitutional Court outlawed a neo-
 Nazi and a Communist party. State governments may outlaw only organizations
 that are active solely within their state. If a group's activities cross state lines, the
 Federal Government assumes jurisdiction.
 Four far-right pelitical grups, not organized as political parties, were banned in
 late 1992. The Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), along with 35 subsidiary orgamza-
 tions, was banned in 1993. Also in 1993, the Federal Government asked the Con-
 stittional Court to ban the far-right Free German Workers' Party; the Court's deci-
 sion was stillpendingat year's end. Several extremist parties were under observa-
 tion by the 0mice tor te Protection of the Constitution (BFV, the internal security
 service), although such monitoring may by law not interfere with the organizations'
 continued activities. The BFV reported that 56,600 people belonged to far-right or-
 ganizations in 1994, of whom some 5,600 were considered violence-prone.
 c. Freedom f Religion.-The Basic Law specifically provides for religious freedom.
 The Government fully supports religious freedom. Moat of the population belongs to
 the Catholic or Protestant Churches. These denominations and the small Jewish
 
 
 871
 community hold a special legal status as corporate bodies under public law, giving
 them, for instance, the right to participate in a state-administered church tax sys-
 tem. State governments subsidize church-affiliated schools and provide religous in-
 struction in schools and universities for those belonging to the Protestant, Catholic,
 or Jewish faith.
 Members of the Church of Scientology continue to allege beth social and govern-
 ment-condoned harassment, such as being fired from a job or expelled from (or not
 permitted to Join) a political party. Major German political parties exclude
 Scientologists from membership, arguing that Scientology is not a religion but a for-
 profit organization, whose goals and principles are inconsistent with those of the po-
 litical parties. Business firms whose owners or executives belong to the Church of
 Sciento ogy may face boycotts and discrimination, sometimes with governmental ap-
 provaL Artists have been prevented from performing or displaying their works be-
 cause of their Scientology membership. Public criticism of Scientologists by leading
 political figures increased during the year, with one Cabinet member publicly stat-
 ing that Scientologists were unfit to serve as teachers, police officers, or professors.
 Scientologists continued to take such grievances to court, and the courts have fre-
 quently ruled in their favor.
 d. Feedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to move anywhere within the country, to travel
 abroad, to emigrate, and to repatriate, without restrictions that violate human
 rights.
 For ethnic Germans entering the country, the Basic Law provides both for citizen-
 ship immediately upon application and for legal residence without restrictions. Per-
 sons not of German ethnicity may acquire citizenship (and with it the right of unre-
 stricted residence) if they meet certain requirements, including legal residence for
 at least 10 years (5 if married to a German), renunciation of a  other citizenships,
 and a basic command of the language. Long-term legal residents often opt not to
 apply; they receive the same social benefits as do citizens, and after 10 years of legal
 residency they are entitled to permanent residency. Representatives of the Turkish
 and Roma communities in Germany have criticized the citizenship policy as unjust
 and discriminatory and have opposed the policy against dual nationality.
 The Basic Law provides for the right of foreign victims of political persecution to
 attain asylum in Germany. However, since an amendment of the asylum law took
 effect on July 1, 1993, tightening the criteria for granting asylum, applications have
 dropped sharply. Applications in 1994 were fewer than in any year since 1989, and
 this trend continues.
 Under the tightened criteria, persons coming directly from any country that offi-
 cials designate as a "safe country of origin" cannot normally claim political asylum,
 but may request an administrative review of their applications while in Germany.
 Persons entering via a "safe third country-any country in the European Union or
 adhering to the Geneva Convention-are also ineligible for asylum.
 The legislated changes also limited legal recourse against denials of asylum appli-
 cations. Critics argue that few countries can assuredly be designated as "safe third
 countries" and that the law unjustly fails to allow applicants to rebut such designa-
 tions. While the law permits appeals against designations of "safe countries of ori-
 gin,* critics protest that the 48-hour period allotted for hearings is too brief.
 Asylum seekers with applications under review enjoy virtually the full range of
 civil rights except the right to vote. While less than 5 percent of applicants have
 attained political asylum,denial does not automatically result in deportation. Most
 rejected applicants are allowed to remain in the country for humanitarian reasons,
 especially tose from the former Yugoslavia.
 Applicants who have been conclusively denied asylum are placed in detention
 pending deportation. Some police detention facilities, particularly in Berlin, are
 overcrowded or otherwise seriously substandard.
 On July 12, Germany signed an agreement with Vietnam on development aid
 which included funds for the repatriation of Vietnamese citizens living illegally in
 Germany. The plan calls for up to 300 illegal residents to be deported every month,
 but the two countries have not worked out detailed mechanisms for the procedure
 and only 30 have been deported as of December 1. The Government has said it will
 begin with illegal immigrants, rejected asylum seekers, and convicted criminals.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Basic Law provides citizens with the right to peacefully change their govern-
 ment, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections. The Government is elected on the basis of universal suffrage and secret
 balloting. Members of the Parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, are elected from
 
 
 a mixture of direct-constituency and party-list candidates. The upper house, the
 Bundesrat, is composed of delegations from state governments.
 The law entitles women to participate fully in political life, and a growing number
 are prominent in the Government and the parties, but women are still substantially
 underrepresented in those ranks. Slightly over 26 percent of the Federal Parliament
 is female, including its President. Women occupy 3 of 16 cabinet positions. One state
 minister president is a woman. On the Federal Constitutional Court, 4 of the 16
 judges are women, including the Chief Justice. All of the parties have undertaken
 to enlist more women. The Greens/Alliance 90 Party requires that women comprise
 half of the party's elected officials. The Social Democrats have a 40-percent quota
 for women on all party committees and governing bodies. The Christian Democrats
 voted at their October convention not to mandate a one-third quota.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are very cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religlon, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits denial of access to shelter, health care, or education on the
 basis of race, religion, disability, sex, ethnic background, political opinion, or citizen-
 ship. The Government enforces the law effectively.
 Women.-While violence    against women    occurs and   is almost certainly
 underreported, it is prohibited by laws which are effectively enforced. It is con-
 demned in society, and legal and medical recourse is available. Trafficking in
 women and forced prostitution is forbidden by law as well. The laws against traf-
 ficking in women were modified in 1992 to deal more effectively with problems
 stemming from the opening of Germany's eastern borders. In recent years, the Fed-
 eral Ministry for Women and Youth commissioned a number of studies to gain infor-
 mation on violence against women, sexual harassment, and other matters, produc-
 ing for example a special report on violence against women in 1995.
 Germany has been a party to the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All
 Forms of Discrimination against Women since 1985 and supported the appointment
 of a special rapporteur on violence against women at the U.N. Human Rights Com-
 mission. The Government has conducted campaigns in the schools and through
 church groups to bring public attention to the existence of such violence and pro-
 posed steps to counter it. The Federal Government has supported numerous pilot
 projects throughout Germany. There are, for example, 330 "women's houses" in Ger-
 many, over 100 in the new states in the east, where victims of violence and their
 children can seek shelter, counseling, and legal and police protection. Police statis-
 tics on rape showed a 4.4 percent decrease to 6,095 cases in 1994 (latest data) from
 6,376 in 1993.
 Children.-The Government is committed to protection of children's rights, and
 there is no culturally based pattern of abuse of human rights of children in Ger-
 many. The Government nevertheless recognizes that violence against children is a
 problem requiring its attention. Police figures indicate there were 15,096 reported
 cases of sexual abuse of children in 1994 (latest available figures), down slightly
 from 1993. Officials believe that the numbers of unreported cases may be much
 higher. The Child and Youth Protection Law stresses the need for preventive meas-
 ures, and the Ministry for the Family, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth has taken
 account of this in stepping up its counseling and other assistance.
 The Criminal Code was amended in 1993 to further protect children against por-
 nography and sexual abuse. For possession of child pornography, the maximum sen-
 tence is 1 year's imprisonment; for distribution, 5 years'. The amendment made sex-
 ual abuse of children by German citizens abroad punishable even if the action is
 not illegal in the child's own country.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against the disabled in em-
 ployment, education, or in the provision of other state services. The law mandates
 several special services for disabled persons, and the Government enforces these
 provisions in practice. The disabled are entitled to assistance to avert, eliminate, or
 alleviate the consequences of their disabilities and to secure employment commensu-
 rate with their abilities. The Government offers vocational training and grants for
 employers who hire the handicapped. The severely disabled may be granted special
 benefits, such as tax breaks, free public transport, special parking facilities, and ex-
 emption from radio and television fees.
 
 
 873
 The Federal Government has established guidelines for attainment of "barrier-
 free" public buildings and for modifications of streets and pedestrian traffic walks
 to accommodate the disabled. While it is up to the individual states to incorporate
 these guidelines into building codes, all 16 states now have access facilities for the
 handicapped.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Police data show the number of violent of-
 fenses by rightwing extremists decreased by 14 percent in the first 6 months of 1995
 compared with the same period in 1994, continuing a downtrend since 1992. Right-
 wing violence against foreigners declined by 27 percent. As in previous years, most
 of these offenses were directed against foreign residents, but the decline in
 xenophobic offenses since 1993 continued to be steeper than in other kinds of mani-
 festations of rightwing extremist violence. Eight American exchange students of
 Asian descent were attacked and slightly injured by right wingers in July in
 Merseburg. Charges have been brought in this case, but the trial had not convened
 by year's end.
 Ethnic Turks continue to credibly complain about societal and job-related dis-
 crimination. Pro-Kurdish demonstrations led to injuries of 47 policemen and 3 dem-
 onstrators in Frankfurt in July. Isolated firebombing incidents occurred during this
 same period targeting Turkish businesses establishments. There have been no ar-
 rests in connection with these firebombings.
 The Karlsruhe Regional Court sentenced NPD Chairman Guenther Dickert to 2
 years' imprisonment in April in connection with denial of the holocaust.
 Since late 1993, officials and courts have generally dealt with extremist crimes
 more vigorously than previously. On October 13, a Dusseldorf court sentenced four
 men in the May 1993 arson murders of five Turks, the worst killing in the wave
 of rightwing violence since reunification. Markus Gartmann was sentenced to 15
 years' imprisonment for killing two women and three girls--all members of the
 same family-in a firebomb attack in the town of Solingen. Three accomplices tried
 as juveniles received maximum sentences of 10 years.
 Perpetrators of rightwing violence were predominantly young, male, and low in
 socioeconomic status, often committing such acts while inebriated. As in the past,
 most acts of violence against minority groups were committed spontaneously. As in
 the past, there was evidence that neo-Nazi groups continue to make efforts for
 greater coordination among themselves.
 In addition to voicing condemnation of the violence, the Government rec-
 ommended tougher anticrime legislation and law-enforcement measures, as well as
 measures aimed at the societal roots of extremist violence and other crime. In the
 eastern states, governments introduced several model, social and educational pro-
 grams designed to counteract the root causes of xenophobia and intolerance. Eastern
 state governments also undertook efforts to reinvigorate enforcement of laws against
 violence by extremists. For such projects, however, state governments have thus far
 allocated only limited funds in their tight budgets.
 The police in the eastern states continued to become better versed in the federal
 legal system, better trained, and more experienced, and by year's end they began
 to achieve the standards of effectiveness characteristic of police in the rest of Ger-
 many. Certainly the level of rightwing activity in the new states continued to de-
 crease, and the police and state officials showed greater coordination in moving
 quickly and effectively to prevent illegal rightwing and neo-Nazi gatherings and
 demonstrations.
 Sinti and Romani leaders expressed satisfaction at the signing by the Government
 of the Council of Europe Convention on Minorities. Germany submitted an interpre-
 tation of the Convention in which Sinti and Roma were explicitly mentioned as eth-
 nic minorities in Germany, providing them the recognition which they had long
 sought.
 Religious Minorities.-Anti-Semitic acts increased, with 634 incidents reported in
 the first 6 months of 1995. Over 90 percent of these anti-Semitic incidents involved
 graffiti, the distribution of anti-Semitic materials, or the display of symbols of
 banned organizations. The most significant act was the firebombing of the 100-year-
 old synagogue in Luebeck on May 7, the second such attack in 14 months. Although
 the building was occupied at the time of the attack, there were no casualties. There
 have been no arrests in this case. Three perpetrators of the 1994 attack were con-
 victed in April and sentenced to 4 years' and 6 months' imprisonment. A fourth per-
 petrator received a prison sentence of 2 years and 6 months. A suspect in the 1995
 attack was apprehended in September, and there is evidence that the motivation
 for the attack may not have been anti-Semitic in origin.
 
 
 874
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right to associate freely, choose representatives,
 determine programs and policies to represent workers' interests, and publicize views
 is recognized and freely exercised. Some 37 percent of the total eligible labor force
 belong to unions. The German Trade Union Federation (DGB) represents 85 percent
 of organized workers and participates in various international and European trade
 union organizations.
 The law provides for the right to strike, except for civil servants (including teach-
 ers) and personnel in sensitive positions, such as members of the armed forces. In
 the past, the International Labr Organization (ILO) has criticized the Govern-
 ment's definition of "essential services" as overly broad. The ILO was responding to
 complaints about sanctions imposed on teachers who struck in the state of Hesse
 in 1989 and, earlier, the replacement of striking postal workers by civil servants.
 In neither case did permanent job loss result. The ILO continues to seek clarifica-
 tions from the Government on policies and laws governing labor rights of civil serv-
 ants.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Basic Law provides for
 the right to organize and bargain collectively, and this right is widely exercised. Due
 to a well-developed system of autonomous contract negotiations, mediation is un-
 common. Basic wages and working conditions are negotiated at the industry level
 and then are adapted, through local collective bargaining, to particular enterprises.
 However, some firms in eastern Germany have refused to join employer associa-
 tions or have withdrawn from them, and then bargained independently with work-
 ers. Likewise, some large firms in the west withdrew at least part of their work
 force from the jurisdiction of employer associations, complaining of rigidities in the
 centralized negotiating system. They have not, however, refused to bargain as indi-
 vidual enterprises. The law mandates a system of works councils and worker mem-
 bership on supervisory boards, and thus workers participate in the management of
 the enterprises in which they work. The law thoroughly protects workers against
 antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Basic Law prohibits forced or
 compulsory labor, and there were no known violations.
 d. Minimum Agqe for Employment of Children.-Federal law generally prohibits
 employment of children under age 15, with a few exceptions: those age 13 or 14 may
 do farm work for up to 3 hours per day or may deliver newspapers for up to 2 hours
 per day; those ages 3 to 14 may take part in cultural performances, albeit under
 stringent crbs on the kinds of activity, number of hours, and time of day. The Fed-
 eral Labor Ministry effectively enforces the law through its Factory Inspection Bu-
 reau.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated or administratively de-
 termined minimum wage. Wages and salaries are set either by collective bargaining
 agreements between industrial unions and employer federations or by individual
 contracts. Covering about 90 percent of all wage- and salary-earners, these agree-
 ments set minimum ay rates and are legally enforceable. These minimums provide
 an adequate standara of living for workers and their families. The number of  hours
 of work per week is regulatedby contracts that directly or indirectly affect 80 per-
 _cent of the working population. The average workweek for industrial workers is 36
 hours ia western Germany and about 39 hours in the eastern states.
 An extensive set of laws and regulations on occupational safety and health incor-
 porates a growing body of European Union standards. These provide for the right
 to refuse to perform dangerous or unhealthy work without jeopardizing employment.
 A comprehensive system of worker-insurance carriers enforces safety requ~irements
 in the workpl  . Ts sstem now applies in the eastern states, where lax stand-
 ards and conditions under the Communist regime created serious problems. The
 Labor Ministry and its counterparts in the states effectively enforce occupational
 safety and health standards through a network of government organs, incud  the
 Federal Institute for Work Safety. At the local level, professional and trade associa-
 tions--self-gverning public corporations with delegates both from the employers
 and from the unions--oversee worker safety.
