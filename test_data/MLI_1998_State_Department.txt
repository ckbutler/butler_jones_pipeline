 MALI
 Mali is a relatively centralized constitutional democracy now pursuing decen-
 tralization through local elections. President Alpha Oumar Konare was reelected to
 a second 5-year term in. 1997. A collective of 18 opposition parties that boycotted
 the 1997 presidential and legislative elections, which were ad stratively flawed
 but considered generally free and without evident fraud, also boycotted the June
 municipal elections. The opposition parties claimed that the elections were unconsti-
 tutional because the Government failed to carry out annual updates of electoral
 lists. However, some opposition candidates chose to participate by running as inde-
 pendents. The ruling Alliance for Democracy in Mali (ADEMA), led by President
 Konare, dominates the National Assembly, which includes representatives of opposi-
 tion and ADEMA-aligned parties. In 1997 the President reappointed Prime Minister
 Ibrahim Boubacar Keita as head of government. The Government named a new cab-
 inet in September 1997 that includes opposition and ADEMA-aligned members.
 Local elections took place in June in 19 urban communities. However, in four of
 these communities, more than one-third of the council members subsequently re-
 signed resulting in the municipal councils being dissolved by law. In September the
 Government postponed until April 1999 the rural elections previously scheduled for
 November. The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary, but in practice
 the Government continues to exert influence on the judiciary.
 Security forces are composed of the army, air force, Gendarmerie, the National
 Guard, and the police. The army and air force are under the control of the civilian
 Minister of the Armed Forces and Veterans, as are the Gendarmerie and the Na-
 tional Guard. The police are under the Ministry of Territorial Administration and
 Security. The police and gendarmes share responsibility for internal security. The
 Government continued the process of integrating elements of former Tuareg rebel
 forces into its armed forces. Members of the security forces were responsible for a
 few human rights abuses.
 Mali is a very poor country with a market-based economy. Most of the work force
 is employed in the agricultural sector, particularly farming and animal husbandry.
 The country's principal exports are cotton, livestock, and gold. There is a very small
 industrial sector, largely based on the manufacture of textiles, beverages, and proc-
 essed food products. The Gross National Product is approximately $251 per capita,
 which provides most of the population with a low standard of living. The economy
 depends heavily upon foreign assistance. Desertification and social limitations, in-
 cluding a current estimated literacy rate of roughly 20 percent and a high popu-
 lation growth rate, contribute to poverty. Poor infrastructure, minimal foreign in-
 vestment, administrative inefficiency, and corruption are also important factors in
 limiting economic growth.
 The Government generally respected constitutional provisions for freedom of
 speech, press, assembly, association, and religion. However, prison conditions re-
 mained poor, there were instances of arbitrary arrest and detention, and the judicial
 system's large case backlog resulted in long periods of pretrial detention. The judici-
 ary continued to be subject to executive influence. There were a few instances in
 which freedom of assembly was limited. Social and cultural factors continued to
 sharply limit economic and educational opportunities for most women. The Govern-
 ment closed secondary schools and colleges in January following violent student
 demonstrations in support of higher stipends and better conditions. Societal violence
 against women and children, including spousal abuse and female genital mutilation
 (FGM), is widespread. There were two serious incidents of societal violence related
 to religious tension. There was an incident of mob violence against Christian mis-
 sionaries that resulted in several injuries and significant property damage. In a sep-
 arate incident, adherents of a traditionalist Muslim sect killed a judge who had de-
 tained some of the sect's members. Gendarmes, local hunters, and military veterans
 killed 11 members of the sect in an exchange of gunfire following a subsequent jail-
 break. Some Malian children were sold into forced labor in Cote D'Ivoire; the Gov-
 ernment arrested several traffickers. A number of persons died in incidents of mob
 violence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by security forces during the year.
 In August members of a traditionalist Muslim sect, the 'pieds nus" (bare feet),
 murdered a judge who had imprisoned one of their members for a minor infraction,
 and attacked the town jail, releasing the prisoners, many of whom later returned
 
 
 voluntarily. Gendarmes and local hunters killed 11 members of the sect in a skir-
 mish following the jailbreak (see Section 5).
 There were no developments in the 1994 deaths of the Swiss Cooperation Mission
 director and his two Malian colleagues, who were killed by an army patrol in
 Niafunke. A government mission of inquiry into their deaths determined that the
 actions were unwarranted and unjustified. However, to date, the Government has
 taken no action to expedite the case, which remains on file at a regional court.
 In the evening prior to the June municipal election in Segou, individuals seeking
 to disrupt the elections threw a grenade into the courtyard of the regional rep-
 resentative of the electoral commission, killing the deputy chief commissioner's
 adult daughter and wounding several other persons. Several persons were arrested
 and charged with assault and attempt to kill; the case remained under judicial in-
 vestigation at year's end.
 The persons accused of the May 1997 bombing of the Bamako market on election
 day were tried and sentenced to imprisonment in November but immediately par-
 doned by the President. Similarly, the persons accused of shooting and killing two
 opposition activists and wounding several other persons in San in July 1997 were
 convicted and imprisoned but pardoned by the President early in the year. The 10
 opposition party officials accused of inciting a mob to kill a police officer at an oppo-
 sition rally in August 1997 were also convicted and imprisoned but pardoned by the
 President early in the year (see Sections 1.c. and i.e.).
 In February a mob attacked a rural police stationand subsequenty killed two in-
 dividuals held there who were accused of murdering a man while stealing his motor-
 cycle
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and the authorities generally respect
 these provisions.
 Amnesty International (Al), in reports released in November 1997 and in October,
 cited allegations by former detainees and an independent witness that members of
 the security forces had tortured them in order to extract confessions in some cases.
 Although senior government officials voiced skepticism about these reports, the Gov-
 ernment invited AI to continue its monitoring and reporting activities (see Section
 4). In the two cases on which Al's allegations of torture chiefly focused, namely the
 case of the 1997 election day bombing of the Bamako market (see Section l.a.) and
 the case of military officers accused of planning a coup (see Section i.e.), the defend-
 ants were released soon after their convictions, either because the President par-
 doned them or because the court imposed short sentences including the time that
 they already had been detained.
 Prison conditions are poor. Prisons continue to be characterized by overcrowding,
 inadequate medical facilities, and limited food supplies. They remain below mini-
 mum international standards. In Bamako juvenile offenders are usually held in the
 same prison as adult offenders but are kept in separate cells. Women are housed
 in the same prison facility as men but live in a separate compound. In regional pris-
 ons outside the capital, men and women are housed in the same building but in sep-
 arate cells. In these facilities, children share cells with adult prisoners of the same
 sex. In late 1997, the Justice Minister made a fact finding tour of the prison system,
 which led to the closing of the colonial-era Kidal prison with its prisoners given day-
 time jobs in the remote northern desert town. The Minister initiated an overall re-
 view of prison conditions and, at year's end, the review still was ongoing. In Decem-
 ber the Justice Minister confirmed that poor prison conditions persist. Also in De-
 cember, the Government inaugurated a new detention center in Bamako for women
 and children with an emphasis on reeducation and return to society.
 Several organizations, including the Malian Association of Human Rights, the Ma-
 lian Association of Women Jurists, and other nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's) visited prisoners and are working with women and juvenile prisoners to im-
 prove their conditions. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) contin-
 ued to visit leading members of the former government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that suspects
 must be charged or released within 48 hours and that they are entitled to counsel.
 In practice, however, detainees are not always charged within the 48-hour period.
 Moreover, administrative backlogs and insufficient lawyers, judges, and courts often
 cause lengthy delays in bringing people to trial. In extreme cases, individuals have
 remained several years in prison before coming to trial For example, Abdoulaye
 Diallo had been detained since 1995, prior to his conviction in March for embezzle-
 ment during his tenure as Minister of Health under the regime of General Moussa
 Traore, who was President until 1991. He was sentenced for crimes of bloodshed to
 
 
 3 years of imprisonment that included time spent in custody. He was absolved of
 economic crimes.
 Judicial warrants are required for arrest. Local lawyers have estimated that about
 half of prison inmates are pretrial detainees. Limited rights of bail or the granting
 of conditional liberty exist, particularly for minor crimes and civil matters. On occa-
 sion the authorities release defendants on their own recognizance.
 In April the Government arrested about 40 students, detained them for 3 days,
 and then released them (see Section 2.b.).
 In September police detained a newspaper publishing manager for questioning re-
 garding an article about the President (see Section 2.a.).
 Former first lady Mariam Traore and former Customs Commissioner Douah Abra-
 ham Sissoko, who were placed under detention following the fall of the Moussa
 Traore regime in 1991, remain under detention. They were convicted and sentenced
 to death in 1993, but President Konare commuted their sentences to prison terms
 in December 1997. In 1997 former President Traore, his wife, and Sissoko were
 charged with "economic crimes," including "abuse of a position of power," and "illicit
 enrichment." Their cases, and similar cases involving five other senior officials of
 the Traore regime, came to trial in October.
 The Government does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but the executive branch continues to exert influence over the judiial system.
 The Ministry of Justice appoints and has the power to suspend judges and super-
 vises both law enforcement and judicial functions, and the President heads the Su-
 perior Judicial Council, which oversees judicial activity.
 The Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative powers. The Constitution
 established a separate Constitutional Court that oversees issues of constitutionality
 and acts as an election arbiter. The Constitution also provides for the convening of
 a High Court of Justice with the power to try senior government officials in cases
 of treason.
 Except in the case of minors, trials are public, and defendants have the right to
 be present and have an attorney of their choice. Defendants are presumed innocent
 and have the right to confront witnesses and to appeal decisions to the Supreme
 Court. Court-appointed attorneys are provided for the indigent without charge. The
 village chief in consultation with the elders decides the majority of disputes in rural
 areas. If these decisions are challenged in court, only those found to have legal
 merit are upheld.
 Women and minorities are not discriminated against in courts, but traditional
 practice discriminates against women in inheritance matters.
 Amnesty International in an October report described the arrest in 1996, deten-
 tion in 1997, and ultimate trial and conviction in March of seven military officers,
 including former minister Mady Diallo, accused of plotting to overthrow the Govern-
 ment. The report concluded that there were irregularities throughout the process,
 that confessions were provided under duress, and that the entire process and the
 subsequent sentences were politically motivated. The prosecution, however, de-
 scribed the officers' claimed labor union activities within the officer corps as a veiled
 attempt to organize a coup. The accused were released in March, having already
 served in detention most of the prison terms to which they were sentenced.
 There were no other reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, and the Government respects
 this right in practice. Police searches are infrequent and require judicial warrants.
 Security forces do, however, maintain physical and technical surveillance of individ-
 uals and groups believed to be threats to internal security, including surveillance
 of telephone and written correspondence of individuals deemed to be a threat to na-
 tional security.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government generally respected these rights in practice.
 There are approximately 40 private newspapers and journals, in French, Arabic,
 and local languages. There are five daily newspapers: four are privately owned, of
 which one is allied with the ruling party; one is government controlled.
 The Government does not censor print, broadcast, or electronic media, which often
 offer editorials critical of the Government and opposition alike. Laws passed in 1993
 regulate the press and provide for substantial criminal penalties, including impris-
 onment, for libel and for public injury to the Head of State, other officials, and for-
 eign diplomats; these laws leave injury undefined and subject to judicial interpreta-
 tion. However, the current Government has never prosecuted journalists on criminal
 
 
 258
 libel charges. There were no journalists incarcerated at year's end, and, other than
 an opposition journalist detained briefly for questioning, no journalists were ar-
 rested on libel charges. There were no incidents of civil libel actions against journal-
 ists or seizure of print runs or other government harassment of journalists or the
 media.
 On   May   18, Cheick  Oumar Konare, editor-in-chief of a Bamako-based
 proopposition daily, Sud Info, announced that he was quitting journalism under gov-
 ernment pressure. Konare stated that on May 12 a group of masked men pulled
 from his car, took him to a ravine, gagged him, beat him, and threatened to kill
 him and all other journalists critical of ADEMA. Konare also stated that on May
 17 his car was set on fire while parked in front of his house. However, independent
 observers did not substantiate Konare's account of these events, and he did not re-
 port them to the police.
 On September 15, police detained Chouadou Traore, the publishing manager of
 a private Bamako daily newspaper, Nouvel Horizon, and questioned him regarding
 an article that claimed that the President might consider changing the Constitution
 to permit him to run for a third term of office. The manager was released the same
 day without being charged.
 The Government controls one television station and one of many radio stations,
 but all present a wide range of views, including those critical of the Government,
 the President, the Prime Minister, and other politicians.
 The relative expense of newspapers and television, coupled with a low literacy
 rate, makes radio the most prevalent medium of mass information and communica-
 tion. Fifteen private radio stations exist in Bamako, and there are approximately
 40 additional stations throughout the country.
 Two private television companies rebroadcast French, British, South African, and
 American television programs, including news bulletins. However, there are no pri-
 vate television stations that broadcast domestically produced programs. The legal
 framework for private television has been in place since 1992; however, the Govern-
 ment is still developing the fee schedules. Radio KLEDU has had an approved appli-
 cation on record since 1992, but it also is awaiting announcement of the fee sched-
 ules and examining its financial base before starting private television broadcasting.
 At present there is no legal provision allowing private ownership of a television sta-
 tion; however, private retransmission stations are allowed. The Government made
 little progress toward private television licensing during the year.
 Domestic reception and distribution of foreign satellite and cable television is per-
 mitted and fairly widespread, especially in Bamako. Four domestic servers provide
 access to the Internet. Licenses to operate Internet servers are granted freely and
 are not prohibitively expensive.
 Academic freedom generally is respected; however, in April security forces made
 a mass arrest of students attending a meeting on the campus of an institute of high-
 er education (see Section 2.b.).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government generally respects this right in practice;
 however, there were a few exceptions. The law requires groups that wish to hold
 public meetings to obtain the mayor's permission; such permission is granted rou-
 nely. However, in April the Government arrested about 40 students during a meet-
 ing of the Malian Students's Association held on the campus of the National School
 of Administration to plan coordinated student demonstrations for improved edu-
 cational conditions. Those arrested included two members of the Malian Student Co-
 ordination Bureau, its secretary general Bakary Mariko, and its administrative sec-
 retary Lamine Badi. However, no one was charged and all were released 3 days
 later. During the weekend of the June 21 municipal elections, the Government de-
 nied permits to opposition groups seeking to hold rallies in congested public areas
 where preelection violence occurred in 1997. In the weeks prior to the elections, the
 Government issued permits to opposition and student groups that held a number
 of demonstrations.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government re-
 spects this right is practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and- de-
 clares Mali to be a secular state. The Government does not discriminate on religious
 grounds, and all persons are free to practice their faiths. There are restrictions
 against the Baha'i faith; however, they seldom are enforced and Baha'is generally
 practice their faith freely. The law allows for religious practices that do notpose
 a threat to social stability and peace. Muslims make up about 90 percent of the
 country's popuiation. Most non-Muslims practice traditional animist religions or no
 religion, but there is also a small Christian minority. Persons are free to change
 their religion. Muslims and non-Muslims are free to proselytize. The Minister of
 
 
 259
 
 Territorial Administration and Security can prohibit religious publications that he
 concludes defame another religion, but there were no known instances of publica-
 tions being prohibited.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects them in practice. The Government generally does not restrict inter-
 nal movement and does not restrict international travel. However, police routinely
 stop and check both citizens and foreigners to restrict the movement of contraband
 and to verify vehicle registrations. Some police and gendarmes use the occasion to
 extort bribes.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. In June the Government passed legislation regarding the status of refugees,
 which conforms to the provisions of the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status
 of Refugees. The Government provides first asylum for refugees. There were no re-
 ports of the forced return of persons to a country where they fearedpersecution. In
 May the Government expelled four senior officers from the armed forces of the
 former Zaire who requested refugee status upon their arrival from Cote d'Ivoire. The
 Government returned the four officers and their families to Cote d'Ivoire.
 The estimated 10,000 Mauritanian refugees living in western Mali, constitute a
 quasi-refugee population. However, neither Mali nor Mauritania accords refugee
 status to members of these pastoralist border groups, who historically make cross-
 frontier migrations. The UNHCR continues to provide assistance and incentives for
 voluntary repatriation to Mauritania, but many nomads of Mauritanian origin shun
 these efforts due to a perceived lack of economic opportunity in Mauritania.
 The UNHCR successfully completed the repatriation of Malian refugees displaced
 by the Tuareg rebellions of the early 1990's. The UNHCR has closed the refugee
 camps formerly located in neighboring countries. However, the UNHCR retains a
 presence in northern Mali as a follow-on to resettlement efforts aimed at former ref-
 ugee populations and continues to coordinate with NGO's and the Government in
 the overall effort to revitalize the economic situation in the north.
 Mali hosts approximately 2,000 Sierra Leonian, Liberian, and other refugees. The
 UNHCR office in Bamako reports a registered caseload of 1,060 Sierra Leonians,
 300 Liberians, and 440 other nationals as of year's end.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government and did so for the first time
 in 1992. In 1997 citizens elected President Alpha Oumar Konare to a second 5-year
 term by secret ballot in elections that were open to all and free of evident fraud
 and manipulation. Konare won 96 percent of the vote, but voter turnout was report-
 edly 20 to 25 percent; most opposition parties boycotted the election, citing flaws in
 the voter registration system. The opposition continued to charge that the Govern-
 ment failed to carry out constitutionally mandated annual electoral list revisions
 and that, therefore, the elections should be declared invalid.
 Under the Constitution, the President is Chief of State and Commander-in-Chief
 of the armed forces and is elected for a term of 5 years with a limit of two terms.
 The President appoints the Prime Minister. Additionally, the President appoints
 other members of the Government and sets limits on their powers. He names civil
 servants (national directors, regional governors, and others) and high military offi-
 cers as mandated by the Constitution. The President also promulgates laws within
 15 days, following transmission to the Government of a final adopted text. He can
 veto and return legislation to the National Assembly for reconsideration. There is
 no provision for the National Assembly to override a presidential veto. The Presi-
 dent may submit all questions of national interest to referendum after consultation
 with the Constitutional Court. He exercises the power of pardon and can grant am-
 nesty. The President may dissolve the National Assembly and call for new elections,
 although not in the year following legislative elections. Theoretically, he can declare
 a state of emergency and rule by decree, although President Konare has never done
 SO.
 National Assembly members were elected in 1992 and 1997. The Constitutional
 Court cancelled the results of the initial 1997 legislative elections, citing flaws in
 the electoral process. These elections were repeated later in 1997, and the results
 were implemented. Citing problems in the voter registration process, a collective of
 18 opposition parties boycotted these elections, which, although administratively
 flawed, were considered by most independent observers to be free and without evi-
 dent fraud. ADEMA holds 130 of 147 seats in the National Assembly, with 12 held
 by allied parties and 5 held by opposition parties.
 
 
 Except for the 19 cities where elections were held in June (and until rural elec-
 tions are carried out), the country is ruled by appointed officials (governors, com-
 mandants de cercle, and chefs d'arrondissement). After local elections scheduled for
 1999 are completed, regional legislatures are to be formed by elected local govern-
 ment officials, and governors are to be elected in each of the country's eight regions.
 Although local governments currently remain largely dependent on the central Gov-
 ernment for their revenues and staff, each community is to have its own revenue
 collection mechanism. Decentralization is a politically controversial issue; while it
 is supported by the central authorities, the nonparticipating opposition believes that
 the Government is dominating the process and that it should arrived at through
 consensus among a broad spectrum of actors.
 The first local government elections since 1992 were held in June to choose coun-
 cil members (who in turn select the mayor and deputy mayor) for the 19 urban com-
 munities. ADEMA won mayoral and deputy mayoral seats in every community ex-
 cept two in which allied parties won both seats. Several opposition parties boycotted
 the June municipal elections, citing flaws in the voter registration system. During
 the week preceding the elections, one person was killed in election related violence
 (see Section L.a.), and several persons were arrested in Segou for attempting to sab-
 otage the elections. They were charged with assault with intent to kill and conspir-
 acy to destroy public property. An opposition party's officials blamed a fire in its
 Bamako headquarters on ADEMA supporters. In four communities, more than one-
 third of the newly-elected council members resigned, citing flaws in the electoral
 process, inability to govern due to insufficient resources, and breach of promises on
 the part of the ruling party. In accordance with law, the Council of Ministers dis-
 solved these councils, which lacked a quorum, and ordered new elections for these
 communities. However, a new election in Sikasso produced similar results and again
 was followed by mass resignations. .
 In September the Government postponed the first elections for the council mem-
 bers of the country's 682 rural communities from November to April 1999. Later the
 same month, the members of the Independent. National Election Commission
 (CENI) resigned, stating that their original mission was complete.
 There are no restrictions, legal or otherwise, on voting by women or minorities.
 However, women are underrepresented in politics. A total of 18 women hold seats
 in the 147-member National Assembly, compared with 3 elected in 1992. Six cabinet
 members are women. Members of historically marginalized pastoralist ethnic mi-
 norities, including Fulani and Taureg, occupy seats in both the Cabinet and Na-
 tional Assembly. The President of the Assembly is Fulani (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Independent human rights organizations-including the Malian Association for
 Human Rights (AMDH), a smaller Malian League of Human Rights, and a local
 chapter of Amnesty International (AI)--operate openly and without interference
 from the Government. The ICRC has an office in Bamako and has strengthened its
 presence in the north by opening offices in  Timbuktu and Gao.
 In response to a 1997 report by Al, as well as to an October follow-up investiga-
 tion report detailing alleged instances of torture and other abuses, the Government
 denied the credibility of the allegations and invited AI to conduct further investiga-
 tions in the country.
 Since 1994 the Government has held an annual Democracy Forum in December
 to which it invited citizens to voice discontent and grievances against the Govern-
 ment publicly in the presence of the media and international human rights observ-
 ers. The events are well attended by local citizens from all walks of life who speak
 freely. Held on December 10, the annual Democracy Forum received live radio and
 television coverage for its 14-hour session. A panel of international jurors reviewed
 98 questions on government performance and human rights, questioning govern-
 ment ministers on the slowness of the judicial system, insufficient number of judges,
 and poor prison conditions.
 In July the Government cooperated with the United Nations to allow the extra-
 dition under U.N. escort of a former Rwandan official wanted by the International
 War Crimes Tribunal in Arusha.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on social origin, color, language,
 sex, or race, and the Government respects these provisions in practice. However, so-
 cial and cultural factors give men a dominant role.
 
 
 Women.-Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination- based on sex and
 provides for the basic rights of all persons, violence against women, including wife
 beating, is tolerated and common.
 Women's access to jobs in the professions and government, and to economic and
 educational opportunities has traditionally been limited. A 1995-96 national demo-
 graphic and health survey found that 81 percent of women (compared with 69.3 per-
 cent of men) between the ages of 15 and 49 received no education. Women comprise
 15 percent of the labor force. The Government, the major employer, pays women the
 same as men for similar work. Women often live under harsh conditions, especially
 in the rural areas, where they perform hard farm work and do most of the
 childrearing. Despite legislation giving women equal rights regarding property, tra-
 ditional practice and ignorance of the law prevent women from taking full advan-
 tage of this reform. In 1996 the Government launched a 4-year national plan of ac-
 tion for the promotion of women. The plan, financed by national, regional, and local
 community budgets, seeks to reduce inequalities between men and women in six
 target areas, including education, health, and legal rights.
 There are numerous active women's groups that promote the rights of women and
 children. Women have very limited access to legal services. They are particularly
 vulnerable in cases of divorce, child custody, and inheritance rights, as well as in
 the general protection of civil rights.
 Children.-Although by law primary education is compulsory through the sixth
 grade, only 50 percent of children receive a basic education. Literacy rates among
 women remain low due to a low degree of adherence to this requirement, a lack of
 primary schools, cultural tendencies to place less emphasis on education for women,
 and the fact that most of the population live in rural areas. There is no constitu-
 tional or legal provision to protect the interests and rights of children and no juve-
 nile court system. However, the Malian Social Services Department investigates and
 intervenes in cases of reported child abuse or neglect.
 From January 8 until January 19, the Government closed all secondary and col-
 lege level educational institutions at all levels in the wake of widespread student
 demonstrations held to demand increases in student stipends and improvements in
 educational conditions. Similar demonstrations occurredin April (see Section 2.b.).
 There were credible reports that children were sold into forced labor in Cote
 d'Ivoire (see Section 6.c.).
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is still com-
 mon, especially in rural areas, and is performed on girls at an early age. According
 to a 1995-96 national demographic and health survey, at least 93.7 percent of adult
 women have undergone this mutilation. The Government has not proposed legisla-
 tion prohibiting FGM. However, it supports educational efforts to eliminate the
 practice through seminars and conferences and provides media access to proponents
 of its elimination. In 1997 the Ministry for the Promotion of Women created a Na-
 tional Committee Against Violence Towards Women that links all the NGO's active
 in preventing FGM. Throughout the year, various NGO's campaigned against FGM
 and in October the national committee adopted a draft action plan against sexual
 mutilation for submission to the ministerial council.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation protecting the rights of
 the physically or mentally disabled, nor mandating accessibility. The Government
 does not discriminate against thephysically disabled in regard to employment, edu-
 cation, and other state services. Given the high unemployment rate, however, the
 physically disabled are often unabl   to find work.
 Religious Minorities.-On April 28, a mob of about 300 Muslims attacked Chris-
 tian missionaries and NGO workers in the northern region of Gao. Several mission-
 aries were injured; their assailants stole property, and burned and partially de-
 stroyed a small Christian church and two missionary houses. The attack followed
 the public showing of a film on the life of Jesus, which reportedly exacerbated al-
 ready existing tensions between Christians and Muslims.
 On August 2, members of a traditionalist Islamic sect known as the "pieds nus"
 (bare feet) stabbed and killed judge Omar Bah in Dioila, and freed several members
 of their sect from the Diola jail, where they had been incarcerated for disturbing
 the peace. The attack followed the death in the jail of an 85-year-old sect member
 wh6 had adhered to the sect's practice of refusing to take medication. Gendarmes,
 local hunters and military veterans apprehended the "pieds nus" after the jail
 break, shot and killed 11 of them, and wounded 10 more in an exchange of gunfire
 outside Dioila.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.--The population of about 10 million is eth-
 nically, culturally, and regionally diverse. Major ethnic-cultural groups include: the
 Mande, concentrated in the southwest, which constitutes about half the population
 
 
 and includes the Bambara ethnic group; the Malinke; the Voltaic, concentrated in
 the south and comprising the Bobo and Senoufo groups; the Sudanic, concentrated
 in the central regions and comprising the Sarakole, Songhai, Dogon, and Bozo
 groups; and the pastoralist, comprising the Tuaregs and Moors of the northeast and
 the Peul (or Fulani) of the central region.
 Longstanding tensions between the long-marginalized Moor and Tuareg pastoral-
 ist groups and the more populous nonpastoralist groups have been a leading source
 of political instability and violence, including the Tuareg rebellions of the early
 1990's.
 No single ethnic group predominates in either the private sector or the public sec-
 tor. All three Presidents since independence have been affiliated with the Bambara
 group, which accounts for roughly one half of the country's population, but no ethnic
 group holds disproportionate numbers of government positions or predominates in
 the military or civil service. Political parties, by and large, do not have readily iden-
 tifiable ethnic bases but reflect regional constituencies.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code specifically
 provide for the freedom of workers to form or join unions and protect freedom of
 association. Only the military, the Gendarmerie, and the National Guard are ex-
 cluded from forming unions. Virtually all salaried employees are organized. Workers
 have established independent unions for teachers, magistrates, health workers, and
 senior civil servants, and most are affiliated with the National Union of Malian
 workers (UNTM) confederation. The UNTM has maintained its autonomy from the
 Government.
 There are two major labor federations, the UNTM and the Syndicated Confed-
 eration of Malian Workers (CSTM). The UNTM, formerly the only major labor body,
 split in late 1997, dividing the countrys 12 labor organizations into 2 federations.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, although there are restrictions
 in some areas. For example, civil servants and workers in state-owned enterprises
 must give 2 weeks' notice of a planned strike and must enter into negotiations with
 the employer and a third party, usually the Ministry of Labor. The Labor Code pro-
 hibits retribution against strikers, and the Government respects this requirement
 in practice. During the year, post office workers and teachers threatened to go on
 strike. Both groups subsequently negotiated and signed collective bargaining agree-
 ments.
 Unions are free to associate with and participate in international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The growth of independent
 unions has led to more direct bargaining between these unions and their employers.
 However, wages and salaries for workers belonging to the UNTM unions are set by
 tripartite negotiations between the Ministry of Labor, labor unions, and representa-
 tives of the federation of employers of the sector to which the wages apply. These
 negotiations usually set the pattern for unions outside the UNTM. The Ministry of
 Labor acts as a mediator in labor disputes. The 1997 split in the UNTM did not
 change the basic procedures of these negotiations.
 Neither the Constitution nor the Labor Code addresses the question of antiunion
 discrimination, but there have been no reports or complaints of antiunion behavior
 or activities. If the parties cannot come to agreement, the dispute goes to the Labor
 Court for decision.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, including that performed by children. There were some reports
 that the de facto slavery long reported to have existed in northern salt mining com-
 munities has evolved toward wage labor in recent years; however, reliable current
 evidence about labor conditions in those remote facilities remained unavailable. He-
 reditary servitude relationships link different ethnic' groups, particularly in the
 north. For example, there is a hereditary, service relationship between members of
 the Bellah ethnic group and Taureg populations. There are reliable accounts of inci-
 dents of Bellahs voluntarily leaving their Tuareg families and of rejoining the
 households of Tuaregs repatriated from neighboring countries.
 There were instances of trafficking of Malian children who were sold into forced
 labor in Cote d'Ivoire. For example, children recruited by Malians in the border
 town of Sikasso were promised jobs in Cote d'Ivoire, transported across the border,
 and then sold for approximately $20 to $40 (10,000 to 20,000 CFA Francs) to
 Malians and Ivorians who brokered them throughout the plantations of north-cen-
 tral Cote d'Ivoire. The Government is taking steps to halt this trafficking and repa-
 triate the children to Mali. In July 55 children were returned to their families from
 
 
 Cote d'Ivoire. The Government arrested five persons in Sikasso who were respon-
 sible for trafficking.
 Although there have been no reports of forced oi bonded child labor in Mali, ap-
 prenticeship, often in a family member's or a parent's vocation, begins at an early
 age, especially for children unable to attend school.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment adopted a Labor Code in 1996 that has specific policies pertaining to child
 labor. The Labor Code prohibits forced or bonded child labor, and the authorities
 enforce this provision through the use of labor inspectors. Inspectors from the Min-
 istry of Employment, Public Service, and Labor conduct surprise inspections and
 complaint-based inspections. However, resource limitations restrict the frequency
 and effectiveness of oversight by the Labor Inspection Service and the Service oper-
 ates only in the modern sector (see Section 6.c.).
 The Labor Code permits children between the ages of 12 and 14 to work up to
 2 hours per day during school vacations with parental approval. Children between
 the ages of 14 and 16 may work up to 42 hours per day with the permission of
 a labor inspector, but nbt during nights, holidays, or Sundays. Children between the
 ages of 16 and 18 may work in jobs that are not physically demanding; males may
 work up to 8 hours per day and females up to 6 hours per day.
 These regulations are often ignored in practice. Moreover, the Labor Code has no
 effect on the vast number of children who work in rural areas, helping with family
 farms and herds, and in the informal sector, for example, street vending. These chil-
 dren are not protected by laws against unjust compensation, excessive hours, or ca-
 pricious discharge.
 Education is free and in principle is open to all, although the majority of students
 leave school by the age of 12. While primary school is compulsory, it is only avail-
 able to one-half of the children. Child labor predominates in the agricultural sector
 and, to a lesser degree, in crafts and trades apprenticeships, and cottage industries.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code specifies conditions of employ-
 ment, including hours, wages, and social security, but in practice many employers
 either ignore or do not comply completely with the regulations. The national mini-
 mum wage rate, set in 1994, is approximately $40 (21,000 CFA Francs) per month.
 Workers must be paid overtime for additional hours. The minimum wage is supple-
 mented by a required package of benefits, including social security and health care.
 While this total package could provide a minimum standard of living for one person,
 in practice most wage earners support large extended families and must supplement
 their income by some subsistence farming or work in the informal sector.
 The normal legal workweek is 40 hours (45 hours for agricultural employees),
 with a requirement for at least one 24-hour rest period. The Social Security Code
 provides a broad range of legal protection against hazards in the workplace, and
 workers' groups have brought pressure on employers to respect parts of the regula-
 tions, particularly those affecting personal hygiene. With unemployment high, how-
 ever, workers are often reluctant to report violations of occupational safety regula-
 tions. The Labor Inspection Service of the Ministry of Labor oversees these stand-
 ards but limits enforcement to the modern, formal sector. Workers have the right
 to remove themselves from dangerous work situations and request an investigation
 by the Social Security Department, which is responsible for recommending remedial
 action where deemed necessary.
