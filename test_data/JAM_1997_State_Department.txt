 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. Two political parties have alternated in power since the first
 elections under universal adult suffrage in 1944; a third major party was estab-
 lished in late 1995. Prime Minister Patterson's People's National Party (PNP) won
 50 of the 60 seats in Parliament in national elections on December 18. The general
 election campaign was significantly less violent than previous electoral campaigns.
 However, there continued to be intimidation of voters and party agents and restric-
 tions on the free movement of voters. The judiciary is independent but lacks ade-
 quate resources.
 The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) has primary responsibility for internal se-
 curity, assisted by the Island Special Constabulary Force. The Jamaica Defence
 Force (army, air wing, and coast guard) is charged with supporting the JCF in
 maintaining law and order, although it has no powers of arrest. While civilian au-
 thorities generally maintain effective control of the security forces, some members
 of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is based on primary products (bauxite and alumina, sugar, bananas),
 services (tourism, finance), and light manufacturing (garment assembly). The Gov-
 ernment promoted private investment to stimulate economic growth and moderniza-
 tion, pursuing in the process a sometimes painful program of structural adjustment.
 Annual per capita income is $2,170, but this figure is misleading as there is a large
 and widening gap between the wealthy and the impoverished.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens; however,
 problems remained in certain areas. Although members of the security forces com-
 mitted extrajudicial killings and beatings and carried out arbitrary arrests and de-
 tentions, the Government moved effectively to punish some of those involved. Prison
 and jail conditions remained poor, with overcrowding, brutality against detainees,
 dismal sanitary conditions, and inadequate diet the norm. The judicial system was
 overburdened and lengthy delays in trials were common. Economic discrimination
 and violence against women remained problems, as did mob violence against those
 suspected of breaking the law.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The security forces frequently em-
 ployed lethal force in apprehending criminal suspects, usually in the guise of shoot-
 outs. This resulted in the killing by police of 149 people during the year. While alle-
 gations of "ipolice murder" were frequent, the validity of some of the allegations was
 suspect. This problem is the result of unresolved, long-standing antipathy between
 the security forces and certain communities, espcialy among the urban poor. The
 JCF conducted both administrative and criminal investigations into incidents in-
 volving fatal shootings by the police. The JCF policy statement on the use of force
 incorporates U.N.-approved language on basic principles on the use of force and fire-
 arms by law enforcement officials.__
 Political violence lessened considerably from 1996. However, the opposition Ja-
 maica Labor Party (JLP) accused the security forces of targeting the opposition lead-
 er's West Kingston constituency for special attention, culminating in a May 6-7 con-
 frontation with residents of Tivoli Gardens. In this confrontation, the police shot
 and killed four persons (three women and one child) and injured nine others by gun-
 fire. All the victims were unarmed civilians. No member -of the security forces was
 injured, and no arrests were made. Despite the apparent use of excessive force, the
 Government refused calls to convene a commission of inquiry and took no action
 against any member of the security forces.
 There were no new developments in the beating death of a 22-year-old man in
 a West Kingston police station in April 1996. There were also no new developments
 in the May 1996 death of a man held in the Port Antonio jail, nor in the murder
 trial of a JCF officer accused in two July 1993 killings. No action was reported in
 the civil lawsuits brought by relatives of two men who died in the Constant Spring
 jail in 1992.
 Vigilantism, involving spontaneous mob executions in response to crime, contin-
 ued to be a problem. There were 20 vigilante killings in 1995, 21 in 1996, and 16
 in 1997. Official investigations into such killings generally do not uncover any infor-
 mation, as the persons and the community involved usually band together to intimi-
 date potential witnesses. In one case, a mob stoned to death a foreigner in Montego
 Bay after his car hit a vendor's stand. The official investigation uncovered only one
 witness who was willing to testify, despite the fact that the murder happened in
 daylight on a busy street. The first trial of the accused assailants resulted in a hung
 jury, but the public prosecutor planned to try the defendants again. In other cases,
 four suspected robbers were killed with machetes in rural St. Mary in July. In Feb-
 ruary a man was killed by machete after attacking an elderly woman in rural St.
 Andrew. No arrests were made in either case.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and other abuse of prisoners and detainees. However, re-
 ports of physical abuse of prisoners by guards continued, despite efforts by the Gov-
 ernment to remove abusive guards and improve procedures.
 In April the Police Commissioner condemned the excessive use of force by police
 in Hopewell, Hanover, who shot six persons who were demonstrating against sub-
 standard roads and water supply. The authorities charged three policemen with un-
 lawful wounding; no trial date had been set by year's end. In June the appeal of
 three policemen who were convicted of rape in 1994 was denied; the convicted pe-
 licemen are to serve 8-year prison terms.
 Prison conditions remained poor, with overcrowding, inadequate diet, poor sani-
 tary conditions, and insufficient medical care the norm. In August violence erupted
 at both men's maximum security prisons after prison warders engaged in a mass
 sickout. Inmates killed 16 of their fellow prisoners, many of them because they had
 been identified as homosexuals. The Government convened a commission of inquiry,
 which was still investigating the matter at year's end.
 The Government allowed private groups, voluntary organizations, international
 human rights organizations, and the media to visit prisons and monitor prison con-
 ditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In 1994 Parliament repealed the Sup-
 pression of Crimes Act of 1974, which permitted warrantless searches and the arrest
 of persons "reasonably suspected" of having committed a crime. The Jamaica Con-
 stabulary Force Act, however, now contains several of these provisions, and there
 were continued reports that the police abused these provisions. In March the Jamai-
 can Bar Association (JBA) protested that the police were unlawfully detaining and
 fingerprinting groups of citizens in poor, inner city areas. At the time, the Police
 
 
 567
 Commissioner disavowed the practice and ordered it discontinued; however, both the
 JBA and the Jamaica Council on Human Rights state that the practice continues.
 The law requires police to present a detainee in court within 48 hours of deten-
 tion, but the authorities continued to detain suspects, especially those from poor
 neighborhoods, without bringing them before a judge within the prescribed period.
 Magistrates inquire at least once per week into the welfare of each person listed
 by the JCF as being detained. There is a functioning bail system.
 Foreign prisoners must pay for their own deportation once they have completed
 their sentences. If they cannot afford to pay, they are jailed until relatives or con-
 sulates can arrange for transportation. In effect this constitutes an additional prison
 term for indigent foreigners.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and no instances of exile occurred.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, which exists in practice. However, the judicial system is overburdened and op-
 erates with inadequate resources.
 Three courts handle criminal matters at the trial level. Resident magistrates try
 lesser offenses (misdemeanors). A Supreme Court judge tries felonies, except that
 felonies involving firearms are tried before a judge of the Gun Court. Defendants
 have the right to appeal a conviction in any of the three trial courts to the Court
 of Appeal, which is the highest court. The Constitution allows the Court of Appeal
 and the Parliament to refer cases to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
 in the United Kingdom as a final court of appeal.
 The lack of sufficient staff and resources hinders due process. Trials in many
 cases are delayed for years, and other cases are dismissed because files cannot be
 located. The Government initiated a night court in September 1995, which has had
 some success in reducing the backlog of cases.
 While the defendant's right to counsel is well-established, the courts appoint coun-
 sel for indigents only in cases of a serious offense (e.g., murder, rape, robbery, and
 gun offenses). However, the law does not consider many offenses, including wound-
 ing with intent to cause great bodily harm, as "serious." Thus the courts try many
 defendants without benefit of counsel.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrsry intrusion by the State into the private life of the
 individual. The revised Jamaica Constabulary Force Act continues to give security
 personnel broad powers of search and seizure similar to those granted by the former
 Suppression of Crimes Act.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice.
 The Government privatized the Jamaica Broadcasting Company in June, and the
 television station and two radio stations it operated became privately owned. The
 Government's broadcasting commission has the right to regulate programming dur-
 ing emergencies. Foreign television transmissions are unregulated and available
 through satellite antennas. The four largest newspapers, all privately owned, regu-
 larly report on human rights abuses, particularly those involving the JCF. Foreign
 publications are widely available.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the authorities respect
 them in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Govern-
 ment provides first asylum, and provided it to approximately 40 persons in 1994.
 Similar but smaller numbers of first asylum cases, mainly Cubans and Haitians,
 were accepted in 1995 and 1996, but none were accepted in 1997. The Government
 established a committee and formal procedures to review claims to refugee status.
 This committee denied all claims to refugee status by Cubans and Haitians who had
 arrived in Jamaica since 1994. However, several Cuban applicants were granted
 permission to stay in Jamaica on other grounds, but none received such permission
 in 1997.
 There were no reports of forced return of persons to a country where they feared
 persecution.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in periodic elections held on the basis of
 universal suffrage. All citizens age 18 and over have the right to vote by secret bal-
 lot. However, voters living in so-called garrison communities, which are located in
 inner-city areas dominated by one of the two major political parties, face substantial
 impediments to the free exercise of their right to vote. During the general election
 campaign, both international and local observer groups concluded that, although the
 process was significantly less violent than recent election campaigns, problems per-
 sisted in the garrison communities. These problems included intimidation of party
 agents and voters of nondominant parties and restrictions on the movement of vot-
 ers and election workers. Some areas are so dominated by one party that the polls
 simply closed early and vote counts were taken that resulted in 100 percent (or
 nearly 100 percent) of the votes being awarded to the dominant party. These prob-
 lems persisted in the December 18 election, despite the best efforts of the security
 forces, which were credited with controlling violence, such as the beating of voters,
 and reducing election malpractice, such as stealing ballot boxes from polling places.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women in pol itics. Women
 hold some 13 percent of all political offices and 30 percent of the senior civil service
 positions. Two of the 16 cabinet members are women, as is the PNP General Sec-
 retary.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. The work of the Ja-
 maica Council for Human Rights, the countrs only formal organization concerned
 with all aspects of human rights, was severely hampered by a lack of adequate re-
 sources, which required a substantial reduction in its staff. Government officials are
 generally cooperative and responsive to the views of human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, place of origin, polit-
 ical opinions, color, creed, or sex. The Government largely enforces these prohibi-
 tions in practice, except for widespread discrimination on the basis of political opin-
 ion in the distribution of scarce governmental benefits, including employment, espe-
 cially in the garrison communities (see Section 3).
 Women.-Ig practice women suffer from economic discrimination, sexual harass-
 ment in the workplace, and social and cultural traditions that perpetuate violence
 against women, including spousal abuse. The Domestic Violence Act of 1995 came
 into effect in May 1996. It provides additional remedies for domestic violence, in-
 cluding restraining orders and other noncustodial sentencing. Violence against
 women is widespread, but many women are reluctant to acknowledge or report abu-
 sive behavior, leading to wide variations in estimates of its extent.
 The Constitution and the 1975 Employment Act accord women full equality. The
 Bureau of Women's Affairs in the Ministry of Labor oversees programs to ensure
 the legal rights of women. These programs have had limited effect but have raised
 the awareness of problems affecting women. In June 1996, the Government estab-
 lished a steering committee, charged with creating a Commission on Gender and So-
 cial Equity. The committee forwarded its recommendations to Parliament regarding
 how the commission should be established; the report was awaiting parliamentary
 action at year's end.
 A number of active women's rights groups exist. They are concerned with a wide
 range of issues, including employment, violence against women, political representa-
 tion, and the image of women presented in the media. Their effectiveness is mixed,
 but the groups were successful in advocating enactment of the Domestic Violence
 Act.
 Children.-The Government is committed to improving children's welfare. The
 Ministry of Education, Youth, and Culture is responsible for implementation of the
 Government's programs for children.
 The Juvenile Act of 1951 deals with several areas related to the protection of chil-
 dren, including prevention of cruelty, prohibition on causing or allowing juvenile
 begging, the power to bring juveniles in need of care or protection before a juvenile
 court, the treatment of juvenile offenders, the regulation and supervision of chil-
 dren's homes, and restrictions on employment of juveniles. In 1996 the visiting Ex-
 ecutive Director of the Unitd Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said the Govern-
 
 
 569
 
 ment had done very well in its efforts to improve the welfare and survival of chil-
 dren.
 People With Disabilities.-No laws mandate accessibility for people with disabil-
 ities. Several government agencies and nongovernmental organizations provide serv-
 ices and employment to various groups of disabled citizens.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides for the right to form or join a trade
 union, and unions function freely and independently of the Government. The Labor
 Relations and Industrial Disputes Act (LRIDA) defines worker rights. There is a
 spectrum of national unions, some of which are affiliated with political parties. Ap-
 proximately 15 percent of the work force is organized.
 The LREIA neither authorizes nor prohibits the right to strike, but strikes do
 occur. Striking workers can interrupt work without criminal liability but cannot be
 assured of keeping their jobs. Workers in 10 broad categories of "essential services"
 are prohibited from striking, a provision the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 has repeatedly condemned as overly inclusive. The Government did not declare any
 strikes illegal in 1997.
 Unions maintain a wide variety of regional and international affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-The Government rarely inter-
 feres with union organizing efforts. Judicial and plice authorities effectively enforce
 the LRIDA and other labor regulations. All parties are firlny committed to collec-
 tive bargaining in contract negotiations, even in some nonunion settings. An inde-
 pendent Industrial Disputes Tribunal (IDT) hears cases where management and
 labor fail to reach agreement. Any cases not resolved by the IDT pass to the civil
 courts. The number of industrial disputes referred to the IDT declined. The IDT
 made decisions in a few cases, while others were settled by agreement or with-
 drawn. However, the majority of cases referred to the IDT remained unresolved. The
 LRIDA prohibits antiunion discrimination, and employees may not-be fired solely
 for union membership. The authorities enforced this law effectively.
 Domestic labor laws apply equally to the "free zones" (export processing zones).
 However, there are no unionized companies in any of the 3 zones-established in
 1972, 1985, and 1988-that employ approximately 18,000 workers. Organizers at-
 tribute this circumstance to resistance by foreign owners in the zones to organizing
 efforts, but attempts to organize plants within the zones continue. Company-con-
 trolled "workers' councils" handle giievance resolution at most free zone companies,
 but do not negotiate wages and conditions with management. Management deter-
 mines wages and benefits within the free zones; these are generally as good as or
 better than those in similar industries outside the zones. The Ministry of Labor has
 not performed factory inspections in the free zones since 1992.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution does not specifi-
 cally address the matter of forced or compulsory labor, but there were no reports
 that this practice exists.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Juve-
 nile Act provides that children under the a e of 12 shall not be employed except
 by parents or guardians, and that such empfoyment may only be in domestic, agri-
 cultural, or horticultural work. Enforcement, however, is erratic. While the Con-
 stitution does not prohibit forced or bonded labor by children (see Section 6.c.), such
 practices were not known to occur. Children under the age of 12 peddle goods and
 services on city streets, but there is no evidence of widespread illegal employment
 of children in other sectors of the economy. The Educational Act stipulates that all
 children between 6 and 11 years of age must attend elementary school. Industrial
 safety, police, and truant officers are charged with enforcement. Under current eco-
 nomic circumstances, however, thousands of children are kept home to help with
 housework and avoid school fees. A 1994 UNICEF report stated that 4.6 percent of
 children below the age of 16 worked to help support their households.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage, raised from $15.00
 (J$500) to $22.50 (J$800) per week in 1996, is widely considered inadequate. Most
 salaried workers are paid more than the legal minimum. Work over 40 hours per
 week or 8 hoursper day must be compensated at overtime rates, a provision that
 is widely observed.
 The Labor Ministry's Industrial Safety Division sets and enforces industrial
 health and safety standards, which are considered adequate. Industrial accident
 rates, particularly in the bauxite and alumina industry, remained low. Public serv-
 ice staff reductions in the Ministries of Labor, Finance, National Security, and the
 Public Service have contributed- to the difficulties in enforcing workplace regula-
 tions. The law provides workers with the right to remove themselves from dan-
 gerous work situations without jeopardy to their continued employment if they are
 
 
 570
 trade union members or covered by the Factories Act. The law does not specifically
 protect other categories of workers in those circumstances.
