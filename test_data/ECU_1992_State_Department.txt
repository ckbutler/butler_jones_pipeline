 ECUADOR
 Ecuador is a constitutional republic with a President and a 77-member unicam-
 eral National Assembly chosen in free elections. In May and July 1992, national
 elections saw the peaceful transfer of power from a center-left government to a cen-
 ter-right government, with a realignment of power within the National Assembly as
 well. Members of the Supreme Court, presently chosen by the Assembly, preside
 over a judiciary that is constitutionally independent but susceptible to political pres-
 sure. Reform of the judicial system was proposed in the National Assembly soon
 after the newly elected government of Sixto Duran-Ballen took office in August
 1992. In December Congre  approved one aspect of this reform, a restructuring of
 the Supreme Court to give it stronger powers as the final arbiter of legal questions.
 The same law also mandates changes in the lower court system. The Assembly has
 important powers to question and censure Cabinet ministers; such censure results
 in automatic dismissal of the minister in question.

 The Ecuadorian military has significant autonomy, reinforced by guaranteed ac-
 cess to revenues from the nation's oil exports, and from its civil aviation, shipping,
 and other economic activities. According to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament
 Agency, total military expenditures for 1989 were $163 million. A significant reduc-
 tion in the 1992 defense budget. was implemented during the last quarter of the
 year, and the Government stated that the budget would not be increased in 1993.
 The military has maintained a low profile in domestic politics since the return to
 constitutional rule in 1979. The national police are responsible for domestic law en-
 forcement and maintenance of internal order. They also have primary responsibility
 for carrying out antinarcotics efforts, although the military is increasing its role in
 the war against drugs. The President controls the police through the Minister of
 Government. In response to numerous instances of police mistreatment of criminal
 suspects including the use of physical force against detainees, there were wide-
 spread demands for reform of the national police to improve its human rights per-
 formance.
 The economy is based on private enterprise, although there continues to be heavy
 government involvement in key sectors such as petroleum, utilities, and aviation.
 nation remained high at about a 50-percent annual rate throughout 1992. Overall
 economic conditions remained difficult for the vast majority of Ecuadorians; rural
 poverty is extensive and little improvement in this area in 1992 was evident. The
 combined unemployment and underemployment rate was over 60 percent.
 Ecuadorians enjoy, both in law and i fact, a wide range of freedoms and individ-
 ual rights, but human rights problems remain. Foremost among these are torture
 and other mistreatment of prisoners and detainees, impunity for human rights
 abusers, violence by paramilitary groups in rural areas, brutal prison conditions,
 lengthy detention before trial, a politicized court system, and pervasive discrimina-
 tion against women, blacks, and Indians. The most fundamental concern is over
 shortcomings in the Ecuadorian legal and judicial system. Persons are subject to ar-
 bitrary arrest; once incarcerated, they may wait years before coming to trial. Often,
 the only way to avoid these problems is through the payment of bribes to a variety
 of officials.
 RESPrCT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extra, dicial Killing.-There were no known politically mo-
 tivated killings in 1992 but there were cases of extrajudicial killing of criminal sus-
 peta by the police, who usually act with impunity in such cases. For example,
 Felipe Moreira Chavez was detained by police frm the Office of Criminal Investiga-
 tion on August 20, and his body was lef at the morgue by police on August 22. Al-
 though his relatives claimed he died as the result of electric torture, there was no
 investigation of these charges.
 In addition, indigenous people charge that they are the target of violent and lethal
 reprisals by paramilitary groups during land invasions and other squatter dem-
 onstrations. The paramilitary groups are armed civilian bands and security guards
 hired by private landowners to protect their property. These forces often use mili-
 tary-style uniforms and weapons- some are reportedly operated or trained by former
 military or police officials, but there is no evidence of complicity with active duty
 forces or personnel. After several homosexual men were murdered in Quito in late
 1991, concerns arose that there was a campaign to eliminate them. Although no
 firm link was ever established, the murders stopped in January 1992 at the same
 time that police arrested a band of teenagers who were also charged in a rash of
 taxi driver murders in Quito.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known cases of politically motivated disappear-
 ances during 1992.
 Charges were finally brought in the 1988 disappearance and alleged murder of
 two teenaged boys at the hands of police-the case of the Restrepo brothers. An
 international commission named to investigate their disappearance accused senior
 police officials, particularly those associated with the now defunct Criminal Inves-
 tigative Service (SIC), of engaging in a coverup and of obstructing the investigation.
 In October 1992, an assistant attorney general charged then Chief of Police General
 Gilberto Molina and one of his senior assistants, Colonel Trajano Barrionuevo, as
 intellectual authors of the murder of the boys. Several lower ranking police officers
 were charged with actually carrying out the murders.
 At the same time, the assistant attorney general called for formal charges of tor-
 ture to be made against the then Minister of Government Luis Robles Plaza; how-
 ever, no charges were actually filed. Soon after the charges were made public Gen-
 eral Molina escaped from protective custody. On December 3, the Chief Justice of
 
 
 391
 the Supreme Court ruled that the case was "in plenary," tantamount to the Su-
 preme Court saing that it now has sufficient evidence to proceed with prosecution.
 The Chief Justice's ruling accused Molina and one other individual of a coverup
 rather than of being the intellectual authors of the murders. The Chief Justice also
 lifted the preventive detention order under which Molina had been held for almost
 a year, but he remains at large.
 During its existence, the SIC was accused by many credible human rights mon-
 itors and organizations of involvement in torture, mistreatment, disappearances,
 and deaths of criminal suspects. Although the Borja administration announced the
 abolition of the SIC in September 1991, many of its members were reassigned to
 other police units, such as the Office of Criminal Investigation (Oi)).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although torture and similar forms of intimidation and punishment are prohibited
 by law, there wer continued reports in 1992 of physical' mistreatment by police of
 suspects and prisoners. The military were also accused of abuse. Indeed, there were
 at least two incidents in 1992 in which police officers were beaten or otherwise
 abused by the military. Beating a suspect to obtain a confession is the most common
 method used by police to carry out criminal investigations; officials are almost never
 punished for such abuses. Nearly every month the Ecuadorian Ecumenical Human
 Rights Commission (CEDHU) published detailed reprts on suspects claiming to
 have been tortured by the police. CEDHU's reports frequently name police officials
 alleged to be responsible for specific instances of torture an  often include hoto
 graphs of the victims with their wounds. By law, police offiers may be trid on
 before police courts in closed sessions. The practical effect of this is immunity from
 prosecution, though in some high-profile cases, such as that of the Restrepo broth-
 ers, there has been some progress.
 Prison conditions in Ecuador's 20 overcrowded detention centers are very poor.
 There are no separate facilities for hard-core or dangerous criminals. Prisoners with
 economic resources are usually able to secure favorable treatment through payments
 to prison officials, while the indigent suffer severe deprivation and have to make
 do with the lowest quality of facilities and provisions.
 d Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and Penal Code provide
 that no one may be deprived of liberty without a written order from a governmental
 authority, but these legal protections against arbitrary arrest or detention are often
 violated. Specific written orders must be signed within 24 hours of detention--even
 in cases in which a suspect is cauht in the act of committing a crime. The suspect
 must be charged with a specific criminal offense within 48 hours of arrest. All pris-
 oners have the right to a review of the legality of their detention within 48 hours
 of arrest, a review which is supposed to be carried out by the senior elected official
 (usually the mayor) of the locality in which the suspect is held. Incommunicado de-
 tention is not uncommon although it is legally prohibited.
 Despite provisions of the Penal Code, the police often detain suspects without the
 required written order. Even when an order is obtained, those charged with review-
 ing it to determine its validity often allow frivolous charges to be brought, either
 because of overwork or because bribes are paid by the accuser. In many instances
 the system is used as a means of harassment in civil cases in which one party seeks
 to have the other arrested on criminal charges. Suspects are frequently detained
 longer than 24 hours before orders are signed, and few are charged within 48 hours
 of arrest. Preventive detention up to and including trial is legal under certain cir-
 cumstances.
 Exile is not generally used as a tool of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The vast majority of nonmilitary defendants are
 tried by the regular court system, although some indigenous groups try members
 pivately for violations of tribal rules. Currently, the Congress elects a 16-member
 Supreme Court which chooses its president from within its ranks. The Supreme
 Court names approximately 115 members to the provincial superior courts which
 serve as appeals courts for criminal, civil, tax, and labor cases. The executive branch
 names the other "first instance" judges. While the courts are supposed to be inde-
 pendent by law, political party leaders exercise significant influence over the selec-
 tion of judges at all levels. In December Cogss approved a major reform of the
 Supreme Court which will create several smaller chambers within the court to han-
 dle specialized legal questions. The number of justices will increase from 16 to 31,
 and the court will have the power of "casacion, similar to the U.S. Supreme Court
 power of judicial review. The reform also aims to depoliticize the court by lengthen-
 Ing and shifting the terms of office of justices so that they do not correspond entirely
 with national elections. Finally the reform law gives the new Supreme Court 90
 days from the date it is installed to reorganize the entire lower court system.
 
 
 392
 Minimum due process rights for criminal defendants are provided for by law but
 are often not observed in practice. In theory, the accused is presumed innocent until
 proven guilty. Defendants have the right to a public trial, defense attorneys, and
 appeal. They may present evidence but have the privilege not to testify against
 themselves, and they may confront and cross-examine witnesses. Although a public
 defender system exists, in practiee there are relatively few attorneys avaiable to de-
 fend the large number of indigent suspects. Trial is supposed to begin within 15 to
 60 days of the initial arrest. In practice, however, initiation of the trial phase can
 take years. Rail is not generally available in Ecuador. Families of detainees some-
 times intervene in an attempt to secure the prisonei's freedom through illegal
 means.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family. Home, or Correspondence.-Police
 are required to have a warrant to enter a private home or business, except in the
 case of hot pursuit. The police generally respect the sanctity of private homes and
 correspondence. Police surveillance is permitted, but wiretapping is prohibited by
 the Constitution. Although the-  is no evidence to suggest that wiretapping is being
 carried out by the Government in violation of the law, there are numerous com-
 plaints of private citizens engaged in eavesdropping against other private citizens
 by various means.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and the Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech. This provision is generally respected in practice. With the exception of two
 government-owned radio stations, all of the major media organs--television, news-
 papers, and radio--are in local private hands (foreign investment in the mass media
 is prohibited). Using a law promulgated by the last military regime that requires
 the media to give the Government free space or air time, the Government frequently
 requires television and radio to broadcast government-produced programs featuring
 the President and other top administration officials. It also requires newspapers to
 carry a minimum amount of news prepared by the National Secretariat of Social
 Communications. The media and opposition politicl figures have criticized the Gov-
 ernment's use of the media for its own political ends.
 The media represent a wide range of political views and often criticize the Gov-
 ernment. However, some degree of self-censorshlip in the print media occurs, par-
 ticularly with respect to stories about the military or corruption at high levels of
 national, provincial, or municipal government. Nevertheless, in 1992 the media con-
 tinued to giewide coverage to t e Restrepo disappearance case, in which high-
 ranking po ice officials were charged (see Stion .b.). There are 2 major dailyr
 newspapers in the capital, Quit, 5 in the principal commercial center, GuayaqWi,
 and more than 20 additional papers published daily in other regions and cities.
 There are 4 national television networks, 4 local and provincial television networks,
 and. about 30)0 radio stations. All are free of government censorship. Journalists
 working in the preparation and reporting of news (as opposed to opinion) must be
 graduates of an accredited Ecuadornan university journalism school.
 Ecuador has a large university system comprising both state-subsidized and pri-
 vate universities. The state universities are active in politics, particularly on the left
 of the political spectrum. The Government has scrupulously avoided interference in
 issues involving academic fredom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of free assembly and association for peaceful purposes. These rights are
 generally respected in practice. Public rallies require prior government permits,
 which are generally granted. Numerous political demonstrations took place mn 1992,
 including a general strike on September 23, a variety of prtests against govern-
 ment economic measures, and widespread demonstrations by indigenous groups to
 mark the 500th anniversary of the arrival of Columbus in the hemisphere. Gen-
 erally, the security forces intervene in demonstrations only when there is violence
 against persons or property. However, private psramilitary groups were used to
 break up demonstrations and occupations of land in rural areas by indigenous orga-
 nizations. The military also impeded access to the capital to limit an indigenous
 demonstration there on October 12, 1992. In 199 1-92, the Government announced
 strengthened controls over private guard forces and other armed groups that were
 not properly registered, but no charges were brought against such groups. In gen-
 eral, police were restrained in the use of force during demonstrations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.--Citizens are free to practice the religion of their choice.
 There is no official state religion, although the population is nominally over 90 per-
 cent Roman Catholic. There are active Protestant and Jewish communities in the
 major cities, and evangelical movements continue to attract new adherents. The
 Constitution prohibits discrimination for religious reasons, although members of the
 
 
 393
 clergy are barred by the Constitution from election to the Congress, the presidency,
 or vice presidency. Numerous foreign-based religious orders and missionary groups
 are active in Ecuador.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Em4gration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution assures the right of all citizens to travel freely
 throughout the country, to choose their place of residence, and to depart from and
 return to Ecuador. These rights are respocted in practice. Ecuadorian citizens who
 return to the country after residing abroad are not harassed or discriminated
 against by the Government. No cases of forced resettlement were reported in 1992,
 but Colombian Oscar Amores was arrested on criminal charges while in refugee sta-
 tus and faced possible deportation at year's end.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Since the return to civilian rule in 1979, Ecuadorian citizens have actively exer-
 cised their right to change their national and local governments. Free elections for
 the presidency and the Congress have taken place regularly since 1979, and power
 has en transferred peacefully to parties of opposing ideologies in presidential elec-
 tions every 4 years. In May and July 1992, national elections saw the peaceful
 transfer of power from a center-left government to a center-right government, with
 a realignment of power within the National Assembly as well In 1992 there were
 16 legally registered political parties, spanning the ideological spectrum. Twelve of
 the 16 parties, including 3 leftist parties, are represented in the Congress.
 Voting is mandatory or literate citizens over the age of 18 and voluntary for illit-
 erate citizens. There are no restrictions on voting by women or by minority groups.
 Active-duty members of the military forces cannot vote, and there is no provision
 for absentee voting. All citizens, regardless of sex, reigion, socioeconomic status, or
 ethnic origin, have the right to form and join political parties and to run for local
 or national office. Under current laws, however, candidates must belong to one of
 the recognized parties and cannot run as independents. The white and mestizo
 male-dominated elite tends to be self-perpetuating, and blacks, Indians and women
 continue to be underrepresented in high positions in Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights groups such as the Catholic Church-affiliated Ecumenical
 Commission on Human Rights (CEDHU) and the Latin American Human Rights
 Association (ALDHU) are independent and actively monitor human rights issues in
 Ecuador. These groups, particularly CEDHU, have been outspoken in their criticism
 of the Government's record on specific cases, and CEDHU has taken a particular
 interest in defending the human rights of the poor. International human rights or-
 ganizations operate without hindrance in Ecuador.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, sex, or social
 status.
 Nevertheless, discrimination against women, blacks, and Indians is pervasive in
 Ecuadorian society, particularly with respect to educational and economic oppor-
 tunity. The vast majority of the rural population of approximately 5 million (slightly
 less than 50 percent of the population) are peasants of Indian or mestizo ancestry.
 The population of the rural, northern coastal area of Ecuador includes large num-
 brs of black citizens. Most peasants live in varying degrees of poverty. Land is
 scarce in the more heavily populated highland areas. Infant mortality, malnutrition,
 and epidemic disease are common, and potable water and electricity are often un-
 available. The rural education system is seriously deficient. Efforts to improve living
 standards for Indian and black peasants were hampered in 1992, as in previous
 years by the Government's reluctance to change tra itional spending patterns, es-
 pecialy those favoring the cities. The long-simmering frstration of Ecuador's larg-
 eat minority group, the Indians, over those socioeconomic issues exploded in nation-
 wide protest demonstrations in 1990, and again in October 1992.
 On December 2, the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador
 (CONAIE) charged that a paramilitary    u  working for the agroindustrial com-
 pviolentl evicted severl-indigenous amilies from company land.
 ~an  duacem
 argued that te Yuracruz property had been turned over to the amiie
 in a court case several months earlier, but the ormpany refused to let them ocupy
 the land. CONAIE leader Luis Macas complained that the local authorities refused
 to protect the legitimate owners. Land occupation cases can be very convoluted be-
 cause of the vague and contradictory nature of the agrarian reform law and the
 highly politicized and often corrupt judiciary.
 
 
 394
 There was little improvement in the status of women in 1992. The Ecuadorian
 women's movement considers culture and tradition as inhibiting achievement of full
 equality for women. While no current data on salaries or occupation by sex are
 available, anecdotal evidence sugsts that there are substantially fewer women in
 the professions or working as sliled laborers than men, and salary discrimination
 is common. Although violence against women, including within marriage, is prohib-
 ited by law, it is a common practice. Many rapes go unreported because of the vic-
 tims' reluctance to confront the perpetrator. To date, the Government has not ad-
 dressed this question as a serious public policy issue.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the Constitution and Labor Code most work-
 ers enjoy the right to form trade unions. Workers not free to form trade unions in-
 clude public security and military officials, and public sector employees in
 nonrevenue earning entities. The 1991 Labor Code reforms raised the number of
 workers required for an establishment to be unionized from 15 to 30. The Inter-
 national Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA)
 concluded in November that this was too stringent a limitation at the plant workers
 council level and should be changed. While employees of state-owned organizations
 enjoy full rights similar to those in the private sector, the majority of public sector
 employees technically are prevented from oining unions and lack collective bargain-
 ing rights. Nevertheless, most public employees maintain membership in some labor
 organization, and the Government is frequently hampered by "illegal" strikes. De-
 spite official threats, action is virtuall never taken against striking public workers.
 Approximately 12 to 15 percent or the work force is organized. There are four
 large labor centrals or confederations, three of which maintain international affili-
 ations. Ecuador also has numerous labor federations unaffiliated with the four labor
 centrals, such as the drivers' union, the teachers' organization, the National Arti-
 sans and Mechanics Confederation, and numerous peasant groups. None of the main
 labor centrals is firmly connected to any one  litical party.
 Workers have the legal right to strike. There are few restrictions on this right,
 except for public servants and workers in most state-owned enterprises. A 20-day
 cooling-off period is required before declaring a strike. The 1991 Labor Code revi-
 sions, whichthe Government contends were adopted in light of the structural ad-
 justment process made necessary by Andean Pact integration, limit solidarity
 strikes or boycotts to 3 days, provided that they are approved by the Labor Ministry.
 Many legal strikes occurred in 1992. In addition to the large number declared legal,
 there were numerous illegal strikes, including the September 23 national strike. In
 a legal strike, workers may take possession of the factory or workplace, thus ending
 production at the site, and receive police protection during the takeover. All salaries
 and benefits continue to be paid by the employer during a legal strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Ecuador has a highly seg-
 mented labor market with a minority of workers in skilled, usually unionized, posi-
 tions in state-run enterprises or in medium to large industries. The vast majority
 of the economically active population is either unemployed or underemployed in the
 informal sector. Moast rural labor is not organized. The Labor Code requires that all
 private employers with 30 or more workers belonging to a union must negotiate col-
 lectively when the union so requests. The new labor law has streamlined the bar-
 gaining process in state-owned enterprises by recuiring workers to be represented
 by only one labor union. The Labor Code prohibits discrimination against unions
 and requires that employers provide space for union activities upon a union's re-
 quest.
 Despite the reforms promulgated in November 1991, employers consider the Labor
 Code to be highly unfavorable to their interests and a disincentive to the hiring of
 union members and to employment in general. Employers often try to avoid hiring
 additional workers and unionization by substituting machinery for workers or by
 "atomizing" their production processes to maintain plants employing fewer workers
 than the number needed to-form a union. Employers are not permitted to dismiss
 a worker without the express permission of the Ministry of Labor. The Ministry's
 rulings are not subject to judicial review.
 Dismissals ruled as uiyustified by the Ministry of Labor require payment to the
 worker of large indemnities or separation payments by employers, although the re-
 forms set a cap on such payments. The La or Code provides for resolution of labor
 conflicts through an arbitration and conciliation board comprised of one representa-
 tive of the Ministry of Labor, two from the union, and two representatives of man-
 agement. In November, in response to a complaint about the 1991 Labor Code revi-
 sions, the CFA expressed concern that they provide for "compulsory arbitration" if
 no agreement is reached, contrary to the pnnciples of freedom of association.
 
 
 395
 A maquila (in-bond) law pased in 1990 permits the hiring of temporary workers
 for the maquila industries only. While there is no express prohibition of association
 rights in the maquila law organizing temporary contract workers will be difficult
 in practice, as many will 6e temporary employees with short term contracts. The
 Government approved a law permitting free-trade zones, but none had been estab.
 lished by year's end.
 c. Pohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.--Compulsory labor is prolubited by
 both the Constitution and the Labor Code and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Persons less than 14 years old are
 prohibited by law from working except in special circumstances such as apprentice-
 ships. Those between the ages of 14 and 18 are required to have the permission of
 their parent or guardian to work. In practice, enforcement of child labor laws is seri-
 ouslyinadequate. In rural areas most children leave school at about 10 years of age
 to contribute to household income as farm laborers. In the city many cluldren under
 14 work in family-owned busines in in the informal sector, shining shoes, collecting
 and recycling garbage, or as stret peddlers.
 e. Acceptable Con      of Work.-The Ministry of Labr has the principal role
 in enforcing labor laws and carries this out with a corps of labor inspectors who are
 active in all 21 provinces. The Labor Code provides for a 40-hour workweek a 15-
 day annual vacation, a minimum wage, and other variable employer-provided bene-
 fits such as uniforms and training opportunities. The minimum wage is set by the
 Minister of Labor every six months in consultation with the commission on salaries.
 It also may be adjusted by an act of Congress. It is enforced by the Ministry of
 Labor. The basic minimum wage is very low and is not adequate to provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family. The vast majority of organized workers
 in state industries and formal sector private enterprises earn substantially more
 than the minimum wage and also have significant other benefits. Because it is so
 low, the minimum wage is the operative wage in many informal sector activities
 where the majority of the economic ally active population is employed. There is little
 reason for employers to violate the Labor Code by paying less.
 The Labor Code also provides for general protection of workers' health and safety
 on the job. In the formal sector occupational health and safety is not a major prob-
 lem. The Government enforces health and safety standards and regulations through
 the Social Security Institute. There are no specific regulations governing health and
 safety standards in the agiculturl sector and, in practice, there is no enforcement
 of safety rules in small mines and remote locations.
