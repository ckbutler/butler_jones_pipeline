 GUINEA
  Under President Lansana Conte, Guinea has been governed by the
 Military Committee for National Recovery (CMRN) and a joint
 military and civilian Council of Ministers since 1984. The
 regime, which came to power following the 26-year rule of
 Sekou Toure, suspended the constitution and rules through
 ordinances, decrees, and decisions issued by the President and
 ministers. On December 23, Guineans voted overwhelmingly to
 adopt a constitution which provides for an interim period of
 mixed military/civilian administration, not to exceed 5 years,
 leading to an elected.presidential system of government, with
 two political parties, aunicameral legislature, and strict
 separation of powers. The President announced at the end of
 1990 that the CMRN would be replaced in early 1991 by a joint
 civilian/military council as the first step toward applying
 the new Constitution.
 Military and paramilitary forces number about 17,000 persons
 (although accurate figures are difficult to obtain), with the
 army consisting of some 10,000 officers and soldiers. The
 2,000-man National Guard (Gendarmerie Nationale), a police
 force, and a well-armed presidential guard provide internal
 security. Both the military and police have committed human
 rights abuses.
 Eighty percent of Guinea's population of 7 million is
 dependent on subsistence agriculture. Per capita annual
 income is estimated to be as low as $300. Mineral resources,
 mainly bauxite, diamonds, and gold, are the major exports.
 Under President Conte, Guinea's economic reform program is
 attempting to reduce the size of the civil service, the main
 employer, by 50 percent and diversify the small salaried work
 force, primarily through the creation of producers'
 associations and cooperatives and the promotion of foreign
 investment. However, these efforts have left recent
 university graduates without jobs, especially in the public
 sector, a sinecure under the old regime. In 1990 there was
 growing government concern over labor and student unrest.
 Human rights remained circumscribed in 1990. Major concerns
 were the Government's failure to curb abuses by poorly
 disciplined security forces and arbitrary arrest, absence of
 due process, restrictions on freedoms of speech, press,
 assembly, and association, and on the right of citizens to
 change their government through democratic means.
 Acknowledging these concerns, especially those in the
 political sphere, the Government widely publicized in 1990 the
 new draft constitution, prepared by a committee of 50 persons
 drawn from all sectors of educated Guinean society. The new
 Constitution provides for many basic rights, including a
 prohibition on torture and protection against arbitrary
 arrest. The Government issued a general amnesty in 1990 for
 all Guineans convicted of political crimes.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings in
 Guinea in 1990. Police killed several persons in putting down
 civil unrest and rioting following a strike (Section 6.a.) and
 student disorders in November and December (Section 2.b.).

 GUINEA
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman and
 degrading treatment. The military Government continued in
 1990 to denounce the human rights atrocities of the former
 Toure dictatorship and publicly proclaimed-its support of the
 1965 penal code, which forbids torture and abuse of
 authority. However, mistreatment of detainees continued and
 frequently involved severe. beatings. The police and soldiers
 are widely perceived by the public as using excessive force.
 Officials who commit such abuses are rarely punished; there
 were no known instances of punishment in 1990.
 In late 1989 six Conakry residents were arrested for
 distributing tracts produced by an opposition group located
 outside the country. Reliable sources indicate that two of
 the six were beaten while in custody, and the six, including
 Mohamed Ali Bangoura, a newspaper distributor, left the
 country after spending a short time in custody in Conakry. In
 February 1990, responding to a complaint from Amnesty
 International, the Government officially denied that the
 incident had occurred.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Ineffective administrative controle and limited legal recourse-
 make arbitrary arrest a persistent threat to-Guineans. Under
 the law, arresting authorities may hold a suspected criminal
 incommunicado for 48 hours, or 96 hours if an extension is
 granted by a tribunal. The detainee has the right to counsel
 only after appearing before a judge. Political detainees,
 such as those held after the 1985 coup attempt, have been held
 incommunicado and without chaige for much longer periods.
 Some were held for as long as 2 1/2 years. In recent years,
 political detainees have reportedly been held incommunicado
 for a few days.
 A system of bail for those accused of less serious crimes, as
 defined by the presiding judge, is available at the judge's
 discretion. In practice, despite presidential admonitions and
 campaigns in the government-owned media against corruption and
 harassment of citizens, security elements used arbitrary
 detention as a means of extortion. Police and National Guard
 officers, for example, used nightly roadblocks to harass or
 arrest persons in an effort to extort money.
 Over 2 million Guineans fled the Sekou Toure regime. The
 Government has encouraged expatriate Guineans to return home,
 and many continued to do so. The general amnesty announced in
 February applied to Guinean exiles as well to people still in
 the country (see Section i.e.). Significant numbers of
 Guineans still live in neighboring African countries and in
 France.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although Guinean law provides guarantees of due process,
 administrative inefficiencies, corruption, and personnel
 deficiencies make the administration of justice erratic. The
 Guinean penal code provides for the presumption of innocence
 
 
 154
 GUINEA
 of accused persons, the independence of judges, the equality
 of citizens before the law, the right of the accused to
 counsel, and the right to appeal a judicial decision. The
 judiciary is susceptible to influence by the executive;
 however the new Constitution affirms the judiciary's
 independence.
 The judiciary includes the courts of first instance (or
 justices of the peace at the local level) and two Courts of
 Appeal (one in Kankan, one in Conakry). The Court of Assizes,
 which is supposed to meet whenever there is a sufficient case
 load, convened in 1990 for the first time since 1988,
 effectively leaving some defendants in prison for 3 years
 without t-rial. The Court of Annulment is the Guinean court of
 last appeal. A special Court of State Security was created in
 1985 to try those allegedly involved in the July coup
 attempt. Guinean law provides for a Court of State Security
 under certain circumstances, but it has not met since 1985. A
 Military Tribunal prepares and adjudicates charges against
 accused military personnel but, to ensure equality before the
 law, since 1988 all judgments regarding violations under the
 penal code are rendered by civil courts. Trials are public.
 Those accused of major crimes have the right to an attorney at
 public expense if they cannot afford counsel; those accused of
 less serious crimes may appeal to the Bar Association for free
 legal counsel, although many remain unaware of this
 possibility. About 35 lawyers are accredited with the Bar
 Association and are engaged in private practice.
 The administration of justice is plagued by numerous
 problems: The insufficient number of magistrates, who are
 often poorly trained; an outdated and overrestrictive legal
 code; and corruption. There are also allegations of nepotism
 in the administration of justice, with relatives of
 influential members of the Government virtually immune from
 the law. The Customs Service, the Central Bank, and the Army
 have all been involved in significant scandals in 1989-1990.
 There is a traditional system of justice at the village or
 urban neighborhood level where litigants present their civil
 cases before a village chief, neighborhood chief, or council
 of wise men for judgment. Justice is not enforced uniformly.
 For example, burglars caught in urban areas are sometimes
 beaten to death by victims and their neighbors with the tacit
 approval of police authorities. Authorities have publicly
 condemned such summary justice, but neither police nor
 citizens have been tried and punished for it. The dividing
 line between the formal and traditional justice system3 is not
 clearly defined, and a case may be referred from the formal to
 the traditional system to ensure compliance with the judicial
 ruling by all parties. Conversely, if a case cannot be
 resolved to the satisfaction of all parties in the traditional
 system, it may be referred to the formal system for
 adjudication.
 In 1990 the Government continued to receive extensive
 criticism for its secretive handling of those tried by the
 State Security Court and the Military Court in 1986 for
 alleged involvement either with the former Toure regime or the
 July 1985 coup attempt. In response to such criticism, the
 Government announced on February 16, a new general amnesty for
 all Guineans convicted of political crimes; it also ordered
 the restitution of all property seized from persons involved
 in the attempted coup of July 1985. It did not, however, give
 the names of the persons released in 1990 (or in the 1987 and
 
 
 155
 GUINEA
 1988 amnesties), and the fate of others remained unknown at
 the end of 1990. The amnesty did not restore property seized
 by the Government following the April 1984 coup.
 The number of political prisoners held at the end of 1990 was
 unknown. Three Guineans were arrested in N'Zerekore in August
 following distribution of political tracts critical of the
 Government. Two were convicted of violating laws on
 publications, sentenced to 3 months in prison, and released;
 one was convicted of fraud as well, having entered Guinea on
 false papers, and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.
 Guinean officials have informed diplomatic and international
 human rights observers that there are no longer any political
 detainees or prisoners held in Guinea, implying that all those
 imprisoned for their connection with the 1985 coup have been
 released.
 f. Arbitrary-Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government stresses traditional family values and the-
 inviolability of the home, but unwarranted interference in
 citizens' lives continues, primarily through police
 harassment. Security officials are known to monitor mail and
 telephone calls.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Includingz
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government has publicly stated that it supports free
 speech and a free press, and the new Constitution promises an
 unspecified degree of freedom of expression, subject to
 limitation by law and regulation. However, citizens do not
 generally feel free to express public criticism of the
 Government, although criticism of government officials is
 heard in private discussions.
 The Government owns and operates the news media, and reporters
 (who are government employees) practice self-censorship. In
 1990 investigative reporting focused on social ills and
 unscrupulous commercial practices (a favorite target of
 official criticism), but no criticism of the senior levels of
 government or established policies was aired. The press
 provided only limited and biased coverage of the teachers'
 strike in March and subsequent civil unrest. No footage of
 violent confrontations between security forces and
 demonstrators was broadcast, and no mention of the casualties
 inflicted by security forces was made (see Section 6.a.). The
 Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism continues to act
 both as administrator and censor of the media. At least one
 group applied for a permit to publish an independent
 newspaper; they had not received a response by the end of
 1990. Publications that incite crime or are contrary to good
 morals are prohibited, as are insult, defamation, and libel.
 Several signed political tracts that included specific
 criticisms of the President and other officials were
 distributed widely in Conakry and other Guinean cities. Ba
 Mamadou, a former exile now living in Conakry condemned to
 death in absentia by Toure for criticizing his regime, wrote a
 series of tracts criticizing the Government for its failure to
 combat corruption and abuse of authority and for its excessive
 secrecy. The official government newspaper responded to these
 widely read tracts with several editorials defending the
 
 
 GUINEA
 Government and attacking Ba. Clandestine tracts were also
 common and sometimes provoked a harsh response from the
 Government.
 Foreign publications, some of which include criticism of the
 Government, circulate freely in Guinea. There is no attempt
 to interfere with foreign radio broadcasts.
 b.- Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public gatherings may take place only with the approval of the
 Government. The Guinean penal code bans any meeting that has
 an ethnic or racial character or any gathering "whose nature
 threatens national unity." The Government encourages the
 formation of nonpolitical professional organizations, and
 their numbers continue to increase.
 Protopolitical groups, including discussion groups, and
 nascent human rights organizations were active in Conakry in
 1990. Their membership has so far been drawn for the most
 part from a small number of intellectuals in Conakry; the
 groups' impact has been reduced both by their limited access
 to the media and by public reticence about open participation
 in such organizations.
 There was considerable student unrest in 1990 over
 school-related conditions regarding dormitories, libraries,
 campus security and food. Police used deadly force to
 suppress a student demonstration in November. The Government
 acknowledged that one student was killed; the Guinean
 organization for Human Rights (OFDH) said that at least two
 others were killed by security forces. In early December, at
 least two students were killed when police dispersed
 demonstrators. The Government reported that one was shot by
 security forces, and the other was shot by another student.
 Students dispute the Government's account. There were no
 known investigations into these incidents by year's end.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Large religious groups enjoy religious freedom and tolerance,
 but the Government and the quasi-governmental National Islamic
 League (LIN) have spoken out against the proliferation of
 "pseudo-sects (within Guinean Islam) generating confusion and
 deviation." The President has declared that the LIN is the
 only organization with responsiblity for coordinating the
 observance of Islam in Guinea. Although an estimated 85
 percent of the population is nominally Muslim, there is no
 official state religion. The Government observes major
 Christian and Muslim holidays. Foreign missionaries, both
 Catholic and Protestant, operate freely in Guinea. The
 state-owned radio and television stations have given air time
 to Billy Graham crusades and provide regular slots for both
 Muslim and Christian broadcasts.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Guineans are free to move about the country and change their
 place of residence and work, although'in practice they face
 harassment by police and military roadblocks, particularly at
 night. It is common for citizens to pay bribes to avoid
 police harassment. Foreign travel is permitted, although the
 Government retains the ability to limit it for political
 reasons.
 
 
 157
 GUINEA
 The Government in the past has restricted the freedom of
 movement of individual citizens for political reasons. For
 example, the 67 persons granted amnesty at the end of 1987
 were restricted to their area of origin following their
 release from prison, although this restriction was lifted as a
 result of the 1990 amnesty.
 More than 300,000 Liberians sought refuge in Guinea in 1990,
 principally in the Guinea forest region. The Government
 worked closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) and many other international and
 nongovernmental organizations to provide food and shelter for
 the refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights- The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens are unable to change their government through
 democratic procedures. The military Government suspended.the
 Constitution and banned political parties and formal political
 activity when it took power in April 1984. The new
 Constitution, adopted by referendum in December, provides for
 a transitional period, not to exceed 5 years, of mixed
 military/civiliar stewardship leading eventually to a
 two-party, presidential system of government with a unicameral
 legislature and strict separation of powers- Some structures
 of the future government such as the those of the judi-ciary-
 will be determined during the transitional period-
 There were allegations of abuse of votfng procedures, at
 several palling places in the constitutional referendum and
 results from several prefectures were altered. Nevertheless,
 most informed observers agreed that those irregularities did
 not significantly affect the result.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are at least- three nascent human rights organizations- in
 Conakry that have begun to publicize their concerns about some
 human rights issues, including rehabilitation of the victims
 of Sekou Toure's oppression. In June an independent
 organization calling itself the Guinean Organization for Human
 Rights applied to the Government for official recognition. It
 had not yet received a response by the end of 1990. The group
 prepared and distributed declarations criticizing the
 Government's human rights performance without reprisals from
 the Government. No effort was made to interfere with the
 group's meetings, but in November the Government responded
 with its security forces to the group's attempt to hold a
 demonstration protesting the Government's handling of unrest
 at the university and detained some members of the
 organization for up to 3 days. In 1990 senior Government
 officials met with representatives of the International
 Committee of the Red Cross concerning humanitarian issues,
 including possible prison visits.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While racial or ethnic discrimination is prohibited by the
 penal code, ethnic identification is strong in Guinea, and
 mutual suspicion affects relations across ethnic lines within
 and outside the Government. Official government policy is to
 
 
 158
 GUINEA
 include representatives of all major ethnic groups in the
 Government, but the Soussou ethnic group, to which President
 Conte belongs, tends to predominate at the highest, most
 influential levels. A disproportionate number of police are
 Malinke, former President Toure's ethnic group. Clandestinely
 circulated opposition tracts frequently play on ethnic
 tensions to stir resentment against the Government. Many of
 those who disappeared after the 1985 coup came from the
 Malinke ethnic group. There is still awareness of caste in
 traditional environments, but there is no significant
 discrimination against slave castes in public life.
 In rural Guinea, opportunities for women are limited by custom
 and the traditional demands of subsistence farming. The
 Government has affirmed the principle of equal pay for equal
 work, but in practice women receive less pay than men in most
 jobs.
 Violence against women, mainly wife beating, is prohibited
 under criminal law and is a ground for divorce under civil
 law. However, police rarely intervene in domestic disputes,
 and prosecution of wife beaters is infrequent. Health workers
 in Guinea state that wife beating exists, but they differ in
 their opinions on the extent of the problem. The issue has
 not received significant publicity or government attention.
 Female genital mutilation (circumcision) is practiced among
 all religious groups in Guinea: Muslinis, Christians, and
 animists. According to Western health workers, the practice
 is widespread among Guineans, although the current generation
 of young parents is more reluctant to observe this custom.
 Grandmothers will frequently see to the circumcision of a
 granddaughter even when the parents are opposed. The most
 dangerous form of circumcision, infibulation, is not practiced.
 Section 6 Workers Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The National Confederation of Guinean Workers (CNTG) is funded
 by the State, and all of Guinea's salaried workers (many of
 whom are civil servants) are members. While the CNTG is
 technically independent, critics charge that its leadership
 remains closely tied to the ruling Military Council and
 refuses to uphold the union statutes drafted following the
 CNTG's declared independence from the Government. However, an
 evolution now appears to be taking place within the CNTG
 toward a more representative organization based on collective
 action.
 Guinea's new labor code, drafted with the assistance of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) and promulgated in
 January 1988, states that all workers have the right to create
 and participate in organizations that defend and develop their
 individual and collective rights as workers. The code also
 provides that workers have the right not to be a member of
 such organizations. Further, it stipulates that a union must
 be independent of political parties to be recognized as
 representative of workers. The code requires elected worker
 representatives for any enterprise employing 25 salaried
 workers. At the end of 1990, it was not clear to what extent
 the new labor code was being fully implemented.
 The code also grants salaried workers the right to strike 10
 days after their representative union makes known their
 
 
 159
 GUINEA
 intention to strike. Many CNTG locals showed increased
 impatience with eroding purchasing power in 1990. A teachers'
 strike over extremely low wages in March sparked civil unrest
 in which the police killed several rioters, none of whom was a
 striking teacher. The Government promised teachers and other
 workers a significant salary hike following the strike, which
 was later fulfilled. Bank workers, electric workers, workers
 at the CBG bauxite mine, and workers at the Entag cigarette
 factory also went on strike, most often successfully. The
 CNTG belongs to the Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 In its 1989 report, the ILO's Committee of Experts (COE>
 commended the Government for the new labor code, but observed
 that the law still permits either party to invoke compulsory
 arbitration, a practice that could limit the right to strike,
 according to the Commi-ttee-
 b. The.Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under the new code-, representative workers' unions or union
 groups may organize the workplace and- negotiate with employers
 or employer organizations. Union delegates are to represent
 individual and collective claims and grievances before the
 employer.
 Work rules and work hours established by the employer are to:
 be developed in consultation with: union delegates- Individual
 workers threatened with dismissal or other sanctions have the
 right to a hearing before the employer with a union
 representative present. Employe-rs must give advance notice of
 any plan to redcuce the size of their work force for economic
 reasons.
 In practice, CNTG representatives take the lead in
 labor/management talks. Collective bargaining has taken
 place; notably in the resolution of a series of- strikes in
 1990. There are no export processing zones-
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The labor code specifically forbids forced or compulsory labor
 which is not practiced. The COE at its 1990 session agaYn
 noted the Government's stated intention to revise or repeal
 various obsolete laws to bring them into compliance with ILO
 conventions on forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment in practice as well as in the
 new code is 16 years of age. Apprentices, however, may be as
 young as 14 years old. Workers and apprentices below age 18
 are not permitted to work at night or more than 12 consecutive
 hours or on Sundays. According to the labor code, the
 Minister of Labor and Social Affairs must maintain a list of
 occupations in which women and youth under age 18 may not be
 employed. Enforcement of the Ministry of these provisions is
 limited to the modern sector of the economy. Children of all
 ages work on family farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government has not yet enacted minimum wage legislation,
 but the labor code provides for the eventual establishment by
 decree of a guaranteed minimum hourly wage. There are also
 provisions for overtime and night wages which are fixed
 
 
 160
 GUINEA
 percentages of the regular wage. Wages currently paid the
 average worker in the public sector, about $70 a month, are
 generally not sufficient to provide a decent standard of
 living, and workers must often rely on some subsistence
 agriculture or the extended family for additional assistance.
 The average wage rate of a worker in the mining sector is
 higher, about $160 per month, which does afford a satisfactory
 standard of living.
 According to the code, regular work is not to exceed 10-hour
 days or 48-hour weeks, with a 40-hour workweek being the
 norm. The minimum weekly day of rest must be 24 consecutive
 hours, usually on Sunday. Every salaried worker has the right
 to an annual paid holiday accumulated at the rate of at least
 2.5 workdays per month of service. Several articles of the
 code provide for safe working conditions and the continued
 good health of workers, and labor inspectors are empowered to
 suspend work immediately in dangerous situations. These as
 yet represent goals rather than the practice and are not
 enforced.- The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is
 supposed to enforce labor standards. Labor inspectors
 acknowledge that they can not even cover Conakry with their
 small staffs and meager budgets; at the same time, major parts
 of the code are also alleged to be stifling to businesses and
 inhibitive to foreign investors.
