 BARBADOS
 A member of the British Commonwealth, Barbados is a
 constitutional democracy with a free, two-party democratic
 system of government on the British parliamentary model. Its
 House of Assembly is the third oldest elected body in the
 Western Hemisphere. Barbadians recognize the Queen of England
 as head of state; she is represented by an appointed Governor
 General. The Prime Minister is the head of government.
 The Royal Barbados Police Force ensures public order; it
 respects constitutional and legal guarantees of human rights.
 Police morale is good, and public respect for the police force
 is high. The volunteer Barbados Defence Force is responsible
 for national security, but is'used for public order i-n times
 of crisis, emergency, or other specific need. Barbados has a
 well-established judicial system based on common law and
 British procedure.
 The country's economy is based on light manufacturing, tourism,
 services, and sugar.
 There were no changes in Barbados' good human rights record
 during 1987.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No killings for political motives were reported.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there
 were no reports in 1987 of cruel,.inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. Prison conditions are humane, and
 facilities were expanded in 1987 to accommodate increased
 numbers of inmates. A separate facility was also built for
 prisoners held on charges for civil debts, thereby separating
 them from prisoners held on criminal charges.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment,
 and this prohibition is respected in practice. The
 Constitution also requires the authorities to bring detainees
 before a court of law within 72 hours of arrest. Criminal
 defendants have the right to counsel, and attorneys have ready
 access to their clients.
 The use of any form of forced or compulsory labor is prohibited
 by law, and that prohibition is respected. Hard labor as a
 sentence was recently abolished.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that persons charged with criminal
 offenses be given a fair, public hearing within a reasonable

 time by.an ihdependent and impartial court. Defendants are
 presumed innocent until proven guilty. The Government
 provides free legal aid to the indigent. The judiciary acts
 independently and is free of intervention from other branches
 of government. There'are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government'does hot interfere arbitrarily in the private
 lives of its,'citizens. The Constitution prohibits arbitrary
 entry, search, or seizure, and'the law requires warrants to be
 issued before privately owned property may be-entered 'and
 searched. The.Government neither Censors the'mail nor
 restricts the rec~ipt-of foreign correspondence or
 publications.                      -
 Section 2 Respect'for Civil-.iberties; Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitutionprovides for freedom of speech and press, and
 these rights are generally respected in practice. Thereare
 five radio stations, two of which are government owned. CBC
 television servite (the sole television station)'is gbvefnment
 owned.,.Though CBC is not independentoof government'control,
 views opposing government policies are regularly reported.
 The Government often comes under attack on two popular, daily,
 call-in Tadio-programs.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Go~ertment observes the constitutional guarantees of
 peaceful assembly and private association. Political parties,
 trade -ssoCiations, and private organizations function and
 hold meetings and rallies without government hindrance.-
 Workers have the right to organize, to bargain collectively,
 and to strike. Approximately 55 percent of the working
 population is organized, and protests or strikes have occurred
 when collective bargaining has failed. Although the major
 union has strong ties 'with the governing party, and its four
 principal officers'are parliamentarians, labor leaders and
 rank-andrfile trade union membr's are motivated primarily by
 economic and social rather-than political considerations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is full freedom of religion. While the Anglican and
 Methodist faiths have traditionally predominated, there are
 numerous other active religious denominations and organizations
 throughout'the'country..
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens and legal residents move freely within and outside
 Barbados, a right provided for by the Constitution. Barbados
 has a small number of applicants for admission as refugees;
 their applications are processed on a case-by-case basis.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In Barbados' parliamentary democracy, parties compete freely
 in honest elections held at least every 5 years. There are no
 impediments to participation in the political process;
 Barbadians over age 18 enjoy universal suffrage.
 The present Democratic Labour Party (DLP) Government won the
 May 1986 election, taking 24 of the 27 seats. The differences
 between the government party and the opposition Barbados
 Labour Party (BLP) are based more on personalities than on
 ideology. A Marxist third party, the Workers Party of
 Barbados, which was formed in 1985, has attracted little
 support and participated only marginally in the 1986
 election. It holds no parliamentary seats.
 Following the death of Prime Minister Errol Barrow on June 1,
 1987, Erskine Sandiford, an educator and Minister of Education,
 was chosen by his party as the new-Prime Minister in a smooth
 transition of power. Henry Forde, a former Foreign Minister
 and Attorney General with a strong record as a champion of
 human rights, leads the BLP opposition.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no reports of human rights violations in Barbados
 during 1987, and human rights groups have not requested
 investigations. There is a local affiliate of Amnesty
 International. Barbados advocates strengthening the human
 rights machinery of the United Nations and the Organization of
 Axrferican.States. The Government favors more investigations
 into alleged violations of human rights in other countries and
 the increased use of factfinding or observer teams to monitor
 controversial political and electoral situations. Prime
 Minister Barrow, while in opposition before his party's
 electoral victory, served as a member of an international team
 sent to observe the Philippine elections.
 The Government has consistently spoken out on human rights
 violations in other countries, particularly in Africa, Latin
 America, and the Caribbean. Prime Minister Sandiford
 reinforced Barbados' stand on human rights in an address to
 the United Nations General Assembly in September 1987.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law
 regardless of race, religion or sex. These provisions are
 respected in practice. Barbados is a signatory of the 1979
 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
 Against Women. Women actively participate in all aspects of
 national life and are well represented at all levels in both
 the public and private sectors. Women's groups speak out on
 public issues and insist on being consulted by the Government
 on important national issues.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The legal minimum working age in Barbados is 16 and is
 observed. The workweek is 40 hours-in 5 days. Workers are
 guaranteed a minimum of 3 weeks of annual leave. Occupational

 by law. All workers are covered by unemployment benefits

 program offers heavily subsidized treatment-and medication.
