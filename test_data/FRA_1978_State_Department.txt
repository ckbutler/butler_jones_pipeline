 FRANCE
 France is a constitutional democracy in which the govern-
 ment's authority is balanced between executive and legis-
 lative branches. The French system is based on the thesis
 that the plurality of power provides the checks and bal-
 ances essential to ensure that the rights of individuals
 stand higher than the claims of the state. France has an
 established tradition of respect for human rights and of
 their promotion at home and abroad. The French govern-
 ment and people fully support this element of national
 tradition and policy.

 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 France provides extensive social security benefits, un-
 employment compensation, full health services and free
 education to all citizens through university levels.
 The French government's decisions to absorb many refu-
 gees from Algeria and Indochina and to permit Africans
 from former French colonies to work in France on a
 long-term basis have been intensely debated and some-
 times criticized by segments of the French population.
 Nonetheless, official French sensitivity to these needs
 has remained consistent and high, and the government
 seeks to prevent instances where criticism might evolve
 into racial conflict.

 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly

 Travel and Emigration

 and emigration.

 Participation in democratic processes is fully respected.

 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 To the knowledge of the Department of State, no investi-
 gations of human rights performance in France have been
 sought.
