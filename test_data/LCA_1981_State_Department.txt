 ST. LUCIA
 St. Lucia, independent since February 22, 1979, was
 a British dependency, and subsequently an associated
 state. When full independence was granted, St. Lucia
 had a well-developed parliamentary system and considerable
 experience in local administration. The constitution
 includes specific safeguards for the preservation
 of human rights.
 St. Lucia's economic development has been hampered
 by limited government revenues and by political uncertainty
 discouraging private sector investment. The economy
 has a small but growing industrial base, but is most
 heavily dependent on agriculture. Both agriculture
 and industry were affected by hurricane Allen, which
 struck the island in August 1980 and dealt a severe
 blow to efforts to build the economy. For the time
 being, the island will have to devote its scarce resources
 to rebuilding and rehabilitation.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the constitution and is not
 practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The constitution prohibits inhuman or degrading punishment.
 There have been no allegations of such treatment.
 C. Disappearances
 No disappearances have been reported.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is constitutionally
 prohibited, and this prohibition is respected in practice.
 The constitution contains a provision for preventive
 detention when a state of emergency is declared, which
 has not occured since independence.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair hearing by an independent and impartial court
 established by law is required by the constitution.
 Accused persons are presumed to be innocent until
 proven guilty. The constitution also guarantees the
 provision of legal counsel. There have been no allegations
 of denial of these rights. The country's appeals
 court is the regional West Indies Court of Appeal,
 which has a wide reputation for impartiality.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Arbitrary search and entry are prohibited by the constitu-
 tion, and this prohibition is respected in practice.

 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The St. Lucian constitution guarantees these freedoms,
 and they are respected in practice.
 St. Lucia has three newspapers, which represent various
 shades of opinion. There are privately-owned radio
 and television stations, and the government-owned
 Radio St. Lucia. There is no censorship of the media.
 There are no restrictions on public meetings, and
 opposition groups are free to organize. Trade unions
 are free to organize and elect their own leaders without
 government interference. Unions in the private sector
 of the economy have the right to strike. The government
 certification process is impartial and available to
 all unions. There is no formal union participation
 in labor-related policy decisions, but political leaders
 maintain close contact with all union organizations,
 and their-views are taken into consideration in the
 decision-making processes.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 These rights are all guaranteed in the constitution
 and are honored in practice. There have been no cases
 of refugee resettlement in St. Lucia.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 St. Lucia's political system continues to be vigorous,
 with opposition parties playing an active role in
 and out of parliament. There are no restrictions
 against women participating in government, and they
 hold prominent positions in the St. Lucia civil service.
 In elective office, howevei, their role is more limited.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no reports on St. Lucia by international
 human rights bodies nor any requests for investigation.
 St. Lucia has not signed the Inter-American Convention
 on Human Rights. The major domestic organization
 that follows human rights developments is the multi-
 denominational St. Lucia Christian Council.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 St. Lucia has a mixed economy. Foreign investment
 is encouraged, particularly in labor-intensive industries,
 although an uncertain political situation has clouded
 the investment climate. The government has made strenous
 efforts, within the limits of severe fiscal constraints,
 to meet the social and economic needs of the population.
 Hurricane Allen, in August 1980, dealt a sharp blow
 to the agriculture-based economy, throwing thousands
 of banana workers out of their jobs and deroofing
 houses, schools and hospitals around the island.
 The government has made efforts to restore housing
 and public buildings to the state existing before
 the hurricane, but living conditions for the average
 citizen have not yet returned to the pre-hurricane
 
 
 521
 level, and agricultural production has not been fully
 restored. There is a modest welfare scheme for indigents.
 Over the past five years, St. Lucia has channeled
 more than 20 percent of its total recurrent expenditures
 into education and health,'reflecting the high priority
 given to those areas. In 1980, for the first time,
 patient care at the general hospital was made free
 of charge. Elementary school enrollment includes
 95 percent of those eligible. However, shortages
 of teachers and classroom space severely limit secondary
 school enrollment. Only about one third of primary
 school graduates enter junior secondary school (at
 age 12), and only one third of those enter senior
 secondary school (at age 15). Approximately three
 percent of the school population eventually graduates
 as potential university entrants. The government
 is making strenuous efforts to expand secondary education,
 but there is little likelihood of major changes in
 those statistics in the near future.
 In agriculture, the government has expressed concern
 about the antiquated land tenure system but has not
 yet acted on recommendations of its land reform commission.
 Meanwhile, the government has arranged a pilot land
 resettlement scheme to provide five to ten-acre plots
 for 175 farmers.
 Women are not discriminated against in matters of
 employment. The manifesto of the ruling political
 party includes a commitment to ensure equality of
 treatment of women in all spheres of St. Lucian life,
 including wages.
 
 
 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 
 The nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines gained
 full independence from the United Kingdom on October 27,
 1979, although the Queen of England remains the nominal
 head of state. St. Vincent, a British colony from
 the eighteenth century, gained internal self-government
 in 1967 when it became an associated state, with
 Britain retaining responsibility only for foreign
 affairs and defense. Long years of experience with
 English common law have created a respect for the
 rights of the individual and an open political system.
 The 1979 constitution provides for a Westminster-
 style parliamentary system of government and contains
 specific safeguards for basic human rights.
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines held its first election
 as an independent nation shortly after independence.
 Four political parties of widely-varied ideological
 views participated; the election was judged to be
 fair. On December 7, 1979, two days after the election,
 a secessionist uprising on Union Island in the Grenadines
 was suppressed with assistance from neighboring Barbados.
 In the aftermath of the uprising, the government declared
 a state of emergency which lasted until May 15, 1980.
 During that period, a by-election was postponed and,
 at one time, up to 40 persons were charged and detained
 without bail. As soon as the emergency was lifted,
 the by-election was scheduled and all prisoners were
 released on bail except for four ring-leaders later
 convicted in the normal criminal court.
 During 1981, charges abounded of government unresponsive-
 ness to popular discontent in connection with two
 controversial pieces of labor legislation. The dispute
 led to formation of a broad anti-government coalition
 and demonstrations and strike action against the govern-
 ment. The proposed legislation was ultimately withdrawn.
 The rights of Vincentians to assemble and speak out
 against government policies were respected during
 the crisis.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The constitution prohibits torture and there are no
 reports that it is practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The constitution prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading
 treatment or punishment. There have been no complaints
 about prison conditions. There is one men's prison
 in the country, located in an older building. This
 facility is spartan but offers basic facilities, is
 uncrowded and is well maintained. A woman's facility
 is located at a separate location, and conditions
 are of a similar nature. These facilities were used
 for those detained after the December 1979 Union Island
 (5=)
 
 
 523
 uprising. Police practices have not attracted critical
 comment. The St. Vincent and the Grenadines' police
 is a non-political organization, and the government
 strives to ensure that standards of impartiality are
 maintained and honored in practice.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of disappearances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution provides for preventive detention
 under emergency laws, for legal representation for
 the detainee and for periodic review of his case.
 There are no political prisoners. During the state
 of emergency in early 1980, prisoners detained in
 the Union Island insurrection were denied bail until
 the emergency was lifted, at which time they were
 released.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution guarantees a fair hearing within
 a reasonable time by an independent and impartial
 court established by law. Access to legal counsel
 is also guaranteed, and defendants are presumed to
 be innocent until proven guilty. Decisions of local
 courts can be appealed to the regional West Indies
 Court of Appeals (which has a well-established reputa-
 tion for impartiality) and, ultimately, to the British
 privy council.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution provides for protection from arbitrary
 search and entry. From all reports, this protection
 is respected.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees these freedoms and they
 are respected in practice. There are three weekly
 newspapers in St. Vincent and the Grenadines representing
 a wide range of opinion, and there is no censorship
 or overt government interference in their operations.
 Independent publishers have alleged, however, that
 government advertising is often given or withheld
 in reflection of their editorial stances. Opposition
 factions have accused the government of denying necessary
 police meeting permits for political reasons, especially
 during the state of emergency. There is no religious
 discrimination in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
 The government has accepted the International Labor
 Organization's convention on freedom of association.
 Unions enjoy the right of collective bargaining and
 are generally active on the industrial relations scene.
 There is no discrimination favoring one union or another.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The constitution provides for freedom of movement
 within the country as well as the right to enter and
 
 
 524
 leave freely. The freedom is honored in practice.
 No one is known to have applied for refugee status
 in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines enjoys universal suffrage,
 and there is active political participation in national
 elections every five years. Few organized groups
 pursue specific interests during inter-election periods.
 Rather, there are small political parties that appear
 to function actively only during election time. On
 the other hand, the government tends to neglect popular
 consultation and opposition viewpoints in the belief
 that it can pass its legislation without taking into
 account divergent opinions.
 While there are no legal impediments to women participa-
 ting in the political process, they have not usually
 played a prominent role in politics. Those who have
 done so have generally been wives of prominent politi-
 cians. NO women were elected to parliament at the
 most recent elections.
 3.   Government Attitudes and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 As a new nation, St. Vincent and the Grenadines has
 not yet acceded, of its own accord, to any international
 human rights conventions. The government has announced
 its intention to review individually all treaties
 to which Great Britain acceded on its behalf. There
 are no branches of international human rights organiza-
 tions in St. Vincent, nor is there any local body
 publicly active in monitoring human rights violations.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines has a per capita gross
 domestic product estimated at just under $500, up
 from $270 in 1970. As this figure suggests, the nation
 has severe economic problems and also suffers from
 high unemployment, estimated to be 50 percent among
 male youth. Considerable agricultural damage was
 done by the eruption of Soufriere volcano in April
 1979. Economic progress was set back even more in
 August 1980 by hurricane Allen, which caused considerable
 infrastructure damage and devasted much of the agricul-
 tural economy -- especially the banana crop. The
 government has endeavored to overcome these problems
 as quickly as possible.
 While the base of the economy is agriculture, the
 government has been. attempting to diversify into tourism
 -- already well-established in the Grenadines -- and
 light industry. The government has outlined tax incen-
 tives and other encouragement to foreign private investment
 employing Vincentian labor. The small number of foreign
 investors in St. Vincent express satisfaction with
 the government's industrial program which has, however,
 made only small inroads so far in the substantial
 unemployment. There are no laws specifically guarantee-
 ing women's rights in the employment field. The industrial
 wages act provides for a different -- and lower --
 minimum wage for women than for men engaged in factory
 work. There is also a provision prohibiting women
 
 
 525
 from employment during midnight shifts -- a regulation
 originally designed to benefit female workers.
 From 1970-1978, gross national product per capita
 rose from $270 to $490. In 1977-1978 alone, the real
 growth rate was 14.8 percent. Subsequently, the two
 natural disasters retarded economic growth considerably.
 The nation's poverty limits the resources it can expend
 on priorities such as social services. Good medical
 care is not available in much of the nation because
 of a scarcity of doctors and their concentration in
 the capital. The government announced in 1980 its
 intention to establish a clinic in the heretofore
 medically-unserviced Union Island in the Grenadines.
 These poor medical conditions are reflected in a rela-
 tively high infant mortality rate (56 per thousand)
 which has been unchanged over time. Education and
 housing need substantial improvement, a fact which
 the government acknowledges. Although such indicators
 as percentage of population with access to safe water
 have shown improvement (17 percent in 1970; 25 percent
 in 1978), primary school enrollment has fallen (1970
 97 percent; 1978 85 percent) as the rate of population
 growth has risen from 0.7 percent in 1970 to 2.1 percent
 in 1978.
 The government has a national provident fund, which
 provides for retirement benefits for much of the wage-
 earning population. Currently, a new national insurance
 scheme is planned, which will not, however, encompass
 unemployment insurance. There are, under present
 law, no benefits for the jobless. There have been
 charges that the present government has neglected
 development and social serviqes in the small Grenadine
 Islands. Such charges may stem from the consistent
 election of an anti-government member of parliament
 from the Grenadines. Most estimates have placed the
 Grenadines' per capita income at a higher level than
 that of St. Vincent proper, as a result of remittances
 from the many islanders employed as crew by shipping
 lines.
