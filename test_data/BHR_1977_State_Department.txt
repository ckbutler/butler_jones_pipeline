 BAHRAIN
 
 Historically the most prosperous and cosmopolitan of
 the Arab states in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain pioneered
 in devoting oil revenues to social welfare, although it
 is now less well-off than its oil-exporting neighbors.
 The general attitude toward human rights in Bahrain is
 conditioned by a tradition of tolerance. It has an
 educated population, including the region's only native
 industrial proletariat. Therefore, there is political
 and labor activity of a kind hardly known in neighbor-
 ing states. As a result, the government's attitude
 toward human rights is a mixture of progressive social
 outlook and a firm concern for state security. The
 constitution provides strict safeguards for personal
 liberties and dedicates the state to social welfare,
 but after a brief experience with representative gov-
 ernment the Amir in 1975 suspended the elected National
 Assembly.
 1. Respect for the Integrity.of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Government of Bahrain has long faced a small but
 well-organized radical opposition which carried out a
 political assassination in late 1976. In dealing with
 this group, the authorities may occasionally have per-
 mitted the torture of persons detained by the police.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Government of Bahrain does not practice cruel, in-
 human or degrading treatment or punishment.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Government of Bahrain employs pre-emptive imprison-
 ment in cases involving what it views as serious and
 immediate threats  to civil order, as well as personal
 threats to members of the ruling family, the diplomatic
 corps, or religious leaders. The government has occa-
 sionally defined a threat to civil order to include
 non-violent public protests, but in such cases those
 arrested have been detained only briefly. In more
 (332)
 
 
 333
 serious cases, only a few persons regarded as security
 threats have been detained for extended periods of
 time; these cases have been reviewed periodically by
 the courts in conformance with specific provisions of
 the law.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials are generally provided in Bahrain.
 Trials for crimes judged treasonable may be closed to
 the public.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The Bahraini authorities have searched without warrant
 private premises in extraordinary circumstances such
 as a perceived threat to the security of the state.
 Constitutional prohibitions against arbitrary invasion
 of the home, are, however, usually observed by the
 police.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Beginning with the first receipt of some oil income 40
 years ago, the Bahraini regime set an example in the
 region by liberal policies in public health care and
 education. More recently, the government has embarked
 on-costly anti-inflation subsidies and public housing
 programs.
 A commercial real estate boom has inten3ified the in-
 equality of wealth in this essentially free-enterprise
 community. The government is allocatinc the bulk of
 its public resources to providing the social welfare
 benefits guaranteed the citizen by the zonstitution.
 Bahrain's modest oil wealth, combined w-Ith the govern-
 ment's relatively enlightened social po.i-ics, results
 in a reasonably equitable distribution -f public
 wealth. Taxation of the public is toker.. Bahrain
 takes pride in the lack of corruption ii its public
 life; some does exist, but not to the extent of

 adversely affecting the poor.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Bahrainis are free in thought and speech. From time to
 time, the press is censored, particularly in discussion
 of Bahrain's relations with other countries. Religious,
 ethnic, and racial tolerance is characteristic of Bah-
 raini social attitudes and legal practice. The easy
 acceptance of Bahraini Jews in important roles in the
 community is an example of this attitude.
 The status of women is more advanced in Bahrain than in
 any other Arabian Peninsula country. Education has long
 been available to women, and they are now moving toward
 the goal of job equality. The government encourages
 the participation of women in the professional and
 skilled labor force.
 Although freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the con-
 stitution, the government has on several occasions
 prohibited gatherings which it has considered to be a
 threat to public order.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Bahrainis are free to move within the country, to travel
 abroad, and to emigrate.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Representative democracy suffered a setback with the
 dissolution of the National Assembly in 1975. The
 present lack of representative institutions is, however,
 in part counterbalanced by the relative ease of access
 of citizens to government leaders. The cabinet tra-
 ditionally is broadly representative of the community.
 For decades, Bahrain has had an active labor movement,
 which at times has represented a potent political force.

 Trade unions, however, are illegal. Workers are in-
 stead organized on an industry-by-industry basis into
 workers' councils. The councils primarily perform
 social welfare functions for their members and serve
 a liaison function with management with respect to
 worker grievances.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Amnesty International has followed the cases of more
 than 30 people imprisoned in Bahrain. In September
 1975, the organization wrote to the Amir advocating
 their release. Subsequently 27 or 28 were released.
 Some of these have since gone through the process of
 re-arrest and release several times.
 No international public or private organization has
 asked for an investigation of human rights in Bahrain.
