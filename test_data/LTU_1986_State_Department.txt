 LITHUANIA*
 Lithuania, the largest of the three Baltic states, was
 forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union as a constituent republic
 of the U.S.S.R. in 1940 after having enjoyed independence
 between the two World Wars. The United States does not
 recognize this forced incorporation of Lithuania into the
 U.S.S.R.
 Lithuania is subjected to the same centralized rule, the same
 Constitution and judicial system, the same restrictions on
 civil and political liberties, and the same police controls as
 the republics of the Soviet Union. The non-Lithuanian segment
 of the population, now estimated at about 20 percent, has been
 growing in recent years as a result of official settlement
 policy.
 As in the other Baltic states, the standard of living in
 Lithuania is somewhat higher than the Soviet average.
 Agricultural and industrial production increased in 1986, but
 Soviet redistribution policies continued to force down
 Lithuanian living standards toward lower all-union levels.
 Official disregard for human rights in Lithuania continued in
 1986. Soviet authorities continued their campaign against
 human rights activists and against the Roman Catholic Church,
 which is preparing for the 1987 celebration of the 600th
 anniversary of Christianity in Lithuania.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Although Lithuanian activists have on occasion died in Soviet
 custody, it is often impossible to prove official
 responsibility for the deaths of persons involved in human
 rights activities. On February 6, 1986, Father Juozas
 Zdebskis was killed in a mysterious car accident which
 reminded many of the 1980-81 deathd under similar
 circumstances of other priests involved in human rights
 activities. Zdebskis had been warned on several occasions by
 Soviet officials to cease his work for the Catholic Committee
 for the Defense of Believers' Rights.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Political dissidents are frequently mistreated during
 interrogation or confinement in labor camps, prisons, or
 psychiatric hospitals. Persons accused of publishing or
 * Given Soviet control over all aspects of life in Lithuania,
 the systemic human rights abuses described in the report on
 the U.S.S.R. apply also to Lithuania. This report discusses
 only instances of repression specific to Lithuania.

 LITHUANIA
 distributing underground publications receive harsh sentences,
 including terms in prisons or labor camps, exile, or
 commitment to psychiatric hospitals. The typical charge is
 "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda." For example,
 Lithuanian Helsinki Group member Victoras Petkus, imprisoned
 for human rights activities in 1977, has reportedly been in
 bad health since serving a term in a labor camp in 1983-84.
 There has been no direct news of Petkus since August 1983, but
 the 1986 release of Anatoliy (Natan) Shcharansky, who shared a
 cell with Petkus for 16 months early in their sentences,
 provided added information as to Petkus' unhealthy condition
 at that time.
 Lithuanian activists continue to focus on the August 22, 1985
 attack on Father Vaclovas Stakenas, a member of the Catholic
 Committee for the Defense of Believers" Rights. The attack
 has been compared to that which resulted in the death of
 Father Popieluszko in Poland in 1984.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The provisions of Soviet law are so broadly worded that they
 have been used to prosecute persons exercising basic human
 rights.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party subverts
 constitutional guarantees of the objectivity and independence
 of the judicial process in political cases. The
 self-determined "compelling needs of the State" override the
 rights of a defendant.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Informer networks, censorship of mail, electronic monitoring
 of telephones, and jamming of foreign radio broadcasts enable
 government authorities to interfere in nearly every aspect of
 personal life. Constitutional guarantees to the contrary,
 Soviet investigative agencies do not abstain from forced entry
 and illegal searches. Contacts between Lithuanians and
 foreign visitors are strongly discouraged, and those who
 maintain such contacts are subject to harassment by the
 authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for most internationally accepted
 political liberties, provided that their exercise does not
 challenge or differ from the interests of the party and
 State. As is shown by the frequent imprisonment of religious
 leaders, human rights activists, and those involved in
 underground publications, Soviet officials have little respect
 for freedom of speech and press. The degree of their
 sensitivity to uncontrolled printing operations was revealed
 in a January 21 report in the newspaper Sovyetskaya Kultura
 regarding the discovery of a 7-year-old underground printing
 operation in Gargzdai in northwest Lithuania. Five persons
 involved were arrested, tried, and sentenced for up to 3 years
 for having printed religious cards, calendars, and
 prayerbooks--all designated by the authorities as
 "contraband." Underground publications which appear regularly
 
 
 971
 LITHUANIA
 include the Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania,
 Ausra (Dawn), Tautos Kelias (The Path of the Nation), Lietuvos
 Ateitis (Lithuania's Future), and Perspektyvos (Perspectives).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to associate freely is provided for in the
 Constitution, but the authorities strictly control all
 associations and organizations.
 Soviet labor laws and practices are enforced in Lithuania.
 Although the Constitution guarantees all Soviet citizens the
 right to form trade unions, any efforts by workers to exercise
 this right independently of state-sponsored and controlled
 unions have been brutally repressed. Given Soviet concern
 that the ideas of the Polish Solidarity trade union movement
 might spread, this has been especially true in Lithuania,
 which has close historical ties to Poland and the Catholic
 Church.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Despite constitutional guarantees, religious activists are
 subject to systematic harassment. Soviet authorities have
 apparently mounted a large-scale assault on all religious
 activists not controlled and sponsored by the State, with
 special emphasis on the Lithuanian Catholic Church. Soviet
 officials reportedly have taken control of church committees
 and excluded priests from some of these bodies. Because of
 officially imposed limits on admissions to Lithuania's only
 theological seminary, over 100 parishes are said to be without
 a permanently assigned pastor. Children are routinely
 harassed to deter them from attending church services. In
 school the children of believers are sometimes forced to join
 atheist organizations on threat of punishment. Catholics
 attending religious festivities have been interrogated and
 physically abused, and historic shrines and artifacts have
 been desecrated.
 Because of the difficult conditions created by government
 reprisals and threats, the group calling itself the Lithuanian
 Catholic Committee for the Defense of Believers' Rights has
 been forced to go underground. In the last 3 years, three
 members of the group have been convicted of anti-Soviet
 agitation and propaganda or disrupting public order. Fathers
 Jonas Matulionas, Alfonsas Svarinkas, and Sigitas Tamkevicius
 are still in prison. A young Catholic student, Roman
 Zemaitis, was tried and convicted with Matulionas and is
 serving 2 years in a labor camp.
 Despite these convictions and continuous attempts to suppress
 its activities, the Catholic Church remains active and
 vigorous. The 70th issue of the Chronicle of the Catholic
 Church in Lithuania (dated April 23, 1986) carried a 1985
 protest from 127 Lithuanian priests to General Secretary of
 the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Gorbachev which
 charged the Soviet regime with failure to comply with
 Lithuanian law, the Soviet Constitution, Article 18 of the
 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and Section VII of the
 Helsinki Final Act. They specifically criticized Soviet
 actions which "morally terrorized" children of religious
 parents for attending church, suppressed church rites and
 religious education, controlled the appointment of priests and
 bishops, and prosecuted activist priests and believers.

 LITHUANIA
 Another attack on Soviet policies surfaced in a November 11,
 1985, declaration from the bishops and administrators of
 several Lithuanian dioceses who decried the lack of
 catechisms, Bibles, and other religious materials resulting
 from official restrictions.
 The Lithuanian church (comprising both coopted officials and
 unofficial activists) is busy with preparations for the 1987
 celebrations marking the 600th anniversary of Christianity in
 Lithuania. There is hope that Pope John Paul II might
 attend. Several large gatherings are planned, although there
 is fear that Soviet authorities might restrict or totally
 forbid them, as has happened in the past for smaller religious
 festivities.
 The officially controlled press in 1986 criticized Eastern
 cults, such as Zen Buddhism, for their evil influence on
 Lithuanian society. One reason for this publicity was the
 1985 murder of an Uzbek movie actor, director, and karate
 champion in Vilnius by a teacher of mysticism and his
 associates who were traveling in Lithuania among their
 devotees. The press has also cited Islam and the Hare Krishna
 sect as posing a danger.
 Several small, unregistered Protestant sects have also been
 the object of severe Soviet harassment including threats that
 young children will be taken away from religious parents.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Emigration from Lithuania has virtually stopped during the
 last 3 years. Although many Lithuanians have close relatives
 abroad, Soviet authorities use various vague phrases, such as
 "against the interests of the State," in order to refuse
 emigration requests. The authorities try to deter people from
 even applying to emigrate by threats of dismissal from
 employment, psychological harassment, and alteration of the
 procedures for exit visa applications. One Lithuanian, whose
 claim to American citizenship is recognized by the United
 States Goverment, is Vytautas Skuodis, a member of the
 Lithuanian Helsinki Watch Group. Skuodis has been serving a
 sentence of 7 years in labor camp and 5 years in internal
 exile since 1980 in connection with his human rights
 activities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Communist Party attempts to direct and control all
 political, economic, cultural, and social developments in the
 Soviet Union. It is defined in law as the "leading and guiding
 force of Soviet society" and is the only political party that
 is tolerated.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Rejecting foreign criticism of its human rights record, the
 Soviet Government argues that it fully protects all
 internationally recognized human rights. It will not permit
 any investigation of the human rights situation in Lithuania.
 Authorities have arrested Lithuanians who have attempted such
 investigations and have routinely harassed foreign visitors
 
 
 973
 LITHUANIA
 (and their local interlocutors) who show an interest in
 investigating human rights abuses.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The relative homogeneity of Lithuania's population, its strong
 sense of national identity, and the binding force of the
 Lithuanian Catholic Church have helped to preserve many of the
 country's social and cultural traditions. Nevertheless, the
 disruptive effects of an antireligious ideology, forced
 collectivization, and a policy of industrialization have been
 severe. Rigid controls on cultural and religious expression
 have forced many Lithuanians into underground activity. A
 reduction in the amount of Lithuanian language instruction at
 the primary level in 1982, with a corresponding increase in
 the teaching of the Russian language and Russian history, has
 aroused fear that the groundwork is being laid for cultural
 and eventual linguistic Russification of Lithuania.
 Non-Lithuanians total about 20 percent of the population, and
 their proportion has been growing in recent years, especially
 as Slavic migrants are drawn to the relative prosperity of
 Lithuania compared to their ethnic home areas within the
 Soviet Union.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men. An
 extensive system of day-care service and maternity benefits
 enable women to obtain and retain employment outside the
 home. However, women generally hold less remunerative
 positions in the professions than men.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The statutory minimum wage for the employment of children in
 1986 was 16, and the standard workweek was 40 hours. The
 minimum wage was set at $112 per month at the official rate of
 exchange. According to the latest official data, the average
 wage was about $272 per month. Soviet law requires, in
 general terms, healthy and safe working sonditions, but these
 conditions usually fall short of Western standards.
