 ARGENTINA
 Argentina is a federal constitutional democracy with an executive branch headed
 by an elected president, a bicameral legislature, and a separate judiciary. In 1995
 voters reelected President Carlos Saul Menem to a second term that runs until
 1999. The judiciary is independent but inefficient.
 The President is the constitutional commander in chief, and a civilian Defense
 Minister oversees the armed forces. Several law enforcement agencies share the re-
 sponsibility for maintaining law and order. The Federal Police report to the Interior
 Minister, as do the Border Police and Coast Guard. Provincial police are subordinate
 to the respective provincial governors. Members of the police continued to commit
 human rights abuses.
 Argentina has a mixed agricultural, industrial, and service economy. An economic
 reform and structural adjustment program has led to high growth with low inflation
 and spurred competitiveness. Gross domestic product (GDP) increased about 8 per-
 cent, and per capita GDP was $8,900. As a result of privatization, private sector ad-
 justment, and rapid labor force growth, the national unemployment rate, although
 declining slowly, remained high at 16 percent. The high cost of living affected those
 on low fixed incomes the most, although the entire country benefited from the end
 of hyperinflation.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there were problems in some areas. There continued to be instances of extrajudicial
 killings and brutality by the police, who also arbitrarily arrested and detained citi-
 zens. However, the authorities took action to prosecute or punish a number of per-
 sons for such abuses. Prison conditions are poor. The judicial system is subject to
 political influence at times and to inordinate delays, resulting in lengthy pretrial de-
 tention. There were numerous threats against journalists, and one journalist was
 killed. Discrimination and violence against women are also problems.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated extrajudicial killings.
 Police officers, however, were believed responsible for a number of extrajudicial
 killings. The authorities investigated and in some cases detained, tried, and con-
 victed the officers involved. A former police chief in the province of Buenos Aires
 was arrested on suspicion of carrying out the brutal murder in January of news pho-
 tographer Jose Luis Cabezas (see Section 2.a.). In April a young woman, Teresa
 Rodriguez, was killed when police in the province of Neuquen, reinforced by federal
 border guards, broke up a demonstration by striking teachers and unemployed
 workers in the town of Cutral-co. The bullet that killed her apparently was fired
 from a police weapon, although this could not be confirmed.
 In April a court in the Buenos Aires provincial town of Lomas de Zamora sen-
 tenced two provincial police officers to 8 years in prison in the 1992 death of 19-
 year-old Anibal Romero, shot and killed while attempting to avoid arrest on sus-
 picion of armed robbery.
 In July the Catholic bishop of the province of Santiago del Estero led a public
 march to protest the killing of 15-year-old Juan Gonzalez, allegedly by a provincial
 policeman.
 In November the authorities arrested and indicted five Mendoze provincial jolice-
 men in connection with the October death of 18-year-old Sebastian Bordon, a high
 school student from Buenos Aires province. For reasons that remain unclear,
 Bordon, who was on a school trip, was left in the custody of Mendoza police. His
 body was found several days later in a rugged area of the province. The five officers
 arrested in the case are expected to be tried in March or April, 1998.
 Suspected police involvement in the Cabezas murder increased the pressure on
 the governor of the province of Buenos Aires, Eduardo Duhalde, to reform the pro-
 vincial police force. He relieved hundreds of officers from duty under a 1996 law en-
 abling the provincial government to fire police for cause without lengby adjudica-
 tion procedures. In June the Government created a new office within the Secretariat
 of Security to monitor the activities of the provincial police and receive public com-
 plaints of abuse of police authority. In September the Government published a new
 police instruction manual incorporating a report on police violence by the Center for
 Legal and Social Studies, a nongovernmental human rights group. The governor told
 a meeting of senior police officers that reforms were essential to restore public con-
 fidence in the force.
 In June a court sentenced a Buenos Aires provincial policeman to 11 years in pris-
 on for killing Roberto Roldan, who was shot in-February 1996 while seated in the
 back of a car that was rushing his daughter to a hospital in the Buenos Aires sub-
 urb of Avellaneda. In October a court sentenced three Buenos Aires provincial Ko
 licemen to life in prison and a fourth to 15 years in prison in connection with the
 1996 killing of 16-year-old Cristian Campos in the city of Mar del Plata.
 In April a court in the capital city of Buenos Aires accused police authorities of
 inaction in apprehending a fugitive federal policeman, Angel Petronio, who was con-
 victed in 1994 of attempted homicide. In July a border policeman was sentenced to
 8 years in prison on a charge of attempted homicide in the March 1996 shooting
 of two teenage girls in Buenos Aires. In September a court in the capital city sen-
 tenced a federal police officer to 18 years in prison for the 1996 killing of 17-year-
 old Marcelo Mirabete.
 In September the second trial in 2 years in the death of Maria Soledad Morales
 opened in the province of Catamarca. The young girl's body was found in a ditch
 beside a highway in 1990, and several police officers were suspected of helping to
 cover up the crime. A 1996 trial had ended without a verdict when one of the judges
 resigned.
 A former Buenos Aires provincial policeman, one of five indicted in 1993 for the
 murder of 17-year-old Sergio Duran, was arrested in October after eluding capture
 for 4 years.
 The authorities charged eight army officers with attempting to cover up the 1994
 murder in the province of Neuquen of army recruit Omar Carrasco, who was beaten
 to death in a hazing incident. The Carrasco murder led to increased public pressure
 against compulsory military service, which the Government later abolished. In Sep-
 tember attorneys for the three officers who in January 1996 were convicted of carry-
 ing out the murder said that they would request a review of the case based on new
 expert testimony regarding the cause of Carrasco's death.
 In September the Jewish community released a 100-page report criticizing the
 Government's handling of investigations into the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Em-
 
 
 402
 bassy, which killed 29 persons, and the 1994 bombing of the AMIA Jewish cultural
 center, which killed 87 persons. The Islamic Jihad terrorist group had claimed re-
 sponsibility for the embassy attack. In November a congressional commission discov-
 ered that one of the four policemen charged in connection with the AMIA bombing,
 Juan Jose Ribelli, received $2.5 million 1 week before the bombing. Investigators
 also determined that police officers provided a stolen van for the AMIA car bombing.
 Investigations of both bombings were continuing at year's end.
 In October a Spanish court issued arrest warrants for the former chief of the Ar-
 gentine navy and 10 aides on charges of genocide during the 1976-83 "dirty war"
 waged by the military governments. The Spanish judge had previously ordered the
 arrest of Leopoldo Galtieri, the army general who served as president when a mili-
 tary junta ruled the country in 1981-82. The court also brought charges of genocide
 against former naval officer Adolfo Scilingo, who went to Spain to testify in the in-
 vestigation (see Section 1.b.). On December 30, the Spanish judge issued charges
 against another 36 Argentine military and police officials, whose names were pro-
 vided by Scilingo. According to press reports, in response to a request from the
 Spanish Government, the Swiss Government agreed to freeze the bank accounts of
 four of the Argentine officers charged.
 In. July a court sentenced Enrique Gorriaran Merlo to life imprisonment for lead-
 ing a 1989 guerrilla attack on the army's La Tablada barracks, in which 34 people
 were killed. It also sentenced his ex-wife, Ana Maria Sivori, to 18 years in jail for
 her role in the attack.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There were no new developments in the case of the police officers ordered arrested
 for the torture death of 23-year-old student Miguel Bru, who disappeared in 1993.
 An arbitral panel ordered payment of an indemnity of $136,000 to the family of
 Cristian Guardatti, last seen in the custody of provincial police in 1992. This arbi-
 tration was a product of amicable settlement procedures, achieved through the good
 offices of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). At year's end,
 the Government stated it was taking steps to arrange payment of the arbitral
 award. The IACHR referred the question of compensation for the families of Adolfo
 Garrido and Raul Baigorria, who disappeared in 1990, to the Inter-American Court
 of Human Rights. An ad hoc investigative commission and an arbitral commission,
 established by the province of Mendoza in 1996, submitted reports to the court,
 which was expected to hear the case in early 1998.
 The fate of the thousands who disappeared under the 1976-83 military regime
 continued to claim public attention. In April a Madrid newspaper reported that
 Spanish intelligence services had microfilmed the records of the regime's war
 against leftist subversion. The Spanish Government, however, denied the report. In
 June a Buenos Aires television station claimed that it had obtained the transcript
 of the military interrogation of a prominent journalist who disappeared in 1977,
 suggesting that there might be other such records in existence. The manner in
 which the document was publicized, however, cast doubt on its authenticity.
 In June a court ordered the release from prison of former naval officer Adolfo
 Scilingo, who in 1995 claimed in a newspaper interview that fellow officers had
 rounded up alleged subversives during the military dictatorship and thrown them
 to their deaths from airplanes over the River Plate. He added that he had partici-
 pated in two such flights. Four assailants attacked Scilingo in September; they
 carved on his face the initials of journalists who had interviewed him and warned
 him to stop speaking to the press. In October Scilingo went to Spain to testify before
 judge Baltasar Garzon, who was onducting an. investigation into the disappearance
 anddeath of Spanish citizens in Argentina during the military regime. The judge
 ordered him arrested, and he was in jail at year's end, awaiting trial on charges
 of genocide (see also Section l.a.).
 The federal appeals court in Buenos Aires continued its investigation into the fate
 of those who disappeared during the dictatorship. The court cannot impose sentence
 on those responsible for the disappearanes who benefited from government par-
 dons. In October, however, federal prosecutor Miguel Angel Osorio raised questions
 about the pardons in a request to federal judge Gustavo Literas to investigate the
 activities of certain military leaders pardoned in 1989. Federal judge Adolfo
 Bagnasco continued an investigation into the fate of children of persons who dis-
 app ared.
 June the authorities confirmed that former navy Captain Alfredo Astiz, who
 was removed from the armed forces in 1996 because of his alleged torture and mur-
 der of two French nuns and a teenager at the Navy Mechanics School in Buenos
 Aires in 1977, was working for the navy again. The Minister of Defense ordered the
 navy to give him no further work.
 
 
 In May the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a human rights group, asked the Ital-
 ian Ministry of Justice to prosecute Cardinal Pio Laghi for an alleged role in tor-
 ture, murder, and kidnaping while he was Papal Nuncio in Argentina from 1974 to
 1980. The group charged that he had first hand knowledge of abuses perpetrated on
 suspected political dissidents by members of the military government; the cardinal
 denied the allegations. The Government of Italy took no action in the matter.
 Most reliable estimates place the number of those who disappeared during the
 dirty war between 10,000 and 15,000. In 1984 the National Commission on Dis-
 appeared Persons (CONADEP) issued a report that lists 8,961 names, based on pub-
 lic testimony from friends, relatives, and other witnesses. Since then, the Ministry
 of the Interior's Subsecretariat for Human and Social Rights, which inherited the
 CONADEP files, has added over 700 new names, also based on voluntary reporting.
 At the same time, other names have been removed from the original list, either
 through confirmation of the death or survival of the person who disappeared, or
 through the identification of duplicate entries. The absence of documentary records
 of those who disappeared means that the human rights secretariat, like CONADEP
 before it, must rely on public testimony, either voluntary or court-ordered. As
 CONADEP noted in its report: "It has been possible to determine that an important
 quantity of documentation existed which has been destroyed or which is being con-
 cealed by those responsible for the repression."
 The human rights secretariat has received over 9,600 claims for-compensation
 from former prisoners of the military regime and approved 8,000 of them. It has re-
 ceived.7,000 claims from the families of.persons who died or disappeared and ap-
 proved 1,500 of them. The law provides that the -families of persons who dis-
 appeared-may submit claims for compensation until the year 2000. The Government
 announced in August that it plans to issue, an estimated $3 billion in bonds to com-
 pensate families of those who disappeared.
 . c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or'Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and the Criminal-Code provides penalties for tor-
 ture that are similar to those for homicide. Nevertheless, police brutality remains
 a serious problem. In June the U.N. Committee Against Torture criticized the Gov-
 ernment for tolerating the continued practice.of torture in police stations and pris-
 ons.
 In January the Government of Buenos Aires province dismissed eight police offi-
 cers for their role in violently repressing a student demonstration at the La Plata
 police headquarters in February 1996. In February a court ordered the federal police
 --to-pay $10,000 (10,000 pesos) to Hector Gonzalez, who was a victim of a police beat-
 ing during a 1992 incident in a Buenos Aires train station.
 The Commission for, Relatives of Victims of Social ard Institutional Violence
 (Cofavi) works to obtain justice in instances of police brutality and reportedly ob-
 tained_32 convictions for violent ,crimes in cases it brought against police officers
 -. since-1992-Cofavi and- other human rights groups assert there has been an increase
 in the. number of documented cases of police, brutality, highlighted .by the. Bordon
 and Campos killings (see Section L.a.).
 Prison conditions are poor in a number of overcrowded jails where the facilities
 are old and dilapidated. According to the New Rights of Man, a nongovernmental
 human rights organization, a federal prosecutor reported numerous problems, in-
 cluding cellblock flooding, inadequate electrical wiring, broken windows, poor sani-
 tary conditions, and insufficient food in federal penitentiary number 6 in the city
 of Rawson, in the Patagonian province of Chubut.
 In January an inmate of the Villa Devoto prison in Buenos Aires was shot in the
 neck and killed. Prison authorities said that "the victim and several other inmates
 had fired on guards during an escape attempt, but inmates claimed that the victim
 had innocently approached an area that was off limits to -prisoners. In July inmates
 of the Caserosprison protested conditions there, hut after negotiations with senior
 authorities the incident ended peacefully. Among their demands, the prisoners
 sought compliance with the "2 for 1" law, a 1994 statute that gives unsent nced
 prisoners 2 days' credit toward their final sentence for every day served prior to sen-
 tencing. According to press reports, 80 percent of the 1,230 inmates in the Caseros
 prison have yet to be sentenced.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Penal Code places limits on the ar-
 rest and investigatory power of the police and the judiciary, but provincial police
 oftemignored these restictions.-Human rights groups find it difficult to document
 such incidents, saying that victims are reluctant to file complaints because they fear
 police retaliation or do not believe that their complaints would do any good.
 Police occasionally detain teenagers and young adults, sometimes overnight, some-
 times for an entire weekend, without formal charges. They do not always provide
 
 
 such detainees with the opportunity to call their families or an attorney. These de-
 tainees are released only upon a complaint from relatives or legal counsel.
 The law provides for the right to bail, and it is utilized in practice. Nonetheless,
 the law allows pretrial detention for up to 2 years, and the slow pace of criminal
 trials often results in lengthy pretrial detention priods.
 The law does not prmit involuntary exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. While the judiciary is nominally independent and impartial, its processes are
 inefficient, complicated, and, at times, subject to political influence.
 The judicial system is divided into federal and provincial courts, each headed by
 a Supreme Court with chambers of appeal and section courts below it. The system
 is hampered by inordinate delays, procedural logjams, changes of judges, inadequate
 administrative support, and incompetence. Allegations' of corruption are widely re-
 ported, especially in civil cases.
 Trials are public and defendants have the right to legal counsel and defense wit-
 nesses. A panel of judges decides guilt or innocence. In 1992 some federal and pro-
 vincial courts began deciding cases using oral trials instead of the practice of writ-
 ten submissions. Oral trials are less time consuming, and they have helped reduce
 the number of prison inmates awaiting trial. Nevertheless, lawyers and judges are
 still struggling to adjust to the new procedures, and substantial elements of the old
 system remain. For example, before the oral part of a trial begins, judges receive
 written documentation regarding the case which, according to prominent legal ex-
 perts, can bias a judge before oral testimony is heard.
 Constitutional reforms in 1994 provided for a blue-ribbon judicial council that
 would have responsibility for federal court administration and the selection and re-
 moval of judges. In December Congress passed enabling legislation to create the
 council. After the President signs the new law, the councirs 20 members are to be
 chosen within 120 days.
 Some international human rights groups have claimed that Juan Antonio
 Puigjane, a Capuchin monk sentenced to prison with 19 others in a- 1989 attack on
 an army barracks, is jailed for political reasons. Argentine officials, however, main-
 tain that Puigane was properly tried and convicted for involvement in a violent re-
 bellion against a democratically elected government. There were no other reports of
 political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, and government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions. Violations are subject to legal sanction, although in practice,
 local police have the right to stop and search individuals without probable cause.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. Following
 the murder of news photographer Jose Luis Cabezas (see Section L.a.), there were
 reports of numerous anonymous threats against journalists. The body of Cabezas,
 a photographer for the weekly newsmagazine Noticias, was found January 25 out-
 side the coastal resort town of Pinamar, in Buenos Aires province. His hands were
 cuffed behind his back, he had been shot in the head, and his body left in his car,
 which had been burned. A former police chief in Pinamar was eventually arrested
 on suspicion of carrying out the murder, but the motive was unclear and by year's
 end the case had not yet gone to trial. There was widespread suspicion that Cabezas
 was killed because he had been investigating police involvement in criminal activi-
 ties.
 In an August report, a group of prominent journalists called the Association for
 the Defense of Independent Journalism chronicled numerous threats to journalists
 around the country following the Cabezas murder, many in the form of anonymous
 telephone calls. Several reporters covering the Cabezas investigation were taken off
 the story due to threats made against them and their families. In a report issued
 in September, the Committee on Freedom of the Press of the Association of Argen-
 tine News Organizations concluded that as long as the Cabezas murder remained
 unsolved, and there was no adequate response to "the interminable and unaccept-
 able series of threats to journalists and the media," it would continue to maintain
 that "the freedom of the press existing in our country since 1983 is seriously com-
 promised."
 The law provides for academic freedom, and the Government respects this in prac-
 tice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution and laws pro-
 vide for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 
 
 405
 There were violent protests in major cities in May, as citizens protested high un-
 employment and declining living standards. Riot policemen clashed with tens of
 thousands of people blocking roads bridges and government buildings. In La Plata
 police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters and arrested 70 people. In the
 northwestern -province-of Jujuy, border guards injured 50 people while breaking up
 a roadblock-set up by 200 sugar workers and their families.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution and law provide for these rights, and the Government
 respects them in practice.
 The Government recognizes as refugees those persons .who meet the criteria of the
 1951 United Nations Convention. Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967
 Protocol. The refugee eligibility-committee, composed of representatives of the Min-
 istries of Justice, Foreign Affairs, and the Interior is responsible for determining a
 refugee's status. A representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees may
 participate in committee hearings, but may not vote. The Government has granted
 refugee status to numerous -persons and accepted them for resettlement. The issue
 of the provision of first asylum, however, has rarely arisen. There were no reports
 of the ford return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Since its return to democratic government in 1983, Argentina has held periodic
 free and fair elections to choose federal, provincial, and municipal office holders.
 Universal adult suffrage is obligatory in national elections. Political parties of vary-
 ing ideologies operate freely and openly. The revised Constitution provides that all
 adult citizens shall enjoy full participation in the political process, and they do so
 in practice.
 The Constitution stipulates that the internal regulations of political parties and
 party nominations for elections be-subject to affirmative action requirements to as-
 sure that women are represented in elective office. A 1993 decree implementing a
 1991 law required that a minimum of 30 percent of all political party lists of can-
 didates be female. As a result, the presence of women in the Congress is increasing.
 In the new Chamber of Deputies elected in October, 70 of 257 members are women.
 In the Senate, however, whose members are still appointed, only 2 of 72 members
 are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and federal law provide for equality for all citizens. The 1988
 Antidiscrimination Law establishes a series of penalties from 1 month to 3 years'
 imprisonment for anyone who arbitrarily restricts, obstructs, or restrains a person
 based on "race, religion, nationality, ideology, political opinion, sex, economic posi-
 tion, social class, or physical characteristics. There is no evidence of any systematic
 effort to abridge these rights by the Government or by private groups.
 Women.-Violence and sexual harassment against women are problems. Insen-
 sitivity among pollce and judges sometimes discourages women from reporting as-
 saults, especially domestic violence. The National Women's Council has been work-
 ing with ]aw enforcement authorities to include, in their poice training curriculum,
 material on handling cases of violence against women. Rape is a problem, but reli-
 able statistics as to its extent were not available. A rapist is not prosecuted if he
 offers to marry the victim and she accepts his proposal. Many public and private
 institutions offer prevention programs and provide support and treatment for
 women who have been abused, but transitory housing is scarce.
 Women still encounter economic discrimination and occupy a disproportionate
 number of lower paying jobs. Often they are paid less than men for equal work,
 even though this is explicitly prohibited by law. Women are also found dispropor-
 tionately in the informal, unregistered labor market, where they are effectively de-
 nied work-related economic and social benefits enjoyed by registered workers.
 The National Women's Council, created in 1992 in response to recommendations
 in the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
 Against Women, carries out programs to promote equal opportunity for women in
 
 
 education and employment, encourage the participation of women in politics, and
 sup ort women's rights programs at the provincial level.
 ildren.-The 1994 Constitution incorporates the U.N. Convention on the Rights
 of the Child. The Ministry of Interior's Subsecretariat for Human and Social Rights
 works with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other international
 agencies to promote children's rights and well-being. Historically, Argentina has had
 numerous programs to provide public education, health protection, and recreational
 services for all children, regardless of class or economic status.
 According to some nongovernmental and church sources, however, child abuse and
 prostitution are on the rise, and the National Council on Children and the Family
 believes that those affected tend to be younger than previously thought. The Coun-
 cil, which the Government established in 1990, works with federal and local agen-
 cies to improve child protection programs. The federal capital, most of the 23 prov-
 inces, and the Federal Government have passed child protection laws.
 People With Disabilities.-A 1994 law aimed at eliminating physical barriers to
 disabled persons regulates standards regarding access to public buildings, parks,
 plazas, stairs, and pedestrian areas. Street curbs, commuter train stations, and
 some buildings in Buenos Aires have been modified to accommodate wheelchairs,
 but some public buildings and lavatories are still inaccessible to the disabled.
 Federal law also prohibits discrimination against the disabled in employment.
 Since establishment of the National Program against Discrimination in 1994, the
 largest single group bringing complaints has been disabled persons. Nongovern-
 mental organizations are active in defending the rights of people with disabilities
 and helping them find employment.
 Indigenous People.-The revised Constitution provides for the right of minorities
 to be represented in government and incorporates international agreements in-
 tended to promote their economic, social, and cultural rights. Estimates of the size
 of the indigenous population vary from 60,000 to 150,000, but the National Statis-
 tical Institute put the figure at below 100,000 as of 1992. Most indigenous people
 live in the northern and northwestern provinces and in the far south. Their stand-
 ard of living is considerably below the national average, and they have higher rates
 of illiteracy, chronic diseases, and unemployment. Some indigenous groups, includ-
 ing the Kolla Indians in the northwest province of Salta, are involved in protracted
 legal disputes with the federal and provincial governments over tribal lands.
 In March the Government restored to the Kolla Indians ownership of their ances-
 tral lands, half a century after they first marched on Buenos Aires to demand their
 rights. About 100 Kollas traveled to Buenos Aires by bus to receive deeds to 708,900
 acres from President Menem. With state land that was already given up under laws
 from the 1994 constitutional reforms, the Government has reportedly returned al-
 most 4 million acres to indigenous people and plans to return 988,400 acres more
 in 1999.
 Religious Minorities.-There were scattered reports of anti-Semitic acts. Jewish
 community centers in the provinces of Misiones, Tucuman, and Cordoba were van-
 dalized early in the year. On the night of December 24, vandals entered the Jewish
 cemetery in the town of La Tablada, outside Buenos Aires, and damaged 35 tomb-
 stones. The cemetery, which was also vandalized in October 1996, is guarded by
 Buenos Aires provincial police, who reportedly said that they saw nothing. No one
 had been arrested by year's end. In November a Congressional commission discov-
 ered new evidence against one of the four policemen charged in connection the 1994
 bombing of the AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires (see Section l.a.).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-With the exception of military personnel, all workers
 are free to form unions. Estimates regarding union membership vary widely. Most
 union leaders believe it to be about 40 percent of the work force; government figures
 indicate union, membership at 30 percent. Trade unions are independent of the Gov-
 ernment or political parties, although most union leaders support President
 Menem's Justicialist Party.
 Most unions are affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor (CGT). A
 smaller federation, the Argentine Workers' Central, was granted government rec-
 ognition in May after petitioning the International Labor Organization.
 Workers have the right to strike, and strikers are protected by law. The Move-
 ment of Argentine Workers (a dissident group within the CGT) and the Argentine
 Workers' Central staged a 1-day general strike in August to protest an agreement
 on labor law reform negotiated in May between the Government and the CGT.
 Many trade unions are also members of international trade secretariats and par-
 ticipate actively in their programs.
 
 
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law prohibits antiunion
 practices, and the Government enforces this prohibition. The trend towards bargain-
 ing on a company level, rather than negotiating on a sectoral basis, continued, but
 the adjustment has not been an easy one for either side. Both the Federal Govern-
 ment and a few highly industrialized provinces are working to create mediation
 services to promote more effective resolution of collective bargaining disputes.
 Export processing zones exist or are planned in several provinces. The same labor
 laws apply in these zones as in all other parts of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and there were no reports that it was practiced. The law also prohibits forced and
 bonded labor by children and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits employment of children under 14 years of age, except in rare cases where
 the Ministry of Education may authorize a child to work as part of a family unit.
 Minors between the ages of 14 and 16 may work in a limited number of job 'cat-
 egories but not more than 6 hours a day or 35 hours a week. The law prohibits
 forced and bonded labor by children, and there were no reports of its use (see Sec-
 tion 6.c.). A survey by the National Institute on Statistics and the Census revealed,
 however, that some 149,000 children under age 15 were employed. According to the
 National Council on the Child and the Family, two-thirds were working in rural
 areas as farm laborers with their parents and a third were employed in urban
 areas, chiefly as domestic servants. UNICEF estimated that 252,000 children under
