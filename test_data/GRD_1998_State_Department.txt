 GRENADA
 Grenada is a parliamentary democracy, with a Governor General as titular Head
 of State. In June 1995 parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Dr. Keith Mitchell's
 New National Party (NNP) won 8 of 15 seats and formed a majority government.
 The elections were contested openly and fairly, and were free of violence. The judici-
 a   is independent.
 Te 750-member Royal Grenada Police Force is responsible for maintaining law
 and order. It is controlled by and responsive to civilian authorities.
 Grenada has a free market economy based upon agriculture and tourism. The es-
 timated real economic growth rate was 4.65 percent in 1997, and the projected an-
 nual growth rate for 1998 was 4.78 percent. Per capita gross domestic product was
 about $3,200 in 1997.
 Citizens enjoy a wide range of civil and political rights. Human rights problems
 include an allegation of police brutality during arrest, which has not been confirmed
 judicially. The Commissioner of Police has spoken out strongly against police use
 of unlawful force. Violence against women is common but appears to be on the de-
 cline. Child abuse is a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kllling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and there were no reported incidents of
 torture. Flogging, a legal form of punishment, is rare but has been used as punish-
 ment for sex crimes and theft cases.
 The press reported one allegation of police brutality, which involved excessive use
 of force in making an arrest. The case was pending in court at year's end. Allega-
 tions of police brutality are investigated internally by the police. There were no re-
 ports that disciplinary action was taken against a police officer during the year. The
 Police Commissioner can discipline officers in valid cases of brutality with penalties
 that may include dismissal from the force. The Police Commissioner has spoken out
 strongly against police use of unlawful force.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides the police with the
 right to detain persons on suspicion without a warrant, but they must bring formal
 
 
 630
 charges within 48 hours. The police adhered to this time limit in practice. If the
 -police do not charge a detainee within 48 hours, they must release the person.
 The law provides for a judicial determination of the legality of detention within
 15 days after arrest on a criminal charge. The police must formally arraign or re-
 lease a detained person within 60 days, and the authorities generally followed these
 procedures. There is a functioning system of bail, although persons charged with
 capital offenses are not eligible. Persons charged with treason may be accorded bail
 only upon recommendation of the Governor General.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary, a part of the Eastern Caribbean
 legal system, is highly regarded and independent. Final appeal may be made to the
 Privy Council in the United Kingdom. There are no military or political courts.
 Those arrested on criminal charges are brought before a judge to determine whether
 there is sufficient evidence to -substantiate the charges; if there is, the judge re-
 mands the defendant for trial.
 The law provides for the right to a fair public trial, and the authorities observe
 it in practice. There is a presumption of innocence, and the law protects persons
 against self-incrimination and requires the police to explain a person's rights upon
 arrest. The accused has the right to remain silent and to seek the advice of legal
 counsel. A defense lawyer has the right to be present during interrogation and may
 advise the accused how to respond or not to respond to questions. The accused has
 the right to confront his accuser.
 The court appoints attorneys for indigents only in cases of murder or other capital
 crimes. In other criminal cases that reach the appellate stage, the court simlarly
 will appoint a lawyer to represent the accused if the defendant was not previously
 represented or reappoint earlier counsel if the appellant no longer can afford that
 lawyer's services. Due to the backlog of cases caused by a shortage of judges and
 facilities, up to 6 months can pass before those charged with serious offenses face
 trial in the high court. With the exception of persons charged with murder and for-
 eign-born drug suspects, the courts grant most defendants bail while awaiting trial.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for protection from these abuses, and there were no reports
 of such actions. The law generally requires judicially issued warrants for searching
 homes, except in cases of hot pursuit. The Firearms Act of 1968 and the Drug Abuse
 Prevention Act Number 7 of 1992 contain other exceptions that give the police and
 security units legal authority to search persons and property without warrants in
 certain circumstances. In practice police obtain warrants in the majority of cases be-
 fore conducting any search.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government does not restrict these rights. There are four
 weekly newspapers and several other newspapers that publish irregularly. One of
 the weeklies is affiliated with an opposition political party, but the three most wide-
 ly circulated newspapers are independent and often critical of the Government. The
 newspapers routinely carry press releases by the opposition parties, including regu-
 lar weekly columns expressing the opposition parties -views.
 There are four radio stations. The main station is part of the Grenadian Broad-
 casting Corporation (GBC), a statutory body not under direct government control.
 The principal television station is also part of the GBC. A privately owned television
 station began broadcasting in 1992, when a cable company began operating in the
 capital area with plans to expand eventually throughout the country. All news-
 papers, radio, and television stations enjoy independence from the State and regu-
 larly report opposition views. The television news often carried reports on opposition
 activities, incuding coverage of political rallies held by various political parties and
 candidates, public forums featuring political leaders of each of the major parties,
 and other public service broadcasts.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assemble for any peaceful purpose. Supporters of political parties meet
 frequently and hold public rallies; the authorities require permits for the use of a
 public address system but not for public meetings themselves.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country,
 and all citizens have the right to enter and leave the country, except in special cir-
 
 
 cumstances as outlined in and limited by the 1986 Act to Restrict the Freedom of
 Movement of Certain Persons. This law allows the Minister for National Security
 to restrict travel out of the country by any person whose aims, tendencies, or objec-
 tives include the overthrow of the democratic and parliamentary system of govern-
 ment; it has not been invoked in the past few years. Anyone so restricted may ap-
 peal after 3 months to an independent and impartial tribunal. The Chief Justice ap-
 points an accredited lawyer to preside over such a tribunal.
 No formal government policy toward refugee or asylum requests exists. The issue
 of provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no reports of forced expulsion
 of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status; however, government practice re-
 mains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universa suffrage. General elections must be held at
 least every 5 years; the Prime Minister dissolved Parliament effective December 2
 and set elections for January 18, 1999.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice on participation by women in govern-
 ment and politics. Three of the 15 elected members of Parliament were women, as
 well as 1 of the 13 appointed Senators (who also served as Deputy President of the
 Senate). Women account for 7 of the 13 permanent secretaries, the highest civil
 service position in each ministry, in addition, a woman is the Cabinet Secretary, the
 highest civil service position in the Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups operate without government restriction, and the Gov-
 ernment cooperates with visits fom international human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based upon race, place of origin, politi-
 cal opinions, color, creed, or sex, and the Government generally adheres to these
 provisions.
 Women.-Women's rights  monitors believe that violence against women remains
 a serious problem. The police state that most cases of abuse are not reported, and
 others are settled out of court. The law stipulates a sentence of 15 years' imprison-
 ment for a conviction of rape. Sentences for assault against a spouse vary according
 to the severity of the incident. At year's end, a shelter for battered and abused
 women was prepared to open in the northern part of the island, with medical and
 psychological counseling personnel on its staff.
 There is no evidence of official discrimination in health care, employment, or edu-
 cation. Women frequently earn less than men performing the same work; such wage
 differences are less marked for the more highly paid jobs.
 Children.-The Social Welfare Division within the Ministry of Labor provides pro-
 bationary and rehabilitative services to youths, day care services and social work
 programs to families, assistance to families wishing to adopt or foster children, and
 financial assistance to the three children's homes run by private organizations.
 Government social service agencies reported a further increase in the number of
 child abuse cases, including sexual abuse. Abused children are either placed in a
 government-run home or in private foster homes. The law provides for harsh pen-
 alties against those convicted of child abuse and disallows the victim's alleged "con-
 sent" as a defense in cases of incest. Women's organizations and other nongovern-
 mental organizations increased their public awareness efforts to recognize and com-
 bat sexual abuse of women and children.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not protect job seekers with disabilities
 from discrimination in employment, nor does it mandate prevision of accessibility
 for public buildings or services. The National Council for the Disabled and the Na-
 tional Children's Home assist the Government in placing disabled students into
 community schools. The Council also seeks assistance from architects and builders
 in the construction of ramps at hotels and public buildings, and ramps have been
 installed at some hotels.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers are free to organize independent labor
 unions. Labor Ministry officials estimate that between 20 and 25 percent of the
 work force is unionized. Union leaders play a significant role in the political process,
 
 
 and one labor leader serves in the Senate on behalf of the Grenada Trades Union
 Council (GTUC).
 Workers in the private and public sectors are free to strike, once legal and proce-
 dural requirements are met. There were several incidents of industrial action, in-
 cluding brief strikes by truckers and hospital nurses. However, all were short-lived
 and settled with the intervention of the Labor Commission, the Minister of Labor,
 or the Industrial Court. All unions are technically free of government control, and
 none receive government financial support. However, all the major unions belong to
 one umbrella labor federation, the GTUC, which is subsidized by the Government.
 The GTUC holds annual conventions and determines some policies for member
 unions.
 The GTUC and its unions freely affiliate with regional and international trade
 union groups.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers are free to organize
 and to participate in collective bargaining. Legislation requires employers to recog-
 nize a union that represents the majority of workers-in a particular business. The
 law prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and organizers.
 If a complaint ofdiscrimination arises, mechanisms exist to resolve it. After all ave-
 nues for resolving a complaint have been exhausted between union representatives
 and employers, both sides may agree to ask for the assistance of the Labor Commis-
 sioner. If the Labor Commissioner is unable to find a resolution to the impasse, the
 Minister of Labor intervenes and, if unable to reach an agreement, may appoint an
 arbitration tribunal if both parties agree to abide by its ruling. The law requires
 employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination to rehire dismissed employees,
 but in most cases the employee accepts the option of compensation. There were no
 cases of antiunion discrimination reported-to the Ministry during the year.
 Unions may organize and bargain anywhere in the country, including, in theory,
 export processing zones (EPZ's), which are not exempted from labor legislation.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced or bonded labor, including that of children, and there were no reports
 of it.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Child
 labor, including forced or bonded labor, is illegal (see Section 6.c.); however, children
 sometimes work in the agricultural sector. The statutory minimum age for employ-
 ment of children is 18 years. Inspectors from the Ministry of Labor enforce this pro-
 vision in the formal sector by periodic checks. Enforcement efforts in the informal
 sector are lax.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are no minimum wage laws in force.
 Most workers, including nonunionized workers, receive packages of benefits from
 employers set by collective bargaining agreements between employers and labor
 unions. In many cases, overall wages and benefits are insufficient to provide a de-
 cent standard of living for a worker and family. Many agricultural workers earn
 only $13.50 to $18.00 (EC$18.50 to EC$25.00) per day.
 The law does not prescribe a set number of hours as the standard workweek, ex-
 cept for the public sector, which is expected to work a 40-hour week Monday
 through Friday. The normal workweek in all sectors seldom exceeds 40 hours, al-
 though in the commercial sector this includes Saturday morning work.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, but the authorities enforce
 them unevenly. Workers can remove themselves from dangerous workplace situa-
 tions without jeopardy to continued employment.
