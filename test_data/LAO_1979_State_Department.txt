 LAOS
 Cultural, institutional, and historical factors have
 profoundly affected the human rights situation in
 Laos. Historical factors include political struggles
 and armed fighting that has been going on for decades,
 causing rifts that have still not healed. Past foreign
 involvement has made the government suspicious of Wes-
 terners. The population of Laos is about three million
 (approximately 50 percent Lao, 20 percent tribal Thai, 15
 percent Phoutheng (Kha), and 15 percent Hmong (Meo), Yao
 and others), thinly and unevenly distributed over more than
 91,000 square square miles of generally rugged terrain.
 Governmental institutions in Laos are weak. Literacy is
 estimated at 12-20 percent.
 Under the Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR)
 established on December 2, 1975, there was an initial
 severe deterioration in human rights conditions.
 Government leaders relied on force to control those
 people recently brought under LPDR control. Several
 thousand officials of the former government who were
 not trusted by the new regime have been confined indef-
 initely for "re-education." Some officials of the former
 government, however, continue to hold positions of res-
 ponsibility within the bureaucracy.
 There has been some improvement during the past two years
 in several aspects of human rights in Laos, though notable
 shortcomings persist in many areas.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 In previous years there have been isolated reports of
 torture in "re-education camps" and prisons. There has
 been no independent investigation of the camps or
 prisons, and these reports thus cannot be confirmed.
 This year, the Department of State has not had any re-
 ports of torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Refugees have described conditions in "re-education"
 camps (for political prisoners) as primitive, with
 limited medical facilities and poor food often re-
 sulting in malnutrition and disease. The inmates re-
 portedly grow much of their own food. These sources
 state the prisoners are forced to perform hard labor;
 prisoners reportedly receive the same salary as a private
 in the Lao Army. Lao Government officials have publicly
 denied
 
 (482)
 
 
 483
 reports of mistreatment of persons in the re-education
 camps. These officials often maintain that camp inmates
 lead a life which is no more difficult than that led by
 most rural Lao.
 The Lao authorities have taken a number of foreign ob-
 servers to see "rehabilitation" centers for "social
 evils" on islands in the Nam Ngun Reservoir, which they
 apparently regard as a showcase effort. Conditions of these
 detention centers appear spartan but adequate.
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic also has normal
 prisons and prison work camps where those convicted
 of crimes are held together with some persons accused
 of undefined political offenses. There have been a number
 of reports of executions, some as late as 1978.
 Official policy calls for execution of the leaders of
 resistance groups, and Lao authorities have announced
 the execution of a few "reactionaries" charged with
 sabotage activities. One report about Vientiane's Sam
 Khe Prison alleges that in 1977 and 1978 several inmates
 were beaten to death following "People's Courts," held
 inside the prison. A recently released prisoner from
 Sam Khe reported that he had not witnessed any overt
 brutality during nine months of detention. According to
 refdgees and to sources in Vientiane in prior years,
 the authorities in Southern Laos had executed a number
 of people, some publicly, in an effort to clamp down
 on armed resistance there. Such reports are difficult
 to verify. There have been some refugee reports of exe-
 cutions of those attempting to escape from re-education
 camps.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Shortly after the establishment of the new regime, several
 thousand Lao citizens as well as a few foreign resi-
 dents were arrested for their association with the
 previous government (or with the United States), and
 were sent, without public hearing or trial, to remote
 camps for "re-education." The re-education camps in
 Phong Saly were closed in early 1979 and most of the camps'
 inmates released, reducing the number of those in
 captivity to some extent. Former Prime Minister
 and adviser to the Lao Government Souvanna Phouma
 told a visiting U.S. reporter in March 1979 that
 he estimated about 10,000 (15,000 at the most)
 were being held in re-education camps.
 In November and December, at least two more camps were
 closed down, and there were unconfirmed reports that
 this may have been part of a broader program to close
 down all camps.
 Persons accused of hostility to the regime or socially
 undesirable habits (prostitution, drug abuse, idleness,
 and "wrong thought") are sent to rehabilitation centers
 without trial, and can be held there for indefinite
 periods. Most of these persons have been allowed to
 return after several years of hard labor, political
 indoctrination, and admission of guilt.

 also raised to more closely approach free market prices.
 officials of international organizations have reported
 instances of malnutrition, but no starvation. The govern-
 ment is attempting to establish a national rural health
 system, but shortages of trained personnel (many fled
 in 1975), medicines, facilities, and equipment have
 continued to frustrate this effort. These shortages
 also hamper the use of medicine and hospital supplies
 and other public health assistance received in foreign
 aid.
 The Lao authorities have instituted a new campaign
 to wipe out illiteracy. (Outside agencies have esti-
 mated that more than 80 percent of the population is
 unable to read and write.) It is not yet possible to
 tell how successful this campaign will be, although
 the Lao claim that good progress is being made.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The press is government-controlled and is a principal
 instrument for disseminating government and party
 positions. Written or spoken opposition to the govern-
 ment is not considered a legitimate activity. Some
 persons who have engaged in such activities have been
 jailed.
 Laos has traditionally been a Buddhist nation with a
 minority of other religions represented. The Government
 has taken over some Buddhist and Christian places of
 worship for use as seminar halls, but the practice of
 Buddhism and Christianity has been allowed to continue.
 The government has been attempting to use the Buddhist
 clergy as teachers and to explain and endorse govern-
 ment policies. Donations to support monks are tax exempt.
 Monks are the only remaining social group still entitled
 to special honorific terms of address.
 In 1979, Vientiane celebrated the Lao New Year in April
 with a return to traditional ceremonies. Despite official
 government statements, including instructions to avoid
 waste, warnings to maintain public security and con-
 stant reminders of the threat from foreign troops,
 this year's celebration appeared to reflect the tradi-
 tional Lao New Year's spirit more than has been the
 case in the past few years.
 
 
 485.
 
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Until December 1979 Lao citizens were required to seek
 permission from the authorities for most internal travel
 of any distance. Foreign travel is permitted for offici-
 cials and students of government-approved programs.
 Border crossing permits are available for those with
 business in Thailand. The Lao Government has said that
 those wishing to emigrate will be allowed to do so.
 In fact tens of thousands have fled Laos; some were
 fired upon and some killed by Lao border guards
 as they crossed the river to Thailand. Many Lao caught
 seeking to leave illegally have been imprisoned, al-
 though in some cases they have only been sent for short
 indoctrination seminars before being allowed to return home.
 The Lao have recently agreed with the Thai Government
 that each side will take back, on a case by case basis,
 those of its citizens who have illegally crossed into
 the other country and wish to return home. The Depart-
 ment of State has had reports of returnees who have been
 treated well by the Lao authorities. However, there
 have also been rumors from refugees in Thailand of exe-
 cutions of those who had been repatriated. It has not
 been possible to confirm these stories. It is clear,
 however, that certain categories of refugees can return
 without major reprisals.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Local elections were held by the new authorities in the
 autumn of 1975. Voters in villages and districts were
 allowed a choice from a list of candidates-who had been
 pre-selected by the state/party organization. Provin-
 cial and nation-level representatives were reportedly
 chosen by these locally-elected officials, although the
 latter process was not public. In November 1979, a number
 of Lao officials were arrested for "political activity."
 The number arrested and the nature of their activity
 are not known.
 The LPDR is attempting to overcome traditional Lao atti-
 tudes and to integrate minority groups and women into
 their system. Lao women are treated equitably in most
 cases, and are encouraged to take part in economic and
 state controlled political activity.
 d. Treatment of Minorities
 There is no evidence that the government is seeking to
 destroy any particular ethnic group, per se, such as the
 Hmong. Rather the government is equally repressive
 toward all who fought against its takeover,
 and most especially toward those who continue to resist
 its authority by force of arms. The war with the Hmong is
 
 
 surely brutal; but the main differences between the Hmong
 and other resistance groups is that the Hmong have attempted
 to defend specific tribal areas and there is a traditional
 ethnic antipathy. The Hmong and their families thus con-
 stitute concrete targets for the Vietnamese and Lao military.
 Also, they are heavily armed, requiring conventional mili-
 tary operations to dislodge them from their strongholds.
 The Hmong themselves are split along clan lines, with
 many on the side of the LPDR and Vietnamese.
 There is also an ongoing military campaign to suppress resis-
 tance from lowland Lao groups, mainly in southern Laos
 and around Vientiane. Many of the insurgents are former
 Royal Army troops. Both sides are reported to use brutal
 tactics, with the anti-government insurgents engaging
 in assassination and ambush.
 The LPDR has begun a program to resettle some ethnic
 minorities who inhabit mountainous areas into the low-
 lands under better government control and where they
 can engage in agricultural production. Villagers of some
 tribal peoples have been forcibly relocated. The govern-
 ment undertook this program because there has been sig-
 nificant armed resistance, chiefly by those Hmong (Meo)
 dissident groups who had been armed and trained by the
 U.S. and, before that, by France in the war against the
 communists. A joint Lao and Vietnamese army campaign
 to suppress hilltribe resistance in Laos has been in
 progress for a number of months. Refugees have reported
 that large numbers of women and children have been killed
 in bombing raids and that captured Hmong soldiers have
 been dealt with harshly, and in some cases killed.
 There have been refugee accounts of attacks using some
 sort of lethal chemical agent against Hmong. The
 Department of State does not have absolute proof of
 these charges. However, the results of U.S. Government
 investigations support the conclusion that some chemical
 agent or agents were being used in Laos from 1974 to
 as recently as May 1979
 The deterioration in Sino-Lao relations has resulted
 in increasing Lao Government suspicion of and surveil-
 lance of local Chinese. So far, however, there has been
 no policy of expulsion or persecution. The Chinese
 school is open, the Chinese Association is in operation,
 and Chinese merchants are in business, though many have
 left the country.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 Laos allows little independent travel by persons capable
 of investigating human rights violations. Foreigners
 are not allowed to travel outside Vientiane without
 specific permission. Foreign journalists have been
 allowed to visit Laos with increased frequency during
 1979, even though their reports have caused the govern-
 ment some embarrassment. Within Vientiane, foreign
 diplomatic and other observers are able to talk rela-
 tively freely to a cross section of the city popula-
 tion. However, most of these individuals have no
 direct information on the situation outside the capital.
 There have been several official visits to rehabilita-
 tion centers, but no travel by outsiders has been authori-
 zed to the more remote re-education camps.
 A number of UN agencies are present in Laos, but there
 have been no groups visiting Laos specifically to in-
 vestigate human rights conditions there.
