 CHINA
 The People's Repubic of China (PRC) is an authoritarian state in which the Chi-
 nese Communist Pay (CCP) is the paramount source of power. At the national and
 regional levels, party members hold almost all top civilian, police, and military posi-
 tions. Ultimate authority rests with the members of the Politburo, who often consult
 with still-influential past members of that body on major decisions. These leaders
 stress the need to maintain stability and social order and are committed to perpet-
 uating rule of the CCP and its herarchy. Citizens lack the freedom to peaceflly

 express opposition to the party-led political system and the right to change their na-
 tional leaders or form of government. Socialism continues to provide the theoretical
 underpinning of Chinese politics, but Marxist ideology has given way to economic
 pragmatism in recent years. Economic decentralization has increased the authority
 of regional officials. The party's authority rests primarily on the success of economic
 reform, its ability to maintain stability, appeals to patriotism, and control of the se-
 curity apparatus.
 The security apparatus comprises the Ministries of State Security and Public Se-
 curity, the People s Armed Police, the People's Liberation Army and the state judi-
 cial, procuratorial, and penal systems. Security policy and personnel were respon-
 sible for numerous human rights abuses.
 China has a mixed economy that is expanding rapidly. Economic reforms are rais-
 ing living standards for many, strengthening entrepreneurs, diminishing central
 control over the economy, and creating new economic opportunities. Although there
 are problems in the state sector, individual economic opprnities continue to ex-
 pand rapidly with increased freedom of employment and mobility. As the Govern-
 ment continues to adopt market-based policies, both state-owned and nonstate en-
 terprises are benefiting from increased freedom to compete in domestic and overseas
 markets. As economic opportunities grow, however, income disparities between
 coastal and inland areas continue to widen. The number of citizens living in abso-
 lute poverty continues to decline, although estimates of those in poverty range from
 official figures of 65 million to estimates as high as 350 million out of a total popu-
 lation of 1.2 billion. Tens of millions of peasants have left their homes in search of
 better jobs and living conditions. According to estimates, as many as 100 million
 people make up this floating population," with many major cities counting 1 million
 or more such people. Urban areas are also coping with workers idled by industrial
 reforms. An estimated 10 million state workers have been laid off, or not paid. Mil-
 lions more have been idled on partial wages.
 The Government continued to commit widespread and well-documented human
 rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted norms, stemming from the au-
 thorities' intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of
 laws protecting basic freedoms. The Constitution and laws provide for fundamental
 human rights, but they are often ignored in practice. Abuses included torture and
 mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary and lengthy incommuni-
 cado detention. Prison conditions remained harsh. The Government continued se-
 vere restrictions on freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, pri-
 vacy, and worker rights. Some restrictions remained on freedom of movement. In
 many cases, the judicial system denies criminal defendants basic legal safeguards
 and due process because authorities attach higher priority to maintaining public
 order and su ppressing political opposition than to enforcing eal norms.
 Although the Government denies that it holds political prisoners, the number of
 persons detained or serving sentences for "counterrevolutionary crimes" or "crimes
 against the state," or for peaceful political or religious activities are believed to
 number in the thousands. Persons detained during 1996 included activists arrested
 for issuing petitions or open letters calling for reforms and greater democracy.
 Overall in 1996, the authorities stepped up efforts to cut off expressions of protest
 or criticism. All public dissent against the party and government was effectively si-
 leneed by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison terms, administrative deten-
 tion, or house arrest. No dissidents were known to be active at year's end. Even
 those released from prison were kept under tight surveillance and often prevented
 from taking employment or otherwise resuming a normal life. Nonapproved reli-
 gious groups, including Protestant and Catholic groups, also experienced intensified
 repression as the Government enforced 1994 regulations that require all such
 groups to be registered with government religious affairs bureaus and come under
 the supervision of official "patriotic" religious organizations. Discrimination agnst
 women, minorities, and the disabled, violence against women, and the abuse of chil-
 dren remain problems. Serious human rights abuses persist iin minority areas, in-
 cluding Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia. Controls on religion and on other fun-
 damental freedoms in these areas have also intensified.
 During 1996 the National Peoples' Congress (NPC) passed new laws designed to
 reform criminal procedures and thne legal profession. The Government's village elec-
 tions program conducted closely supervised multicandidate elections in villages in-
 habited by hundreds of millions of rural citizens. Although these offer some oppor-
 tunity for local clans and other groups to work out differences democratically, they
 are tightly controlled and do not threaten the leading role of the Communist Party.
 In 1996 Chn     ad lmited human rights discussions and exchanges on the rule of
 law with foreign interlocutors and hosted a meeting of the Interparliamentary
 Union at which a human rights resolution was drafted.

 In many respects, Chinese society continued to open further. Greater disposable
 income, looser ideological controls, and freer access to outside sources of information
 led to greater room for individual choice, more diversity in cultural life, and in-
 creased media reporting. Although the sale and use of satellite dishes are tightly
 regulated, satellite television broadcasts are widely available, particularly in coastal
 areas. Increasing numbers of citizens have access to the Internet although the Gov-
 ernment closed down some World Wide Web sites, including Chinese-language sites
 in Hong Kong and Taiwan, those of Western news organizations, and attempted to
 control the political and social content of the material available through the
 Internet. Controls on reporting economic information imposed in 1995 continued,
 and the Government placed new restrictions on the news media.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were reports of extrajudicial
 killings, including some carried in the Chinese press. There is, however, no reliable
 information about the number of such killings or the adequacy of the government
 response. There have been numerous executions carried out immediately after mass
 summary trials. Often these "trials" occur under circumstances where the lack of
 basic due process protections borders on extrajudicial killing (see Section i.e.).
 In April the official press reported that a guard assigned to maintain public order
 in Shenzhai village, Anhui province, was executed for murdering one farmer and
 wounding two others after they refused to pay illegal levies imposed on local resi-
 dents. The village chief was given a suspended death sentence for his role in the
 incident. In March the parents of 33-year-old Wang Jingbo released a statement
 claiming that their son was beaten to death while illegally detained by the Public
 Security Bureau in Beijing's Chaoyang District. The victim's parents demanded an
 impartial investigation after an autopsy reportedly showed that their son suffered
 a brain hemorrhage and 12 broken ribs while detained. At least three Buddhist
 monks died as a result of mistreatment while in prison in Tibet (see Tibet adden-
 dum).
 b. Disappearance.-In January the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or
 Involuntary Disappearances reprted on three new cases of disappearances that al-
 legedly occurred in 1995. Most of the 56 cases which the Working Group has under
 review occurred between 1988-90. The majority were Tibetans, the others were po-
 litical activists. The Government still has not provided a comprehensive, credible
 public accounting of all those missing or detained in connection with the suppres-
 sion of the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations. Long incommunicado detentions con-
 tinued (see Section 1.d.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture, however, both official Chinese sources and international
 human rights groups continued to report many cases in which police and other ele-
 ments of the security apparatus employed torture and degrading treatment in deal-
 ing with detained and imprisoned persons. Former detainees have credibly reported
 that officials used cattle prods, electrodes, thumb cuffs, prolonged periods of solitary
 confinement and incommunicado detention, beating, shackles, and other forms of
 abuse againat detained men and women. Persons detained pending trial were par-
 ticularly at risk as a result of government failure to correct obvious systemic weak-
 nesses in design and operation of p retrial detention. These weaknesses include a re-
 liane on onfessions as a basis for convictions and the lack of access to prisoners
 by legal counsel and family members until after authorities file formal charges, a
 step that often takes months. Some, but not all, of these problems were addressed
 in March, when the National People's Congress enacted amendments to the Crimi-
 nal Procedures Law. The amendments, which were to become effective on January
 1, 1997, are a positive step toward bringing Chinas criminal justice process into
 conformity with international norms (see Sections 1.d. and i.e.).
 In Ari a h   inese delegate to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights
 stated that "the Chinese judiciary deals with every complaint of torture promptly
 after it is fled, and those found guilty are punished according to law." The Govern-
 ment also claimed in its report to the United Nations Committee against Torture
 that "the State, taking an extremely serious view of any incident of torture, has
 adopted commensurate measures through administrative and judicial means to pun-
 ish by law anyone guilty of such an act." However, because prisoners remain inac-
 csesible to international humanitarian organizations, such as the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), these claims are impossible to verify independ-
 ently.
 
 
 619
 In March the Supreme People's Procuratorate reported that it had investigated
 412 cases in which torture was used to extract confessions in 1995, but it provided
 no information on convictions or punishments. The number of actual incidents of
 torture and mistreatment by government officials is almost certainly greater than
 reflected in published government statistics.
 Conditions in penal institutions are generally harsh and frequently degrading,
 and nutritional and health conditions are sometimes grim. Adequate medical care
 for prisoners continues to be a problem, despite official assurances that prisoners
 have the right to prompt medical treatment if they become ill. Political prisoners
 who reportedly had dificulties in obtaining timely and adequate medical treatment
 during 1996 despite repeated appeals on their behalf by their families and the
 international community, included Xi Yang, Zhou Guoqiang, Wei Jingsheng, Wang
 Dan, Bao Tong, Liu Nianchun, and Gao Yu. Chen Ziming, who has been diagnosed
 with cancer, was released for a second time on medical parole in November. The
 terms of his parole were highly restrictive, and he was placed under tight police sur-
 veillance. China's 1994 Prison Law was Aesigned, in part, to improve treatment of
 detainees and respect for their legal rights. The Government's stated goal is to con-
 vert one-half of the nation's prisons and 150 reeducation-through-labor camps into
 "modernized, civilized" facilities by the year 2010. In 1995 Government officials
 claimed that the Procuratorate had assigned officials to virtually all the prisons,
 houses of detention, and centers for reeducation through labor, in order to supervise
 prison management and enforce laws on treatment of prisoners. No information
 about the number of personnel assigned or the effectiveness of this step was avail-
 able at year's end.
 The official press reported in February 1995 that the Government has established
 157 psychological treatment centers and 54 consultation clinics in the nation's 685
 prisons. Official sources also claimed that more than 17,000 prisoners were treated
 at those facilities over the past 10 years. Mental hospitals have reportedly been
 used on occasion to control political dissidents. The foreign press reported in Sep-
 tember that dissident writer WangWanxing, who was arrested in 1992 for protest-
 ing in Tiananmen Square on the third anniversary of the 1989 demonstrations, was
 in good mental health but remained detained against his will at the An Kang psy-
 chiatric hospital in Shanghai. Neither conditions at such institutions nor treatment
 of prisoners at these centers could be verified because of lack of access by independ-
 ent observers.
 Conditions of imprisonment and detention for political prisoners vary widely. Bao
 Tong remained detained at a government residential compound after his 7-yearpris-
 on term expired in May. Other political prisoners, including Wei Jingsheng, Chen
 Ziming, and Gao Yu were incarcerated with common criminals. Fellow inmates re-
 portedly beat Liu Nianchun at a prison in Heilongjiang province. Imprisoned dis-
 sident Chen Longde reportedly attempted to commit suicide in August by jumping
 from a multistory prison building after he was kicked, punched, and beaten with
 electric prods. He survived the fall, but suffered serious injuries. According to non-
 governmental organization (NGO) reports, Wang Hui, wife of jailed labor activist
 Zhou Guoqiang was detained in May, reportedly for pressing her husband's case. As
 a result of her treatment, including the withholding of liquids, she attempted sui-
 cide. Her attempt was punished with a severe beating. She was released sometime
 prior to November. According to NGO reports, dissident Yao Zhenxiang also was
 beaten after his detention in April.
 China does not permit independent monitoring of prisons or reeducation-through-
 labor camps. The Procuratorate is charged with law enforcement in the corrections
 system. The official press reported in July that 50,000 reprimands were issued to
 prison personnel during the first 5 months of 1996 for inappropriate conduct. Nego-
 tiations with the ICRC regarding access to prisoners have not been resumed since
 the Government suspended discussions in March 1995.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Criminal Procedure Law, offi-
 cials may hold detainees for up to 10 days before the Procuratorate must approve
 a formal arrest warrant. In theory the Administrative Procedure Law permits a de-
 tainee to challenge the legality of his detention. In practice, however, lack of access
 to legal counsel inhibits the effective use of this law to obtain prompt judicial deci-
 sions on the issue. In known cases involving political dissidents, authorities have
 interpreted the law in the Government's favor and strictly against detainees.
 Activist Wang Dan was held in incommunicado detention for 17 months in connec-
 tion with the issuance of a prodemocracy petition before being charged, tried, and
 sentenced in October to 11 years in prison. He is appealing his sentence to the Su-
 preme Court, having lost a lower level appeal.
 There is no system of bail, but at the discretion of public security officials some
 detainees can be released pending further investigation. The authorities must notify
 
 
 620
 the detainee's family or work unit of his detention within 24 hours; in practice, how-
 ever, authorities seldom give timely notification. Under a sweeping exception to the
 law, officials need not provide notification if it would "hinder the investigation* of
 a case. The Government held dissident Liu Nianchun incommunicado for more than
 a year without charges before his wife was notified of his whereabouts and per-
 nutted to visit him in July. His suit contesting his detention was initially dismissed
 in mid-1996 for reasons that included the fact that his legal papers were written
 with a ballpoint pen, a minor detail usually overlooked in Chinese courts.
 The State Compensation Law provides a legal basis for citizens to recover dam-
 ages for illegal detentions. Although the majority of Chinese remain unaware of this
 1995 law, there is evidence that it is having some impact. The Chinese press re-
 ported several cases involving Guangdong and Fujian residents who sue7officials
 'or malfeasane and won daage awards. In Hebei a woman was awarded over
 $2,000 for wrongful detention.
 Amendments to the Criminal Procedures Law enacted by the National People's
 Congress in Mardi, and effective January 1, 1997, are designed to address some of
 the problems related to detention. During the year, the Government initiated efforts
 to educate the Chinese legal community on the nature and function of the new
 amendments. Human rights activists and legal scholars in China and abroad ac-
 knowledged the positive reforms introduced by the new law, but they noted that
 they do not fully bring Chinese criminal procedure practices into conformity with
 international standards and may be difficult to implement. The amendments do not
 apply retroactively.
 Because the Government tightly controls information, it is impossible to estimate
 accurately the total number of people subjected to new or continued arbitrary arrest
 or detention. Nevertheless, Procurator General Zhang Siqing reported in March to
 the NPC that during 1995 the Supreme Procuratorate investigated 4,627 illegal de-
 tention cases. These figures likely include illegal detentions of those involved in
 commercial disputes as well as those detained for other reasons. Local officials and
 business leaders frequently conspire to use detentions as a means of exerting pres-
 sure in commercial disputes. In June the Chief Procurator of Hebei province re-
 ported that 600 persons were rescued in 345 cases of illegal hostage-taking in 1995.
 Such incidents often involve commercial disputes. There were similar cases involv-
 ing detained foreign businessmen whose passports were confiscated during business
 diputes. Australian businessman James Peng, whom Chinese public security offi-
 cinskidnaped in Macau in 1994 and brought to China for trial, was tried in Novem-
 ber 1994 and sentenced to a lengthy prison term in September 1995. He remained
 imprisoned despite continued officia and unofficial appeals on his behalf.
 In practice, authorities often disregarded or circumvented limits on detention by
 using regulations on "taking in for shelter and investigation," "supervised resi-
 dence," and other methods not requiring procuratorial approval. According to Chi-
 nese legal experts, the new Criminal Procedures Law amendments are designed to
 eliminate taking in for shelter and investigation. Recent reforms do not affect the
 reeducation-through-labor system, which permits authorities to extrajudicially sen-
 tence detainees to terms as long as 3 years in labor camps. Liu Xiaobo was detained
 on October 8 and within hours sentenced to 3 years' reeducation through labor
 under this system. Numerous other dissidents, including Liu Nianchun, Zhou
 Guoqiang, Bishop Zeng Jingmu, Chen Longde, Zhang Lin, and Bao Ge were held
 in reeducation-through-labor camps in 1996.
 Authorities detained political and labor activists without cause at "sensitive"
 times during the year and also used parle regulations to control their activities.
 Guangzhou authorities detained dissident Wang Xizhe for 15 days in June, osten-
 siby because he violated his parole by attending a family dinner in an area outside
 City. (Wang fled the ountry in October, see also Section 2.d.) Wang's
 arrest coincided with the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations. At
 the height of a period of increased political tension in mid-1996 between China and
 Japan regarding sovereignty over the Diayu/Senkaku islands, the Government
 forced longtime anti-Japanese activist Tong Zeng to depart Beijing for a 2-week trip
 to Gansu province.
 The Government continued to impose restrictions on reentry into China by dis-
 sidents and activists (see Section 2.d.). There were no reports of the Government
 forcibly exiling citizens.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-According to the Constitution, the court system
 is equal in authority to the State Council and the Central Military Commission, the
 two most important government institutions. All three organs are nominally under
 the supervision of the NPC. Officials state that China's judiciary is independent but
 acknowledge that it is subject to the Communist Party's polic guidance. All of these
 state organs are given policy direction by the high-level Party Political and Legal
 
 
 621
 Commission. Party and government leaders use a variety of means to direct the
 courts on verdicts and sentences. Corruption and conflicts of interest also affect judi-
 cial decisionmaking. Supreme Court President Ren Jianxin reported in March to the
 NPC that in 1995 the judiciary cited some 962 court staff members for violations
 of discipline and law, and 61 judicial officers received criminal penalties.
 The Supreme People's Court stands at the apex of the court system, followed in
 descending order by the higher, intermediate, and basic people's courts. Judges are
 appointed by the people's congresses at the corresponding level. There are special
 courts for handling military, maritime, and railway transport cases.
 In February 1995, the NPC passed three new laws designed to professionalize
 judges, prosecutors, and policemen; the laws came into effect in July 1995.
 In May the NPC passed a new lawyers' law designed to professionalize the legal
 profession. The law replaced temporary regulations adopted in 1980, 1 year after
 China permitted lawyers to resume the practice of law following a 20-year period
 when the practice of law was prohibited. The new law recognized for the first time
 that lawyers represent their clients, not the State. The bill also granted lawyers for-
 mal permission to establish private law firms, established educational requirements
 for legal practitioners, encouraged free legal services for the general public, and pro-
 vided for the discipline of lawyers.
 Officials often ignore the due process provisions of the law and of the Constitu-
 tion. Both before and after trial, authorities subject prisoners to severe psychological
 pressure to confess. Defendants who fail to "show the right attitude" by confessing
 their crimes are typically sentenced more harshly. Criminal trials remain essen-
 tially sentencing hearings, despite official denials. Confessions without corroborating
 evidence are insufficient for a conviction under law, but coerced confessions are fre-
 qently introduced into evidence. International observers were especially concerned
 that the Government's "strike hard" anticrime campaign, which extended through-
 out most of the year, further encouraged law enforcement personnel to arrest, con-
 vict and punish suspects without according full due process rights.
 Under the 1979 Criminal Procedure Law, which was in effect in 1996, the authori-
 ties give accused persons virtually no opportunity toprepare an adequate defense
 while their cases are being investigated, the phase during which the question of
 guilt or innocence is essentially decided. The law provides that defense lawyers may
 be retained no earlier than 7 days before the trial. However, in some cases even
 this brief period is shortened under regulations issued in 1983 to accelerate the ad-
 judication of certain serious criminal cases. Under the law, there is no requirement
 that the court appoint a defense attorney for the defendant unless the defendant
 is hearing impaired or a minor, although the court may appoint defense counsel if
 it feels an attorney is necessary. When attorneys do appear, they have little time
 to prepare a defense and rarely contest guilt; their function is generally confined
 to requesting clemency. The conviction rate is over 90 percent. The court's permis-
 sion is required before the accused or his representative can interrogate witnesses,
 produce new witnesses, or review evidence.
 The Criminal Procedure Law requires that all trials be held in public, except
 those involving state secrets, juveniles, or "personal secrets." Under this provision,
 details of cases involving "counterrevolutionary" charges have frequently been kept
 secret, even from defendants' relatives. The 1988 Law on State Secrets affords a
 ready basis for denying a public trial. There is an appeals process, but appala en-
 erally do not reverse arbitrary or erroneous verdicts. Under the CriminalPrcedure
 Law, persons "exempted from prosecution" by procurators may still be deemed to
 have a criminal record, despite the lack of a judicial determination of guilt. Such
 provisions can be applied in counterrevolutionary crimes as well as for ordinary
 criminal offenses.
 Amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law, passed in March and effective Janu-
 ary 1997, are designed to encourage adversarial criminal proceedings and thereby
 change the traditional practice of holding trials that have essentially been sentenc-
 ing hearings. The amendments state that criminal suspects may, after being first
 interrogated by an investigative organ or from the day coercive measures are first
 taken, retain a lawyer to offer legal advice. Defense attorneys may conduct limited
 investigations, call defense witnesses, and argue their clients cases in open court.
 Moreover, courts are prohibited from treating suspects as criminals until they are
 convicted. Coerced confessions are expressly forbidden. The "exempted from prosecu-
 tion" provision is barred. Throughout 1996 scholars and government officials took
 steps to educate legal, procuratorate, and court personnel about these amendments.
 Government officials state that China has an insufficient number of lawyers to
 meet the country's growing needs. A key element in Justice Ministry efforts to en-
 courage legal reform is a plan to have 150,000 lawyers, 30,000 notaries, and 40,000
 grassroots legal service centers by the year 2000. Minister of Justice Xiao Yang stat-
 
 
 ed in January that China currently has 89,000 lawyers, 16,548 notarial personnel,
 and more than 100,000 grassroots legal service workers. China has more than 7,200
 law firms including 73 foreign law offices. In many cities, lawyers are organizing
 private law firms outside the framework of established government legal offices.
 These firms are self-regulating and do not have their personnel or budgets deter-
 mined directly by the State. A foreign press report quoted Justice Ministry officials
 as stating that there were approximately 1,000 such firms in early 1995. Only a
 small percentage of lawyers practice criminal law. Political dissidents have fre-
 quently found it difficult to find an attorney willing to handle the most sensitive
 political cases. One explanation for the problem is that authorities have retaliated
 in the past by revoking the legal licenses of lawyers representing such defendants.
 Like other citizens, many defense lawyers still depend on an official work unit for
 employment, housing, and other benefits. Some lawyers are therefore reluctant to
 be seen as overzealous in re presenting certain defendants.
 The impact of the lack of due process is particularly egregious in death penalty
 cases. China's 1979 Criminal Code contained 26 crimes punishable by death; 1995
 legislation raised this number to 65, including financial crimes such as counterfeit-
 ing currency, passing fake negotiable notes and letters of credit, and illegal "pooling"
 of funds. In May the Supreme Court called for wider use of capital punishment, in-
 cluding in the case of crimes that result in death. It stated that persons whose
 crimes result in death should be punished by death regardless of extenuating cir-
 cumstances or lack of a prior criminal record. National figures on the number of
 executions are not available, but in 1996 it has been estimated that several thou-
 sand executions were carried out. The Chinese press confirms that large numbers
 of speedy executions were carried out in 1996 as part of the "Strike-Hard" national
 anticrime campaign. A high court nominally reviews all death sentences, but the
 time between arrest and execution is often a matter of days, and reviews have con-
 sistently resulted in a confirmation of sentence. In June the Jilin Provincial Court
 held a news conference to report that, during a crackdown on crime in the preceding
 month, provincial authorities held 46 public rallies to "sternly and rapidly" sentence
 serious criminals. Defendants sentenced included three persons who were caught,
 tried, and executed within 10 days after they allegedly looted a car, and within 7
 days of their arrest. In February the Shanghai Municipal No. 1 Intermediate Court
 held three separate rallies within 2 days to sentence and execute 18 criminals found
 guilty of murder, robbery, or other crimes. No executions for political offenses are
 known to have occurred in 1996.
 In recent years, credible reports have alleged that organs from some executed
 prisoners are removed and transplanted. Officials have confirmed that executed
 prisoners are among the sources of organs for transplant. There is no national legis-
 lation governing organ donations, but officials assert that consent is required from
 prisoners or their relatives before organs are removed.
 Only courts can sentence prisoners to facilities managed by the criminal justice
 system. Justice Ministry statistics issued in January 1995 showed that China has
 imprisoned and released approximately 10 million prisoners since 1949; there were
 1,285,000 prisoners in prisons or reform-through-labor camps at the end of 1994.
 Government authorities can, however, assign persons accused of "minor" public
 order offenses to reeducation-through-labor camps in an extrajudicial process. Terms
 of detention run from a normal minimum of 1 year to a maximum of 3 years. The
 labor reeducation committee, which determines the term of detention, may extend
 an inmate's sentence for an additional year. According to prison officials, 200,000
 detainees were in reeducation-through-labor facilities at the end of 1995, up from
 153,000 at the end of 1993. Other estimates of the number of such inmates are con-
 siderably higher.
 Since 1990 defendants have been able to challenge reeducation-through-labor sen-
 tences under the Administrative Procedure Law. While some personshave gained
 a reduction in or suspension of their sentences after reconsideration or appeal, in
 practice these procedures are not widely used, and such problems as short appeal
 times and lack of access to lawyers weaken their effectiveness in preventing or re-
 versing arbitrary decisions. Liu Nianchun unsuccessfully appealed the reeducation-
 through-labor sentence that he received in mid-1996. Irregular appellate procedures
 in his case included inadequate notice of the hearing and insufficient time and re-
 sources to prepare the appeal.
 Government officials deny that China holds any political prisoners, asserting that
 authorities detain persons not for the political or religious views they hold, but be-
 cause they have taken some action that violates the Criminal Law. However, the
 authorities continue to confine citizens for political reasons. Perhaps thousands of
 political prisoners remain imprisoned or detained.
 
 
 Political dissidents are often detained or charged with having committed
 counterrevolutionary crimes under Articles 90 through 104 of the Criminal Law.
 Counterrevolutionary offenses range from treason and espionage to spreading
 counterrevolutionary propaganda. The authorities have also used these articles to
 punish persons who organized demonstrations, disrupted traffic, disclosed official in-
 formation to foreigners, or formed associations outside of state control. Efforts are
 under way, through revisions to the Criminal Law, to redefine counterrevolutionary
 offenses as treasonous acts designed to threaten national security, but it is not clear
 whether such a change would make a significant difference in how political cases
 are treated. Labor rights activists Li Wenming and Guo Baosheng, who were ar-
 rested in May and June of 1994 on the charge of "counterrevolutionary propaganda
 and incitement," were tried and found guilty in November on the more serious
 charge of 'conspiracy" to subvert the Government for spreading information among
 workers about their rights. By years end, they had not been sentenced. Of the 12
 others who were indicted with Li and Guo, 2 have been sentenced to 1-year terms
 of reeducation through labor, 2 are being tried in Beijing, and the rest were re-
 leased.
 In January 1995, a Justice Ministry official said that there were 2,678 people
 serving sentences for counterrevolutionary crimes at the end of 1994. These figures
 include people convicted of espionage or other internationally recognized criminal of-
 fenses, but they do not include political prisoners detained but not charged; political
 or religious activists held in reeducation-through-labor camps; and persons detained
 or convicted for criminal offenses solely involving nonviolent political or religious ac-
 tivities.
 The 1988 Law on State Secrets provides justification for denying a public trial.
 Details regarding cases falling under this provision are frequently kept secret, even
 from defendants relatives. At least 14 persons were imprisoned on state secrets"
 charges in 1996. In May, after being detained for exactly 1 year, dissident Li Hai
 was tried for stealing unspecified state secrets. Li's family was not permitted to at-
 tend the trial. In December authorities announced Li had been convicted and sen-
 tenced to a 9-year prison term for "prying into and gathering the following informa-
 tion about people sentenced for criminal activities during the June 4, 1989 period:
 name, age, family situation, crime, length of sentence, location of imprisonment,
 treatment while imprisoned." The verdict stated that these data constitute state se-
 crets.
 The Government released certain prisoners detained for their political or religious
 beliefs, including Ren Wanding, Fu Shenqi, and Zhang Xianliang. Fu and Zhang de-
 parted China in September. Others were released and then detained again. Tong
 Yi was released in June after serving her full sentence but was briefly detained
 :aain shortly thereafter for traveling without official authorization. Bao Tong was
 so released from prison in May but remained held in custody in a government fa-
 cility at year's end (see Section 1.c.). Liu Xiaobo was released in January but was
 rearrested on October 7 and administratively sentenced to a 3-year term of reeduca-
 tion through labor the next day. Many others, including Wei Jingsheng, Xi Yang,
 Hu Shigen, Kang Yuchun, Li Jingsheng, Jampa Ngodrup, and Ngawang
 Phulchung remained imprisoned or under other forms of detention during the year.
 Ngawang Sangdrl, a 19-year-old Tibetan nun serving a 9-year sentence for taking
 part in a proindependence demonstration and for singing nationalistic songs in pris-
 on had her sentence doubled in July (see Tibet addendum).
 The Government subjects many prisoners-including political prisoners-to "dep-
 rivation of political rights' even after they have served their sentences. This status
 explicitly limits rights of free speech and association. Former prisoners often find
 their status in society, ability to find employment, freedom to travel, and access to
 social services severely restricted. Economic reform and social change have amelio-
 rated these problems for nonpolitical prisoners to some extent in recent years.
 Former political prisoners and their families, however, are frequently subjected to
 police surveillance and harassment and also may encounter difficulty in obtaining
 or keeping employment and housing. Dissident Li Gang cited constant police har-
 assment, his inability to work, rent an apartment, or accept help from friends as
 reasons for his decision to flee China in April and seek resettlement abroad. Govern-
 ment harassment has prevented relatives of Chen Ziming, Liu Nianchun, Qin
 Yongmin, and other dissidents from obtaining and keeping steady employment.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Eco-
 nomie liberalization is creating diverse employment opportunities and introducing
 market forces into the economy, thus loosening governmental monitoring and regu-
 lation of personal and family life, particularly in rural areas. In urban areas, how-
 ever, most people still depend on their government-linked work unit for housing,
 permission to have a child, approval to apply for a passport, and other aspects of
 
 
 624
 ordinary life. The work unit, along with the neighborhood committee, are charged
 with monitoring activities and attitudes, although these institutions have become
 less important as means of social or political control in urban areas.
 Although the law requires search warrants before security forces can search prem-
 ises, this provision is often ignored in practice. In addition the Public Security Bu-
 reau and the Procuratorate issue warrants on their own authority.
 The 1982 Constitution states that "freedom and privacy of correspondence of citi-
 zens are protected by law." In practice, however, authorities frequently monitor tele-
 phone conversations, fax transmissions, electronic mail, and Internet communica-
 tions of foreign visitors, businessmen, diplomats, residents, and journalists as well
 as Chinese dissidents, activists and others. Authorities also open and censor domes-
 tic and international mail. In March Procurator General Zhang Siqing reported to
 the National People's Congress that in 1995 the Supreme People's Procuratorate in-
 vestigated 1,739 cases of illegal searches of residences or surveillance and 87 cases
 of hindering postal and telecommunications and encroaching on freedom of commu-
 nications. Government security organs monitor and sometimes restrict contact be-
 tween foreigners and citizens, particularly dissidents. Rules implementing the State
 Security Law define as a violation of the law "activities of individuals outside the
 country (including non-Chinese citizens resident in China) who disregard dissuasion
 and meet with personnel in the country who have endangered state security or who
 are seriously suspected of endangering state security."
 The Government encouraged expansion of Internet and other communications in-
 frastructure. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications licensed more than 20
 companies as "agents" authorized to offer Internet access, and access is becoming
 easier. There are no reliable statistics on the number of Chinese Internet users, but
 the number in Beijing alone is thought to exceed 10,000. Nevertheless, authorities
 dedicated increased attention and resources to efforts to control Internet content
 and usage. In January authorities issued regulations requiring Internet users to
 register and sign a vaguely worded pledge not to use the Internet to endanger secu-
 rity. In September the Government blocked access to more than 100 news sites on
 the World Wide Web, including many Chinese language sites in Hong Kong and Tai-
 wan and the sites of major Western news organizations. Sites hosted by dissidents
 were also blocked. During the year, China's Ministry of State Security was tasked
 with controlling material on line. Regulations allegedly adopted to preserve public
 security were used to implement Internet censorship.
 In April the Government issued regulations requiring foreign wire service provid-
 ers of economic information and financial market data to register, pay substantial
 fees, and face penalties for the transmission of information deemed "harmful to Chi-
 nese national interests." Providers were further required to provide equipment al-
 lowing Chinese authorities to simultaneously monitor information provided to cus-
 tomers. All operations, customers, and contracts also were subject to government
 preapprval. Foreign wire services in China strongly protested and began discus-
 sions with the authorities to resolve concerns over the nature and scope of the new
 regulations. No foreign wire service had completed registration procedures by the
 end of the year.
 The authorities continue to jam Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts, but the effec-
 tiveness of this interference varies considerably by region, with audible signals of
 VOA and other broadcasters reaching most parts of China, including the capital.
 The British Broadcasting Corporation monitoring service noticed in May that the
 government-owned China Radio International (CRI) was using English-language
 programming purchased from an Australian entertainment company to jam the
 "oice of Tibet, a Tibetan dissident radio station which is produced outside China.
 Radio Free Asia began operation in Chinese in September and in Tibetan in De-
 cember. Reception has been good to fair, and there are no reports of jamming.
 The Government continued to implement comprehensive and highly intrusive one-
 child family planning policies first adopted in the late 1970's. The State Family
 Planning Commission formulates and implements government policies with assist-
 ance from the Family Planning Association, which has 83 million members in 1.02
 million branches. China's population policy most heavily affects ethnic Han Chinese
 in urban areas. Urban couples seldom obtain permission to have a second child. Ex-
 ceptions are allowed for many of the 70 percent of Han who live in rural areas, and
 ethnic minorities are subject to less stringent population controls. In special cir-
 cumstances, minorities in some rural areas are permitted to have as many as four
 children.
 Population control policy relies on education, propaganda, and economic incen-
 tives, as well as on more coercive measures, including psychological pressure and
 economic penalties. Rewards for couples who adhere to the policy include monthly
 stipends and preferential medical and educational benefits. Disciplinary measures
 
 
 625
 against those who violate the policy include fines, withholding of social services, de-
 motion, and other administrative punishments that sometimes result in loss of em-
 ployment. Penalties for excess births can be levied against local officials and the
 mothers' work units providing multiple sources of pressure. Fines for giving birth
 without authorization vary, but they can be a formidable disincentive. In Fujian, for
 example, the standard fine has been calculated to be twice a family's gross annual
 income or twice the calculated average income of rural families with no quantifiable
 cash income; additional, unauthorized births incur fines assessed in increments of
 50 percent per child. In Guangzhou the standard fine is calculated to be 30 to 50
 percent of 7 years' income for the average resident. Unpaid fines have sometimes
 resulted in confiscation or destruction of personal property. There were also reports
 that teams of village officials expelled women and their families from their homes
 and then destroyed the houses. According to a 1995 government white paper, more
 than 200 million married couples of childbearing age, or about 80 percent of all cou-
 ples in that age group, use contraception. The Government does not authorize the
 use of force to compel persons to submit to abortion or sterilization, but officials ac-
 knowledge that there are instances of forced abortions and sterilizations. Officials
 maintain that, when discovered, the responsible officials are disciplined and undergo
 retraining, but they have not provided any data or examples to verify this assertion.
 Officials admit, however, that more severe punishment is rare. The State Family
 Planning Commission has limited ability to punish lower level offenders. Individuals
 can sue officials who have exceeded their authority in implementing family planning
 policy, but there are no known successful suits on these grounds.
 Poor supervision of local officials who are under intense pressure to meet family
 planning targets results in instances of abuse, including forced abortion and ster-
 lization. During an unauthorized pregnancy, often a woman is visited by family
 planning agents and pressured to temiate the pregnancy. There were credible re-
 ports that several women were forced to undergo abortions of unauthorized preg-
 nancies in Fujian. The press sometimes reports instances of abuse. For example, a
 newspaper in Shenyang reported that family planning agents convinced a woman,
 7-months pregnant, to take "appropriate measures." Awell-documented incident of
 a 1994 forced 8-month abortion has been reported in the coastal province of
 Guangdong. A 1995 incident involving a forced sterilization was also reported in
 Guangwhou.
 Regulations forbid the termination of pregnancies based on the sex of the fetus,
 but because of the traditional preference for male children, particularly in rural
 areas, some families have used ultrasound to identify female fetuses. Use of
 ultrasound for this purpose is specifically prohibited by the new Maternal and Child
 Health Care Law, which calls for punishment of medical practitioners who violate
 this provision. According to the State Family Planning Commission, a handful of
 doctors have been charged under this law. The Chinese press has reported that the
 national ratio of male to female births is 114 to 100. One October 1994 survey of
 births in rural areas put the ratio as high as 117 male births to 100 female. The
 statstical norm is 106 male births to 100 female. Official statistics may exclude
 many female births, especially the second or third in a family. Such births are unre-
 ported so that the parents can keep trying to conceive a by. These statistics also
 probably reflect, however, the abuse of seonography and the termination of preg-
 nancies based on the sex of the fetus. Female infanticide or neglect of baby girls
 may also be a factor in some areas.
 The Maternal and Child Care Law, which came into effect in June 1995, calls for
 premarital and prenatal examinations to determine whether couples have acute in-
 fGctious diseases, certain mental illnesses (not including mental retardation), or are
 at risk for passing on debilitating genetic diseases. The Ministry of Health, not the
 State Family Planning Commission, implements the law, which mandates abortion
 or sterilization in some cases, based on medical advice. The law also provides for
 obtaining a second opinion and states that patients or their guardians must give
 written consent to procedures (see also Section 5). At least five provincial govern-
 ments have implemented regulations seeking to prevent people with severe mental
 disabilities from having children.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and thess.-Although the Constitution states that freedom
 of speech and freedom of the press are fundamental rights enmjaed by all citizens,
 the Government interprets the Communist Party's "leading role as circumscribing
 these rights. It does not permit citizens to publish or broadcast criticism of senior
 leaders or opinions that contradict basic Communist Party doctrine providing for a
 Socialist state under the party's leadership. During the year the Government and
 party further intensified control over expression of unauthorized political views. The
 
 
 formal charges brought against dissident and prodemocracy advocate Wang Dan
 were based on public criticisms of the Government. These criticisms together with
 his publication of articles and his activities in support of democracy advocates re-
 sulted in his November conviction and sentence to 11 years in prison, a much harsh-
 er sentence than he received for his prodemocracy activities in 1989. The case was
 not reported in the Chinese language press. Liu Nianchun, who was denied permis-
 sion in 1994 to register the Association for Protection of Labor Rights, was sen-
 tenced in July to 3 years' reeducation through labor after having been held in deten-
 tion since his 1995 arrest for involvement with a prodemocracy petition drive (see
 Section 1.d.).
 The party and the Government continue to control print and broadcast media and
 compel them to propagate the current ideological line. All media employees are
 under explicit, public orders to follow CCP directives, and to "guide public opinion"
 as directed by political authorities. This greatly restricts the freedom of newspapers
 and broadcast journalists to report the news. Both formal and informal press guide-
 lines continued to require reporters to avoid coverage of sensitive subjects and to
 protect "state secrets.  Under the State Security Law, state secrets are broadly de-
 fined, and interpretation of the law is left to the Ministries of State Security and
 Public Securit.
 In June authorities fired the director of the Beijing Youth Daily after the news-
 paper printed a factual story about the poisoning deaths of three children who
 drank "Wahaha," a popular beverage produced by a state-owned enterprise. The
 Party Propaganda Department also forced all those involved with publishing the ar-
 ticle to engag in self-criticism, a move that highlighted the absence of laws protect-
 ing journalists and consumers. After the fall Comunist Party plenum the Propa-
 ganda Department reportedly issued a directive forbidding the publication of nega-
 tive stories, including any major cases of corruption and unrest. It also censored sev-
 eral authors and called for strict supervision over articles on the reversion of Hong
 Kong. Shanghai customs officials impounded the May 21 editions of the Inter-
 national Herald Tribune and the Asian Wall Street Journal because they carried re-
 ports and pictures of the Lee Teng-hui inauguration in Taiwan. Shanghai officials
 also expugted foreign English-language newspapers and clamped down on "Hong
 Kong" style political magazines. Government regulators permit transmission of
 Hong Kong television broadcasts to Guangzhou but occasionally censor program con-
 tent.
 A Western press report stated that 38 newspapers have been shut down since
 1994 either due to poor management or "plitical prblems." According to reports
 other papers and magazines have been shut down for publishing sensitive articles
 on the plight of state farms, the cultural revolution, and-debates on Deng Xiaoping's
 reform program.
 Articles published by foreign journalists are monitored. The Government has
 withheld visas from journalists who have written stories critical of China. Foreign
 journalists working in China have also been subjected to surveillance and, on occa-
 sion, harassment. French journaist Christine Ockrent, who visited China in July,
 was prevented from meeting with any Chinese dissidents and was under surveil-
 lance by a team of more than 10 plainclothes officials.
 Despite these government controls, uncontrolled information about the nation is
 flowinginto China at an increasing rate. Residents in Guangdong and other parts
 of southnern China have access to Hong Kong television progas and newspapers.
 Throughout China, a lively tabloid sector continues to flourish. Radio talk shows re-
 main popular, and, while generally avoiding politically sensitive subjects, they pro-
 vide opportunities for citizens to air grievances about public issues. Despite licens-
 ing requirements, a small but rapidly growing segment of the population has access
 to satellite television broadcasts and most sites on the Internet. Most citizens have
 the means to own and use shortwave radios, and the Government does not place
 any restrictions on their use.
 Fiec competition and dwindling government subsidies have increased opportuni-
 ties for private publishers and bookselers, but the Government moved to tighten
 its control over the production and dissemination of publications during the year.
 In 1995 the China Press and Publications Administration announced that it would
 limit the number of books published by controlling book registration numbers issued
 to officially approved publishing houses. Despite this effort, books continued to be
 published through unsanctioned channels.
 Fear of government retaliation limited artistic freedom of expression. Security
 personnel have effectively eliminated an artist community near Beijing University
 at Yuanmingyuan through harassment and arrests. The crackdown, which began in
 1995, appeared to be the result of official irritation over the artists' antigovernment
 vieWs.
 
 
 627
 The Government has continued to impose heavy ideological controls on political
 discourse at colleges, universities, and research institutes. In September, for exam-
 ple, authorities closed computer bulletin boards at universities in Beijing when stu-
 dents began using the Internet to urge government action in defense of Chinese sov-
 ereignty claims over the Diaoyu/enkku islands. As a result of official controls,
 many intellectuals and scholars, fearing that books or  aprs on political topics
 would be deemed too sensitive to be published, feel compelled to exercise self-censor-
 ship. In areas such as economic policy or legal reform, there was far greater official
 tolerance for comment and debate.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assodlion.-While the Constitution has
 provisions for freedom of peaceful assembly and association, the Government se-
 verely restricts these rights in practice. The Constitution provides, for example, that
 such activities may not infringe upon the "interests of the State." Protests against
 the political system or its leaders are prohibited.
 Authorities deny  rmits and quickly move to suppress demonstrations involvin
 expression of dissident political views. On the June 4 anniversary of the 1989
 Tiananmen crackdown, police arrested a woman who attem pted to commemorate
 the event by leaving flowers at the Memorial to People's Heroes in Tiananmen
 Square. In June authorities in Shanghai prevented a Greenpeace ship on an anti-
 nuclear mission from calling at the port. In September a group of students from sev-
 eral Beijing universities were detained for attempting to stage a demonstration out-
 side the Japanese Embassy. The Government tolerates some small-scale demonstra-
 tions about nonpolitical grievances, and unauthorized protests on nonpolitical sub-
 jects are not automatically disrupted. In July some 200 Beijing residents prtested
 in front of the Beijing Municipal Office the Government's failure to provide prom-
 ised housing and to pay owed factoiy wages. Police did not interfere with the pro-
 test, but no government officials agreed to the group's request for a meeting to dis-
 cuss its concerns. Such incidents were not uncommon in Beijing and other areas
 during the year.
 The Communist Party organizes and controls most professional and social associa-
 tions. Regulations require all organizations to be officially registered and approved.
 Authorities can detain violators for up to 15 days and impose fines up to $23
 (RMB200). Ostensibly aimed at secret societies and criminal gangs, the regulations
 also deter the formation of unauthorized political, religious, or labor organizations.
 Political activists including Liu Nianchun and Yang Zhou, were denied permission
 to regster their labor and human rights associations.
 IndMarch the Government cited the organizers' failure to preregister with authori-
 ties to justify a Beijing poice raid of a charity banquet to raise fundsfor Chinese
 orphans. The police initially demanded that the event be canceled but relented when
 the orga  Bers aeed to separate guests into subrups, to cancel speeches by
 scheduled speakers, remove banners, and do no fun     otsing. The 447 guests in at-
 tendance included Chinese officials, foreign ambassadors, and foreign business lead-
 ers, journalists, and teachers.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Although the Constitution affirms toleration of religious
 beliefs, the Government seeks to restrict all religious practice to closely controlled
 and government-sanctioned religious organizations and registered places of worship.
 At the annual national religious affairs conference in January religious policy was
 "readjusted    n to emphasize harder line aspects. During the year many religious
 groups were subjected to increased restrictions although the degree of restriction
 varied significantly in different regions of China. Despite these increased restric-
 tions, the number of religious adherents continues to grow. The annual conference
 gave special attention to appointing a new generation of party loyalists to lead the
 work of official religious bdies and to the issue of registering unofficial religious
 groups.
 Although there is no legislation governing religious affairs, State Council regula-
 tions require all religious groups to register with government religious affairs bu-
 reaus and come under the supervision of official "patriotic" religious organizations.
 In 1996 some groups registered while others were refused registration. Many, how-
 ever, have been reluctant to comply out of principled opposition to state control of
 religion or for fear of adverse consequences if they reveal, as required, the names
 and addresses of members and details about leadership activities, finances, and con-
 tacts in China or abroad. The campaign to shut down unauthorized groupsis in the
 hands of the police and religious affairs officials and is being conducted concurrently
 with  other police  actions  against criminals and   underground   separatists,
 prodemocracy, and labor groups. The national goal for 1996 was to register or close
 down all unregistered religious groups.
 In 1996 police closed dozens of "undergreound mosques, temples, and seminaries
 and hundreds of Protestant "house church groups, many with significant member-
 
 
 ships, properties, financial resources, and networks. Leaders of such groups, includ-
 itinerant teachers and evangelists, increasingly have been detained or lengthy
 investi~atian. Ther are NGO reports of deaths of detainees by beating. Some con-
 regtons have been hit with heavy fnes. In Shanghai, home of the patriotic
 Prtsatheadquarters, authorities have been particularly tough.
 Official Chinese media carried warnings of the "threat of reigious infiltration." In
 August the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily said that "hostile inter-
 national forces resort to ethnic and religious issues to 'Westernize' and 'split' Social-
 ist countries and step up religious infiltration." The publication also quoted a senior
 Communist official as saying that religion had "interfered in government adminis-
 tration, judicial matters, education, and marriages."
 The State Council's Religious Affairs Bureau and the CCP United Front Work De-
 partment, which are staffed by officials who rarely are religious adherents, provide
 guidance and supervision" over implementation of government regulations on reli-
 gion and on the role of foreigners n religious activity. Communist Party officials
 state that party membership and religious belief are incompatible. This places a se-
 rious limitation on religious-believers, since party membership is required for almost
 all high-level positions in government and state-owned businesses. According to a
 1995 government survey, 20 percent of Communist Party members engage in some
 form of religious activity. In January 1995, the CCP circulated a document to party
 organizations at the provincial level ordering expulsion of party members belonging
 to open or clandestine religious organizations. In November the People's Liberation
 Army Daily's report on military "spiritual civilization" stated that it is necessary
 to conduct education in atheism so that they (the military) believe in science and
 oppose superstition. Participation in religious activities is forbidden."
 After forcefully suppressing all religious observances and closing all seminaries
 during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, the Government began in the late 1970's
 to restore or replace damaged or confiscated churches, temples, mosques, and mon-
 asteries and allowed seminaries to reopen. According to the Government, there are
 now 68,000 religious sites in China and 48 religious colleges. The Government also
 adopted a policy of returning confiscated church property. Implementation of this
 policy has varied from locality to locality. The official religious organizations admin-
 ister local Bible schools, more than a dozen Catholic and Protestant seminaries,
 nine institutes to train mama and Islamic scholars, and institutes to train Buddhist
 monks. Students who attend these institutes must demonstrate "political reliabil-
 ity," and all graduates must p ass an examination on their theologic al and poitical
 knowledge to qualify for the clergy. The Government permitted some Catholic semi-
 narians, Muslim clerics, and Buddhist clergy to go abroad for additional religious
 studies in 1996. Unofficial churches, however, have significant problems traiing
 Te     authorities permit officially sanctioned religious organizations to maintain
 international contacts as long as these do not entail foreign control. The January
 1994 regulations codified many existing rules involving foreigners, including a ban
 on proselytizing by foreigners, but allow foreign nationals to p each to foreigners,
 bring in religious materials for their own use, and preach to Chinese at churches,
 mosques, and temples at the invitation of registered religious organizations. Chinese
 authorities strictly enforced the 1994 regulations in several cities. Some regularly
 scheduled expatriate religious services were shut down by police, who asserted that
 the meetings did not comply with regulations that require registration of religious
 gatherings.Meetings were subsequently allowed to resume in some cases.
 Buddhists make up the largest body of religious believers in China. The Govern-
 ment estimates that there are 100 million Buddhists, most of whom are from the
 dominant Han ethnic group. The Government says that there are 9,500 Buddhist
 temples and monasteries in China and more than 170,000 nuns and monks. Some
 local authorities have called for controls on Buddhist places of worship, especially
 newly established sites. The Zhejiang provincial government, for example, said that
 from April to June, 17,900 shrines and churches, which had been illegally erected,
 had been "rectified" which can mean destroyed, registered, or transferred to another
 group. Religious shrines in other areas of China were also destroyed. In November
 the Guanming Daily reported that 1,600 "pagan shrines" were destroyed in Hubei
 province i a nationwide crackdown on superstition. The newspaper repo red that
 the shrines covered approximately 35 acres of land and cost approximately $700,000
 to construct. The Guansaming Daily reported that in November nine temples were
 closed in Guizhou prvince. in December Beijing Central Television reported that
 farmers had destroyed 400 temples and ancestral halls in Jiangxi province. The re-
 port stated that 200 new schools would be built on the land previously occupied by
 the temples. (A discussion of government restrictions on Tibetan Buddhism can be
 found in the addendum to this report.)
 
 
 629
 According to government figures, there are 17 million Muslims. In some areas
 with large Muslim populations, officials continue to restrict the building of mosques
 and the religious education of youths under the age of 18. Following unrest in 1990
 in Xinjiang, which has a large Muslim population, the authorities issued regulations
 further restricting religious activities and teaching. There were several reports of
 unrest in Xinjiang, prompting the leadership to issue statements on the need to con-
 trol religion there.    a trip to Xinjiang on September 11, Premier Li Peng said
 that relevant Chinese departments should "step up the control of religious a airs."
 Li also stated that China upholds freedom of religious belief, but added that religion
 "should serve the aims of socialism."
 Authorities in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, another province with a large
 Muslim population, issued regulations in July 1994, forbidding religious bodies from
 interfering in administrative affairs, inclung g education, marriage, and family plan-
 ning. China permits Muslim citizens to make the haji to Mecca, and the number
 of those making the pilgrimage has increased significantly in recent years.
 The number of Chnstians continues to    w rapidly. However, the Government
 permits only those Christian churches a  ted with either the Catholic Patriotic
 Association or the (Protestant) Three Self Patriotic Movement to operate openly. The
 Government established both organizations in the 1950's to eliminate perceived for-
 eign domination of local Christian groups.
 In some areas there is tacit cooperation between official and unofficial churches,
 but active, unofficial religious movements are viewed as posing a challenge as well
 as an alternative to the state-regulated churches. The unofficial, Vatican-affiliated
 Catholic Church claims a membership far larger than the 4 million persons reg-
 istered with the official Catholic Church, although actual figures are unknown.
 While government officials estimate that there are about 15 million Protestant wor-
 shipers in Chin~ other estimates indicate that there are at least 10 million people
 who belong to the official Protestant church, while perhaps 30 million worship pri-
 vately in house churches that are independent of government control. As a result
 of the increase in Protestant worshipers, there has been a corresponding demand
 for Bibles. This year, the Government supervised the publication of about 3 million
 Bibles--a two-fold increase over 1995.
 There was evidence that authorities in some areas, guided by national policy
 made strong efforts to crack down on the activities of the unapproved Catholic and
 Protestant movements. Local authorities have used threats, demolition of unregis-
 tered property, extortion of "fines," interrogation, detention, and reform-through-
 education sentences. Unofficial religious groups have been hard hit in Beijing and
 nearby provinces of Henan, where there are rapidly, growing numbers of unregis-
 tered Protestants, and Hebei, a center of unregistered Catholics. In Henan police
 closed down several hundred house churches that were part of a nationwide network
 claiming 10 million members affiliated with Xu Yongzhe, a religious leader who has
 been subjected to decades of persecution, including detention and imprisonment. In
 Hebei repression focused on the location of an annual spring pilgrmage to Donglu
 that was banned this year after attracting 10,000 unofficial Catholics in 1995.
 Heboi's underground church seminary was also closed down.
 In Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian, police reportedly raided underground masses,
 destroyed altars, confiscated books, roughed up congregations, and detained some
 worshipers. During November, according to credible reports, approximately 80 un-
 derground Catholics from Linchuan, Jiangxi province, were arrested without war-
 rants, beaten, and jailed. One source reported that several unofficial priests "dis-
 appeared" in Shanghai and Hebei.
 A Western news report said that Chinese authorities in Fujian refused in August
 to provide medical care for 76-year-old Catholic Bishop Zeng Jingmu, who had con-
 tracted pneumonia. Zeng has been detained since March for holding illegal church
 services in his home. In May Beijing police detained Fu Xiqiu and his wife, Cai
 Bochun, for their work in establishing a Christian training center near Beijing. The
 couple were released in July, apparently after police could not find any evidence
 against them, but they were kept under close surveillance and lost their employ-
 ment and housing.
 Nonmainstream sects are often singled out for particularly heavy-handed treat-
 ment. In 1996 police continued to put pressure on an underground evangelical sect
 called the "Shouters. The Shouters sect has been deemed counterrevolutionary by
 the Government, and its members have been repeatedly detained, fined, and impris-
 oned since its establishment over 16 years ago.In August authorities arrested well-
 known writer Bei Cun, along with 39 others in Fujian Province, for seeking converts
 to the outlawed sect. In February Public Security Bureau officers in Fujian detained
 Zhang Ruiyu, a member of the New Testament Church, and in March arrested
 church member Cai Lifen.
 
 
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The effectiveness of the Government's identification card system, used
 to control and restrict the location of individual residences within China, continued
 to erode. Estimates of the "floating population" of economic migrants leaving their
 home areas to seek work elsewhere in China range from tens of millions to as many
 as 100 million. This itinerant population enjoys increased economic opportunities
 but lacks official residence status which provides full access to social services and
 education. Unless they obtain resident status, they must pay a premium for these
 services.
 Authorities have denied some former inmates permission, under the "staying at
 prison employment" system, to return to their homes, a provision applicable to re-
 cidivists incarcerated in reform-through-labor camps. Those inmates sentenced to
 more than 5 years in reeducation-through-labor camps also may lose their legal
 right to return home. For those assigned to camps far from their residences, this
 constitutes a form of internal exile. The number of prisoners subject to this restric-
 tion is unknown. Authorities have reportedly forced others to accept jobs in state
 enterprises where they can be more closely supervised after their release from pris-
 on or detention.
 Other released or paroled prisoners returned home but were not permitted free-
 dom of movement. Chen Ziming, who was paroled on medical grounds in November,
 is confined to his home except for police-escorted visits to doctors. Bao Tong has
 been held in custody at a government facility in Beijing since his May release from
 Qincheng prison upon completion of his sentence (see also Sections 1.c. and i.e.).
 The Government routinely permits legal emigration and most foreign travel. In
 November the Government announced streamlined and standardized procedures for
 Chinese citizens to obtain exit permits. In September dissident Zhang Xianliang de-
 parted China after his release from prison earlier in the year. In the same month,
 authorities issued a passport to the father of Tiananmen activist Chai Ling but re-
 portedly denied the passport application of Guangzhou dissident Wang Xizhe. Wang
 fled China in October (see Section 1.d.). Some have reported that their passports
 have been held by the Ministry of State Security.
 Students wishing to go abroad still routinely were able to obtain passports. Per.
 mission for couples to travel abroad was sometimes conditioned on agreement to
 delay childbirth; noncompliance triggered fines for the couple or their work unit.
 The Government continued to use political attitudes as a major criterion in selecting
 people for government-sponsored study abroad, but it did not simiariy control pri-
 vately sponsored students, who currently constitute the majority of students study-
 ing abroad. The Government continued efforts to attract persons who have studied
 overseas back to China. Official media have said that people who have joined foreign
 organizations hostile to China should quit them before returning home and refrain
 while abroad from activities that violate Chinese law.
 In June a Xinhua News Agency official told a journalist that Chinese border con-
 trol stations generally kept background records of certain citizens so that officials
 could decide whether to admit them to China. The following month, a Foreign Min-
 istry spokesman dismissed reports that China "blacklists" political activists as
 "sheer rumor." International observers reported in 1995 that they had documents
 that substantiated their claims that such lists exist. Perhaps the most prominent
 case of a dissident refused reentry is labor activist Han Dongfang, whose passport
 was revoked in 1993 because he allegedly engaged in activities hostile to China
 while overseas, He remains in Hong Kong. The were instances during 1996 when
 the authorities refused visas or entry to China on apparent political grounds. In
 July eight Hong Kong members of the United Front Against the Provisional Legisla-
 ture, who had hoped to hand a protest petition to the authorities, were denied entry
 at the Beijing airport.
 The Government continued to accept the repatriation of citizens who had entered
 other countries or territories illegally. In 1996, in addition to the routine return of
 Chinese illegal immigrants found in Hong Kong, the Government continued accept-
 ing the return of several groups of illegal immigrants from other countries. Citizens
 illegally smuggled to other countries were often detained upon their return for a
 short time to determine identity and any past crimlowin od o ivolvement in
 smuggling activities. As a deterrent and to recover local costs incurred during the
 repatriation, the authorities in some areas levied fines of varying amounts up to a
 maximum of $1,000 on returnees, Exact amounts depended upa    n the extent to
 which returnees actively cperated with the smugglers. Leaders of the alien smug-
 gling rings are sometimes mf ed more than $1,000 and also face prison sentences.
 Since the late 1980's, China has adopted a de fdcto policy of tolerance toward the
 small numbwe of pesonseer than 100 annually-from other nations who have
 registered with the Beijing office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 
 
 631
 us (UNHCR) as asylum seekers. China has permitted these persons to stay in
 Cia while the UNHCR makes determinations as to their status and-if the
 UNHCR determines that they are bona fide refugees-while they await resettlement
 in third countries. Treatment of asylum seekers who present themselves initially to
 Chinese authorities is unknown. As yet China has no law or regulations that au-
 thorize the authorities to grant refugee status, but the Government is reportedly
 drafting working rules on granting such status.
 The Government provided local resettlement to almost 300,000 asylum seekers,
 overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese, who left Indochina for China during the late 1970's
 and the 1980 a. The authorities have accepted the return to China of would-be ille-
 gal emigrants to Hong Kong and Australia from among these individuals, provided
 that China can verify their identity and willingness to return voluntarily. China has
 successfully worked with Laos and Cambodia to facilitate the return of resettled in-
 dividuals who have decided to return to their home countries, and it is now using
 the UNHCR's good offices to negotiate Vietnamese agreement to accept 9,000 per-
 sons seeking to repatriate to Vietnam. The Government denies having tightened its
 policy on accepting Vietnamese asylum seekers. In recent years very few such asy-
 lum seekers have found resettlement in China.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens lack the means to change their government legally and cannot freely
 choose or change the laws and officials that govern them. Citizens vote directly only
 for party-reviewed candidates for delegate positions in county-level people's con-
 gresses and for village-level officials. Rople's congress delegates at the provincial
 level, however, are slected by county-level people's congresses, and in turn provin-
 cial-level people's congresses select delegates to the National People's Congress
 (NPC). NPC seats are allocated on the basis of 1 per 220,000 urban residents and
 1 per 880,000 rural residents. Although the CCP approves the candidates, many
 county and provincial elections are competitive, with more candidates running than
 there are seats available.
 According to the 1982 Constitution, the NPC is the highest organ of state power.
 Formally it elects the President and Vice President, selects the Premier and Vice
 Premiers, and elects the Chairman of the Government's Central Military Commis-
 sion. At the 1996 session of the NPC nearly 30 percent (799) of the delegates attend-
 ing took the unusual step of either voting against, abstaining, or failing to vote on
 the Supreme People's Procuratorate work report. The Supreme Court work report
 received 514 negative votes. Most observers interpret these votes as expressions of
 delegate unhappiness about the problems of crime and corruption. The NPC has not
 in practice demonstrated the power to set policy or remove government or party
 leaders.
 The election and agenda of people's congresses at all levels remain under the firm
 control of the Communist Party, the paramount source of political authority in
 China. A number of small "democratic" parties that date from before the Communist
 takeover in 1949 play only a minor consultative role, and they pledge their alle-
 giance to the Communist Party. The party retains a tight rein on political decision-
 making. Efforts to form new political parties are suppressed.
 Direct elections for basic level or village government are legally sanctioned for all
 of China's approximately 1 million villages. Foreign observers estimate that more
 than 80 percent of these villages have already participated in elections for local
 leaders. Although many have yet to hold truly competitive elections, central govern-
 ment officials have expressed their intent to further expand the competitive election
 process, and efforts to make these elections more competitive and fair continued.
 Successful village elections have included campaigning by multiple candidates, plat-
 forms, and the use of secret ballots. The Ministry of Civil Affairs, which administers
 the village election prora, plans to set up an election training center in Beijing
 that will train local and provincial officials to teach others the basic techniques of
 running democratic elections. In some cases, candidates most favored by the au-
 thorities were defeated in village elections. Although there have been reports of
 vote buyig" in some locales, elections have reportedly reduced corruption and
 brought eter management to some villages. Many local observers do not, however,
 take village elections seriously. Political controls are tight, and village elections do
 not threaten to undermine implementation of unpopular central policies or endanger
 the leading role of the Communist Party.
 The official requirement that associations register and be approved discourages
 independent interest groups from forming and affecting the system. Social organiza-
 tions registered in recent years include gups promoting environmental protection,
 consumer rights, charitable work, and the rights of the disabled, but the Govern-
 
 
 ment monitors their activities to ensure that they remain apolitical. Political activi-
 ties are quickly suppressed. Liu Xiaobo, Wang Xizhe, and other activists submitted
 proreform petitions to government authorities. Liu was arrested in October and sen-
 tenced in a matter of hours to 3 years at a reeducation-through-labor camp. Shortly
 thereafter, Wang escaped China and is now living abroad.
 The Government places no formal restrictions on the participation of women or
 minority groups in the political process. The Government and party organizations
 include approximately 12 million female officials. In September the press reported
 that women and ethnic minorities constituted 21.03 percent and 14.7 percent of Na-
 tional People's Congress delegates, respectively. All of China's 56 nationalities are
 represented in the NPC membership. Women and minorities, however, hold rel-
 atively few positions of significant influence within the party or government struc-
 ture. There are currently no women in the Politburo, but women hold 3 out of 41
 ministerial-level positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no independent Chinese organizations that publicly monitor or com-
 ment on human rights conditions in China. Shanghai officials, for example, have re-
 fused to register the Chinese Human Rights Association. Founders of the group
 were detained, but it is not clear whether their detentions resulted solely from their
 involvement in the group. The detention or incarceration of all active, prominent
 human rights activists confirms the Government's intolerance of such groups. For
 example, Wang Dan-the Tiananmen-era activist who announced in 1994 his inten-
 tion to investigate China's human rights situation-was sentenced to 11 years' im-
 prisonment in October after having been held in incommunicado detention for 17
 months.
 Since 1991 the Government has promoted limited academic study and discussion
 of concepts of human rights, although activity in these areas has been less frequent
 since 1994. In 1993 the Government formed the China Society for Human Rights
 Studies as a "nongovernmental organization." Its efforts have focused largely on im-
 proving China's image abroad and responding to criticism of China's human rights
 record. The Society was widely regarded as the author of a March commentary pub-
 lished in various official newspapers and magazines entitled "A Comparison of
 Human Rights in China with Those in the United States." The article purported to
 refute alleged US. "distortions" of China's human rights record while arguing that
 China's human rights performance was better than that of the United States. In
 March the State Council's Information Office issued a White Paper entitled "Safe-
 guarding Human Rights or Interferingin Internal Affairs of China," which criticized
 foreign criticism of China's human rights record.
 In September the Government hosted a meeting of the Interparliamentary Union
 (IPU), an international organization of legislators. China played a role in efforts to
 draft an IPU human rights resolution, displayed greater openness on human rights
 issues, and agreed to a final resolution text that recognized the universality of
 human rights. Despite this public acknowledgment of universal human rights prin-
 ciples, however, Chinese officials reject in theory the universality of human rights.
 They argue instead that a nation's political, economic, and social system and its
 unique historical, religious, and cultural background determine its concept of human
 rights.
 The Government remains reluctant to accept criticism of China's human rights
 situation by other nations or international organizations and often criticized reports
 by international human rights monitoring groups. To deflect attempts to discuss its
 human rights record, the Government strongly opposed and vigorously lobbied
 against a resolution on China s human rights record at the 1996 session of the U.N.
 Commission on Human Rights (UNHRC). The Government also introduced a proce-
 dural motion, as it has every year the resolution is introduced, to take no action
 on the resolution. The motion was passed by the Commission, and the resolution
 was not debated by the Commission.
 Nevertheless, officials no longer dismiss all discussion of human rights as inter-
 ference in China's internal affairs. Chinese authorities continued to discuss human
 rights issues with foreign governments during bilateral visits. The Government
 sought to limit the Dalai Lama's influence by threatening leaders of several nations
 with serious diplomatic and economic consequences if they met with him (see Tibet
 addendum). Chinas displeasure with those who cosponsored the UNHRC resolution
 in April led it to refuse some foreign governments' requests to hold a human rights
 dialog.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 There are laws designed to protect women children, the disabled, and minorities.
 In practice, however, societal discrimination based on ethnicity, gender, and disabil-
 ity has persisted. The concept of a largely homogeneous Chinese people pervades the
 thinking of the Han majority.
 Women.-Violence against women can be grounds for prosecution under the law.
 Nationwide statistics on the extent of physical violence against women are not avail-
 able, but the public discussion of the establishment of abuse hot lines and women s
 centers has focused attention on the problem. In April 1995, the Chairman of the
 China Academy of Management Science Institute of Women's Studies stated that
 domestic incidents have become both more violent and more frequent in recent
 years. In 1994 the Beijing Society for Research on Marriage and the Family pub-
 lished a survey of 2,100 families showing that one-fifth of the wives surveyed had
 been abused by their spouses.
 In recognition of the seriousness of spousal abuse, some areas took measures to
 address the problem. In February the city of Changsha, Hunan province, imple-
 mented China's first provincial regulation on controlling and preventing family vio-
 lence. The regulation called on grassroots governments and party committees to as-
 sist efforts to decrease domestic violence. In March a women s legal hot line was set
 up in Beijing to provide legal advice for women who cannot afford regular attorneys'
 fees. In May Shanghai opened its first shelter for battered women. A women's legal
 center, which was opened near Beijing in 1995, was active in educating women
 about their legal rights and offering free or inexpensive legal aid to women and chil-
 drn in need and unable to escape family violence and abuse. The women served
 were poor, uneducated rural women. Some were not even aware that they could
 leave hom without their husband's permission. The center has been highly success-
 ful and has developed a cooperative relationship with police, who have started
 bringing battered women to the center.
 No statute outlaws sexual harassment in the workplace, a problem that is often
 unaddressed in society and the legal system. A 1996 case highlighted the obstacles
 that victims of sexual harassment and abuse face in Chinese courts. A woman who
 complained to peers about sexual harassment by her boss, was sued by him for
 criminal defamation, found guilty, fined, and sentenced to 2 years in prison. She
 served 7 months of her sentence before an appeal to a provincial supreme court re-
 versed the decision in her case and found her innocent.
 The increased commercialization of sex and related trafficking in women has
 trapped tens of thousands of women in a cycle of crime and exploitation. These
 women face a high risk of drug addiction, AIDS, and other sexually transmitted dis-
 eases. According to media reports, 80 percent of Beijing's massage parlors offer sex
 service. In July the Beijing municipal government announced a crackdown on mas-
 sage parlors in the capital, but the long-term effectiveness of the crackdown on this
 lucrative business, which involves organized crime groups, businesspeople, and even
 the military is uncertain. Unsafe working conditions are rampant among the sau-
 nas massage houses, and hostess bars that have sprungup in large numbers.
 The abduction of women is a serious and growing pro I ems. The Government con-
 tinued to condemn and to take steps to prevent and punish the abduction and sale
 of women for marriage or prostitution. The press reported in March that 10 Xinjiang
 farmers, who were part of a gang, were convicted for abducting and selling as many
 as 75 women. In June, 24 gang members from Guangdong province were arrested
 for allegedly abducting and selling 230 young women in southern China. According
 to figures announced by the Ministry of Public Security in January 1994, there were
 over 15,000 cases of abduction and trafficking in women and children in 1993. In
 October police broke up China's largest female abduction racket, arresting 62 al-
 leged traffickers and freeing 344 young women after a gunfight in the small village
 of Maoyanghao in Anhui province. According to a Chinese media report, more than
 80 percent of the village's population was implicated in supporting the racket. The
 group had sold girls as young as 12 years old. In November police arrested 61 kid-
 napers in Fujian province and set free 79 women and children in a raid.
 So me research indicates that a key reason for the abduction and sale of women
 is a serious imbalance in sex ratios in certain localities. Male/female birth ratios and
 the traditional preference for boys contribute to this situation (see Section 1.f.). This
 has created a situation where the demand by men for marriageable women cannot
 be met by local brides. Some families address the problem by recruiting women in
 economically less advanced areas. Others seek help from criminal gangs, which ei-
 ther kidnap women or trick them by promising them jobs and an easier way of life
 and then transport them far from their home areas for delivery to buyers. Once in
 
 
 634
 their new "family," these women are "married* and raped. Some accept their fate
 and join the new community; others struggle and are punished.
 The authorities have enacted laws and conducted educational campaigns in an ef-
 fort to eradicate the traditional preference for sons; however this preference re-
 mains strong in rural China. A number of provinces have sought to reduce the per-
 ceived higher value of boys in providing old-age support for their parents by estab-
 lishing or improving pensions and retirement homes.
 The 1982 Constitution states that 'women enjoy equal rights with men in all
 spheres of life," including ownership of property, inheritance rights, and access to
 education. In 1992 the NPC enacted legislation on the protection of-the rights and
 interests of women, which was designed to assist in curbing gender-based discrimi-
 nation. Women have continued, however, to report discrimination, sexual harass-
 ment, unfair dismissal, demotion, and wage discrepancies.
 Women are also sometimes the unintended victims of reforms designed to stream-
 line enterprises and give workers greater job mobility. The press reported that, ac-
 cording to a 1995 survey by the Women's Research Institute of the Chinese Acad-
 emy of Management Science, women constituted 70 percent of persons fired or likely
 to be fired as a result of restructuring unprofitable state enterprises. Women under
 the age of 35 or over the age of 45 were the most affected, and the least likely to
 be retrained. In addition, female employees were more likely to be chosen to take
 pay cuts when a plant or company was in financial trouble.
 any employers prefer to hire men to avoid the expense of maternity leave and
 child care, and some even lower the effective retirement age for female workers to
 40 years of age. (The official retirement age for men is 60 years and for women 55
 years.) Although the law promises equal pay for equal work, a 1990 survey found
 that women's salaries averaged 77 percent of men's. Those statistics still appear to
 be accurate. Most women employed in industry work in lower skilled and lower paid
 jobs.
 While the gap in the education levels of men and women is narrowing, men con-
 tinue to constitute the majority of the relatively small number of Chinese who re-
 ceive a university-level education. In 1994, 830,000 Chinese graduated from under-
 graduate institutions. According to the State Education Commission, women made
 up 35.6 percent of college students and 30.3 percent of postgraduate students. Edu-
 cators in China's large cities have reported, however, that there is a trend toward
 greater gender balance in universities. Some academics have reported that in some
 departments, women are beginning to outnumber men-even in some graduate
 schools. However, women wit advanced degrees report an increase in discrimna-
 tion in the hiring process as the job distribution system has opened up and become
 more competitive.
 In March the Government outlined its 5-Year Plan for the Advancement of
 Women in China. The main priority is to increase literacy of rural women, 80 per-
 cent of whom are illiterate or nearly illiterate. Overall, women make up about 70
 percent of illiterates in the country. The All-China Women's Federation, the coun-
 try's largest organization devoted to women's issues, stated that one of the goals of
 the plan was to decrease the number of female illiterates by 3 million every year.
 Some Chinese women's advocates, however, were skeptical that the goal could be
 realized because of a lack of resources.
 Children.-Acording to a government white paper on children released in April,
 "The Constitution of China      promotes the all-around moral, intellectual and
 physical development of children and young people," and prohibits maltreatment of
 children. The white paper also states that "China's legal framework for the protec-
 tion of children's rights and interests and its social guarantee mechanisms are effec-
 tive in practice." China ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
 Child in 1995.
 The Constitution provides for 9 years of compulsory education for children (see
 Tibet addendum). The extensive health care delivery system has led to improved
 child health and a sharp decline in national infant mortality rates. According to the
 April Child Welfare White Paper, the infant mortality rate has decreased to 37.79
 per 1,000 from approximately 200 per 1,000 in the early 1950's. There were credible
 reports of female infanticide and the use of ultrasound tests to terminate preg-
 nancies of female fetuses, but no reliable statistics were available to demonstrate
 the extent of the problem. The Chinese press has reported in the past that the na-
 tional ratio of male to female births is 114 to 100, while the worldwide statistical
 norm is 106 to 100 (see Section 1.f.).
 Physical abuse of children can be grounds for criminal prosecution. The 1992 Law
 on the Protection of Juveniles forbids infanticide, as well as mistreatment or aban-
 donment of children. This law also prohibits discrimination against disabled minors,
 emphasizes the importance of safety and morality, and codifies a variety of judicial
 
 
 prmtections for juvenile offenders. In January the press reported that a couple in
 Dngguan was fined the equivalent of a month's wages for abandoning their new-
 born son at a hospital; the child was born with a deformed liver, kidneys, and intes-
 tines.
 Despite government efforts to prevent the kidnaping and buying and selling of
 children, the problem persists in some rural areas. In March 1995, authorities in
 Guangxi province reported that, as a result of three campaigns in the past 2 years
 against trading of children and women, police arrested 3,886 criminals, smashed
 595 criminal gangs, and released 134 children and 2,861 women. In December 1995,
 the press reported that six boys, some of whom were taken from their parents soon
 after birth, were returned from central Henan province to their original families in
 neighbring Sichuan province (see also section on Women above).
 According to a 1994 Beijing University demographics study, the number of chil-
 dren abandoned in China each year is approximately 1.7 million, despite the fact
 that under the law child abandonment is punishable by fines and a 5-year prison
 term. The vast majority of those eventually admitted to Chinese orphanages every
 year are female or disabled and are in poor health. The treatment of children at
 orphanages varies from deplorable to adequate. There have been reports of children
 being restrained for long periods of time and being denied basic care and feeding.
 Differences among available statistics make accurate determination of infant mor-
 tality rates in orphanages difficult, but rates appear to be very high at many or-
 hanes, especially among new arrivals. Human Rights Watch cites Ministry of
 ivil   airs statistics for 1989-90 that put infant mortality in orphanages in 10
 provinces at over 50 percent.
 According to several sources, orphanae workers practice triage and reserve basic
 medical care and even nutrition for children who are deemed to have the best
 chances for survival. Some sources report that children whose prospects of survival
 are determined to be poor are placed in rooms separate from other children and sub-
 jected to extreme neglect. Claims that government policies, as opposed to lack of re-
 sources, were to blame for the lack of care of children placed in orphanages could
 not be verified. Human Rights Watch reported in January, however, that many or-
 phanages, including those with the highest death rates, have budgets that provide
 or adequate was bonuses, and other personnel-related costs, but that budgets for
 children's food, clothing, and other necessities are low in institutions throughout the
 country. The Government denies that orphans are mistreated or refused medical
 care but acknowledges that the orphanage system is hard pressed to provide for
 those children who are admitted with serious medical problems.
 People With Disabilities.-In 1990 the Government adopted legislation protecting
 the rights of the country's approximately 60 million disabled persons. According to
 the official press, all local governments subsequently drafted specific measures to
 implement the law. The Government reported in July that, in the 3 preceding years,
 the NPC Standing Committee conducted nationwide inspections to verify compliance
 with the law; it found that the handicapped generally received good services and
 help in both their dealings with officials and in public life."
 However, reality for the disabled lags far behind legal dictates. Misdiagnosis, in-
 adequate medical care, pariah status, and abandonment remain common problems
 for the disabled population. Moreover, statistics compiled in 1993 and published in
 the official press as recently as March show that approximately 50 percent of the
 disabled lack adequate food and clothing. The same figures show that 68 percent
 of the disabled are illiterate; 67 percent require family sup port; 49 percent are un-
 employed; only 6 percent of blind and deaf children enter sool; and only 0.33 per-
 cent of mentally retarded children enter school.
 Deng Pufang, son of retired senior leader Deng Xiaoping, heads the China Welfare
 Fund or the Handicapped, the government organization tasked with assisting the
 disabled. In July the official press reported that the State Council had completed
 the outline of a government program for the disabled. The program, which is a part
 of the Government's ninth 5-year plan for 1996-2000, is designed to solve food and
 clothing problems for the 15 million disabled persons able to work, and to guarantee
 the basic needs of 3 million disabled individuals believed to be living in extreme
 poverty. The program also confirms goals previously established to provide rehabili-
 tation services to 3 million people, raise school enrollment rates for disabled persons
 to 80 percent, and increase their employment rate to 80 percent. The Government
 requires all state enterprises to hire a certain number of disabled workers, but au-
 thorities estimate that nearly half of all disabled persons are jobless.
 Standards adopted in 1994 for making roads and buildings accessible to the dis-
 abled are subject to the 1990 Law on the Handicapped, which calls for their "grad-
 ual" implementation. To date lax compliance with the law has resulted in only lim-
 ited access to most buildings.
 
 
 The new Maternal and Child Health Care Law forbids the marriage of persons
 with certain specified contagious diseases or certain acute mental illnesses such as
 schizophrenia. If doctors find that a couple is at risk of transmitting disabling con-
 genital defects to their children, the couple may marry only if they agree to use
 birth control or undergo sterilization. This law mandates premarital and prenatal
 examination for genetic or contagious diseases, but it specifies that medically ad-
 vised abortion or sterilization requires the signed consent of the patients or their
 guardians.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The State Statistical Bureau reported in
 February that, according to an October 1, 1995, census, the total population of Chi-
 na's 55 ethnic minorities was 108.46 million, or 8.98 percent of the national popu-
 lation. Most minority groups reside in areas they have traditionally inhabited, many
 of which are mountainous or remote. China's policy on minorities calls for pref-
 erential treatment in marriage regulations, family planning, university admission,
 and employment. The Government has programs to provide low interest loans, sub-
 sidies, and special development funds for minority areas.
 Government development policies have helped improve minority living standards
 in recent years. According to government statistics, between 1991 and 1995 the
 economies in minority regions grew by 11 percent annually. However, incomes for
 members of minorities in minority areas remain well below the national average.
 Development programs have disrupted traditional living patterns of minority
 groups, including Tibetans and the Muslim Uighur majority of western Xinjiang. Re-
 cent plans to develop tourism in Xinjiang have often, for example, focused on mar-
 keting and investment opportunities but paid little attention to how minority cul-
 tures and the environment might be adversely affected. However, some projects
 have been dropped for environmental reasons, for example, a proposal to build a
 railroad track around Lake Tianchi near Urumqi.
 In the area of education, the Government has tried to design policies responsive
 to minority concerns. According to government statistics, 15.34 million minority stu-
 dents have attended schools since 1994. In many areas with a significant population
 of minorities, there are two-track school systems using either standard Chinese or
 the local minority language. Students can choose to attend schools in either system.
 One acknowledged side effect of this policy designed to protect and maintain minor-
 ity cultures has been reinforcement of a segregated education system. Under this
 divided education system, those graduating from minority schools are at a disadvan-
 tage in competing for jobs in government and business, which require good spoken
 Chinese. These graduates must take Chinese-language instruction before attending
 universities and colleges (see also Tibet addendum).
 The Communist Party has an avowed policy of boosting minority representation
 in the Government an the party. In March the official press reported that there
 were 2.4 million minority cadres. Many members of minorities occupy local leader-
 ship slots, and a few have positions of influence at the national level. However, in
 most areas, ethnic minorities are shut out of positions of real political and decision-
 making power. Minorities often resent Han officials holding key positions in minor-
 ity autonomous regions. Ethnic minorities in Tibet, Xinjiang, and elsewhere have at
 times demonstrated against Han Chinese authority.
 In 1996 tensions between ethnic Hans and Uighurs in Xinjiang intensified, and
 incidents of violence occurred. According to some estimates, the migration of ethnic
 Han into the area in recent decades has caused the Han-Uighur ratio in Urumqi
 to shift from 20:80 to 80:20 and has created Uighur resentment. Chinese officials'
 control of the region's political and economic institutions has also been a factor in
 the growth of tension. Athough Chinese policies have brought tangible economic im-
 provements, Uighurs maintain that they receive only a small share of the benefits.
 Authorities have maintained tight control over separatist activities. Possession of
 separatist publications is not permitted, and according to reports, possession of such
 materials has resulted in lengthy prison sentences. In general, central authorities
 have made it clear that they will not tolerate opposition to Communist Party rule
 in minority regions and have responded to unrest with force and heightened security
 measures.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1982 Constitution provides for "freedom of asso-
 ciation," but qualifying language makes it clear that this right is subject to the in-
 terests of the State and the leadership of the Communist Party. The country's sole
 officially recognized workers' organization, the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions (ACFTU), is controlled by the Communist Party. Independent trade unions
 are illegal. Although ACFTU officials recognize that workers' interests may not al-
 ways coincide with those of the Communist Party, the ACFTU's primary goals and
 
 
 functions remain to improve labor discipline, mobilize workers to achieve party and
 government objectives, and to dispense social welfare funds. The 1993 Trade Union
 Law required that the establishment of unions at any level be submitted to a higher
 level trade union organization for approval. The ACFTU, the highest level organiza-
 tion, has not approved the establishment of independent unions. Attempts to form
 or register independent unions have been severely repressed.
 The ACFTU's primary attention remains focused on state-sector workers. The
 Trade Union Law mandates that workers may decide whether to join the union in
 their enterprise. By official estimate, approximately 8 percent of workers in collec-
 tive and state-owned enterprises have chosen for their own reasons not to join.
 There have been no reports of repercussions for workers who have not joined
 ACFTU unions. Diversification in types of enterprises over the last decade of reform
 has vastly increased the number of workers outside the traditional sphere of the
 ACFTU.
 Over half of China's nonagricultural work force is now largely unorganized and
 outside the state industrial structure, employed in collectives, township and village
 enterprises, private and individual enterprises, and foreign investment enterprises.
 In township and village enterprises, one of the fastest growing sectors of the econ-
 omy, only a tiny percentage of workers are organized in ACFTU affiliates. Workers
 in companies with foreign investors, even when such companies are located in spe-
 cial economic zones (SEts), have the right to form unions provided that the unions
 are affiliated with the ACFTU. The ACFTU estimates that, as of the end of 1995,
 91 percent of foreign investment enterprises had union branches. Anecdotal evi-
 dence, however, indicates that union influence in such enterprises is weak.
 Credible reports indicate the Government has attempted to stamp out illegal
 union activity. Veteran labor activist Liu Nianchun, who was detained in May 1994
 after he tried to register the "League for the Protection of the Rights of the Working
 People," and again in May 1995 after he had signed a petition calling for labor
 rights, was sentenced to 3 years of reeducation through labor in July. Labor rights
 activist Li Wenming and Guo Baosheng were tried in November but by year's end
 had not yet been sentenced (see Section i.e.).
 In March 1994, a petition calling for workers to have "freedom from exploitation,"
 the right to strike, and the right to organize nonofficial trade unions was circulated
 in Beijing. The authorities detained Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbing, and Wang
 Jiaqi after they presented the petition. Zhou is an associate of Han Dongfang, the
 leader of the Beijing Autonomous Workers' Federation. Zhou was sentenced in Sep-
 tember 1994 to 3 years' reeducation through labor, although the charges against
 him were reportedly not linked to the petition. According to reports, he was sen-
 tenced in 1995 to a fourth year for an alleged escape attempt. Accurate figures are
 not available on the number of Beijing Autonomous Workers' Federation detainees
 still being held for their participation in the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstra-
 tions.
 The Government was cited by the International Labor Organization (ILO) during
 1996 for its failure to protect the human and trade union rights of Chinese seafarers
 serving on foreign-flag ships (ILO complaint number 1819). The case stemmed from
 a complaint brought against China by the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU) in January 1995, regarding the Government's arrest of Chinese
 seafarers who had requested the assistance of the International Transport Workers'
 Federation (ITF) to improve their wages and working conditions. The Government
 detained three of the seafarers for 2'/2 years and confiscated their seamen's docu-
 mentation and evidence of qualifications. The ILO's Committee on Freedom of Asso-
 ciation (CFA) in its subsequent recommendations urged the Chinese Government to
 "refrain in the future from having recourse to any act of antiunion discrimination,
 especially the arrest and detention of Chinese seafarers who pursue their legitimate
 griev"ances through the organizations of their choice."
 The right to strike, which had been included in China's 1975 and 1978 constitu-
 tions, was removed from the 1982 Constitution on the ground that the Socialist po-
 litical system had eradicated contradictions between the proletariat and enterprise
 owners. The Trade Union Law assigns unions the role of mediators or go-betweens
 with management in cases of work stoppages or slowdowns. Beginning in 1993, the
 Ministry of Labor stopped officially denying the existence of strikes, but strikes are
 still not officially sanctioned, and accurate statistics on strike incidents are not
 available. One unofficial, yet credible 1995 estimate put the number of work stop-
 pages at 1,870. In March 600 workers went on strike to protest unpaid back wages
 and excessive overtime at a joint venture hardware manufacturing factory in the
 Shenzhen SEZ. In Wuhan, according to reports, unemployed workers have repeat-
 edly staged sit-down protests in front of the entrances of the Wuhan government
 
 
 638
 
 and Hubei provincial government offices. Six hundred people participated in the
 largest demonstration.
 A dispute settlement procedure has been in effect since 1987. The procedure pro-
 vides for mediation, two levels of arbitration committees, and a final appeal to the
 courts. According to official statistics based on National Mediation Center and Labor
 Bureau records, labor disputes increased by a pproximately 73 percent in 1995. This
 followed a 65 percent increase during 1994. Most cases are solved through arbitra-
 tion, and very few reach the courts. According to Ministry of Labor officials, the ma-
 jority of arbitration cases are filed by contract workers or their employers. During
 1995, 23,000 labor disputes were brought before arbitration committees.
 There are no provisions allowing for individual workers or unofficial worker orga-
 nizations to affiliate with international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The National Labor Law,
 which took effect on January 1, 1995, permits workers in all types of enterprises
 to bargain collectively. This law supersedes a 1988 law that allowed collective bar-
 gaining only by workers in private enterprises. The Labor Law provides for workers
 and employers at all types of enterprises to sign individual as well as collective con-
 tracts. Collective contracts are to be worked out between ACFTU or worker rep-
 resentatives and management and specify such matters as working conditions, wage
 distribution, and hours of work. Individual contracts are then to be drawn up in line
 with the terms of the collective contract. Collective contracts must be submitted to
 local government authorities for approval within 15 days. As of August, approxi-
 mately 44 percent of China's industrial work force were officially on collective con-
 tracts.
 To date, union and labor officials report the initiation of only a few experiments
 in collective bargaining. Official sources have explained that sufficient ideological
 and practical difficulties remain to preclude drawing clear distinctions between
 labor and capital in China's state-owned enterprise sector. According to the ACFTU,
 collective bargaining is being implemented first in foreign investment enterprises
 where capital interests are clearly delineated.
 The Ministry of Labor sets a total wage bill for each collective and state-owned
 enterprise according to four criteria: 1) as a percentage of profits, 2) as a contract
 amount with the local labor bureau, 3) for money losing enterprises, according to
 a state-set amount, or 4) as an enterprise-set amount subject to Labor Ministry re-
 view. Individual enterprises determine how to divide the total among workers, a de-
 cision usually made by the enterprise manager in consultation with the enterprise
 party chief and the ACFTU representative.
 Worker congresses are authorized to review plans for wage reform, although these
 bodies serve primarily as rubber-stamp organizations. Wages are generally equal for
 the same type of work within enterprises. Incentives are provided for increased pro-
 ductivity. Under the National Labor Law, wages may be set according to conditions
 stipulated in collective contracts negotiated between ACFTU representatives and
 management. In practice, however, only the small number of workers with high
 technical skills can negotiate effectively on salary and fringe benefits.
 Worker congresses theoretically have the authority to remove incompetent man-
 agers and approve major decisions affecting enterprises, notably wage and bonus
 distribution systems. The congresses generally, however, take place only once a year
 and serve essentially to approve agreements worked out among factory managers,
 party secretaries, and ACFTU representatives. In smaller enterprises it is not un-
 usual to find these three posts held by the same person. The Trade Union Law pro-
 hibits antiunion discrimination and specifies that union representatives may not be
 transferred or terminated by enterprise management during their term of office.
 Unionized foreign businesses generally report pragmatic relations with ACFTU rep-
 resentatives.
 Laws governing working conditions in SEZ's are not significantly different from
 those in the rest of the country. Wages in the SEZ's, however, and in southeastern
 China generally, are significantly higher than in other parts of the country because
 high investment has created a great demand for available labor. As in other areas
 of China, officials admit that some foreign investors in SEZ's are able to negotiate
 "sweetheart" deals with local partners that effectively bypass labor regulations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.--Some penal facilities contract with
 regular industries for prisoners to perform light manufacturing and assembly work.
 In 1991 the Government published a reiteration of its regulations barring the export
 of prison-made goods.
 On August 7, 1992, the U.S. and Chinese Governments signed a Memorandum
 of Understanding (MOU) prohibiting trade in prison labor products. A statement of
 cooperation (SOC) detailing specific working procedures for implementation of the
 MO U was signed on March 14, 1994. Although the signing of the SOC initially
 
 
 639
 helped to foster a more productive relationship with the authorities, cooperation has
 been limited recently. In 1996 the authorities granted access to only one prison
 labor facility requested by U.. Customs. Repeated delays in arranging prison labor
 site visits called into question the Government's intentions regarding the implemen-
 tation of the MOU and SOC.
 In addition to prisons and reform through labor facilities, which hold inmates sen-
 tenced through judicial procedures, the Government also maintains a network of re-
 education-through-labor camps, where inmates are sentenced through nonjudicial
 procedures (see Section i.e.). Inmates of reeducation-through-labor facilities are gen-
 erally required to work, but the authorities assert that the facilities are not prisons
 and have denied access to them under the 1992 prison labor MOU with the IUnited
 States. Reports from international human rights organizations and the foreign press
 indicate that at least some persons in pretrial detention are also required to work.
 Most anecdotal reports conclude that work conditions in the penal stem's light
 manufacturing factories are similar to those in other factories, but conditions on the
 penal system s farms and in mines can be very harsh. As in many Chinese work-
 places, safety is a low priority. There are no available figures for casualties in prison
 industry.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The National Labor Law specifies
 that "no employing unit shall be allowed to recruit juveniles under the age of 16."
 Administrative review, fines, and revocation of business licenses of those businesses
 that hire minors are specified in Article 94 of the Labor Law. The law also provides
 for children to receive 9 years of compulsory education and to receive their subsist-
 ence from parents or guardians. Laborers between the ages of 16 and 18 are re-
 ferred to as "juvenile workers" and are prohibited from engaging in certain forms
 of physical work, including labor in mines.
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for the enforcement of labor-related regula-
 tions. The Labor Law mandates the establishment of labor inspection corps at all
 administrative levels above county government. The rapid growth of the nonstate
 sector, however has outpaced the evolution of government regulatory structures and
 resulted in inadequate labor inspection and enforcement regimes. In poorer, isolated
 areas, child labor in agriculture is widespread, given the few options available to
 minors who have completed their primary school education at approximately 13
 years of age.
 The vast reserve of surplus adult labor, however, minimizes the incentive to em-
 ploy children. Most independent observers agree with Chinese officials that urban
 chld labor is a relatively small problem in formal, monetized sectors of the econ-
 omy. Rising dropout rates at secondary schools in some provinces and anecdotal re-
 ports suggest that children may increasingly be entering unregulated sectors of the
 economy.lt has be en reported that the Government puts the number of children be-
 tween the ages of 6 and 14 who did not attend school in 1995 between 13 and 24
 million. Using this reprt, there is one estimate that approximately 12 million chil-
 dren are in thle work orce full time. No specific industry is identifiable as a signifi-
 cant violator of child labor regulations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Law codifies many of the general
 principles of labor reform, setting out provisions on employment, labor contracts,
 working hours, wages, skill development and training, social insurance, dispute res-
 olution, legal responsibility, supervision, and inspection. There is no national mini-
 mum wage. Rather, the Labor Law allows local governments to determine their own
 standards on minimum wages. In general, minimum wage level determinations are
 higher than the local poverty relief ceiling but lower than the current wage level
 of the average worker
 In December the monthly minimum wage in Beijing was raised to $32.50 (RMB
 270) from $29. In the Shenzhen and Zhuhai SEZ's in south China, the monthly min-
 imum wage was approximately $48 (RMB 398). Minimum wage levels were raised
 in 12 provinces in December. Although these wage levels may be slightly greater
 than average living expenditures according to some official statistics, they would
 provide only a very basic standard of living for a worker and family. Minimum wage
 figures do not, however, include free or heavily subsidized benefits that some state-
 sector employers may provide in kind, such as housing, medical care, and education.
 In prer, rural areas monthly minimum wage levels are as low as $14 (RMB 120).
 Official government estimates put the number of people living in absolute poverty
 at 65 million; other estimates range to 350 million.
 China reduced the national standard workweek in May 1995 from 44 hours to 40
 hours, excluding overtime. The Labor Law mandates a 24-hour rest period weekly
 and does not allow overtime work in excess of 3 hours a day or 36 hours a month.
 It also sets forth a required scale of remuneration for overtime work. Enforcement
 of regulations regarding overtime work varies according to region and type of enter-
 
 
 640
 prise. The official press regularly reports cases of workers forced to work long over-
 time hours at small-scale foreign investment enterprises, particularly in southern
 China and the SEZ's. Abuses at private enterprises are sometimes also given cov-
 lcupational health and safety are constant themes of posters and campaigns.
 Every work unit must designate a health and safety officer, and the ILO has estab-
 lished a training program for these officials. Although the 1982 Constitution does
 not provide for the right to strike, the Trade Union Law explicitly recognizes the
 right of unions to "suggest that staff and workers withdraw from sites of danger"
 and participate in accident investigations. It is unclear, however, to what extent
 workers can actually remove themselves from such dangerous situations without
 risking loss of employment.
 Pressures for increased output, lack of financial resources to maintain equipment,
 lack of concern by management, and a traditionally poor understanding of safety is-
 sues by workers have contributed to a continuing high rate of accidents. According
 to one official survey, 18,160 people died, and 6,005 people were injured in 1995 due
 to work-related accidents, a decrease from 1994. Over 10,000 of the deaths occurred
 as a result of mine accidents. According to the Ministry of Public Health, over 75
 million workers are at risk from occupational respiratory diseases such as
 pneumoconiosis due to poor working conditions. Less than half of rural enterprises
 meet national dust and poison standards. Many factories using harmful products,
 such as asbestos, fail not only to protect their workers against the ill effects of such
 products, but also fail to inform them about the potential hazards.
 Poor enforcement by local officials of occupational safety and health regulations
 continues to put the lives of workers at risk. Work safety issues have, however, at-
 tracted the attention of senior government leaders. In August the National People's
 Congress sent seven inspection teams to various provinces to investigate poor en-
 forcement of work safety standards and other labor abuses. The Ministry of Labor
 is also trying to draft a more rigorous national system of occupational health and
 safety standards. It is unlikely, however, that supervision of small-scale private and
 township and village enterprises, where many accidents occur, will improve substan-
 tially in the near future.
