 MALI
 Mali is a single party state in which effective authority is
 exercised by General Moussa Traore, Secretary General of the
 Democratic Union of the Malian People and President of the
 Republic. In 1968 President Traore, then a lieutenant, led a
 military coup which overthrew the leftist civilian government
 of Modibo Keita. Although Mali in 1974 adopted a Constitution
 which increased the number of civilians in the Government, the
 military continues to have an important role in party and
 governmental affairs. Military officers hold approximately
 one-fourth of the senior positions in the Cabinet and party,
 four of seven governorships, and an important portion of lower
 level administrative posts, mostly in border areas. A
 government reorganization in June further increased the
 percentage of civilians in office.
 Burkina Faso fought a week-long border war with Mali in
 December 1985 over long disputed territory. Tension between
 the two countries remains high, but a ruling from the
 International Court of Justice at the end of 1986 won praise
 from both countries, which have publicly vowed to abide by
 it. Prisoners from the December border war have been
 repatriated.
 Mali is one of the world's poorest countries, with per capita
 income around $160 a year. Landlocked and lacking easily
 exploitable mineral resources, except for some gold, Mali's
 economy is based on subsistence farming and animal husbandry,
 both of which have been severely affected by drought in recent
 years.
 The political and human rights situation did not change
 significantly over the past year. No organized political
 opposition groups are permitted within Mali. The Government
 has not, however, reacted harshly to opposition since the
 student riots in 1981. In 1986, within the context of official
 party or union meetings, it permitted limited criticism of its
 economic reform policies.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported incidents of politically motivated
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported incidents of disappearance, abduction,
 or hostage-taking.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Government of Mali does not officially condone police
 brutality, but physical abuse of suspects sometimes occurs in
 police interrogation. Torture rarely occurs. Public beatings
 by the citizenry of persons identified as thieves does take
 place on occasion. Prison conditions are harsh and, owing to
 a lack of resources, facilities are inadequate. Prisoners
 perform hard manual labor, such as road maintenance. In the
 past, Amnesty International has expressed concern over alleged
 
 
 189
 MALI
 degrading treatment of prisoners in Taoudenit and Kidal prisons
 situated in northern desert locations and appealed to the
 Government to improve conditions. These prisons may contain
 some political prisoners.
 During an April visit to Senegal by President Traore, Malian
 students at the University of Dakar led a strike to highlight
 their claim that six students detained in Mali were being
 mistreated and/or tortured. The students in question, who
 were tried in November 1985 for "offenses against the head of
 state", were represented by lawyers; two were acquitted and
 four received suspended sentences. There is no evidence that
 the students-were-mistreated during their incarceration before
 the trial.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No incidents of arbitrary arrests, detention, or exile were
 reported during 1986. The Malian judicial system is based on
 the French model and detained persons do not have the right to
 a judicial determination of the legality of their detention.
 However, Malian law does not permit arrest without formal
 charge. Malian law does not provide for release on bail, but
 detainees are sometimes released on their own recognizance.
 Prisoners are usually allowed access to a lawyer of their
 choosing. Administrative backlogs often cause delays in
 bringing people to trial.
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited except in cases of
 convicted criminals.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is part of the executive branch and therefore
 potentially subject to interference. Trials are generally
 short in duration. While confessions are not coerced,
 defendants usually admit guilt, and defense lawyers tend to
 argue mitigating circumstances. The verdict and sentence are
 rendered by a panel of three judges. The appeals process is
 limited to an appeal for a presidential pardon or a request
 for a new trial. The National Assembly can convene a High
 Court of Justice to hear cases against state ministers. This
 Court did not meet during 1986. Several high-ranking officers
 were arrested for reportedly inept command decisions during
 the December 1985 border conflict but were subsequently
 released.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Inviolability of the home is guaranteed in the Constitution
 and generally respected in practice. Police searches are
 infrequent, and warrants are issued and recorded, though
 sometimes after the fact.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Malian Constitution does not guarantee freedom of speech
 and press. The State controls all Malian media and does not
 permit public questioning of its authority. Criticism of
 specific programs, aspects of society, or the performance of
 government offices (rarely of individuals) is, however,
 allowed. The national labor union enjoys limited freedom to
 
 
 190
 MALI
 express dissatisfaction with some government austerity
 programs. Academic freedom does not extend to criticism of
 the Government or its policies. Journalists are all
 government employees. A few have been suspended or fired for
 "impertinent" questioning, but in general they have not been
 subjected to other reprisals. Private Malian publications
 expressing antigovernment views are not tolerated, but
 international publications, even those critical of Mali or its
 Government, are .readily available and circulate freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association,
 The Malian Constitution guarantees the liberty of citizens to
 form organizations to protect their "professional interests,"
 but in reality only selected organizations such as urban
 professional associations qualify for this consideration. The
 only groups which assemble freely are the women's, youth, and
 labor associations of Mali's single political party.
 Twelve labor unions with a total of 130,000 members form the
 National Union of Malian Workers (UNTM), the only recognized
 workers' organization. Despite its party affiliation,.the
 UNTM claims to maintain a degree of autonomy from the
 Government, and its Secretary General is not a member of the
 party's central executive council. Within limits, collective
 bargaining is permitted. Strikes, though permitted by law,
 seldom occur. In November 1986, Malian teachers went on
 strike for I day to protest nonpayment of salaries. The
 teachers' union carried out a 2-day strike in December when
 their salaries remained unpaid. The Government did not
 intervene to prevent the strike. The UNTM maintains contacts
 with international labor organizations, both public and
 private.
 c. Freedom of Rel-igion
 Mali is a secular state. The Government generally does not
 discriminate on religious grounds. Although 90 percent of
 Malians are Muslim, most other religions may practice their
 faiths freely and are permitted to establish houses of worship
 and schools. Christian missionaries of various faiths enjoy
 government cooperation and are free to proselytize. Religious
 conversion is permitted, except to the Baha'i, who are free to
 practice their faith in their homes but forbidden to
 proselytize or establish houses of worship.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement in Mali is generally unimpeded, although
 travelers are sometimes subject to police checks, especially
 at night. These checks are allowed by law, ostensibly to
 restrict the movement of stolen or smuggled goods. In
 practice, some police are known to supplement their frequently
 delayed salaries by assessing ad hoc fines or confiscating
 goods. Malians are free to change residence or work place.
 Foreign travel requires an exit visa which is easy to obtain.
 Repatriation is not restricted. Mali has both accepted and
 generated persons displaced by drought and famine in recent
 years. A steady stream of people--mainly nomads affected by
 the drought--migrated to towns in southern Mali in 1985 and
 substantial numbers remain there in 1986. Several thousand
 Malians were repatriated from Algeria in 1986.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The only legal political party, the Democratic Union of the
 Malian People, is the supreme political entity in Mali. Its
 Secretary General, Moussa Traore, is by law the President of
 the Republic. The role of the military has diminished in
 recent years but is still important. Five of the party's 19
 central executive bureau members, 5 of the 17 cabinet
 ministers, 4 of the 7 regional governors, and numerous lower
 level officials are military officers. Important policies and
 decisions are made by a small group--the President, the
 19-member central executive bureau, and the Council of
 Ministers. The party congress meets only once every 3 years,
 and the National Assembly meets twice a year.
 Citizens thus have little and infrequent opportunity to
 influence the Government. Within the one-party system,
 multiple candidates often contest party elections at the local
 level. National Assembly elections, held every 4 years,
 generally present a single candidate selected by the party for
 each seat, although in theory all party members are eligible
 to run for election. The National Assembly debates proposed
 legislation after its acceptance by the Council of Ministers
 and review by the Supreme Court.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government of Mali has been generally responsive to calls
 by recognized groups such as Amnesty International to correct
 reported human rights violations. However, Mali itself has no
 local human rights organizations. The Ministries of Foreign
 Affairs and Justice are charged with responsibility for human
 rights issues. Mali does not play a major role in
 international human rights forums.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While the Government avoids use of ethnic "quotas," virtually
 all ethnic groups are represented at the highest state and
 party level. In local government, officials are assigned
 outside their regions of origin. Although some nomadic groups
 such as the Tuaregs remain outside the economic and political
 mainstream, Mali is relatively free of ethnic tension.
 Social and cultural factors assign a higher role to men that
 women in Malian society, but women are making some progress.
 Women are free to participate in the Malian political process,
 and, while underrepresented, are present at all levels of
 government and the party, especially at the local level. A
 limited number of women occupy positions of responsibility in
 most ministries. Two women serve in the Cabinet (Minister of
 Information and Minister of Public Health and Social Services)
 and one in the party's executive bureau (president of the
 women's union.) Three women now serve in the National
 Assembly. Notwithstanding this trend, custom often restricts
 women to "women's issues" when they do participate in politics.
 The National Union of Malian Women in particular promotes
 discussion of health, social, and education issues and
 disseminates information on the arguments against female
 circumcision. Despite the creation of a national commission
 
 
 192
 MALI
 on the issue and government disapproval, female circumcision
 is still widely practiced.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Workers' rights are specified in the Constitution. Conditions
 of employment, including hours, wages, social security
 benefits, and health and safety standards vary depending upon
 the category of work. Employers are required to pay into a
 National Social Security Fund. While the minimum age for
 employment is 14 with parents' permission, children can be
 apprenticed at 12. In practice, children in rural areas join
 the work force at a much younger age, and workers in the
 informal sector are not protected by laws against unjust
 compensation, excessive hours, and capricious discharge.
