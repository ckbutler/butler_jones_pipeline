 WESTERN SAMOA
 Western Samoa, a small Pacific island country with a
 population of around 165,000, is located approximately 1,600
 miles northeast of New Zealand. It received independence from
 that country in 1962 and still looks to it as a model for its
 democratic practices and educational system. On receiving
 independence, it adopted a Constitution proclaiming the nation
 to be an independent and sovereign state based on "Christian
 principles, and Samoan customs and tradition." The
 Constitution established a parliamentary democracy on the
 Westminster model but with certain concessions to Samoan
 cultural practices. It provides for a Samoan head of state, a
 unicameral legislature, an independent judiciary, protection
 of Samoan land and traditional Samoan titles, and guarantees
 of fundamental rights and freedoms. Executive authority is
 vested in a head of state, with government administered by a
 cabinet consisting of a prime minister and eight ministers
 chosen by the prime minister. All legislation passed by the
 legislative assembly needs the approval of the head of state
 before it becomes law. The present Head of State, Maliefoa
 Tanumafill II, holds the position for life. His successors
 will be elected by the Legislative Assembly for 5-year terms.
 The culture of Western Samoa is essentially Polynesian but
 uniquely Samoan. A proud people, Samoans believe that all
 Polynesian people trace their origins to Samoa. Traditional
 authority is vested in the matai (village chief or selected
 leader of an extended family). Each extended family, or aiga,
 has at least one matai, who is appointed by consensus of the
 aiga. Ownership of land is legally vested in the matai. It
 is the matai's responsibility to direct the economic, social,
 and political affairs of the aiga. There are 362 villages in
 Western Samoa with a total of over 12,000 matai. Each village
 is governed by a fono or council of matai, which can fine or
 otherwise punish offenses against village rules.
 There were no significant human rights problems in 1986.
 The economy is primarily agricultural and beset by many of the
 problems of a developing country. It is particularly
 susceptible to shifts in world prices for its export
 commodities such as coconut oil.  In an attempt to improve its
 current accounts deficit, the Government has implemented
 austerity measures. In 1984 per capita income was $616.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for political motives, whether by the Government or
 opposition political organizations, does not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no secret arrests, clandestine detentions, or
 abductions.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment are prohibited by law, and there have been no
 
 
 847
 WESTERN SAMOA
 reports of such practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no political prisoners. The Constitution guarantees
 freedom from forced labor. There are full and effective legal
 safeguards of internationally recognized rights in this area.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Western Samoan law guarantees the right to a fair public
 trial, and this right is honored. All charges are stated
 formally and clearly. Defendants are entitled to counsel.
 There are no special courts to deal with political or security
 offenses, and the judiciary is independent of government
 interference or influence. Decisions of village matai about
 customary law are not subject to judicial review, but
 arbitrary or excessive punishments would be difficult to
 enforce.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government respects the privacy of the people and does not
 permit arbitrary interference with the family, home, or
 correspondence. Both law and local custom provide for
 protection from invasion of the home or seizure of property
 without substantive and procedural safeguards, including
 search warrants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are fundamental parts of the
 Constitution. They are respected in law and practice. The
 press is independent of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the right of peaceful assembly and
 the right to form associations and unions. There are no
 significant restrictions. While trade unions have not emerged
 in the private sector, the public service has an employee
 association which engages in collective bargaining. The
 Government has permitted efforts to develop unions within the
 country, and the courts have upheld the rights to strike and
 to enter into collective bargaining.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution, along
 with freedom of thought and conscience. Each person is
 guaranteed the right to change religions or belief and to
 worship or teach religion alone or with others. There is no
 government-favored religion. Nearly 100 percent of the
 population is Christian.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees the right to travel and move
 freely throughout Western Samoa and to change residence.
 Samoans are free to travel abroad, and they can emigrate and
 
 
 848
 WESTERN SAMOA
 return to Samoa-without restriction. There are no refugees
 from or in Western Samoa.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Power in Western Samoa is vested in the Prime Minister and the
 Legislative Assembly. Under the Constitution, the Assembly is
 elected every 3 years. Forty-five of its members are elected
 by the approximately 12,000 matai, and the other 2 seats are
 filled by universal suffrage of those citizens who are not
 Samoan by heritage. Although there is some pressure for
 extending suffrage to all citizens, the concept is seen by
 many as conflicting with "Fa'a Samoa" (the Samoan way). The
 existing system is viewed as being democratic, in that the
 'matai" traditionally consult with their extended families
 before making decisions such as choosing among candidates for
 the Assembly. The matai system is conservative but does allow
 for change. While Samoans must show respect and obedience to
 their "matai" in family and communal affairs, the matai have
 well-defined responsibilities which, if not met, can result in
 removal.
 Western Samoa has only the rudiments of political parties.
 The most prominent political organization, the Human Rights
 Protection Party (HRPP) was founded in 1982. Its founder,
 Va'ai Kolone is currently Prime Minister. Although a second
 party was formed shortly before the elections of February
 1985, the political process in Western Samoa remains very much
 a function of personality rather than party. In recent
 experience, elections have occurred more frequently than the
 prescribed 3-year cycle, primarily as a result of
 no-confidence votes.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No requests for human rights investigations were made to the
 Western Samoan Government in 1986, nor have human rights
 organizations found cause for comment or special reporting on
 Western Samoa. There are no internal official or
 nongovernmental human rights organizations in Western Samoa.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Samoan politics and culture are the product of a heritage of
 chiefly-privilege and power, and persons of good family have
 certain advantages. Women traditionally occupy a subordinate
 role, although exceptions, including women matai and members
 of Parliament, are common. The functioning of the matai
 system, including the democratic consensusmethod of selecting
 the matai themselves, tends to work against discrimination.
 The Samoan Constitution makes special provision to preserve
 the political rights of non-Samoans. Persons of mixed
 ancestry who are culturally Samoan are accepted and can attain
 positions of considerable wealth and influence.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Labor and--Employments Act of 19.72 and regulations of 1973
 establish for the. private sector a 4-hour workweek and a
 
 
 849
 WESTERN SAMOA
 minimum wage of $0.25 an hour. It is illegal to employ
 children under 15 years of age except in "safe and light
 work." The law also establishes certain rudimentary safety
 and health provisions, such as a requirement for fencing
 around dangerous machine parts. Independent observers say,
 however, that the safety laws are not enforced except when
 accidents highlight noncompliance, and that many agricultural
 workers, among others, are inadequately protected from
 pesticides and other health hazards. Part of the problem is
 low safety consciousness, which government education programs
 are addressing. The law does not apply to service rendered to
 the matai, some of whom require children to work at what might
 be considered child labor. Government employees are covered
 under different, more stringent regulations, which are
 adequately enforced.
