 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy with a federal
 structure. Legislative power is vested in the bicameral
 Parliament. Given the nation's linguistic and religious
 diversity, the Swiss political system emphasizes local and
 national political consensus and grants considerable autonomy
 to individual cantons.
 The Swiss armed forces are a militia based on universal
 military service for able-bodied males. There is virtually no
 standing army apart from training cadres and a few essential
 headquarters staff functions. Police duties are primarily a
 responsibility of the individual cantons, which have their own
 distinct police forces. The national police authority has a
 coordinating role and relies on the cantons for actual law
 enforcement.
 Switzerland has a free enterprise industrial and service
 economy highly dependent on international trade. There has
 been virtual full employment and labor peace for many years.
 The standard of living is one of the highest in the world.
 Human rights are widely respected. The most notable human
 rights issue in 1991 was the call for further reduction of
 inequalities experienced by women (see Section 5). The
 authorities moved to restore public confidence in the
 collection and protection of personal data on Swiss citizens.
 Switzerland maintained its own strong association with human
 rights issues, exemplified by hosting the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission in Geneva. The headquarters of the International
 Labor Organization and the International Committee of the Red
 Cross are located in Switzerland.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution provides freedom from all of the above. There
 were no reports of any violations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile is provided
 by law. A detained person may not be held longer than 24 hours
 without a warrant of arrest issued by the magistrate conducting
 the preliminary investigation. A suspect must immediately be
 shown the warrant and has the right to contact legal counsel as
 soon as a warrant is issued. A suspect may be detained with a
 warrant until an investigation is completed, but the length of
 investigative detention is always reviewed by higher judicial
 authority, and investigations are usually completed quickly.
 Release on personal recognizance or bail is granted unless the
 
 
 1243
 SWITZERLAND-
 examining magistrate believes the person is a danger to society
 or will not appear for trial. There is no summary exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for public trials. All courts of
 first instance are cantonal courts, with right of appeal to the
 federal courts and freedom from interference by other branches
 of government. Minor cases are tried by a single judge,
 difficult cases by a panel of judges, and murder or other
 serious crimes by a public jury. Even the most serious cases
 are usually brought to trial within a few months. There are no
 political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Police entry into the premises of a person suspected of a
 criminal offense is regulated by cantonal legislation.
 Regulations differ widely from canton to canton.
 The Swiss Government moved in 1991 to ease public concern over
 the collection and protection of personal data about individual
 citizens, allowing those affected to view an extract (fiche) of
 their file. Parliament discussed a new law designed to protect
 personal data. The Government also proposed a new law on state
 security in order to define the framework for actions to
 safeguard national security.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 An independent press, effective judiciary, and democratic
 political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and
 press. Groups or associations that are determined to represent
 a potential threat to the State may have restrictions placed on
 their freedom of speech and press. No groups are restricted at
 the present time. Broadcast media are government funded but
 possess editorial autonomy, and foreign broadcastmedia are
 freely available. Press and publishing are private enterprises
 operated without government intervention. Academic freedom is
 respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only restriction on peaceful assembly and association is a
 requirement to obtain permits from police authorities before
 holding public meetings. These are routinely granted unless
 authorities have reason to believe the meeting will lead to
 violence.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Switzerland enjoys religious freedom. There is no single state
 church, but individual cantons may support a particular church
 out of public funds, and most cantons do so. Foreign clergy
 are free to perform their duties in Switzerland.
 The legal requirement for universal male military service
 provides no exemption for conscientious objectors. They may
 apply for military service that does not entail bearing arms,
 but refusal to serve has nearly always led to prosecution and
 conviction. A new law to ameliorate this situation, which took
 effect in July, maintains that refusal to serve is a punishable
 
 
 1244
 SWITZERLAND
 offense, but if the refusal stems from reasons of conscience,
 the prescribed sentence is a period of community service rather
 than prison.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Swiss citizens have freedom to travel in or outside the country
 and may emigrate without difficulty. Switzerland traditionally
 has been a haven for refugees, but public concern over the
 growing number of asylum seekers, many of whom come for
 economic reasons, created pressure on the Government to
 implement swifter processing of asylum seekers and expel more
 quickly those whose applications are rejected. Asylum seekers
 continue to receive orderly consideration, and those whose
 applications are rejected are allowed to stay temporarily if
 their home country is torn by war or insurrection.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Switzerland is a highly developed constitutional democracy.
 There is universal adult suffrage by secret ballot in federal
 elections. Elections are free and are contested actively by
 four major national parties and at least a dozen significant
 regional or minor parties. Initiative and referendum
 procedures provide unusually intense popular involvement in the
 legislative process. Participation by women in politics has
 been limited historically but continues to expand slowly.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Human rights advocacy groups in Switzerland concern themselves
 almost exclusively with lobbying the Swiss and other
 governments about human rights situations in other countries.
 Switzerland cooperates with international and nongovernmental
 groups in all areas of human rights. All major international
 human rights groups are active in Switzerland, and some of the
 leading ones--e.g., the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 and the ICRC--are based there. The ICRC is made up of Swiss
 nationals, and Swiss participate prominently in other
 humanitarian nongovernmental organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination against
 women in the workplace, government and other sources noted that
 further implementation was necessary to ensure equal pay and
 other benefits for women. The Federal Commission for Women's
 Rights and several private groups, e.g., the Federation of
 Women's Organizations, monitor and promote women's rights.
 Discrimination that persists today is social, not legal, but it
 nevertheless hinders opportunities for women in fields that
 have been traditionally dominated by men.
 In order to focus public awareness on discrimination, the Swiss
 Trade Union Federation organized a women's strike on June 14 in
 which some 10,000 women actively participated, while up to half
 a million supported it in some form without walking off their
 jobs. The themes stressed were that women earn 30 percent less
 than men employed in equivalent jobs, that social security laws
 discriminate against married women, and that, as a result of
 
 
 1245
 SWITZERLAND
 discrimination, women occupy few senior, managerial positions
 in business.
 Swiss policymakers have become a are in recent years of the
 issue-of violence against women. Observers believe that many
 cases go unreported, so that accurate statistics are lacking.
 There is, however, widespread agreement that a problem exists.
 The Federation of Women's Organizations and other women's
 advocacy groups have heightened public consciousness. Each
 city has an emergency telephone number through which women who
 are victims of violence may obtain help and counseling.
 Specialists work with police authorities to interview women who
 report attacks. Laws exist against wife beating and similar
 crimes. Parliament approved a change in the penal code,
 explicitly making spousal rape a criminal offense. While the
 penal code is established at the federal level, enforcement is
 the responsibility of the cantons. Thus, variations in
 enforcement may occur.
 Italian and Romansch linguistic minorities (respectively about
 10 and 1 percent of the population) express concern that the
 limited resources made available to them by the Federal
 Government endanger the continued quality of these languages.
 The Federal Council proposed a constitutional amendment in 1991
 to bolster support for the minority languages. The amendment
 would charge the cantons and the Federal Government to protect
 and promote all Swiss languages in the regions in which they
 are spoken. The amendment would also make Romansch an official
 language in communications between the Federal Government and
 Romansch citizens or institutions.
 Employment opportunities and residence permits are limited for
 foreigners; some assert that this reflects racial prejudice and
 discrimination, but these limitations apply to all non-Swiss.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 All workers, including foreign workers in Switzerland, have
 freedom to associate freely, to join unions of their choice,
 and to select their own representatives. However', less than a
 third of the country's labor force belongs to a union today.
 The change from an industrial to a service-based'economy, the
 high standard of living, and an economy at full employment are
 some of the reasons for the decline in union membership.
 Unions are free to publicize their views and determine their
 own policies to represent member interests without government
 interference. Unions may join federations or affiliate with
 international bodies.
 The right to strike is legally recognized, but a unique labor
 peace agreement between unions and employers in existence since
 the 1930's has resulted in fewer than 20 strikes per year since
 1975. Federal employees and most cantonal and local employees
 do not have the right to strike. The only exception is the
 canton of Jura where both local and cantonal authorities have
 the right to strike. There were no strikes of note in 1991
 except the women's strike of June 14 noted in Section 5.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Swiss law gives workers the right to organize and bargain
 collectively and protects them from acts of antiunion
 
 
 1246
 SWITZERLAND
 discrimination. The Government encourages voluntary
 negotiations between employer and worker organizations,
 although for the most part employers and workers alike seek to
 exclude the Government from involving itself in their affairs.
 Officials estimate that 30 to 40 percent of all Swiss workers
 are covered by collective agreements. There are no export
 processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor, although there is no
 specific statute or constitutional ban on it.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment of children is 15 years.
 Children over 13 may be employed in light duties (e.g., helping
 in retail stores) for not more than 9 hours a week during the
 school year and 15 hours otherwise. Employment between ages 15
 and 20 is strictly regulated. For example, youths may not work
 at night, on Sundays, or under hazardous or dangerous
 conditions. These laws are observed in practice and enforced
 through inspections by the Federal Office of Industry, Trades,
 and Labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no national minimum wage. Employer associations and
 unions negotiate industrial wages during the collective
 bargaining process. The Labor Act established a maximum
 45-hour workweek for blue- and white-collar workers in
 industry, offices, and retail trades, and a 50-hour workweek
 for all other workers. The workweek for blue-collar workers in
 most industries is 43 hours and for white-collar workers 40 to
 43 hours. Overtime is limited by law to 120 hours annually.
 The economy is normally at or near full employment. The
 resulting take-home pay provides Swiss workers and their
 families with a standard of living among the highest in the
 world.
 The Labor Act and the Federal Code of Obligations contain
 extensive regulations to protect worker health and safety. The
 regulations are rigorously enforced by the Federal Office of
 Industry, Trades, and Labor, providing a high standard of
 worker health and safety. Female workers may not be employed
 in dangerous work, and women in industrial enterprises may not
 work at night or on Sundays. These special protections for
 women were under review in 1991; the Government proposed to
 eliminate restrictions against female Sunday or weekend work in
 its effort to remove sexist bias from the labor law. There
 were no allegations of worker rights abuses from domestic or
 foreign sources.
