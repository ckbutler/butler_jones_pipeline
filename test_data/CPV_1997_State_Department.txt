 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde is a multiparty parliamentary democracy in which constitutional pow-
 ers are shared between the elected Head of State, President Antonio Mascarenhas
 Monteiro, an independent and the Head of Government, Prime Minister Carlos
 Wahnon Veiga, and his party, the Movement for Democracy (MPD). The MPD has
 an absolute majority in the National Assembly. The principal opposition party, the
 African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV) held power in a one-
 party state from independence in 1975 until 1991. The judiciary is independent.
 The Government controls the police, which have primary responsibility for main-
 tenance of law and order. Some members of the police committed a few human
 rights abuses.
 Cape Verde has a market-based economy but little industry and few exploitable
 natural resources. The country has a long history of economically driven emigration,
 primarily to Western Europe and the United States, and receipts from Cape
 Verdeans abroad remain an important source of income. Even in years of optimum
 rainfall, the country can produce food for only 25 percent of the population, result-
 ingin heavy reliance on international food aid.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse.
 There were isolated cases of police abuse, including beatings, of citizens detained
 on suspicion of criminal activity. Domestic violence, discrimination against women
 and mistreatment of children continued to be serious problems. Although the Gov-
 ernment supported legislation to ameliorate these problems, it failed to adopt, im-
 plement, and enforce policies designed to address the most critical challenges. There
 were instances of media self-censorship, and the authorities sometimes prosecuted

 for criminal libel journalists and editors who published material critical of govern-
 ment officials.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, but there were isolated cases of police
 mistreatment, including beatings, of citizens detained on suspicion of criminal activ-
 ity. Severe overcrowding of prisons is a problem. The Government permits both for-
 mal visits by human rights monitors to prisons and routine visits to individual pris-
 oners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law stipulates that authorities bring
 charges before a judge within 48 hours of arrest. Police may not make arrests with-
 out a court order unless a person is caught in the act of committing a felony. In
 exceptional cases, and with the concurrence of a court official, authorities may de-
 tain persons without charge for up to 5 days. These laws are observed in practice.
 The Ministry of Justice has 40 days to prepare for trial in state security cases
 and may detain persons until trial or for a period not to exceed 1 year. There is
 a functioning system of bail.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for a judiciary inde-
 pendent of the executive branch, and the Government respects this provision in
 practice.
 The judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court and the regonal courts.
 There are five Supreme Court judges, including one appointed by the President, one
 appointed by the National Assembly, and three appointed by the High Council of
 a gstrates. Judges are independent and may not belong to a political party.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial. Defendants are presumed
 to be innocent; they have the right to public, nonjury trial; to counsel; to present
 witnesses; and to appeal verdicts. Free counsel is provided for the indigent. Regional
 courts adjudicate minor disputes on the local level in rural areas. The Ministry of
 Justice and Labor appoints local judges, who are usually prominent local citizens.
 Defendants may appeal regional court decisions to the Supreme Court.
 The judiciary generally provides due process rights. However, there are serious
 delays owing to understaffing, and the right to an expeditious trial is constrained'
 by a seriously overburdened judicial system. A backlog of cases routinely leads to
 trial delays of 6 months.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom to ex-
 press ideas by words, images, or any other means, and for freedom of the press
 without censorship. The Government generally respected these freedoms in practice,
 and there is a substantial independent press. Nevertheless, there was continued
 criticism by independent political figures of the performance of the state-controlled
 television, radio, and print media for their failure to exercise vigorously their mon-
 itoring role in a multiparty system.
 Journalists are independent of government control and are not required to reveal
 their sources. However, self-censorship within government-controlled media, includ-
 ing the national television and radio networks as well as the state-owned newspaper
 Novo Jornal, influences media criticism of the Government. Under broadly inter-
 preted criminal libel laws, the authorities frequently prosecuted and often convicted
 and fired opposition newspaper editors and journalists who published articles criti-
 cal of government officials.
 Government authorization is not needed to establish newspapers, other printed
 publications, or electronic media. Despite the broadly interpreted criminal libel
 laws, independent media outlets experienced no direct pressure in their daily oper-
 ations or business activities. The national radio station broadcasts live National As-
 sembly sessions.
 The Constitution provides for academic freedom, and this right is respected in
 practice.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association without authorization and without
 harassment by the authorities. Throughout the year, labor organizations, opposition
 political parties, civic action groups, and numerous others exercised this right with-
 out government interference or objection.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the freedom of religion and
 the separation of church and State. It also prohibits the State from imposing reli-
 gious beliefs and practices. The Government respects these rights in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigratin, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides citizens with the right to travel and establish resi-
 dence without government restrictions.
 The Constitution provides for repatriation, and the Government respects this in
 practice.
 The Constitution provides for the right of asylum by refugees, and no violations
 have been reported. According to the Human Rights Commission, credible media re-
 ports, and government officials, Nigerian citizens have been subject to discrimina-
 tion by immigration authorities.
 The Government has not formulated specific policies regarding refugees or first
 asylum, and the issue of first asylum has never arisen.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. Power was transferred peace-
 fully by the PAICV to the MPD following free and fair elections in 1991; a second
 general election in 1995 and municipal and presidential elections in 1996 also were
 judged free and fair by international observers.
 The Constitution provides for separation of powers. Cabinet ministers are not re-
 quired to be members of the National Assembly, but they are individually subject
 to confirmation by the President of the Republic. Collectively, they must retain the
 support of a parliamentary majority. The President may dismiss the Government
 with the approval of the Council of the Republic, which is composed of the president
 of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister, the president of the Supreme Court,
 the Attorney General, the president of the Regional Affairs Council, and four private
 members. Referendums may be held under specified circumstances, but they may
 not challenge individual political rights and liberties or the right of opposition par-
 ties to exist and function freely.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice regarding the rights of women or
 members of minorities to vote or to participate in the political process. Women com-
 prise 11 percent of the deputies elected to the National Assembly. There is one fe-
 male cabinet minister.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There is one private human rights groups in Cape Verde-the National Commis-
 sion of the Rights of Man. No major human rights organizations conducted inves-
 tigations during the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 language, or social status. However, the Government does not effectively enforce all
 its provisions, resulting in ongoing discrimination, particularly against women and
 children.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women, including wife beating, remains com-
 mon. Victims rarely report crimes such as rape and spousal abuse to the police.
 Women's organizations are seeking legislation to establish a special family court to
 address crimes of domestic violence and abuse.
 Women continue to face discrimination in several ways. Despite constitutional
 prohibitions against sex discrimination and provisions for full equality, including
 equal pay for equal work, discrimination continues. Women experience difficulties
 in obtaining certain types of employment. Although they are often paid less than
 men, they are making modest inroads in the professions.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination against women in inheritance, family,
 and custody matters. However, largely because of illiteracy, most women are un-
 aware of their rights. Women are often reluctant to seek redress of domestic dis-
 putes in the courts. The Organization of Cape Verdean Women alleges disparate
 treatment in inheritance matters, despite laws calling for equal rights.
 Children.-The Government has prepared studies of social policy priorities and
 legal rights for children and adolescents, and the Cape Verdean Institute for Chil-
 
 
 dren has been restructured in accordance with norms established in the Convention
 on the Rights of the Child to implement its obligations under the Convention. In
 education the Government's priorities include extending mandatory education to 6
 gars for all children, and there has been substantial progress toward this objective.
 health the Government seeks to reduce infant mortality and disease, combat drug
 and alcohol abuse, and discourage teenage pregnancy. Child abuse and mistreat-
 ment are continuing problems, exacerbated by chronic poverty, large unplanned
 families, and traditional high levels of emigration of adult men. Mass media, includ-
 ing government-controlled media, continue to highlight children's problems, includ-
 ing sexual violence against children, juvenile prostitution, and drug abuse as well
 as health and education problems.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate access to public
 buildings or services for the disabled. Job discrimination against the physically dis-
 abled is prohibited. There are no official schools or trained teachers for the disabled,
 although several nongovernmental groups, including an association for the blind,
 are active.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides that workers are legally
 free to form and to join unions without government authorization or restriction.
 There are two umbrella union associations: The Council of Free Labor Unions, com-
 osed of 11 unions with about 14,000 members, and the National Union of Cape
 erde Workers, formed by the former ruling party but operating independenty,
 composed of 14 unions with about 16,000 members. The Government does not inter-
 fere with the activities of these organizations, but both suffer from a shortage of
 funds.
 The Constitution provides union members with the right to strike, and the Gov-
 ernment respects this right. By law an employer must reinstate a worker fired un-
 justly.
 Unions are free to affiliate internationally and have ties with African and inter-
 national trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to organize, to operate without hindrance, and to sign collective work con-
 tracts. Workers and management in the small private sector, as well as in the pub-
 lic sector, reach agreement through collective bargaining. However, as the country's
 largest employer, the Government continues to play the dominant role by setting
 wages in the civil service. It does not fix wages for the private sector, but salary
 levels for civil servants provide the basis for wage negotiations in the private sector.
 A 1991 legislative decree bans antiunion discrimination by employers, with fines
 for offenders. There were no reported cases of such discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is forbidden by law
 and is not practiced.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children and such practices
 are not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 minimum age for employment is 14 years. The law prohibits children under the age
 of 16 from working at night, more than 7 hours per day, or in establishments where
 toxic products are produced; but the Government rarely enforces the law. In practice
 the Ministry of Justice and Labor enforces minimum age laws with limited success,
 and then only in the urban, formal sectors of the economy.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded child labor and such practices are
 not known to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There are no established minimum wage rates
 in the private sector. Large urban private employers link their minimum wages to
 those paid to civil servants which, for an entry level worker, is approximately $110
 (10,418 escudos) per month. The majority of jobs pay wages insufficient to provide
 a worker and family a decent standard of living; therefore, most workers also rely
 on second jobs, extended family help, and subsistence agriculture.
 The maximum legal workweek for adults is 44 hours. While large employers gen-
 erally respect these regulations, many domestic servants and rural workers work
 longer hours.
 The Director General of Labor conducts periodic inspections to enforce proper
 labor practices and imposes fines on private enterprises which are not in conformity
 with the law. However, the Government does not systematically enforce labor laws,
 and much of the labor force does not enjoy their protection. There are few industries
 that employ heavy or dangerous equipment, and work-related accidents are rare.
 
 
 There is no legal provision for workers to remove themselves from unsafe working
 conditions without jeopardy to continued employment.
