 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a longstanding parliamentary democracy under a constitutional mon-
 arch, King Baudouin I whose role is largely ceremonial. The Council of Ministers
 (Cabinet), led by the Prime Minister, is responsible for government decisions. The
 Cabinet holds office as long as it retains the confidence of the bicameral Parliament.
 Of the two chambers of Parliament, the 212 members of the House of Representa-
 tives are directly elected, as are 106 members of the Senate. Of the remaining 77
 Senate seats, 51 are elected by provincial councils, and 26 are elected by fellow Sen-
 ators.
 National, municipal, and judicial police forces bear the primary responsibility for
 domestic security in Belgium. The armed forces play no role in domestic law enforce-
 ment.
 Belgium is a highly industrialized state with a vigorous private sector and with
 government participation n certain industries. An extensive social welfare system
 suportsoa high standard of iving for most Belgians.
 he Cnstitution and laws contain provisions for respect for human rights which
 are observed in practice. The Government is sensitive to allegations of domestic
 human rigts violations. In 1992 the Government made substantial progress in
 clearing crminal court backlogs and reducing the time required to process criminal
 cases, largely through hiring additional magistrates authorized under legislation ap-
 proved in 1991.
 The continued influx of large numbers of refugees sharpened public debate. In re-
 sponse, the Government has increased its efforts to encourage further integration
 of the immigrant population but has yet to adopt a comprehensive strategy to ad-
 dress the challenges posed by continued immigration.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known extrajudicial
 killings.
 b. Disappearance.-Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detentions are not
 known to occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of torture or inhuman treatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Freedom from arbitrary arrest and im-
 orisonment is provided for by law and respected in practice. Arrested persons must
 
 
 716
 be brought before a judge within 24 hours. Pretrial confinement is allowed only
 under certain legally specified circumstances. The premise for such confinement is
 subject to monthly review by a panel of judges, who may extend pretrial detention
 based on carefully circumscribed criteria (e.g., whether, m the court's view the ar-
 rested person would be likely to commit further crimes or attempt to flee the juris-
 diction if released). Arrested persons are allowed prompt access to a lawyer of their
 choosing or, if they cannot afford one, an attorney appointed by the State. Bail ex-
 ists in principle under Belgian law but is rarely granted in practice. Exile is not
 permitted by law and does not occur.
 A 1991 law transferred direction and control of the Gendarmerie (national police
 force) from the Defense Minister to the Ministers of Interior and Justice to make
 the force more responsive to political and judicial authorities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-A fair public trial is assured by law and honored
 in practice. A suspect is formally charged, if the evidence so warrants, once a pre-
 liminary judicial investigatory phase is completed. Charges are clearly and formally
 stated, and there is a presumption of innocence. Defendants have the right to be
 present, the right to counsel (provided at public expense if needed), and the right
 to confront witnesses and present evidence. Convicted defendants enjoy the right of
 appeal. The judiciary's independence is provided for by the Constitution and ob-
 served in practice. Imprisonment for political beliefs is prohibited. Belgium also has
 a system of military tribunals, before which military personnel are tried for both
 military and common law crimes. One civilian judge sits on the panel. The accused
 has the right of appeal to a higher military court. At year's end, the tribunal system
 was undergoing review.
 Under legislation approved in 1991, the government hired additional magistrates
 to expand the criminal court system in order to clear court backlogs and reduce
 processing time. Beginning in 1992, new magistrates were also required to dem-
 onstrate legal knowledge and their qualifications for the position through an exam-
 ination process directed by eminent jurists and legal scholars.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Free-
 dom from arbitrary state interference with pnvacy is guaranteed by law and re-
 spected in practice. Search warrants issued by a judge are required unless the in-
 habitants of a domicile agree to a search. Privacy legislation restricting access to
 data collected by wiretaps was enacted, but legislation permitting wiretaps had not
 cleared Parliament at year's end.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These freedoms are assured by law and re-
 spected in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary and a functioning
 democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press. Aca-
 demic freedom is respected.
 The Government operates several radio and television networks but does not con-
 trol program content. Programs are supervised by boards of directors which rep-
 resent the main political, linguistic, and opinion groups. A government representa-
 tive sits on each board but has no veto power. Private radio and television stations
 operate with government licenses. Almost all homes have access by cable to tele-
 vision from other Western European countries.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Public assembly is subject to
 regulations concerning public order but is otherwise unrestricted. Groups protesting
 government policies or actions are free from harassment and persecution. Permits
 are required for open-air assemblies but are granted routinely; there are restrictions
 on blocking major arteries to and from downtown Brussels and on entering a small
 zone near the Royal Palace and Parliament. Belgians are free to form organizations
 and establish ties to international bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Belgium has a long tradition of religious tolerance. The
 Roman Catholic, Protestant, Anglican, Jewish, and Muslim religions are accorded a
 "recognized' status in   law   and  granted   a  government subsidy. Minority
 "nonr      ized" religions enjoy full freedom to practice and are not subject to har-
 assment or persecution. Organized religions may establish places of worship and
 train numbers of clergy adequate to serve believers. Links may be maintained with
 coreligionists in other countries or a supranational hierarchy, and foreign mission-
 aries may proselytize. By law, all officially "recognized" religions have the right to
 provide teachers to give religious instruction in the schools.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Belgians are free to travel both within Belgium and abroad and may
 return to Belgium at any time. Emigration is not restricted nor is citizenship re-
 yoked for political reasons. Citizens are free to choose their places of work and resi-
 dence. The Government does not force political refugees to return to countries where
 
 
 717
 they face persecution. Responding to a heavy influx of refugees and mounting back-
 logs, Parliament approvedlegislation in 1991 to streamline asylum processing. How-
 ever, large backlogs remain, and lengthy processing delays continue, prompted by
 inadequate resources and a continual influx of new applicants.
 In 1992 the Government extended until 1995 exemptions issued to six municipali-
 ties which, because of the large immigrant proportion of their population (generally
 more than 40 percent), are not required to accept additional foreigners for residence.
 Other municipalities have attempted to prohibit further registrations without the
 approval of the Government. After being threatened with fines by the Government,
 those municipalities continued to accept new foreign residents.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Participation in the democratic political system is open to all adult citizens. Direct
 popular elections for parliamentary seats (excluding 77 of the 183 Senate seats
 el.e-ted by provincial ouncils and   e     rs) are held at least every 4 years
 under a system of universal, secret, and compulsoy suffrage for all adults (18 and
 over). Unweighted voti  (one person/one vote has been in effect since 1919 for men
 and 1949 for wo     .   law andpractice, opposition parties are free to operate
 without constraints or repression. Of the 24 parties competing in national elections
 in November 1991, 14 gained seats in the new Parliament. A new coalition govern-
 ment, the members of which secured 52 percent of the popular vote, was installed
 in March. There are no restrictions, in law or in practice, on the participation of
 women or minorities in government or politics.
 The existence of communities speaking Dutch, French, and German engenders
 significant complexities for the State. All major institutions, including political par-
 ties, are divided along linguistic lines. There are special p rvisions for Dutch-,
 French-, and German-speaking councils at the regional level. Regional and linguistic
 needs are tsken into account in national political and economic decisions.
 Changes in nationality law extending citizenship to offspring and descendants
 born in Belgium to certain foreigners went into effect in January 1992, immediately
 granting Belgian citizenship to approximately 32,000 people.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several active independent human rights groups exist. The Ministry of Justice
 and other governmental agencies are sensitive to allegations of human rights abuses
 and take steps to correct perceived shortcomings in national legislation. No requests
 have been made for outside investigation of the human rights situation in Belgium.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Belgium is a culturally vibrant, pluralistic society in which individual differences
 in general are respected, and linguistic rights in particular are protected. Some 60
 percent of Belgians are native Dutch speakers living primarily in the northern prov-
 inces that constitute Flanders. The 40 percent otion who are French
 speakers live mostly in Brussels and the southern provinces of Wallonia. A small
 minority of German speakers lives along the eastern border. Language differences
 have been the subject of hundreds of laws over the past century leading to a fairly
 rigid structure designed to protect each language group from cultural, economic, or
 political dominance by the others.
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all residents regardless
 of race, sex, religion, language, social status, or ethnic background. Some 27 percent
 of the residents of Brussels, the largest city, are foreigners. Many of these are North
 African and Turkish immigrants. Encouraging the further integration of the immi-
 grant population and coping with rising influxes of asylum seekers and Eastern Eu-
 ropean immigrants continues to be a focus of strong public debate. In response, Par-
 liament enacted legislation establishing a Center for Racial Equality charged with
 addressing integration issues and promoting a dialog between ethnic groups.
 The immigrant influx has also prompted the growth of the extreme rightist, open-
 ly anti-immigrant Flemish political party, "V-aams Blok." Drawing on increased
 support that saw its parliamentary delegation rise from 3 to 12 in the 1991 elec-
 tions, this party continues to call for repatriation of immigrants to their native
 lands. However, Belgium has not experienced concerted, overt campaigns of violence
 directed at asylum centers or hostels. Critics charged that government failure to en-
 force a law controlling expressions of racism and xenophobia prompted more aggres-
 sively intolerant actions towards immigrants. In response, the Government stated
 that during the next legislative session it planned to revise evidentiary require-
 ments which currently hinder prosecutions under the law. The size and scope of fu-
 ture immigration continues to be a sensitive political topic, and many underlying
 
 
 issues regarding integration of existing immigrant populations have yet to be ad-
 dressed.
 Belgium is an advocate of women's rights, both within the country and in inter-
 national meetings on the subject. A number of commissions have been established
 to ensure that women's rights are protected and to oversee women's education and
 working conditions. A royal decree outlawing sexual harassment in the workplace
 became effective in both the public and private sectors on October 17. Work on a
 government-financed women's center is expected to be completed in May 1994.
 Physical abuse of women ispunishable by law, and the law is enforced. In reac-
 tion to a 1988 government study which concluded that 25 percent of Belgian women
 had encountered some form of physical abuse, new legislation on sexual abuse was
 enacted in 1989, broadening the scope of the previous legislation to allow for pros-
 ecution of conjugal sexual abuse and toughening penalties. Certain sexual abuse
 cases may be tried before a court of assizes, a higher instance than the usual dis-
 trict court.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to associate freely and to
 strike. However, in certain narrowly defined circumstances, such as the provision
 of essential public services, public employees' right to strike is not explicitly recog-
 nized. Belgium has a highly unionized work force (estimated at 70 percent) and a
 long tradition of democratic work council elections. Unions striking or protesting
 government policies or actions are free from harassment and persecution. Signifi-
 cant strikes in 1992 occurred in the health care, transportation, metal, teaching,
 and shipyard sectors.
 Labor unions are strong and independent of the Government but have important
 informal links with, and influence on, many of the major political parties. Unions
 in Belgium are affiliated with the major international bodies representing labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Barain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is recognized and exercised freely. Every other year, manage-
 ment and the unions negotiate a nationwide collective bargaining agreement, cover-
 ing 2.4 million private sector workers, which establishes the framework for negotia-
 tions at plant and branch level for the subsequent 2 years.
 The right to due process and judicial review are guaranteed for all protected activ-
 ity. Effective mechanisms exist for a~judicating disputes between labor and manage-
 ment. Belgium maintains a system of labor tribunals and regular courts which hear
 disputes arising from labor contracts, collective bargaining agreements, and other
 matters.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of children is 15, but there is compulsory schooling until the age of 18. New legisla-
 tion was adopted in 1992 tightening conditions of child labor in entertainment and
 related occupations. The labor courts effectively monitor compliance with national
 laws and standards.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage rates are set in biennial
 nationwide negotiations between the leading trade unions and the Belgian Business
 Federation. After agreement is reached, a formal collective bargaining agreement is
 signed by the National Labor Council and is made mandatory upon the entire pri-
 vate sector by royal decree. In the public sector, the minimum wage is determined
 through negotiations between the Government and the public service unions. These
 wages provide an adequate standard of living for full-time workers and their fami-
 lies.
 A maximum 40-hour week is mandated by law, although many collective bargain-
 ing agreements call for workweeks between 36 and 39 hours.
 Comprehensive health and safety legislation is supplemented by collective bar-
 gaining agreements on safety issues. The Labor Ministry implements this legislation
 through a team of inspectors and determines whether a worker qualifies for disabil-
 ity and medical benefits. Health and safety committees are mandated by law in
 companies with more than 50 employees and by works councils in companies with
 more than 100 employees. Labor courts effectively monitor compliance with national
 laws and standards.
