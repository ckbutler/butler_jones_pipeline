 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Equatorial Guinea is ruled by President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo
 who, in 1979, as Vice Ministep of Defense, overthrew Francisco
 Macias, the ruthless dictator, of the country from its
 independence in 1968. In 1982 a constitution was promulgated,
 and Obiing officially declared the Government to be civilian.
 In 1986 he established Equatorial Guinea's sole legal political
 party, the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (DPEG). In
 1989 Obiang staged the first presidential election since 1968;
 as the only candidate, he was elected to a 7-year term. In a
 November 1991 referendum, Obiang submitted to the electorate a
 new Constitution which was not made readily available to the
 public but was approved by 98.38 percent of those voting,
 according to the GoverMent. While providing for a multiparty
 system, the new Constitution, which became law in December, was
 on balance probably a step backwards for individual liberties
 because it entrenched presidential powers and specifically
 granted Obiang lifetime immunity from any legal proceeding.
 As the country's most senior military officer, Brigadier
 General Obiang dominates both the military and civilian
 branches of the State, personally holding six cabinet
 portfolios, including Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Mines and
 Petroleum. Obiang's Esangui clan and fellow Fang from the
 Mongomo area hold an estimated 50 of the 70 most senior
 official positions in the country.
 Civilian and military security branches are responsible for
 public order, augmented by a presidential guard of 400 to 600
 men provided by Morocco. These forces historically have
 committed the majority of human rights abuses, reportedly often
 at the behest of senior government officials, who commonly have
 been present at torture and interrogation sessions.
 Equatorial Guineans live mainly by subsistence agriculture,
 hunting, and fishing. Per capita annual income is
 approximately $457. The small wage economy, based on cocoa,
 lumber, and coffee, has not recovered from the devastation
 caused by the death or exodus of thousands of trained and
 educated citizens during the Macias era, although a very small
 middle class has emerged in recent years. The country remains
 heavily dependent on foreign aid.
 Almost the entire spectrum of human rights continued to be
 tightly restricted. Despite President Obiang's monopoly on
 power, there were growing public pressures to institute a
 multiparty political system. Most of those actively involved
 in opposition activity have been from the professional classes
 of all ethnic groups, majority Fang from outside of the Mongomo
 area as well as Bubi, Ndowe, Combe, Annobonese, and other
 minorities. The Government responded both by arresting,
 detaining, and torturing its opponents, and, at a special DPEG
 congress in August, by promising to institute carefully
 controlled political reform from the top. By the end of the
 year, through the new Constitution, Obiang seemed ready to
 permit limited political opposition as long as it did not
 present a real challenge to his power. As 1991 ended, however,
 security forces had not relaxed their harassment of dissidents,
 arresting at least 24 in Bata at the end of November and
 another 3 late in December, and no opposition party had been
 recognized.

 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 .Freedom from:
 a. Political and'Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No political killings were reported in 1991. One person
 accused of witchcraft was tortured and beaten to death by
 police (dee Section l.c.).
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 Police and other security forces continued routinely to
 administer torture and other cruel forms of mistreatment to'
 prisoners. Authorities employed a wide variety of techniques,
 including severe beatings with sticks and whips,,electric
 shocks, hanging victims by their feet or arms, and applying hot
 pepper sauce to sensitive areas of the anatomy. Physical as
 well as psychologidal torture was.used routinely as an aid in
 interrogation and to intimidate and punish prisoners.
 In July Manuel Nguema, Gasparo Asama, and Diosdado Nsue Abaga
 were tortured for causing death by witchcraft. Nguema,
 Equatorial Guinea's'Cdnsul- at Calabar, had been home on leave
 when his niece called out his name in her.dying delirium. Al
 three men were accubed, detained, and tortured. Nsue, who was
 detained and tortured a second time, died as a result. Three
 women who i~terceded ouT Nsue's behalf were stripped by police
 and brutally mistreated. Subsequently, four policemen were
 convicted and sentence& to 8 to 10 years in prison for their
 involvement in Nsue's death. A traditional healer also  .
 convicted in the case was given a light sentence-and released
 after a few days, presumably because she was the wife and
 sister of senior government officials. The police officer who
 directed the beating wasnot punished.
 In August the six men still imprisoned for participation in an'
 alleged 1988 coup plot were beaten with whips at Bata prison
 and subsequently denied medical attention.
 Prison conditions continued to be extremely harsh. Basic
 amenities were rarely provided, and prisoners''essential needs
 were largely supplied by their families or friends. The
 Government is reported to provide only a single loaf of bread
 per prisoner per day.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Despite constitutional provisions, there was little enforcement
 of the rights of persons in detention to be charged or released
 within a reasonable period of time, to have access to a lawyer,
 or to be released on bail. Arbitrary arrests by security
 forces or police are commonplace, ofter on spurious charges, in
 order to extort money or to gain personal revenge. Many
 detainees are held incommunicado, although the right to habeas
 corpus and application for pretrial release are provided for in
 the Constitution. The number of detainees--political as well
 as criminal--held at the'end of 1991 was not known.
 
 
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 The Government uses arbitrary arrest, interrogation, torture,
 and banishment to remote villages to intimidate dissidents and
 keep a viable opposition from forming. In May Alfonso Nsue
 Mokuy, chief of special programming at Equatorial Guinea Radio
 and Television; Eusebio Abaga Ondo Maye, former ambassador to
 the Soviet Union; and three other prominent officials accused
 of supporting political pluralism were detained, interrogated
 at security headquarters in Malabo, and banished to their home
 villages. The banishment was rescinded after a short time. In
 a similar case, Ricardo Nvu Mba was banished in February to his
 home village where he remained at year's end.
 In August, less than 2 weeks before a scheduled visit to
 Equatorial Guinea by Spanish President Felipe Gonzalez, three
 persons, including a journalist, were detained for several days
 and fined after being interviewed by a visiting Spanish
 journalist.
 Several persons living in Luba on Bioko Island, including the
 Luba DPEG chief, the municipal secretary, and the director of
 the public school, were accused of causing a death through
 witchcraft, detained for more than a month, and tortured. They
 were eventually released without charge.
 Jesus Ela Abeme, former ambassador to France, was detained on
 suspicion of distributing antigovernment literature, tortured,
 held at security headquarters in Malabo for several weeks, and
 then released without being formally charged.
 The Government continues to maintain that it encourages exiles
 to return to Equatorial Guinea, assuring them that they will
 not be persecuted. At the same time, however, the Government
 makes it clear that political activity outside the sole legal
 party will not be tolerated. In November, 24 politically
 related exiles from Libreville were arrested on their return
 and held without charge for several weeks. Although they
 reportedly had returned to participate in the multiparty system
 announced in the new Constitution, most were eventually sent to
 their home villages and warned to remain there and not to
 become further involved in politics. There were credible
 reports during December of continued harassment of people who
 wished to participate in political groupings under the new
 Constitution. Harassment took the form of surveillance, brief
 detentions, summary dismissals from government employment, and
 evictions from government-owned housing.
 In July the Secretary General of the Reformed Church of
 Equatorial Guinea, Jaime Sipoto, led a delegation to Geneva to
 attend a conference of Equatorial Guinean exiles and human
 rights and religious organizations. Upon returning to
 Equatorial Guinea, Sipoto presented to President Obiang a
 proposal for a committee of conference participants to visit
 Equatorial Guinea to arrange for the return and reintegration
 of the exiles. The proposal also included a plan for
 democratic reform in Equatorial Guinea.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is a formal court structure, with the Supreme Court at
 the apex, and also military and customary (traditional) court
 systems. Traditional laws and customs are honored in the
 formal court system when not in conflict with national law.
 The tribunal provided for in the Constitution to decide
 constitutional issues has never been established; in the
 meantime, the council of State--appointed by the President and
 
 
 113
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 responsible to him-is empowered to rule on bonstitutional
 questions. Under the Constitution, military tribunals hear all
 capital cases.
 There is no separation between the executive and the judiciary,
 and Supreme Court justices serve at the pleasure of the
 President. The executive branch acts with little respect or
 understanding for judicial independence. The nation's mixture
 of traditibnal law, military law, and Spanish rules and
 procedures combines to produce an inconsistent system of
 justice. Judges and court officials are poorly trained. There
 is little concept of due process, and appellate proceedings are
 virtually nonexistent. Defendants unable to afford legal
 counsel stand little chance of acquittal. The fact that the
 few lawyers (approximately 20) in the country depend on their
 connections to the Government for a livelihood raises questions
 about the impartiality of the defense their clients might
 receive.-
 The Government appears to use charges of "kong" (traditional
 witchcraft which is believed can cause injury or death).to jail
 those suspected of engaging in proscribed political activity as
 well as to gain personal revenge. Since the statutes of
 Equatorial Guinea do-not refer to witchcraft, such cases are
 reportedly handled outside the normal court system by the
 Director General of National Security, Armengol Ondo Nguema
 (President Obiang's brother), and Ricardd Mangue, Chief of the
 Appellate Court. In February 1990, the mayor of Ebebiyin and
 five others were ordered imprisoned for periods of 4 to 23
 years. Although no public trial was held, the men are believed
 to have been accused of causing the death by "kong" of a
 brother of the mayor, who was killed in a road accident. The
 real reason for their arrest and incarceration is reliably
 reported to be that they were attempting to form an opposition
 political party. Apparently all six were released from prison
 late in 1991.
 The number of political and security prisoners held at the end
 of 1991 was not known. Two of the six men held in connection
 with the' 1988 coup plot were freed from prison as part of a
 limited prisoner release ordered by President Obiang. The six
 had been convicted in unfair trials. Venancio Miko, imprisoned
 since 1983 on charges of plotting a coup, was released at about
 the same time.
 In 199(f Spain and the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC) jointly financed a visit to Equatorial Guinea by two
 senior Spanish judges to review the court system and civil
 registry and to make recommendations for improving them. The
 judges presented a report to the UNHRC in Geneva and to the
 Governments of Spain and Equatorial Guinea. The report
 recommended measures to improve Equatorial Guinea's judicial
 system and respect for human rights. Spain also agreed to
 train judges who would then serve on the Supreme Court. There
 has been no followup to the report on the part of the
 Government of Equatorial. Guinea, although the establishment of
 an official human rights commission may have been one outcome
 of their visit (see Section 4).
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government sometimes places under surveillance persons it
 deems suspicious. While many believe telephone conversations
 are routinely monitored, there seems to be no deliberate
 
 
 114
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 interference with correspondence. Although required by the
 Constitution, search warrants are not normally used.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Public criticism of the Government is not tolerated. Several
 employees of the government radio and television service were
 detained for talking to a foreign journalist. In another case,
 a journalist was threatened with death by a senior government
 press official for filing a report which the official claimed
 misrepresented President Obiang's views. The Government owns a
 small occasional newspaper and the only television and radio
 stations. Domestic news is government produced and contains no
 criticism of the Government. International news items are
 generally supplied by the Spanish agency EFE and other sources.
 Distribution of foreign publications critical of the Government
 is forbidden. Several persons were arrested or restricted to
 their home villages for possession of the Spanish weekly
 newsmagazine Cambio 16 containing articles critical of the
 Government of Equatorial Guinea.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Despite constitutional provisions guaranteeing these freedoms,
 the Government continues to ban opposition political
 organizations and assemblies. Private nonpolitical groups,
 such as professional organizations, churches, and sports
 groups, require government approval to hold meetings.
 c. Freedom of. Religion
 With one exception, freedom of religion is generally
 respected. Jehovah's witnesses, originally banned from the
 country in 1985 and harassed in 1986 and 1987, are still
 prohibited from practicing their religion. Christianity,
 mainly Roman Catholicism, is the predominant religion, often.
 interspersed with traditional religions. The Islamic and
 Baha'i faiths are also practiced openly. In general, active
 proselytizing by Protestant denominations is discouraged, but
 conversions are permitted. Government permission must be
 obtained to open new places of worship. Foreign clergy and
 missionaries continue to have an active role in educational
 development. All denominations are allowed to participate in
 charitable as well as religious activities.
 A religious law promulgated in June forbade ministers of
 religion to criticize the Government or state organizations in
 their sermons. The new law seemed to be aimed at the Roman
 Catholic Church, since some of its clergy, including the late
 Archbishop of Malabo Raphael Nze Abuy, who died in July, had
 publicly criticized the Government and called for greater
 openness in the country and respect for human rights.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens and residents of Equatorial Guinea generally may
 travel freely within the country, but permits are needed to
 visit Mount Basile, just south of Malabo, where a
 communications center is situated, and Moka in the southern
 part of Bioko Island. Police, who are poorly paid and trained,
 often extort small payments for passage through traffic
 checkpoints on major roads. At times police become abusive and
 
 
 S115
 
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA.
 refused without valid.reason to permit travelers to pass
 checkpoints. There are restrictions on-travel abroad,
 including lengthy delays in obtaining passports. Both citizens
 and residents of Equatorial Guinea must-obtain exit permits,
 issued by the security police, to leave--the country. Many
 Equato-Guineans leave the country without formal documentation
 for both economic and political reasons and reside abroad,
 mostly in Gabon, Cameroon, Spain, and France.
 The Government publicly encourages Equato-Guineans abroad to
 return, but in 1991 few did so. Severo Moto, exiled leader of
 the Progressive Party, was denied the right to return to his
 native country when the Equatorial Guinean Embassy in Madrid
 refused to renew-his passport. Moto was also belittled by name
 in the-government-run press.
 There' are a. number of workers from other African countries in
 Equatorial Guinea. These workers sometimes must resort-to
 bribery to obtain legal registration but generally are free to
 work and travel within the country.
 Section 3 Respect for.Political Rights: The.Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people-of Equatorial Guinea do not have the right to change
 their government by democratic means; President Obiang's
 party, DPEG, is the only political party allowed to function as
 of the end of 1991. Since its founding in 1986, only party
 members have been permitted to. be candidates in local.as well
 as nationaT elections. -The legislature is subordinate to the
 executive with no independent authority; all governors are
 Appointed and removed by the President; all locally elected
 officials serve at the pleasure of the,President-as well.
 Nevertheless, there was growing public pressure throughout the
 year, especially from the small professional class, to adopt a
 multiparty political system. Obiang called a national
 referendum on November 17 which-approved a new Constitution--
 reportedly by 98.38 percent 'of those voting. The Constitution
 permits a multiparty system and separates the office of the
 Chief of State, who would remain the, President, from that of
 the Head of Government, which would be a revamped'office of
 Prime Minister. The Constitution entrenched presidential power
 and granted Obiang lifelong legal immunity for his actions
 before, during, and after his term of office. The text of the
 Constitution was not made public until after the referendum.
 At the end of the year, security forces continued to harass
 political dissidents as well as families of exiles involved in
 politics abroad.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In September 1990, citing an Amnesty International (AI) report
 on torture in Equatorial Guinea, President Obiang announced
 formation of a human rights commission. He did not name the
 members of the commission until February 1991, and the
 commission did not hold its first meeting until September.
 Seven of 14 members are also members of the House of People's-
 Representatives (two of these are also ministers). At year's
 end it appeared the commission would have largely a ceremonial
 role. At the invitation of President Obiang, the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission specialist, Volio Jimenez,
 madean extensive trip in Novemker during which he was given
 access to prisons. His report is expected to be made public in
 1992.
 
 
 116
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although the law calls for equal treatment for all citizens,
 ethnic groups are not granted the same rights and privileges.
 The Fang comprise 75 percent of the population, the Bubi 15
 percent, and other groups the remainder." A small number of
 Fang clans, especially those of the President and relatives by
 marriage, dominate all aspects of government, the military, and
 social life. Discrimination against the Bubi and Fernandino of
 Bioko Island, as well as the Ndowe and associated coastal
 groups from the continent, is consistent, whether in the
 granting of political office or the approval of academic
 scholarships. There are, however, members of minority groups
 in positions of prominence but with little real authority,
 e.g., a Bubi has held the office of Prime Minister since 1982,
 and the President of the House of People's Representatives is a
 member of the Benga ethnic group from the island of Corisco.
 Women are confined by custom to traditional roles, especially
 in agriculture. Polygamy, which is widespread, contributes to
 the secondary status given to women in society. According to
 the Government, boys and girls, once they gain admission, are
 equally likely to complete secondary school. However,
 according to recent U.N. data, females in Equatorial Guinea
 receive only one-fifth as much schooling as males. The
 Constitution and laws guarantee equal rights for women, and
 there is no legal discrimination in employment, though women
 are largely excluded from some fields, such as the military, by
 tradition. The Ministry for the Promotion of Women focuses on
 agriculture, handicrafts, and professional training. It is
 interested in developing women's agricultural cooperatives and
 enrolling more women in the school of professional training in
 Malabo.
 According to medical professionals, violence against women,
 particularly wife beating, is common. Child abuse is
 uncommon. The Government has not addressed violence as an
 issue and looks to the Ministry for the Promotion of Women to
 advance the interests of women in Equatorial Guinean society.
 According to the medical community, female circumcision is not
 practiced in Equatorial Guinea.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers do not have the right of free.association. In the
 small wage economy, no labor organizations exist, although
 there are a few cooperatives with limited power. Strikes are
 prohibited by law.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no legislation regarding these rights or addressing
 antiunion discrimination and no evidence of collective
 bargaining by any group. Wages are set by the Government and
 the employers, with little or no input by workers. The
 employer must meet the minimum wage set by the Government, and
 most companies pay above the government-established minimum.
 There are no export processing'or free trade zones.
 
 
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor and slavery are prohibited by law, and slavery
 does not exist in Equatorial Guinea. However, persons detained
 without formal charges at Blackbich prison and security
 headquarters in Malabo and the police station in Luba during
 1991 were forced to do day labor on the farms, at residential
 construction sites, and in businesses of senior government
 officials
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The legal minimum age for employment is 16, but there is no
 enforcement of this law. Children younger than 16 commonly
 assist.families with agricultural production and sales.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is only a small industrial sector in the country. Most
 salaried employment is provided by the Government, construction
 companies,.businesses providing retail goods and services, and
 the plantation agricultural sector. In April 1990, the
 Government increased the statutory minimum wage rates for
 .workers in-nnagricultural sectors. The minimum wage law is
 not widely enforced, and government employees are exempted from
 its provisions. The minimum wage by itself does not provide a
 worker and family with a decent living, and most of those with
 regular salaried income have to supplement their earnings with
 income from other sources or by farming. The law limits the
 regular workweek to 48 hours and guarantees employees 1 rest
 day per week, plus regularly scheduled national holidays. The
 Labor Code offers comprehensive protection for workers.from
 occupational hazards, but it is not effectively enforced.
 Safety and health-committees which are explicitly sanctioned by
 the Code do not function, and employees who protest unhealthful
 or dangerous working conditions risk losing their jobs.
