 GERMANY
 The Federal Republic of Germany is a constitutional parliamentary democracy
 with an independent judiciary; citizens periodically choose their representatives in
 free and fair multiparty elections. The head of the Federal Government, the Chan-
 cellor, is elected by the lower house of Parliament. The powers of the Chancellor
 and of the Parliament are set forth in the Basic Law (Constitution). The 16 states
 enjoy significant autonomy, especially as concerns law enforcement and the courts,
 education, the environment, and social assistance. The judiciary is independent.
 Law enforcement is primarily a responsibility of state governments, and the police
 are organized at the state level. The jurisdiction of the Federal Criminal Office is
 limited to counter-terrorism, international organized crime, especially narcotics traf-
 ficking, weapons smuggling, and currency counterfeiting. Police forces in general are
 well trained, disciplined, and mindful of citizens' rights, although there were in-
 stances of alleged police abuse.
 Germany has a well-developed industrial economy that provides its citizens with
 a high standard of living. Although plagued in the past few years by sluggish
 growth, the economy is slowly recovering. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth
 was estimated to reach 2.25 percent in 1997, mostly due to increased exports, and
 growth for 1998 was expected to reach as high as 3 percent. Despite these optimistic
 growth prospects, unemployment affects women disproportionately more than men.
 Unemployment remains a volatile political issue, especially as Germany prepares for
 the fall 1998 elections.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse.
 However there were continued allegations of police abuse, especially against for-
 eigners. Violence and harassment directed at foreigners continued to occur. While
 there was only a slight increase in the overall number of antiforeigner crimes during
 
 
 1095
 the first 6 months of 1997, compared with the first 6 months of 1996, the number
 of violent antiforeigner crimes rose by 11 percent. This marked a change in what
 had been a downward trend since 1992.
 Anti-Semitic incidents increased by 9 percent in the first 6 months. Most involved
 graffiti, the distribution of anti- Semitic materials, or the display of symbols of
 banned organizations. The overwhelming majority of the perpetrators of attacks on
 foreigners or anti-Semitic adts were frustrated, largely aplitical youths and a small
 core of rightwing extremists. All the major political parties and all the highest offi-
 cials of thie Federal Republic condemn mistreatment of foreigners and anti-Semitic
 acts.
 Women continue to face wage discrimination in the private sector, as do members
 of minorities and foreigners. The Government is taking serious steps to address the
 problem of violence against women and children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government officials.
 On November 18, prosecution began of Yasser Mohammed Shraydi, Ali Chanaa
 (alias Alba) and his former wife, Verena Helga Chanaa (a German national), and
 his wife's sister, Andrea Haeusler (also a German) in the case of the Aprnil 1986
 bombing of the Berlin discotheque La Belle. The attack killed one Turkish citizen
 and two U.S. citizens, and injured 230 persons.
 On April 10, the trial dealing with the September 1992 murders in Berlins
 Mykonos restaurant of four Iranian Kurdish opposition figures came to an end. Four
 of the five defendants, an Iranian and three Lebanese, were found guilty. Two re-
 ceived life prison sentences, one received 11 years in prison, and another received
 5 years and 3 months in prison. The Berlin court concluded that the highest levels
 of Iran's political leadership had ordered the killings. In the wake of the decision,
 the Government suspended its "critical dialog" with fran and recalled its ambas-
 sador. Authorities decided not to pursue a high-level investigation of the "Commit-
 tee for Special Operations" of Iran s leaders that the court accused of masterminding
 the shootings.
 In August three former East German Politburo officials, Egon Krenz, Guenter
 Schabowski, and Guenter Kleiber, were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 3
 to 6  years for their roles in issuing orders that resulted in the shooting of persons
 who attempted to flee from the former East Germany. The sentencing of these
 former high-level civilian officials capped an effort to hold East German officials re-
 sponsible for hundreds of killings which began with the prosecution of former East
 German border guards who were directly responsible for shootings on the border.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 In May a court found Markus Wolf, a high ranking state security official of the
 former East Germany, guilty on 4 counts of kidnaping, including orchestrating the
 abduction of a former East German state security agent who had escaped to the
 West. Wolf received a 2-year suspended sentence.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and the authorities generally respect this in prac-
 tice.
 However, there continue to be serious allegations of excessiv  e of force by the
 police, especially against foreigners. In July the Council of Europe published a re-
 port of a delegation that toured detention facilities in Germany in 1996.The delega-
 tion heard no allegations of abuse of persons in custody but did note allegations of
 excessive use of force during apprehensions. Also in July, Amnesty International
 published a report that found a continuing pattern of police ill-treatment," largely
 affecting foreigners.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Basic Law prohibits arbitrary arrest,
 detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition. A person can only
 be arrested on the basis of an arrest warrant issued by a competent judicial author-
 ity, unless the person is caught in the act of committing a crime, or the police have
 strong reason to believe the person intends to commit a crime. Any person detained
 by police must be brought before a judge and charged by the day after arrest. The
 court must then issue an arrest warrant stating the grounds for detention or order
 the person's release. Police often detain known or suspected right- and leftwing radi-
 cals for brief periods, when the polic believe such individuals intend to participate
 in illegal or unauthorized demonstrations. For example, in August police detained
 
 
 1096
 about 200 persons suspected of heading for illegal rallies to mark the 10th anniver-
 sary of the death of Rudolf Hess (see Section 5). The rules governing this type of
 detention are different in each state, with authorized periods of detention ranging
 from 1 to 14 days, provided judicial concurrence is given within 24 hours of initial
 apprehension.
 If there is evidence that a suspect might flee the country, police may detain the
 suspect for up to 24 hours pending a formal charge. The right of free access to legal
 counsel has been restricted only in the cases of terrorists suspected of having used
 contacts with lawyers to continue terrorist activity while in prison. Only judges may
 decide on the validity of any deprivation of liberty. Bail exists but is seldom em-
 poed; the usual practice is to release detainees unless there is clear danger of
 flI   outside the country.
 Tere is no use of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Basic Law provides for an independent judici-
 aryand the Government respects this provision in practice.
 e court system is highly developed and provides full legal protection and nu-
 merous possibilities for judicial review. Ordinary courts have jurisdiction in criminal
 and civil matters. There are four levels of such courts (local courts, regional courts,
 higher regional courts, and the Federal Court of Justice), with appeals possible from
 lower to higher levels. In addition, there are four types of specialized courts: Admin-
 istrative, labor, social, and fiscal courts. These courts are also established on dif-
 ferent levels, with the possibility for appeal to the next higher level.
 Separate from these five branches of jurisdiction is the Federal Constitutional
 Court, which is not only the country's supreme court but an organ of the Constitu-
 tion with special functions defined in the Basic Law. Among other things, it reviews
 laws to ensure their compatibility with the Constitution and adjudicates disputes
 between constitutional organs on questions of competencies. It also has jurisdiction
 to hear and decide claims based on the infringement of a person's basic constitu-
 tional rights by a public authority.
 The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process, although
 there are complaints that court proceedings are sometimes delayed due to ever in-
 creasing caseloads.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Basic Law prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these
 prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Basic Law provides for freedom of the
 press, and the Government respects this right in practice. There is no official censor-
 ship. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic po-
 litical system combine to ensure freedom of speech and the press, including aca-
 demic freedom. Propaganda of Nazi and other proscribed organizations, as well as
 statements endorsing nazism, are illegal.
 The authorities have sought to block what they consider dangerous material on
 the Internet. However, in June a local court in Berlin dismissed charges against pol-
 itician Angela Marquardt, who had provided an electronic link on her Internet home
 page to a leftist magazine that published articles about techniques for making
 bombs and derailing trains. The judge's ruling was based on fairly narrow legal
 points. In July Parliament passed a law to prohibit access to prohibited material
 on the Internet (for example, child pornography and Nazi propaganda), which took
 effect on August 1. The law's implications regarding possible liability of on-line serv-
 ice providers are not yet clear.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice. The Basic Law permits ban-
 ning Organizations whose activities are found to be illegal or opposed to the liberal
 democratic order as established by the Basic Law. A 1950's ruling by the Federal
 Constitutional Court outlawed a neo-Nazi and a Communist party. A number of
 other organizations that authorities generally classify as rightwing or leftwing, for-
 eign extremist, or criminal, are banned. State governments may outlaw only organi-
 zations that are active solely within their state, with activities crossing state bound-
 aries coming under federal jurisdiction. In August the state of Brandenburg banned
 the Kameradschaft Oberhavel as a rightwing organization, and in September the
 state of Bremen banned the Bremer Volkskulturverein as a foreign extremist orga-
 nization. In addiiton, several hundred organizations were under observation by the
 federal and state offices for the Protection of the Constitution (OPC). The OPCs are
 charged with examining possible threats to the democratic system; they have no law
 
 
 1097
 enforcement powers, and OPC monitoring by law may not interfere with the organi-
 zations' continued activities.
 c. Freedom of Reliion.-The Basic Law specificallyprovides for religious freedom,
 and the Government respects this right in practice. Most religious organizations are
 granted tax-exempt status. In order to obtain this status, state-level authorities
 must find that the organization operates on a nonprofit basis and contributes so-
 daily, spiritually, or materially to society.
 Beyond the basic tax-exempt status, state governments grant certain religious
 groups "public-law corporation" status. This status entitles aa organization to levy
 taxes on its members; the taxes are collected by the state and distributed propor-
 tionaly to the religious group's enrolled membership. State governments also sub-
 sidize various institutions affiliated with such public-law corporations, such as
 schools and hospitals. In order to attain public-law corporation status, a religious
 organization much show that its constitution and membership offer an assurance of
 its permanency. Although commonly thought to include only the Lutheran and
 Roman Catholic churches, Jewish congregati~ons, and a few small free churches, the
 number of religious groups that have acquired public law corporation status is sig-
 nificantly larger.
 In July the Federal Administrative Court in Berlin upheld a decision of the Berlin
 state government that had denied Jehovah's Witnesses public-law corporation status
 in that state. The court concluded that the church did not offer the "indispensable
 loyalty" towards the democratic state "essential for lasting cooperation," because, for
 example, it forbade its members from participating in public elections. Jehovah's
 Witnesses are appealing this ruling in the Constitutional Court.
 One Christian Charismatic Church led by an American pastor reported that it
 had been subjected over several years to vandnlism, threats of violence, and public
 harassment or scrutiny by sect commissioners. The church is challenging a 1995 rul-
 ing by authorities in Colone, who revoked its tax exempt status on the grounds
 that it was not a charitable organization and did not contribute to the cultural, reli-
 gious, or spiritual values of German society.
 The Church of Scientology continued to be the focus of debate. Scientology has
 come under increasing scrutiny by both federal and state officials who contend that
 it s not a religion but an economic enterprise. Authorities have sometimes sought
 to deregister Scientology organizations previously registered as nonprofit associa-
 tions and require them to register as commercial enterprises. In November the Fed-
 eral Administrative Court in Berlin, in sending an     appeal concerning the
 deregistration of a Scientology organization in the state of  aen Wuerttemberg
 back to a lower level for further review, declared that a registered nonprofit associa-
 tion, religious or otherwise, could engage in entrepreneurial activities as long as
 these were only supplementary and collateral to its nonprofit goals. The case contin-
 ues in the lower court.
 Some government officials allege that Scientology's goals and methods are anti-
 democratic and call for further restrictions on Scientology-affliated organizations
 and individuals. In June authorities of the federal and state Offices for the Protec-
 tion of the Constitution (OPC) agreed to place the Church of Scientology under ob-
 servation for i year because of concerns raised by some offices that there were indi-
 cations that Scientology may pose a threat to democracy. Under the observation de-
 cision, OPC officials will seek to collect information mostly from written materials
 and first hand accounts to assess whether a "threat" exists. More intrusive methods
 would be subject to legal checks and would require evidence of involvement in trea-
 sonous or terrorist activity. One State, Scheswig-Holstein, announced in August it
 had decided not to implement such observation, on the grounds that the situation
 did not appear to justify such measures. While Federal Interior Minister Manfred
 Kanther supported the decision on observation, in a written response to an inquiry
 from the Bavarian state government, Kanther indicated that he did not see suffi-
 cient evidence to support a ban on Scientology.
 Most maornmen      parties continued to exclude Scientologists from membership
 arguing that Scientology is not a religion but a for-profit organization whose goals
 and principles are anti emocratic ano thus incompatible with those of the political
 parties, although there has been only one known instance of enforcement of this
 ban. In July a Bonn state of     corn e is court challenge toat is exclusion, upheld
 the December 1996 expulsion of three Scientologists from a state-level organization
 of the governing Christian Democratic Union party, ruling that a political party had
 the right to exclude from its organization those persons who do not identify them-
 selves with the party's basic goas.
 Scientologists continued to report discrimination, alleging both government-con-
 doned and societal harassment. So-called "sect-falters," statements by individuals
 that they are not affiliated with Scientology, are used by some businesses and other
 
 
 1098
 organizations to discriminate against Scientologists in business and social dealings.
 Scientologists assert that business firms whose owners or executives are
 Scientologists, as well as artists who are Church members, have faced boycotts and
 discrimination, sometimes with state and local government approval. Other Church
 members have reported employment difficulties and, in the state of Bavaria, appli-
 cants for state civil service positions are screened for Scientology membership. Sev-
 eral states have published pamphlets warning of alleged dangers posed by Scien-
 tology. In October a Berlin hotel and a firm renting meeting space reportedly re-
 fused to rent space for public events to be held at their facilities when they learned
 that the Church of Scientology was involved in organizing the events.
 Scientologists continued to take grievances to the courts. Legal rulings have been
 mixed. In April the European Commission on Human Rights decided not to pass on
 to the European Court of Human Rights a discrimination case brought by the
 Church of Scientology against Germany, on the grounds that the Church had not
 exhausted domestic legal channels.
 A parliamentary commission established in 1996 to investigate so-called "sects
 and psycho-groups" has included the Church of Scientology among the groups about
 whose structures, principles, and activities the commission heard testimony. The
 Commission is expected to produce a final report in the spring of 1998. In December
 1996, federal and state government authorities established an interministerial
 group of mid-level officials to exchange information on policies toward Scientology
 and to gather and examine charges of discrimination. This body has no decisionmak-
 ing authority. It plans to publish a review of state-level policies in 1998.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign 7Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to move anywhere within the country, to travel
 abroad, to emigrate, and to repatriate, without restrictions that violate human
 rights.
 VFor ethnic Germans from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the Basic
 Law provides both for citizenship immediately upon application and for legal resi-
 dence without restrictions. Other persons may acquire citizenship (and with it the
 right of unrestricted residence) if they meet certain requirements, including legal
 residence for at least 10 years (5 if married to a German), renunciation of all other
 citizenships, and a basic command of the language. Long-term legal residents often
 opt not to apply; they receive the same social benefits as do citizens, and after 10
 years of lega residency they are entitled to permanent residence.
 The Basic Law and subsequent legislation provide for the right of foreign victims
 of political persecution to attain asylum and resettlement. The Government cooper-
 ates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 Asylum applications continued to decline. In the first half of 1997, Germany re-
 ceived 52,588 applications for asylum and had a recognition rate of 11.4 percent for
 the 90,922 cases concluded. Since July 1993, when the criteria for granting asylum
 were tightened with an amendment to the asylum law, the overall trend in asylum
 applications has continued downward, decreasing by two- thirds from the 1992 all-
 time high of 438,191.
 Under the tightened criteria, persons coming directly from any country that offi-
 cials designate as a "safe country of origin" cannot normally claim political asylum
 but may request an administrative review of their applications while in Germany.
 Persons entering via a "safe third country"-any country in the European Union or
 adhering to the Geneva Convention-are also ineligible for asylum.
 The legislated changes also limited legal recourse against denials of asylum appli-
 cations. Critics argue that few countries can assuredly be designated as "safe third
 countries" and that the law unjustly fails to allow applicants to rebut such designa-
 tions. While the law permits appeals against designations of "safe countries of ori-
 gin,' critics protest that the 48-hour period allotted for hearings is too brief. How-
 ever, the Constitutional Court upheld the constitutionality of the amendments in
 1996.
 In May state authorities began the "second phase" of Bosnian refugee repatri-
 ations, whereby all remaining refugees were to return to Bosnia unless they quali-
 fied for an extension of stay on certain humanitarian grounds. A number of promi-
 nent national officials, as well as the UNHCR, cautioned that the refugees place
 of origin and ethnicity should be given careful consideration in the implementation
 of returns. In June the federal and state interior ministers agreed that, for the time
 being, the deportation of refugees from the "Republika Srpska" region of Bosnia
 would be regarded as a low priority. Most states subsequently extended the tem-
 porary protection status of refugees in this category. Since 1992 approximately
 320,000 Bosnian refugees have lived in Germany under temporary protection, and
 another 25,000 have applied for asylum. The Government has provided first asylum
 
 
 1099
 - and has granted "temporary protection" (first asylum) to these Bosnian refugees.
 Government support for these refugees costs an estimated $2.8 billion annually. At
 year's end, an estimated 100 000 refugees had returned to Bosnia voluntarily, and
 approximately 900 more had been deported by state authorities.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Basic Law provides citizens with the right to change their government peace-
 fully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, Tree, and fair elec-
 tions. The Government is elected on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot-
 ing. Members of the Parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, are elected from a
 mixture of direct-constituency and party-list candidates. The upper house, the Bun-
 desrat, is composed of delegations from state governments.
 The law entitles women to participate fully in political life, and a growing number
 are prominent in the Government and the parties, but women are still underre?-
 resented in those ranks. Slightly over 26 percent of the Federal Parliament is e-
 male, including its President. Women occupy 2 of 16 cabinet positions. One state
 minister-president is a woman. On the Federal Constitutional Court, 5 of the 16
 judges are women, including the Chief Justice. All of the parties have undertaken
 to enlist more women. The Greens/Alliance 90 Party requires that women comprise
 half of the patys elected officials. The Social Democrats have a 40-percent quota
 for women on all party committees and governing bodies. The Christian Democrats
 require that 30 percent of the first-ballot candidates for party positions be women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vest igation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are very cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits denial of access to shelter, health care, or education on the
 basis of race, religion, disability, sex, ethnic background, political opinion, or citizen-
 sip. The Government enforces the law effectively.
 Women.-While violence agnst women occurs and is almost certainly under-
 reported, it is prohibited by laws that are effectively enforced. It is condemned in
 society, and legal and medical recourse is available. Police statistics on rape showed
 a slight increase to 6,228 cases in 1996 (latest available data) from 6,175 in 1995.
 The Government has conducted campaigns in the schools and through church
 groups to bring public attention to the existence of such violence and has proposed
 steps to counter it. The Federal Government has supported numerous pilot projects
 throughout Germany. There are, for example, 330  women's houses" in Germany,
 over 100 in the new states in the East, where victims of violence and their children
 can seek shelter, counseling, and legal and police protection. Germany supported the
 appointment of a special rapporteur on violence against women at the CR.
 Trafficking in women and forced prostitution is also forbidden by law. The laws
 against trafficking in women were modified in 1992 to deal more effectively with
 problems stemming from the opening of Germany'seastern borders. In recent years,
 the Federal Ministry for Women and Youth commissioned a number of studies to
 gain information on violence agalnst women, sexual harassment, and other matters,
 producing for example a special report on violence against women in 1995.
 Children.-The Govenent demonstrates a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. Public education is provided and is mandatory through the age of 16.
 The Government recognizes that violence against children is a problem requiring
 its attention. Police figures indicate that there were 15,674 alleged cases of sexual
 abuse of children in 1996 (latest available figures), down slightly from 1995. 0ffi-
 cials believe that the number of unreported cases may be much higher. The Child
 and Youth Protection Law stresses the need for preventive measures, and the Gov-
 ernment has taken account of this in stepping up its counseling and other assist-
 anc.
 The Criminal Code was amended in 1993 and in December 1997 to further protect
 children against pornography and sexual abuse. For possession of child pornog-
 raphy, the maximum sentence is 1 year's imprisonment; the sentence for distribu-
 tion is 5 years. The 1993 amendment made sexual abuse of children by German citi-
 zens abroad punishable even if the action is not illegal in the child's own country.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against the disabled in em-
 ployment, education, or in the prvision of other state services. The law mandates
 
 
 1100
 
 several special services for disabled persons, and the Government enforces these
 provisions in practice. The disabled are entitled to assistance to avert, eliminate, or
 alleviate the consequences of their disabilities and to secure employment commensu-
 rate with their abilities. The Government offers vocational training and grants for
 employers who hire the disabled. The severely disabled may be granted special ben-
 efits, such as tax breaks, free public transport, special parking facilities, and exemp-
 tion from radio and television fees.
 The Federal Government has established guidelines for attainment of "barrier-
 free" public buildings and for modifications of streets and pedestrian traffic walks
 to accommodate the disabled. While it is up to the individual states to incorporate
 these guidelines into building codes, all 16 states now have access facilities for the
 disabled.
 Religious Minorities.-Anti-Semitic acts increased 9 percent, with 414 incidents
 reported in the first 6 months of 1997, compared with 380 in the same period in
 1996. About 90 percent of these anti-Semitic incidents involved graffiti, the distribu-
 tion of anti-Semitic materials, or the displa of symbols of banned organizations. In
 September unknown vandals desecrated a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, damaging 28
 gravestones. In October the president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany
 (CCJG) protested to the head of Brandenburg state after the town of Gollwitz re-
 fused to accept a group of 60 Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The
 village council voted against the county's plans to convert a local building into a
 temporary shelter for immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The president of
 the CCJG also criticized what he saw as a growing indifference to everyday
 antiforeigner and rightwing incidents.
 NationalIRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-The number of antiforeigner crimes in-
 creased slightly in the first 6 months of 1997, compared with the same period in
 1996. This increase, which includes an 8 to 10 percent rise in violent antiforeigner
 crimes, marked a change in what had been a downward trend since 1992. The per-
 centage of such crimes was significantly higher in the eastern states. As in previous
 years, most of these offenses were directed against foreign residents.
 Perpetrators of antiforeigner violence were predominantly young, male, and low
 in socioeconomic status, often committing such acts spontaneously and while ine-
 briated. Some offenders were rightwing extremists, such as neo-Nazis and
 "skinheads." Many, however, could best be described as rightwing-oriented, having
 loose, if any, practical or ideological ties to extremist groups. Other perpetrators
 were apolitical.
 Acts-by low-ranking members of the Bundeswehr have caused particular concern.
 In March, nine soldiers in uniform, under the influence of alcohol, sought out and
 assaulted at random three foreigners in the city of Detmold. Five soldiers were sub-
 sequently discharged from the military and prosecuted, receiving sentences ranging
 from 6 months' probation to 14 months' imprisonment. In August an arson attack
 committed in Dresden against the residence of Italian workers, by two army
 conscripts with rightwing, xenophobic motives led the Defense Minister to call for
 more careful screening of conscripts. The two incidents received substantial public
 attention and were followed by a series of revelations of other rightwing offenses
 committed by military personnel between 1991 and 1997. The offenses ranged from
 the possession and production of far-right propaganda, to drunken assaults against
 foreigners.
 Acting to increase vigilance, the Ministry of Defense registered 130 rightwing ex-
 tremist incidents between January and November. the Ministry moved quickly to
 take stern disciplinary action against those responsible, dismissing and prosecuting
 perpetrators where possible, and punishing and transferring commanders. In De-
 cember Defense Minister Ruehe suspended a lieutenant general and ordered dis-
 ciplinary proceedings against a colonel for inviting Manfred Roeder, a former lawyer
 who served 8 years in jail for racist bombings against immigrants, to speak in 1995
 at a leadership seminar at the military academy in Hamburg. Authorities also con-
 firmed that the military inadvertently sup plied several used surplus vehicles to an
 organization with which Roeder is active. There was no evidence that rightwing of-
 fenders are more prevalent in the military than in the general young male popu-
 lation. Nevertheless, the Government stated that it would take all necessary meas-
 ures to investigate incidents and prevent future ones.
 In May and June, two firebomb attacks on Christian churches in Luebeck showed
 signs of rightwing, antiforeigner motives. Rightwing graffiti, as well as the name of
 a local Pastor known for assisting asylum seekers, was found on the church walls
 following the attacks. A 19-year-old rightwing radical who admitted committing one
 of the attacks was arrested in June.
 The federal and state governments were firmly committed to combating and pre-
 venting rightwing violence and continued to search for more effective law enforce-
 
 
 1101
 ment measures, as well as measures aimed at the societal roots of extremist crimes.
 Police in the eastern states continued to move toward reaching standards of effec-
 tiveness characteristic of police in the rest of Germany, and demonstrated greater
 coordination in preventing illegal rightwing and neo-Nazi activities. In August police
 in 10 states conducted a coordinated search of homes and firms of individuals sus-
 pected of having connections to the growing rightwing, underground rock music
 scene. During the action, police seized illegal recordings, paraphernalia, and weap-
 ons. Also in August, police in several states enforced a ban on demonstrations by
 neo-Nazis who were attempting to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the death
 of former Nazi leader RudolfHess. There continued to be evidence that neo-Nazi
 groups were making efforts to achieve greater coordination among themselves, par-
 ticularly through the use of modem communication technologies. The federal office
 for the Protection of the Constitution (OPC) reported that 47,000 people belonged
 to far-right organizations in 1997, an increase from 45,300 in 1996.
 Isolated attacks targeting Turkish establishments and individuals occurred.
 Though some attacks were linked to rightwing perpetrators, most were attributed
 to intra-Turkish political or private disputes, but none directly attributable to the
 Kurdistan Workers' Party     K   In September a court in Duesseldorf sentenced
 two members of the PKK to 5-year prison terms in connection with a series of at-
 tacks on Turkish establishments in 1993. Several other trials of PKK members are
 also underway.
 Resident foreigners and minority groups continue to voice credible concerns about
 societal and job-related discrimination. Unemployment affects foreigners dispropor-
 tionately, though tis is in part due to the sometimes inadequate language skills
 or nontransferable professional qualifications of the job-seekers. The Federal Gov-
 ement and all states have established permanent commissions for foreigners' af-
 fairs to assist foreigners in their dealings with government and society. In Septem-
 ber the Government ratified the Council of Europe's Minority Protection Corivention,
 pledging to protect and foster the languages and cultures of the national and ethnic
 inorities that have traditionally lived in Germany (e.g., Sorbs, Danes, Roma, Sinti,
 and Frisians).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right to associate freely, choose representatives,
 determine programs and policies to represent workers' interests, and publicize views
 is recognized and freely exercised. Some 31.6 percent of the total eligible labor force
 belongs to unions. The German Trade Union Federation (DGB) represents 84.9 per-
 cent of organized workers.
 The law provides for the right to strike, except for civil servants (including teach-
 ers) and personnel in sensitive positions, such as members of the armed forces. In
 the past, the International Labor Organization (ILO) has criticized the Govern-
 ment's definition of "essential services" as overly broad. The ILO was responding to
 complaints about sanctions imposed on teachers who struck in the state of Hesse
 in 1989 and, earlier, the replacement of striking postal workers by civil servants.
 In neither case did permanent job loss result. The ILO continues to seek clarifica-
 tions from the Government on policies and laws governing labor rights of civil serv-
 ants.
 The DGB participates in various international and European trade union organi-
 zations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Basic Law provides for
 the right to organize and bargain collectively, and this right is widely exercised. Due
 to a well- developed system of autonomous contract negotiations, mediation is un-
 common. Basic wages and working conditions are negotiated at the industry level
 and then are adapted, through local collective bargaining, to particular enterprises.
 However, some firms in eastern Germany have refused to join employer associa-
 tions, or have withdrawn from them, and then bargained independently with work-
 ers. Likewise, some large firms in the West withdrew at least part of their work
 force from the jurisdiction of employer associations, complaining of rigidities in the
 industrywide, multicompany negotiating system. They have not, however, refused to
 bargain as individual enterprises. The law mandates a system of works councils and
 worker membership on supervisory boards, and thus workers participate in the
 management of the enterprises in which they work. The law thoroughly protects
 workers against antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Conpulsory Labor.-The basic law prohibits forced or
 compulsory labor, including forced or bonded child labor, and there were no reports
 that it occurred.

 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Federal
 law generally prohibits employment of children under the age of 15, with a few ex-
 ceptions: Those 13 or 14 years of age may do farm work for up to 3 hours per day
 or may deliver newspapers for up to 2 hours per day; those 3 to 14 years of age
 may take part in cultural performances, albeit under stringent curbs on the kinds
 of activity, number of hours, and time of day. The Federal Labor Ministry effectively
 enforces the law through its Factory Inspection Bureau.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated or administratively de-
 termined minimum wage. Wages and salaries are set either by collective bargaining
 agreements between unions and employer federations or by individual contracts.
 Covering about 90 percent of all wage- and salary-earners, these agreements set
 minimum pay rates and are legally enforceable. These minimums provide an ade-
 quate standard of living for workers and their families. The number of hours of
 work per week is regulated by contracts that directly or indirectly affect 80 percent
 of the working population. The average workweek for industrial workers is 36 hours
 in western Germany and about 39 hours in the eastern states.
 An extensive set of laws and regulations on occupational safety and health incor-
 porates a growing body of European Union standards. These provide for the right
 to refuse to perform dangerous or unhealthy work without jeopardizing employment.
 A comprehensive system of worker insurance carriers enforces safety requirements
 in the workplace. The Labor Ministry and its counterparts in the states effectively
 enforce occupational safety and health standards through a network of government
 organs, including the Federal Institute for Work Safety. At the local level, profes-
 sional and trade associations-self-governing public corporations with delegates both
 from the employers and from the unions-oversee worker safety.
