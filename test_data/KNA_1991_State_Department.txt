 ST. KITTS AND NEVIS
 St. Kitts and Nevis, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations,
 is a small two-island state with a democratic, parliamentary
 form of government. The Constitution provides the smaller
 island of Nevis considerable self-government, as well as the
 right to secede from the federation if certain enumerated
 procedures are followed. The country is governed by a prime
 minister, a cabinet, and a legislative assembly. The Governor
 General, with largely ceremonial duties, is the titular Head of
 State. The Constitution requires general elections at least
 every 5 years. Elections were last held in 1989, retaining
 Prime Minister Dr. Kennedy Simmonds and his People's Action
 Movement in power.
 Security forces consist of a small police force, which includes
 a 50-person Special Service Unit that receives some light
 infantry training, and a small coast guard.
 St. Kitts and Nevis has a mixed economy based on sugar cane,
 tourism, and light industry. Most commercial enterprises are
 privately owned, but the sugar industry (the country's largest
 economic enterprise) and 85 percent of all arable land are
 owned by a state corporation. Economic growth continued to
 slow in 1991, but the opening of a major tourist resort in
 Nevis and the ground breaking for two new resorts on the
 southeast peninsula have the potential for tourist-generated
 economic growth.
 Human rights continued to be respected during 1991, although
 limited access to government-controlled media remained a
 concern.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Law enforcement authorities abide by the constitutional
 prohibitions against the use of torture or other forms of
 inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Family members,
 attorneys, and clergy are permitted to visit detainees
 regularly.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and
 this provision is respected in practice. The law requires that
 persons detained be brought before a court within 48 hours.
 There were no reported cases of exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that evdry person accused of a crime
 must receive a fair, speedy, and public trial, and these

 ST. KITTS AND NEVIS
 requirements are generally adhered to. The judiciary, a part
 of the Eastern Caribbean legal system, is highly regarded and
 independent. Final appeal may be made to the Queen's Privy
 Council in the United Kingdom. There are no military or
 political courts. Legal assistance is available for indigent
 defendants.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Neither the Government nor the police interfere arbitrarily in
 the private lives of individuals. Judicially issued warrants
 are required to search private homes.
 Section 2 Respect For Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the
 press. The Government owns the only radio and television
 station on St. Kitts. There is a religious television station
 and a privately owned radio station on Nevis. The Government-
 owned radio and television stations on St. Kitts generally do
 not publicize adequately rallies and conventions held by the
 opposition political party. It is difficult for opposition
 party leaders to gain access to the government-owned electronic
 media.
 St. Kitts and Nevis does not have a daily newspaper, although
 each of the major political parties publishes a weekly or
 biweekly newspaper. The papers are free to criticize the
 Government and do so regularly and vigorously. International
 news publications are readily available.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of peaceful assembly.
 Organized demonstrations, rallies, and public meetings
 sponsored by political parties occur regularly, usually taking
 place without government interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion,
 and religious practices are not restricted. Most church
 members belong to Protestant denominations. All groups are
 free to maintain links with coreligionists in other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel inside and outside of the country is unrestricted.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens are able to change their government by peaceful
 means. A vigorous multiparty political system exists in which
 political parties are free to conduct their activities.
 Periodic elections are held in which all citizens 18 years of
 age and older may register and vote by secret ballot,
 The People's Action Movement (PAM) of Prime Minister Kennedy
 Simmonds holds a majority of seats in the Parliament. PAM has
 worked closely with the Nevis Reformation Party .(NRP) of Nevis

 ST. KITTS AND NEVIS
 Premier Simeon Daniel. Since the March 1989 national election,
 the two parties have held 8 of 11 elected seats in the
 Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 While there are no governmental restrictions, no local human
 rights groups have been formed to date.
 There were no requests for investigations or visits by
 international human rights groups in 1991.
 Section 5 Discrimination Besed on Race, Sex, Religion,'
 Language, or Social Status
 There were no renorts of systematic discrimination based on
 race, sex, creed, language, or social status. The role of
 women in society is not restricted by law. However, the role
 of most women in the country is still circumscribed by culture
 and tradition. The Government created the Ministry of Women's
 Affairs to help redefine the role of women in society and to
 ensure that women's rights are promoted. According to a
 Ministry official, violence against women is a problem, but
 gauging the extent of the problem is difficult because many
 women are reluctant to file a complaint or pursue their
 complaints in the courts. Despite this reluctance, there were
 publicly reported cases of both domestic violence and rape in
 1991 and a few convictions. According to the Women's Affairs
 Ministry, a special police unit works closely with the Ministry
 to investigate domestic violence and rape cases.
 The Ministry of Women's Affairs, headed'by'Constance Mitchum, a
 lawyer and St. Kitts' only female Member of Parliament,
 continues to be active in counseling abused women, as well as
 in other aspects of women's rights. The Ministry in September
 submitted to the Cabinet a new national policy statement for
 women that included sections on job discrimination and domestic
 violence.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of all workers to form
 and belong to trade unions. The major labor union, the St.
 Kitts Trades and Labour Union, is affiliated with the
 opposition St. Kitts Labour Party and is organized in all
 sectors of the economy. Membership appears to be declining, as
 the Government assumes some of the social welfare roles
 formerly played by unions. There is also an independent
 teachers' union, a union representing dockworkers in the
 capital city, and a taxi-drivers association.
 The right to strike, while not specified by law, is well
 established and respected in practice. There were no major
 strikes in 1991. Unions are free to form federations or
 confdderations, and to affiliate with international
 organizations. The islands' unions maintain a variety of
 international ties.

 ST. KITTS AND NEVIS
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Labor unions are free to organize and to negotiate for better
 wages and benefits for union members. There is no legislation
 governing the organization and representation of workers, and
 employers are not legally bound to recognize a union, but in
 practice employers do so if a majority of workers polled wish
 to organize. The Labor Commission attempts to mediate disputes
 between labor and management on an ad hoc basis. If neither
 the Labor Commission nor the Minister of Labor can resolve the
 dispute, legislation allows for a case to be brought before a
 civil court. There are no areas, such as export processing
 zones, where union organization or collective bargaining are
 discQuraged or impeded.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution forbids slavery and forced labor, and they do
 not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum legal working age is 14. The Labor Ministry relies
 heavily on school truant officers and the Community Affairs
 Division to monitor compliance, which they do effectively.
 Local law mandates compulsory education up to the age of 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wage rates for domestic servants and retail store
 employees were established by law in 1984 and updated in 1989.
 These provide an adequate, though Spartan, living for a wage
 earner and family; many workers supplement wages by keeping
 small animals such as goats and chickens. Most people live in
 extended families where there may be more than one wage
 earner. The Labor Commission undertakes regular wage
 inspections and special investigations when complaints are
 received; employers found in violation are required to pay back
 wages.
 The standard workweek, although not legally mandated, is 40
 hours in 5 days. Workers are guaranteed a minimum annual
 vacation of 2 weeks. While there are no specific health and
 safety regulations, the Factories Law provides general health
 and safety guidance to Labor Ministry inspectors.
