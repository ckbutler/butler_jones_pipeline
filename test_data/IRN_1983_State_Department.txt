 IRAN
 Four years after the 1979 ouster of the Shah and the advent of
 the Islamic Revolution, Iran remains a revolutionary society.
 The regime is in the process of consolidating the revolution
 and building new political and social institutions. Iran is
 also a country at war. The fighting with Iraq began in
 September, 1980 and continues with little hope for a negotiated
 settlement in the near future. An insurgency in Kurdish areas
 began about four years ago and continues.
 Iran terms itself an Islamic Republic. It is theoretically
 "republican" in the sense that its Constitution, approved by
 popular referendum, follows a parliamentary pattern with a
 legislature, the Majlis, and a president elected by universal
 suffrage. Elections, however, are not free in that all
 candidates for office must be certified by the Ministry of
 Interior as meeting Islamic criteria. It is "Islamic" in its
 express belief that Iran should be governed by the "truth and
 justice" of the Koran under the leadership of Ayatollah Imam
 Khomeini and in the constitutional provision for a Council of
 Guardians, which reviews bills to assure that they comply with
 Islamic law.
 The regime officially derives its legitimacy from the elected
 Majlis (Parliament) and from Islam. In practice, its hold on
 power is reinforced through intimidation, terror, and other
 harsh methods. Constitutional guarantees of human rights are
 ignored in practice.
 Iran's political elite is composed of a group of Muslim clerics
 of the Shi'a sect, which predominates in Iran, and by laymen
 who have aligned themselves with these clerics. Opposition
 elements have not posed a serious threat to the regime since
 mid-1981 as a result of a government campaign to suppress
 political dissidents following a series of bombings that killed
 many of Iran's political leaders. Thousands of suspected
 Mujahedin (a major leftist opposition group) were arrested, and
 many were summarily executed. The regime eliminated one other
 potential opposition group in mid-1983 when it arrested an
 estimated 1,500 members of the Tudeh (Communist) Party,
 including much of the party leadership.
 The regime, however, is not monolithic and there are major
 differences of opinion on economic issues such as private
 property ownership, government versus private control of
 foreign trade, labor versus management oriented industrial
 policy, and on a religious issue that centers on the question
 of divine sanction or authority for Khomeini s rule.
 Economically, Iran is an oil-rich developing country. In the
 years prior to the revolution, Iran experienced rapid but
 uneven economic development; the disruptions of the
 revolutionary period caused serious economic deterioration.
 This deterioration was halted in 1983 when the economy showed
 positive growth. Economic growth rates dropped in the 1978-80
 period, and were stagnant in 1981-82. According to official
 Iranian figures, gross national product (GNP) grew by seven
 percent in the Iranian year ending in March, 1983. Oil revenue
 has been sufficient to fund essential imports, and a rationing
 system assures that available supplies of basic necessities are
 reasonably equitably distributed. Inflation and unemployment
 are high, and blackmarket activities flourish.

 The regime does not share Western concepts of individual
 freedom. Dissent from the political and religious views of the
 leadership is repressed. The ruling clerics' social views are
 imposed on everyone. The leadership's religiously justified
 codes of conduct are especially onerous as applied to women.
 Members of officially "recognized" religious minorities, Jews,
 Christians, and Zoroastrians, are permitted to practice their
 religions. The Baha'is, another religious minority in Iran,
 are not officially recognized by the regime. They are viewed
 as heretics and suffer from imprisonment, torture and execution
 at the hands of the Government. The regime remains strongly
 anti-Zionist and is distrustful of its religious minorities,
 but there have been no reports, at least since mid-1982, of
 arrests due solely to religious affiliation of members of the
 .recognized" religious minorities.
 The war with Iraq that began in September, 1980 continues.
 From the spring of 1983 until mid-October 1983 there were no
 major battles. Iran has maintained military pressure against
 Iraq through a series of probing actions along the border.
 Cities in south-western Iran have been subjected to missile and
 bombing attacks, which according to the Iranians and confirmed
 by a U.N. inspection team, have caused considerable damage to
 civilian areas and considerable loss of life.
 The war has proved costly to both sides. Iran claims that
 roughly 100,000 of its soldiers have been killed since
 September, 1980. Economic resources have been diverted from
 development to the war effort. Both sides have attacked
 economic targets such as oil export terminals and factories.
 Iran claims that the war has created about one million refugees.
 Iran holds an estimated 45,000 to 50,000 Iraqi prisoners of
 war. In general, treatment of the prisoners appears to meet
 international standards, although not all of these prisoners
 have been visited by international groups.
 Iran's human rights record under the current regime remains one
 of the worst in the world, but, with the important exception of
 increased persecution of Baha'is, there was some improvement in
 1983. Khomeini made a much publicized eight point statement in
 December, 1982, much of which focused on human rights issues.
 Censorship of mails and telephones was to cease, entry into
 private homes without a search warrant was forbidden except in
 cases involving suspected opposition hideouts, rights to travel
 outside Iran were extended to most Iranians, and the tests
 designed to measure bureaucrats' loyalty to Islam were to be
 discontinued. A Headquarters for the Enforcement of the Imam's
 Decree, headed by the chief justice of Iran's Supreme Court,
 was established with branch offices in most provincial cities.
 Thousands of complaints were received, and a number of local
 officials were removed. Official public attention to these
 reforms ceased by mid-summer 1983, but an institutional
 framework to correct some human rights abuses remains in place.
 At least 1,500 prisoners, more than half of whom had been
 sentenced by revolutionary courts, were amnestied in February
 and March of 1983. There have been fewer killings and fewer
 arrests in 1983 than in 1981 and 1982. This, however, is
 attributable to the fact that virtually all opposition groups
 have been eliminated and most of the balance of the population
 is constrained by fear from doing anything that would attract
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 80
 
 
 1256
 the attention of the authorities. Nonetheless, abuses
 continue, including arrests, torture, and executions,  Private
 human rights groups believe that many executions take place in
 secret, making accurate statistics impossible and even
 estimates difficult.
 Persecution of the Baha'is has increased to the point that
 Iran's Prosecutor General effectively banned all Baha'i
 religious and institutional activities in August, 1983. His
 order provides the legal basis on which the regime can move
 against all Baha'is in Iran if it chooses to do so.
 There is considerable circumstantial evidence pointing to
 Iranian involvement in terrorist activities in various parts of
 the world, including the bombing of the American Embassy in
 Beirut in April, 1983, attacks upon U.S. and French forces
 involved in the Multi-National Force in Beirut in October,
 1983, and the bombings of the American and the French Embassies
 in Kuwait in December, 1983. Although these charges have been
 denied by Iranian leaders, these same leaders have advocated
 terrorism as a legitimate policy instrument, particularly as a
 means of combating what they view as superpower dominance of
 third world countries.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGITS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 It is impossible to obtain even a rough estimate of the number
 of people killed for political reasons in Iran. It is equally
 impossible to estimate those executed for criminal offenses
 without benefit of a trial. Although sustained efforts have
 been made by various Iranian exile groups and by independent
 human rights organizations to compile lists of persons
 executed, all are dependent on rumor, reports of persons who
 have been released or escaped from Iranian prisons, and on
 other sketchy information. Some reports come from opposition
 groups that have reason to inflate the figures. There is a
 consensus among all observers that the rate of arbitrary
 deprivation of life in Iran remains high, although it is not as
 high as was the case in the second half of 1981 and the first
 half of 1982.
 An informal count of executions for political crimes
 (membership in the Mujahedin, the Communist League or other
 opposition groups) kept by the Department of State for the
 period January to May 1983 shows a total of 172 executions, or
 by extrapolation, a total of some 400 executions per year. The
 vast majority of these executions were performed in provincial
 areas following convictions by local revolutionary courts. The
 figure does not include those convicted by the revolutionary
 courts in Tehran, nor those executed without benefit of a trial
 in Tehran's major prisons.
 Amnesty International estimates that a minimum of 5,195 summary
 executions have been carried out since the February, 1979
 revolution. The Mujahedin, an opposition group now based in
 Paris, estimates that as many as 10,000 have been summarily
 executed, and claims that 1,800 persons were shot during the
 period January 22 to 28 of 1983 alone. It seems likely that
 over 1,000 may have been summarily executed by the Iranian
 regime in the October 1982 to October 1983 period.
 
 
 1257
 According to reports from the Iranian exile community, children
 as young as 11 years of age as well as pregnant women have been
 executed. Although there is no way of confirming these
 reports, neither have they been denied by the regime. Rather,
 regime officials have stated that if a person is guilty, he or
 she will be appropriately punished, no matter what the age or
 sex.
 The regime's moves against the Mujahedin have been largely
 successful in eliminating that group as a threat. Consequently
 there have been relatively few deaths caused by opposition
 groups in the course of the last year. In previous years a
 number of innocent people were killed when large bombs were
 exploded in public places, and several religious leaders were
 the victims of suicide missions by members of the opposition
 carrying grenades. One exception to this general rule is the
 insurrection in the Kurdish areas. While there are no reliable
 statistics available, there have been many deaths resulting
 from this fighting that pits dissident Kurdish groups against
 the regime, and as a result of internecine fighting among
 various Kurdish groups.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances seldom remain secret in Iran. People are
 arbitrarily arrested or carried off, they are held without
 charge, and they are summarily executed. The society, however,
 is not a tightly controlled one, in the sense that a persistent
 relative can usually determine who was responsible for the
 arrest and where the detainee is being held. While many
 relatives are not officially informed of executions, they seem
 to find out and can often confirm rumor by checking burial
 records at Behest-e-Zarah, Tehran's cemetery. Sometimes it is
 necessary to bribe clerks keeping records or perhaps prison
 officials.
 There are, however, some cases of long-term or permanent
 disappearance. One report obtained by Amnesty International
 stated that sometimes opposition members are listed as "killed
 while resisting arrest" when in fact they are still alive and
 in jail. The supposition in these cases is that they will be
 severely tortured while in jail, and may well die as a result
 of this torture. Arrest in most of these cases is believed to
 be the work of the Revolutionary Guard, and is sanctioned by
 the regime.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Stories of torture in Iran's prisons are rampant, and cover a
 wide range of inhuman practices. Beatings of all kinds appear
 to be quite common. Prisoners are beaten on the soles of their
 feet until their legs swell and they can no longer walk.
 Others have damaged kidneys as a result of.being kicked and
 beaten with sticks. There are stories of men whipped in the
 testicles and unable to urinate for several days afterwards.
 Only three in ten were reported to survive this treatment in
 one cell block at Evin Prison in Tehran, Iran's largest and
 most notorious.
 Three Iranians who were held in the Central Komiteh building
 (Komitehs, or committees, are revolutionary groups that control
 various neighborhoods) in Tehran learned from other prisoners
 
 
 1258
 of severe beatings, including a game called "football" played
 with seven or eight guards and a prisoner who was booted from
 guard to guard. Prisoners were burned with hot irons, given
 electric shocks, whipped, kneed in the testicles, forced to run
 around a yard while guards beat the prisoners with pipes and
 cables, had heads dunked in a pool until the individuals were
 on the point of drowning, and then forced to run again.
 Similar stories about Evin are common. Mock executions are a
 favorite method of torture there, along with blindfolding, and
 solitary confinement. At Evin, there are stories of women
 being held with their children, and the children forced to
 watch while the mother is beaten, or themselves beaten in the
 mother's presence. Female prisoners who have been released
 describe frequent rapes in addition to the beatings received.
 The International Federation for Human Rights, based in Paris,
 has alleged that political prisoners in Iran have been forced
 to give blood transfusions with some individuals being
 literally bled to death. These allegations have not been
 substantiated.
 All of this torture occurs in government prisons or in
 government houses in which prisoners of special interest are
 held for questioning. There has been no indication that the
 regime was unaware of this treatment of prisoners, nor that it
 had made any move to stop it. Presumably the torture takes
 place with both the knowledge and sanction of top officials.
 Many of the first person reports received relate to events that
 occurred in 1981 and 1982. There is, however, no indication
 that treatment improved in 1983.
 Since many of the allegations and reports of treatment in
 prisons come from individuals who themselves were in the
 prisons, and who, in some cases, actually experienced the
 torture, and since these stories are widespread and consistent,
 there is little reason to doubt their veracity. In some
 instances there are medical reports to back up the individual's
 allegations.
 Prisoners who escape torture do not necessarily escape other
 cruel, degrading, and inhuman treatment. The jails are grossly
 overcrowded. Those who were detained at the Central Komiteh
 estimated that there were 1,000 to 1,500 people held in a
 faciltiy built for 500. Cells in Evin and other prisons are
 similarly overcrowded. Toilet facilities are either grossly
 inadequate or totally lacking. Medical treatment is not
 available, unless the guards believe a prisoner will break and
 "confess" if enticed by treatment of his wounds. Food is
 inadequate and sometimes full of dirt and bugs, and prisoners
 are herded from place to place like animals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrests for expression of views critical or different from
 those of the Government are quite common in Iran. They have
 decreased in number during the past year only because of the
 widespread fear of arrest on the part of the population. If
 there is a formal accusation and/or trial, the charge is
 usually subversion, anti-regime activities or treason. Arrests
 of this kind are usually made by members of the Revolutionary
 Guard. Arrests by Komiteh members used to be quite common, but
 as Iran's revolution becomes more institutionalized, the
 Komitehs have faded somewhat and the Revolutionary Guards have
 taken over. In these cases, there are never warrants for
 
 
 1259
 arrest.  There is no judicial determination of the legality of
 detention in Iranian law, neither are there any other legal
 protections. Detainees are frequently held for long periods of
 time without charge, and in some cases have been tortured, only
 to have the mullah (Muslim cleric) who supervises the prison
 apologize for the mistake after a period of two or more weeks.
 For political crimes, no access to a lawyer is permitted.
 Cases are heard, if at all, by the "revolutionary judiciary" (a
 parallel judicial system established as a result of the
 revolution). There is no bail, unless the substantial bribes
 reportedly paid by wealthy Iranians to obtain the release of
 relatives is considered informal bail. Although Iran's
 Constitution does guarantee many basic human rights, the
 revolutionary court system pays no attention to these
 provisions. There are no reliable estimates of the number of
 persons arbitrarily arrested in 1983. One prisoner who was
 released from Evin prison some time in 1982 estimated that
 there was a total of 15,000 prisoners there. At least two
 other prisons in the Tehran area probably hold several thousand
 each, including common criminals. Considering the fact that
 thousands of detainees were eventually executed, others
 released after weeks or months in prison, and yet others called
 in for questioning and released after several days, it is
 reasonable to estimate that 20,000 to 30,000 people have been
 arbitrarily arrested in Iran since the beginning of the
 revolution.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 It is difficult to draw a line between the process of taking
 and holding a person and the process of unfair trial and
 sentencing. Persons suspected of involvement in anti-regime
 activities are all subject to the same procedures. They are
 arrested by members of the Revolutionary Guard. Those who are
 suspected of minor offenses are held for questioning at local
 Revolutionary Guard offices. Sometimes they are released after
 several hours or several days, a process that may be repeated
 two or three times before the authorities decide the detainee
 is innocent or that he is guilty and should be jailed. Other
 cases are taken directly to one of Iran's prisons where they
 may be held for weeks, months, or even years prior to being
 released or executed. Some who have been released report being
 called for questioning or interrogation on several different
 occasions. In some cases a mullah is involved, in others it is
 unidentified questioners, sometimes including torturers. It is
 also unclear whether or not this questioning is supposed to
 constitute a trial by a revolutionary court or whether it is
 part of the investigative process.
 There are no estimates as to how many of those executed had a
 trial of any sort. There are reports of opposition activists
 being called before revolutionary judges, usually mullahs,
 having the charges against them read and then being taken out
 to be shot. Prisoners at Tehran's Evin prison report hearing
 shots during the night, sometimes as many as 100 per night.
 Some of this shooting relates to mock executions, some to real
 executions. Most of these reports date from the 1981-1982
 period. In this past year, the number of executions may have
 declined, but there is no evidence that procedures have changed.
 So-called trials of major opposition figures are sometimes
 telecast, but no trial by a revolutionary court can be called
 fair or public. If the trial is given publicity, it is
 generally because the prisoner has been forced to confess to
 crimes against the state.
 
 
 1260
 There is little information regarding trials for common
 criminal offenses. Elements of the pre-revolutionary judiciary
 survive, and some common criminals may have the right to a
 public trial with benefit of a lawyer of their own choosing,
 assuming they can afford the fee. Even this judiciary is not
 independent. Many of the former judges were retired after the
 revolution, and new judges were selected. One criterion for
 new judges was grounding in Islamic law, and political
 acceptability is an absolute requirement for any government
 position.
 The regime is in the process of reforming Iran's civil code so
 that it conforms more closely with Islamic law. Although some
 of these changes have been passed by the Majlis, there are few
 reports of Islamic punishments like the cutting off of a hand.
 There are reports of floggings, but there is no information
 that indicates how many persons have been flogged for which
 crimes. Rather, this seems to be an instrument of torture.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Iran's revolutionary government is attempting to re-make
 Iranian society according to Khomeini's interpretation of Shi'a
 Islam. It explicitly rejects the Western distinction between a
 public sphere which the government may control, and a sphere of
 private life (religious culture, thought, and private behavior)
 which the state may not properly control. The Government
 defines itself as Islamic, and attempts to enforce a way of
 life asserted to be Islamic.
 Since Khomeini's Eight Point Decree of December, 1982, Iranians
 have enjoyed greater privacy. One of the eight points was that
 no one had the right to invade private homes without a
 warrant. An exception was made for suspected hideouts of
 opposition groups like the Mujahedin. The declaration did say
 that if Revolutionary Guards entered a home believing it to be
 an opposition hideout and found they had made a mistake, they
 were to depart, even if they had found evidence of proscribed
 activities such as the presence of alcoholic beverages. The
 decree also stated that mail should not be opened nor
 telephones tapped unless there was good reason to suspect
 anti-regime activities. Homes are entered, mail is opened, and
 phones are tapped, but less so than was the case prior to
 December, 1982. Moreover, Iranians now have a declaration by
 Khomeini himself on which to base complaints. A Headquarters
 for the Enforcement of the Imam's Decree was set up, as were a
 number of provincial and local offices. These officers
 received thousands of complaints about violations of rights of
 privacy. These offices for the enforcement of the decree were
 very active during the first six months of 1983. Little has
 been heard about them in the last several months. They are
 believed to continue to exist, but their authority has been
 weakened by political changes at the upper levels of the regime.
 A special unit of the Revolutionary Guard checks on the social
 activites of Iranians. Women whose chadors (veils covering the
 head, part of the face, and the rest of the body) do not cover
 enough of their faces, or who are wearing make-up, are subject
 to arrest. If they are, in the words of Iran's Prosecutor
 General, "reformable", they may be lectured and released. If
 they are defiant, they may go to jail. There are no statistics
 to indicate how many women have been arrested and/or jailed by
 these units. There are also conflicting reports of their
 
 
 1261
 activities. At one extreme are stories circulating in the
 Iranian exile community about women who have had their lips cut
 with razors because they were wearing lipstick. At the other
 extreme are reports from Western residents of Iran that women
 arrive at dinner parties with chadors over very fashionable
 dresses.
 Schools in Iran are apparently used by the regime to assure
 that families of students behave in an "acceptable, Islamic
 manner". Emigres report that children are asked about the
 habits of their parents, and unacceptable behavior is reported
 to Revolutionary Guard units.
 Nei'jhborhood Komitehs, which originally acted as "block
 wardens", checking on the activities of residents, seem to be
 less active than was the case earlier in the revolution. There
 have been efforts to disband the Komitehs, and many of them may
 have in fact disappeared.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Government claims that freedom of speech and the
 press are respected in Iran, this is not the case. An
 occasional article, such as one that appeared in a women's
 magazine in Iran in which some women complained about such
 things as shortages and long waits in lines for basic goods, is
 cited as evidence of freedom of speech and the press. Some
 general grumbling about living conditions is permitted, but
 criticism of the regime is not allowed. Radio and television
 are government-owned. Some newspapers may be privately owned,
 but the press is government- controlled. Several papers that
 criticized policies or supported a faction that lost in a power
 struggle were shut down. Most of these shutdowns occurred
 prior to October, 1982, but at least one, a newsletter written
 in English, ceased publication in May or June of 1983.
 There is no academic freedom; text books are reviewed to
 determine their acceptability, and foreign books, newspapers
 and magazines are either not permitted, or may be imported only
 after review.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.
 Iranians do not have the right to assemble to protest
 government policies or actions. The only assemblies permitted
 are those sponsored by the Government such as street marches or
 Friday prayers and sermons. In the summer of 1983 in several
 urban areas there were demonstrations to protest the lack of
 electricity and water, and shortages of bread. The
 demonstrations were dispersed by Revolutionary Guards, with
 several deaths reported in one instance.
 There are no labor unions in Iran. Although information is
 lacking, it is believed that there are Islamic workers councils
 in some factories. These, however, are more instruments of
 government control than bodies that represent the interests of
 workers.
 
 
 1262
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Iran terms itself an "Islamic Republic", in which religion is
 closely intertwined with government. Khomeini is recognized as
 the supreme leader, and this position holds something akin to
 divine sanction. The President, and many other top officials
 are mullahs (religious leaders), as are the Speaker of the
 Majlis, and roughly half of the Majlis deputies. Ninety-three
 percent of Iranians are Shi'a Muslims, and five percent are
 Sunni Muslims, but the Sunnis tend to be located in tribal
 areas remote from Tehran. Their political influence is nearly
 nil.
 There are small Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian (the
 pre-Islamic religion of Iran) populations, concentrated mainly
 in urban areas. These three religions are recognized by the
 Government, and they elect representatives that sit in the
 Majlis. They are permitted to practice their religions, to
 instruct their children, and in some cases to maintain
 schools. There have been reports of religious persecution of
 these three minorities, particularly in the early stages of the
 revolution. Conflict continues between these groups and the
 regime on the subject of religious practice. An article that
 appeared in an Armenian language publication in Iran (most
 Armenians are Christians) complained about the regime's
 interference in Armenian schools, and the fact that the regime
 insisted that Armenian girls wear officially sanctioned
 traditional dress. Although the article cited abuses, there is
 some significance to the fact that it appeared at all.
 Elements of the Revolutionary Guard working with Armenians
 reportedly complain about the use of the Armenian language.
 This may be due more to unease at not understanding what is
 being said than an effort to stamp out the culture. Jewish
 groups report fewer problems of this nature because the
 language spoken in Jewish homes and informally among Jews is
 Farsi. Religious instruction for all three faiths is permitted.
 The Baha'i faith is not recognized by Islam, and Baha'is have
 suffered severe persecution since the beginning of the
 revolution. This persecution is mainly government directed and
 aimed at the religious leadership, although there were some
 instances of mob action against Baha'is in the early
 revolutionary period. Baha'i property has been confiscated,
 shrines demolished, business corporations have been disbanded
 or confiscated, and known Baha'is have been denied employment
 by the Government. These measures effectively deny employment
 to most urban Baha'i. The Committee of Experts of the
 International Labor Organization cited Iran for its employment
 discrimination against Baha'is in its report prepared in June,
 1983. Much of the religious leadership has been arrested and
 many religious leaders executed. Charges are vague, "crimes
 against God", "corruption on earth", and "Zionism" are among
 the most frequent. A minimum of 550 Baha'is are in Iranian
 jails. At least 154 Baha'is have been executed since the
 beginning of the revolutionary period, 23 of them in the
 October 1982 to October 1983 period. Of these, most, including
 10 women and children, were executed on the orders of a
 revolutionary judge in Shiraz.
 In August, 1983, Iran's Revolutionary Prosecutor General issued
 an order that effectively bans all Baha'i religious activity,
 and provides the legal foundation on which virtually all
 members of the faith could be charged with crimes in Iran;
 participation in social welfare organizations is forbidden, as
 
 
 1263
 are the business corporations the Baha'i operated; and teaching
 of the faith, even by parents to children in the home, is not
 permitted. There is concern that these actions may mark the
 beginning of even more severe measures against the Baha'is in
 Iran. This concern is reinforced by the arrests of 190 Baha'is
 in the four months following the proclamation.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Free movement within Iran is permitted. Iranians may travel
 temporarily to any part of Iran, except perhaps for the war
 zone on the border with Iraq, and in times of heavy fighting,
 some areas of Kurdestan. Such limitations as exist are for
 purposes of military security. Persons may also change their
 place of residence without obtaining the permission of the
 Government.
 Travel outside of Iran is considerably easier than was the case
 prior to the spring of 1983. Khomeini's Eight Point Decree of
 December, 1982 included the right to travel outside of Iran.
 Prior to that time passports and exit visas had been difficult
 to obtain. There was a period of three to four months before
 the travel restrictions were actually liberalized, but this
 seems to be due more to technical problems with printing
 passports and reviewing applications for exit visas than
 political concerns. Males of draft age are not issued exit
 visas, and Iranians who are politically suspect, such as some
 retired military officers and some high level public officials
 under the former regime, may not be able to leave Iran. Also
 denied exit visas are individuals who obtained loans, not yet
 repaid, from various development banks under the old regime.
 Iranian applicants for American visas in Europe report that
 some Iranians, particularly those with skills in short supply
 in Iran, and who were educated at government expense, are
 required to post bonds in order to obtain exit visas.
 With the exception of Iranians with close associations with the
 former regime, Iranians who return after long periods of time
 abroad seem to encounter few problems. Many who spent long
 periods of time in the West encounter cultural problems,
 particularly since Iran has become oppressive by Western
 standards. All citizens who leave are not, however, guaranteed
 the right to return. Iranians suspected of close association
 with the old regime have encountered problems obtaining new
 Iranian passports and there may have been a few instances of
 arrests once they returned.
 Iranian passports have always been stamped "not valid for
 emigration", but the Iranian Government seems to draw an
 unclear distinction between legal residence in another country
 and emigration. According to Iranian regulations, Iranians
 with a legal residence outside Iran may be issued Iranian
 passports and advance exit visas by the Iranian embassy,
 consulate, or interests section in their country of residence.
 Iranians who have acquired U.S. citizenship are considered
 Iranian (in effect dual nationals) unless they have formally
 renounced their Iranian citizenship. These dual nationals have
 complained that the Iranian Interests Section will not issue
 them Iranian passports and exit visas on the grounds that their
 residence in the U.S. is not legal because, according to
 Iranian law, they emigrated illegally. There are no known
 instances of the Iranian Government denying Iranian citizenship
 to citizens who left Iran, or to those who have remained there.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights:  The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Iran is ruled by a group of religious leaders and their lay
 associates. Although there are differences of opinion within
 this group, all leaders are united in their belief in Khomeini
 as the supreme leader of the revolution, and in their adherence
 to Shi'a Islam. There is a single political party, the Islamic
 Republican Party, to which most high level government officials
 belong. Although the Islamic Republican Party's founders may
 have envisioned a single party structure with political
 significance, these leaders were killed in mid-1981, and the
 party now has no discernible political significance. Its
 membership and the membership of the governing committees
 reflect the political divergence of the mainly clerical
 government. The party met for the first time in a year in
 mid-1983 and elected new officials. Aside from that it has
 been inactive.
 Iran holds elections for Majlis deputies and for the post of
 President. Although there are frequently several candidates
 ,for each position, all must be approved by the Ministry of the
 Interior and only those meeting with the approval of the
 Government may run. Although Iranians do not have the right to
 change or to modify their government, there is considerable
 difference of opinion among groups within the Government.
 The Majlis holds lively debate on a wide variety of issues
 ranging from land reform to nationalizaton of foreign trade,
 the budget, and the nomination of new ministers. In some
 cases, laws proposed by the Government and ministers nominated
 by the Prime Minister have been voted down. Rejection by the
 Majlis is accepted by the executive branch.
 Iran's Constitution provides for a Council of Guardians
 composed of 12 members, six clerics and six lay members who are
 well grounded in Islamic law. This Council must certify all
 bills passed by the Majlis as being in accordance with Islamic
 law. If bills fail, they are sent back to the Majlis for
 revision, and cannot become law until the Council has duly
 certified them. The Council of Guardians has refused to
 certify portions of the land reform bill and some of the
 attempts at reform of Iran's civil code. Until mid-1983 when
 half of its membership was changed (in accordance with
 procedures stipulated in the Constitution), the Council was
 decidedly more conservative than the Majlis. There are no
 reports of Council of Guardians rulings since its composition
 changed. It is, therefore, difficult to determine whether or
 not it retains its conservative cast.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The regime in Iran is disdainful of human rights groups, be
 they government-sponsored or independent. It is not willing to
 discuss human rights problems with anyone, and there have been
 no visits by any group with the exception of the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which has visited some of
 the Iraqi prisoners of war in Iran. There are no internal
 human rights groups in Iran. Such activities would result in
 imprisonment and possible execution. Amnesty International has
 written to the Prime Minister and to Khomeini protesting
 
 
 1265
 violations of human rights in Iran, but has received no reply.
 The 1983 report from Amnhesty International on Iran expressed
 concerns over the large number of executions, the allegation of
 torture and cruel treatment of prisoners, the imprisonment of
 political dissenters, denial of fair trial to political
 prisoners and religious persecution, particularly of Baha'is.
 Expressing many of the same concerns, Freedom House rates Iran
 "not free".
 The ICRC has bee able to visit some of the Iraqi prisoners of
 war, but has not had access to all of those believed held in
 Iran. The regime publicly accused one ICRC official of being a
 spy.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL. AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 There are no reliable statistics available for the
 post-revolutionary period. The following economic and social
 indicators should be taken as rough estimates based on
 statistics from the mid-1970's. The population is about 42.5
 million with a population growth rate of 3.1 percent per
 annum. Life expectancy at birth is 58 years, and the infant
 death rate was 14 per 1,000 live births in the mid to late
 1970's. Given reduced social services, life expectancy and
 mortality figures may be somewhat lower in 1983. The adult
 literacy rate is roughly 50 percent. Primary school enrollment
 in the mid-1970's was over 100 percent, probably reflecting
 enrollment in adult literacy programs. Since many of these
 programs were part of the Shah's development scheme, the
 figures are now probably much lower. Primary and secondary
 schools operate, and some faculties at universities have
 resumed operation.
 In 1977 GNP was $77.8 billion and per capita income $2,160.
 Both of these figures have dropped sharply since 1977,
 particularly when adjusted to correct for inflation. Lack of
 data precludes even a rough estimate of current per capita
 income.
 Iran has raised its oil exports to about 2.0 million barrels
 per day for most of 1983, a level that is slightly greater than
 the average of 1.8 million barrels per day exported in 1982.
 This level is sufficient to permit the import of enough war
 material to maintain the war against Iraq, enough essential
 foodstuffs to feed the population, the intermediate goods
 necessary to increase local industrial activity, and the
 accumulation of increased foreign currency reserves. Luxury
 items are still nearly impossible to find in Iran, and there
 are still shortages of essential items, but these shortages are
 less severe than was the case during the first two years of the
 revolution.  Support for the regime comes mainly from the
 lower, urban classes, and the Government has taken care to see
 that the basic needs of these groups are met. Economic
 hardship has been far more severe for the middle and upper
 income groups who formerly lived lives of comparative luxury.
 Income statistics that would permit a determination of the
 percentage below the poverty line are not available.
 Ultraconservative dress for women is now an absolute
 requirement, regardless of the woman's religion or national
 origin. Even women assigned to foreign embassies must wear
 head coverings and loose clothing that covers the rest of the
 body. Employment opportunities are more restricted than was
 the case under the Shah. Women are legally barred from being
 
 
 1266
 judges, and possibly from pleading cases in courts. Although
 there are cultural barriers making employment in professional
 level positions difficult to obtain and maintain, women do work
 as lawyers, physicians, and statisticians, and in other
 professions in both the public and private sector. Several
 women serve as deputies in the Majlis.
 The Family Protection Act, passed under the Shah, was revoked
 by the Islamic Government, and replaced by a civil code
 reflecting Islamic law. A bill passed in mid-1983 confirmed
 women's right to divorce their husbands.
