 LITHUANIA
 Lithuania is a country of 3.4 million inhabitants which has
 been forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union. Its ancient
 language is most similar to Latvia's, but Lithuania's
 political and cultural traditions have been influenced by
 centuries of ties to Poland. Those ties, although close, have
 often been stormy.
 The population of Vilnius, the capital city, has long been
 ethnically diverse and today is only about 50 percent
 Lithuanian. Overall, however, Lithuania is far more
 ethnically homogeneous than Latvia or Estonia. Its relatively
 high birthrate has helped to stabilize the Lithuanian share of
 the population at about 80 percent for several decades.
 Recent statistics indicate, however, that Lithuania's
 birthrate is declining while the rate of in-migration from the
 Soviet Union has increased by almost 60 percent since the
 1960s, to an average annual rate of 7,300 during the 1970s.
 These trends suggest that Lithuania may soon face the same
 sort of demographic shifts that have already aroused fear of
 assimilation among Latvians and Estonians.
 Since the 14th century, the Catholic Church has played a
 central role in molding the beliefs and traditions of the
 Lithuanian people. As in Poland, the history of the Church in
 Lithuania has become intertwined with the nation's sense of
 identity. Even today, after four decades of sometimes violent
 repression of religious activity by the Communist Party, a
 majority of Lithuanians are practicing believers. The Church
 has provided them with a rallying point in their efforts to
 preserve their rights and traditions against an imposed,
 repressive regime, and it has helped them to maintain contact
 with the outside world. In 1982, the Chronicle of the
 Catholic Church in Lithuania, an underground publication
 modeled on Soviet samizdat, marked its tenth year of reporting
 to Lithuanians and to the world on the restrictions imposed by
 the Soviet regime against religious activity.
 In 1939, the fate of Lithuania, like that of the other Baltic
 states, became the subject of secret negotiations between the
 Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. Like them, it was forcibly
 annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, then occupied by Nazi
 forces, and finally reconquered by the Soviet Union at the end
 of the war, with heavy human losses during each bloody
 exchange. An estimated 190,000 Jews were killed in Lithuania
 during the Nazi period; as was the case in other Nazi-occupied
 areas, some members of the local population participated in
 the exterminations. Reimposition of Soviet control was
 accompanied by mass arrests, deportations, and executions.
 During the years 1940-41 and 1944-52, almost 500,000
 Lithuanians were deported to Siberia and elsewhere in the
 U.S.S.R. Lithuanian armed resistance nevertheless persisted
 into the 1950's.
 Respect for human rights in Lithuania continued to deteriorate
 in 1983 as persecution and harassment of Catholics,
 refuseniks, and human rights activists by Soviet authorities
 followed the pace of the previous two years. Although the
 Soviet Union has attempted to eliminate independent political
 and religious activity in Lithuania since its forcible
 annexation, it is evident that these efforts have intensified
 since 1981.

 In 1980 and 1981, there occurred a number of suspicious
 assaults, several fatal, on Catholic priests. Repressive
 actions in 1983 included the arrest, trial and conviction of
 two influential Catholic priests, Father Alfonsas Svarinskas
 and Father Sigitas Tamkevicius, and of several other religious
 activists. Intimidation and harassment of worshippers and
 government control over church committees also increased.
 Lithuanians seeking to emigrate, assisting the underground
 press, or supporting nationalist ideas have also been targets
 of official Soviet persecution. Special measures have been
 taken to restrict Polish-Lithuanian contacts in order to
 prevent the birth of an independent trade union movement
 similar to Solidarity. At the same time, the economic
 situation of Lithuania has deteriorated in recent years,
 marked particularly by shortages of food and some consumer
 goods.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person
 Religious leaders and human rights activists have been victims
 of official violations of this category of rights at an
 increasing rate over the last three years. Serious violations
 occurred in 1980 and 1981 when three Catholic priests,
 Reverend Leonas Sapoka, Reverend Leonas Mazeika, and Reverend
 Bronius Laurinavicius, died under suspicious circumstances.
 The latter was a member of the Lithuanian Helsinki Monitoring
 Group, and all three of the priests had been criticized in the
 official media. There have been persistent allegations that
 Soviet security organs were involved in the deaths.
 Although there were no reports of similar deaths in 1983, two
 prominent Catholic priests were arrested for "anti-Soviet
 agitation and propaganda." Reverend Alfonsas Svarinskas was
 sentenced to seven years' imprisonment and three years of
 internal exile. He is a founder of the Committee for the
 Defense of Believers' Rights, a key contributor to Catholic
 underground publications, and active in the struggle for
 religious freedom in Lithuania. The second priest arrested
 was Reverend Sigitas Tamkevicius, an associate of Svarinskas,
 who also played a major role in defending religious beliefs in
 Lithuania. Reports indicate that Reverend Tamkevicius was the
 only friendly witness allowed to testify on behalf of Reverend
 Svarinskas during his trial and was arrested during that
 trial. Tamkevicius was sentenced in December to six years in
 a labor camp and four years' internal exile for "anti-Soviet
 agitation and propaganda."
 Soviet authorities use the legal and judicial systems of
 Lithuania as instruments for the suppression of human rights,
 rather than for their defense. The Lithuanian Criminal Code,
 like the Criminal Code of Soviet republics, contains a number
 of vaguely worded articles which limit or nullify the exercise
 of individual rights guaranteed by the Lithuanian
 Constitution. Their result is to deprive Lithuanians of any
 protection against arbitrary arrest and conviction or
 incarceration in a punitive psychiatric facility. In 1983,
 Jonas Sadunas, the brother of Nijole Sadunaite, a human rights
 activist who had returned to Lithuania in 1980 after three
 years in a labor camp and three years' internal exile, was
 
 
 1154
 sentenced to 18 months "deprivation of freedom" for slandering
 a Soviet official. Sadunas was briefly incarcerated in a
 psychiatric hospital before he was formally charged. Other
 recent examples of arbitrary arrest and detention include Mrs.
 Jadvyga Bieliauskiene, who was sentenced to four years'
 deprivation of freedom and three years' internal exile for
 conducting religious activities with children, and Edita
 Abrutiene, who was arrested one month after her husband,
 Vytautus Abrutis, a Lithuanian nationalist, was released from
 prison.
 While the total number of Lithuanian political and religious
 prisoners is not known precisely, specific information is
 available on at least 49 cases. Several of them are members of
 the Lithuanian Helsinki group and two of them, Vytautas Skuodis
 and Algirdas Statkevicius, have valid claims to U.S.
 citizenship which the Soviets refuse to recognize. Both were
 sentenced in 1980. Statkevicius was sent to the psychiatric
 hospital in Chernyakhovsk. Skoudis's wife has frequently been
 threatened and harassed by Soviet officials.
 As in the Soviet Union, arbitrary official interference with
 privacy, family, home, and correspondence is common. In 1983,
 there were numerous allegations of late night searches which
 ransacked the homes of political and religious dissidents.
 Several families, such as the Sadunas family, have reason to
 believe that their international mail is censored, and that
 letters and parcels sent to and from Lithuania are often
 confiscated or simply disappear.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights
 As evidenced by the frequent imprisonment of religious leaders,
 human rights activists, and Lithuanians involved in underground
 publications, Soviet officials show little respect for freedoms
 of speech, peaceful assembly, and religion. Press censorship
 in Lithuania is rigid, but despite the authorities' control of
 the media, underground publications have continued to appear in
 Lithuania. In addition to The Chronicle of the Catholic Church
 in Lithuania, the underground publications Ausra (The Dawn),
 Tautos Kelias (The Path of the Nation), Lietuvos Ateitis
 (Lithuania's Future), and Perspektyvos (Perspectives) appear
 regularly. Persons accused of publishing or distributing these
 publications have received harsh sentences, including prison,
 labor camp, exile, and compulsory psychiatric treatment,
 typically on the charge of "anti-Soviet agitation and
 propaganda."
 Along with the suspicious deaths and arbitrary imprisonment of
 Catholic priests mentioned above, religious activity is subject
 to systematic harassment. There are indications that over the
 last three years Soviet authorities have mounted a large-scale
 assault on religion in Lithuania. Reports claim that Soviet
 authorities are taking control of church committees and
 excluding priests from them. Catholics attending religious
 festivities have been interrogated and physically abused, and
 an historic religious shrine, "The Hill of Maidens", was
 desecrated. Many instances have been reported of the
 harassment and intimidation of children to deter them from
 attending church, and one adult was imprisoned specifically for
 conducting religious activities with children. Despite the
 
 
 1155
 fact that two long-vacant bishoprics in Lithuania were filled
 in 1982, conditions for believers in Lithuania deteriorated in
 1983.
 The intensity of the Soviet authorities' attack can be
 attributed to a fear of the Church's role as a defender of
 rights and a repository of Lithuanian national sentiment, as
 well as its active ties with the Church in Poland. Despite
 efforts by Soviet authorities to suppress its activities, the
 Catholic Church in Lithuania remains one of the most vigorous
 denominations in the Baltic states or in the Soviet Union, and
 has shown tenacity in its resistance to Soviet-imposed
 restrictions. The November 1982 issue of the Chronicle of the
 Catholic Church in Lithuania contained the text of a statement
 signed by 470 priests (out of an estimated 700 active in
 Lithuania) in four of the six dioceses of Lithuania;
 signatures from the remaining two dioceses were still being
 collected. The statement put forward seven "demands" for
 changes in Soviet policy on religious activity where that
 policy conflicted with canon law, asked the Soviet authorities
 to demonstrate goodwill through such actions as returning
 confiscated churches and allowing the construction of churches
 in new urban residential areas, and offered "normal relations"
 with the state. Following the arrest of Father Alfonsas
 Svarinskas in January 1983, Bishop Steponavicius and 98
 priests from the Kaunas Archdiocese sent a letter to General
 Secretary Andropov in Svarinskas's defense, emphasizing the
 impossibility for Catholic clergy of obeying both canon law
 and Soviet law on. religious activities. Such outspoken
 criticism of Soviet policy on this question is unmatched in
 the U.S.S.R. or in the other Baltic states. The unwillingness
 of the Soviet authorities to employ the full range of
 repressive actions at their disposal in retaliating to that
 challenge is considered by some observers a tacit
 acknowledgment of the support the Church commands in the
 general population, and of the difficulty of suppressing so
 broadly-based and militant a body without resorting to mass
 arrests and other sweeping measures.
 For both religious and political reasons, there has been
 opposition in Lithuania to the drafting of young men into the
 Soviet army, particularly for service in Afghanistan. Draft
 deferment or alternate service for reasons of conscience or
 religious belief is not permitted by the Soviet regime.
 Draftees who resist service in Afghanistan have been
 maltreated and threatened with court martial for treason.
 Those who enter the military service but continue their
 religious practices are subject to physical maltreatment and
 psychological abuse.
 The right to travel has been restricted even further in
 Lithuania over the last three years. Many Lithuanians have
 family and personal ties with Poland, and in past years travel
 back and forth was relatively frequent. Following the
 development of the Solidarity trade union in Poland, the
 Polish-Lithuanian border has been closed for extended
 periods. Before the introduction of martial law there, the
 importation of printed materials from Poland was also sharply
 reduced. Anti-Solidarity propaganda and other intimidation
 designed to suppress the formation of a free labor movement
 has been particularly marked in Lithuania.
 
 
 1156
 Emigration from Lithuania, in the past rarely and arbitrarily
 allowed, came to a virtual stop in 1983. Despite the fact
 that many Lithuanians have close relatives abroad, Soviet
 authorities use a variety of vague phrases, such as "against
 the interests of the state", in order to refuse to permit the
 reunification of many long-separated families. The Government
 uses a variety of means to deter people from emigrating,
 including dismissal from employment, psychological harassment,
 constantly changing and burdensome procedures for exit visa
 application, and a reduction of living standards. At least
 five Lithuanian families have been repeatedly refused
 permission to emigrate to the United States. Another five
 families contain a member with a claim to U.S. citizenship.
 There are 46 Lithuanian families on the list of those
 repeatedly refused permission to emigrate to Israel.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The attitude of the USSR on the right of citizens to change
 their government, as stated in Section 3 of the report on the
 Soviet Union, applies equally to Lithuania.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The attitude of Soviet authorities on the investigation of
 human rights violations within Soviet territory, as stated in
 Section 4 of the report on the Soviet Union, applies equally
 to Lithuania.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Lithuania is the most rural of the Baltic states. Despite
 Moscow's high priority on the development of industry, about
 half the labor force remains employed in agriculture.
 Like its Baltic neighbors, Lithuania until recently enjoyed
 relatively high living standards compared to the level of the
 Soviet Union. This comparative advantage is now being eroded
 in several vital sectors. Soviet statistics published for the
 first half of 1983 showed improvements in agricultural and
 industrial production of 1982. However, milk and meat
 production does not seem to keep up with the demand, and there
 are prolonged shortages of these and other food products.
 Some Lithuanians believe that the deterioration of the average
 diet will continue in the republic, even in years of high
 production, since much of Lithuania's food production is sent
 to the U.S.S.R. or to neighboring Poland. Supplies of
 high-quality consumer goods have also decreased because of
 curtailed border trade with Poland. While the quality of
 housing remains above general Soviet standards, living
 conditions as a whole are falling to the lower level common to
 the republics of the Soviet Union.
 The relative homogeneity of Lithuania's population, its strong
 sense of national identity, and the binding force of the
 Lithuanian church have helped to preserve many of the
 country's social and cultural traditions. Nevertheless, the
 disruptive effects of an anti-religious ideology, forced
 collectivization, and a policy of industrialization have been
 severe. Rigid controls on cultural and religious expression
 have forced many Lithuanians into underground activity, which
 brings them into conflict with the authorities. A reduction in
 the amount of Lithuanian language instruction at the primary
 level in 1982, with a corresponding increase in the teaching of
 Russian, has aroused fear that the groundwork is being laid for
 the eventual linguistic russification of the country. Only
 about a third of the Russian-speaking Slavs who settle in
 Lithuania learn or use the native language.
