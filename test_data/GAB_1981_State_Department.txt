 GABON
 Gabon gained independence from France in 1960 and Leon Mba,
 leader of the Bloc Democratique Gabonais, forerunner of the
 present Democratic Party of Gabon, was elected President.
 Gabon has been a single party state, in which political
 power is effectively concentrated in the presidency, since
 shortly after the accession to that office by El Hadj Omar
 Bongo in 1967. President Bongo was reelected president in
 1973 and again in December 1979. A 93-member national
 assembly, chosen from a single slate proposed by the party,
 functions regularly but has little power. The legal system
 is based upon French civil law, customary law, and the 1961
 constitution. There has been no significant opposition to
 the present leadership since President Bongo's accession to
 the presidency. The right of integrity of the person is
 generally respected; political rights are circumscribed by
 the existence of the single party system.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law. There have been no reports
 that it was practiced in 1981 or in recent years.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
 There are no reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading treat-
 ment.or punishment. There are no summary executions. Prison
 conditions are austere, with rudimentary and frequently
 crowded facilities. Visits of family members are permitted,
 and in cases where medical attention is required, the prisoner
 seems able to obtain it. Arrested persons may engage attor-
 neys of their choice if they can afford them; otherwise they
 are provided court-appointed counsel. There are no reports
 of differences in treatment due to type of conviction,
 social class, race, sex, or religion.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no reports of secret arrests or clandestine
 detention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The prohibition in the Gabonese constitution against arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment appears to be respected. No cases are
 known to have occurred in 1981. In November 1980, President
 Bongo stated that there were no political prisoners in Gabon.
 There were no indications of any such prisoners as this
 report was being prepared. However, following student dis-
 turbances in December 1981, President Bongo confirmed at a
 press conference that as many as 20 Gabonese had been arrested
 for distributing seditious tracts and would shortly be brought
 to trial. He denied foreign press reports that hundreds had
 been arrested and invited Amnesty International representa-
 tives to visit Gabonese prisons any time they wished to do so.
 
 
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by the
 Gabonese constitution and is enforced by the courts. The
 constitution states that 'the judiciary power shall be
 independent,' and it appears to be so. Defendants are
 accorded the right to counsel. Charges are formally and
 clearly stated. There are no political courts. Appeal to
 higher courts is an integral part of the judicial system.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The Gabonese constitution states that "the domicile shall
 be inviolable. Searches may be ordered only by a judge or
 other authorities designated by law." Nonetheless, there
 have been occasional instances in the past when the homes
 of foreigners have been invaded by hostile groups of
 Gabonese private citizens following political differences
 or social disturbances between their homelands and Gabon.
 In May 1981, the Cameroonian communities in several Gabonese
 cities were-subject to such attacks after trouble at an
 international soccer match. Gabonese officials have
 provided adequate protection to those affected in these
 instances.
 2. Respect For Civil And Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees liberty of conscience and the
 free practice of religion, the inviolability of correspon-
 dence and telegraphic communications, and the right to work
 regardless of sex, origins, religious beliefs, or opinions.
 However, freedom of speech, press, or assembly is not
 explicitly guaranteed. The right to form associations
 or societies and religious communities within conditions
 established by law is guaranteed by the constitution.
 Since all important organizations -- unions, women and
 youth groups -- are affiliated with the sole political
 party, all political meetings require de facto government
 approval, effectively limiting the right of free assembly.
 The media are government controlled. Television regularly
 carries live news from abroad and a small amount of coverage
 of local politics. Some candid political commentary is
 permitted. For example, the local newspaper, 'L'Union,"
 carries a daily front-page column which is frequently
 critical of some aspect of government, but never of the
 presidency. A monthly newssheet is even more outspoken.
 Since the government controls the media, any such criticism
 must have official acquiescence.   Criticizing or insulting
 the head of state, his family, or other senior government
 officials now carries a penalty of up to ten years imprison-
 ment. Foreign publications containing items critical of
 prevailing conditions circulate within Gabon. A 1980
 television broadcast of Gabon's history since independence
 included in-depth statements from members of the erstwhile
 opposition defending their former positions.

 .b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions of a political nature on emigra-
 tion or on freedom of. movement within or travel outside the
 country. The right of voluntary repatriation is recognized.
 Gabonese.communities abroad live abroad by choice. A few
 :political-exiles from other countries live in Gabon. Until
 1980, Gabon sheltered an estimated 60-70,000 Equatorial
 Guinean refugees. Most of this group became more or less
 integrated into Gabon's social and economic life and con-
 tinue to reside in Gabon in a ncn-refugee status despite the
 change in government in Equatorial Guinea in August 1979.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political participation-is restricted by the constitution to
 the single authorized party, the Democratic Party of Gabon,
 and its affiliated organizations. No citizen wishing to
 take part within this framework is prohibited from doing so.
 A revision of electoral procedures before national assembly
 elections in February 1980 provided increased opportunity for
 members of the party at the local level to choose candidates
 for the national assembly. In some areas during local and
 provincial elections in December 1980, more than one slate of
 -candidates from the Democratic Party of Gabon competed for
 election. When President Bongo stepped down as head of govern-
 ment in favor of Prime Minister Mebiame in August 1981, he
 -indicated that this would contribute to a further democrati-
 .zation of the political system. Trade unionism operates
 within government and party limitations. The right to strike
 is neither guaranteed nor prohibited. in law, but strikes are
 rare and wildcat strikes .are discouraged. There have been no
 strikes since May 1980. Union officials are believed to seek
 government approval prior to bargaining with employers.
 3. -Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 -and Non-governmental .Investigation of Alleged
 Violation of Human Rights
 No local-organizations systematically report and contest
 hupan rights violations in Gabon. There were no known cases
 in 1981 of-external non-governmental human rights groups
 seeking to conduct investigations in Gabon.
 4.. Economic:and Social Circumstances
 Recent World Bank figures put per capita GNP at about
 $3,280, but a lower one ($2,600) is suggested by
 the results of a recent census, which placed the population
 at about 1.2 million (considerably higher than earlier
 estimates). Whichever figure one uses, Gabon's large mineral
 and timber resources-(developed for the most part through
 private foreign capital) and its small population make it
 one of the most affluent countries'in Africa. Despite this
 relative affluence, however, Gabon continues to suffer from
 many of the same economic problems as its nominally poorer
 central African neighbors. Alongside the modern sector,
 a traditional society exists, essentially through subsistence
 -agriculture. As would be expected, income distribution is
 skewed decidedly in favor of the modern sector.

 The government is attempting to ensure further economic
 growth and a more equitable distribution of national in-
 come through public investment in social services (especially
 education and medicine), in infrastructure (such as transpor-
 tation) and in sectoral development, especially agriculture
 and small-to medium-size industry. The right of both men
 and women to hold private property is spelled out in the
 constitution and is scrupulously upheld. Pay scales are
 relatively high; the minimum wage is about $160 per month.
 There is little unemployment among Gabonese who wish to be
 employed.
 While corruption is not uncommon, the problem is not a major
 one for Gabonese society. Urban women are to be found in
 increasing numbers in government, in the professions
 (teaching, nursing, law), in politics and in service indus-
 tries, but their presence in the business life of Gabon
 remains very limited. In rural areas, women are largely
 restricted to their traditional roles in agriculture. In
 both rural and urban areas, most women are homemakers.
 The population growth rate is estimated at about 1.2 percent.
 Life expectancy at birth is 44.5 years, up from 40.2 years
 in 1970, due to progress in disease control, post-natal care
 and provision of medical facilities. The most recent
 adjusted primary school enrollment ratio is 202 per thousand
 (207 for males, 198 for females). Rural school construction
 continues to be a priority area, as is the recruitment and
 training of Gabonese teachers (many are now foreign). The
 percentage of calorie supply available for consumption
 relative to nutritional requirements index is 88, compared
 to 81.3 in 1970. There are no apparent signs of malnutrition.
 Government policy on economic and social needs for Gabonese
 nationals is implemented on a nondiscriminatory basis.
