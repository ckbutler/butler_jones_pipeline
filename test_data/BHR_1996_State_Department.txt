 BAHRAIN
 Bahrain is a hereditary emirate with few democratic institutions and no political
 parties. The Al Khalifa extended family has ruled Bahrain since the late 18th cen-
 tury and dominates its society and government. The Constitution confirms the Amir
 as heredit ruler. The current Amir, Shaykh Isa Bin Sulman Al Khalifa, governs
 Bahrain with the assistance of a younger brother as Prime Minister, the Amr's son
 as Crown Prince, and an appointed cabinet of ministers. In 1975 the Government
 suspended some provisions of Bahrain's 1973 Constitution, including those articles
 relating to the National Assembly, which the Government disbanded in the same
 year. There are few judicial checks on the actions of the Amir and his Government.
 Bahrainis belong to the Shi'a and Sunni sects of Islam, with the Shi'a comprising
 over two-thirds of the indigenous population. The Sunnis predominate because the
 ruling family is Sunni andis supported by the armed forces, the security service,
 and powerful Sunni and Shi'a merchant families. Bahrain experienced considerable
 political unrest throughout the year, including bomb and arson attacks on public
 and private property.
 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for public security. It controls the Public
 Security Force (police) and the extensive Security Service, which are responsible for
 maintaining internal order. The Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) is responsible for de-
 fending against external threats; however, during the year it was called upon to
 deal with civil unrest. The security forces committed numerous serious human
 rights a buses.
 Bahrain has a mixed economy, with government domination of many basic indus-
 tries, including the important oil and aluminum industries. Possessing limited oil
 and natural gas reserves, Bahrain is intensifying efforts to diversify its economic
 base and has attracted companies doing business in banking, financial services, oil-
 field services, and light manufacturing. The Government has used its modest oil
 revenues to build an advanced transportation and telecommunications infrastruc-
 ture. Bahrain has become a regional financial and business center. Tourism, par-
 ticularly via the causeway linking Bahrain to Saudi Arabia, is also a significant
 source of income.
 The Government's human rights record worsened in 1996. The main human rights
 problems continue to include the denial of the right of citizens to change their gov-
 ernment; political and other extrajudicial killings; torture; deteriorating prison con-
 ditions; arbitrary aret and incommunicado detention; involuntary exile; limitations
 on or the denial of the right to a fair public trial, especially in the Security Court;
 infringements on citizens right to privacy; and restrictions on freedom of speech,

 press assembly, association, and worker rights. Domestic violence against women
 and discrimination based on religion, ethnicity, and sex remain problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-During the year, in an effort to con-
 trol civil disturbances, measures taken by the police and security forces resulted in
 the deaths of five persons. In at least one case, the police may have beaten to death
 a young man in custody. Most of the deaths occurred when police used force on
 crowds of antigovernment demonstrators.
 On January 5, during a peaceful demonstration in the Al-Qafool area of downtown
 Manama, security forces shot an unidentified 16-year-old male in the leg who was
 then fatally struck by a vehicle when he attempted to flee the scene. On May 3,
 Fadhel Abbas Marhoon of the village of Karzakkan was fatally shot by a patrolling
 BDF unit. On July 2, 17-year-old Ali Taller was shot and killed by security forces
 during a demonstration in Sitra. On July 23, 53-year-old Zahra Kadhem Ali report-
 edly suffered a fatal heart attack when security forces arrived at her home in Bani
 J amrah to arrest her adolescent son. On August15, 19-year-old Seyed Ali Amin
 from the village of Karbabad died in police custody, reportedly after being beaten
 and tortured during inteirogation at the plice station in the village of Khamis. To
 date the Government has not investigated or prosecuted any police or security force
 personnel for these incidents.
 Seven expatriate laborers died on March 14 when antigovernment protesters bar-
 ricaded them in a restaurant in the village of Sitra and set the building on fire. One
 expatriate was also killed under similar circumstances in a separate arson attack
 in September.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are pro-
 hibited by law. There are credible reports, however, that prisoners often are beaten,
 both on the soles of their feet and about the face and head, burned with cigarettes,
 forced to endure long periods without sleep, and in some cases are subjectedto elec-
 tric shock. At least one death probably occurred as a result of torture during deten-
 tion (see Section l.a.). The Government has difficulty in rebutting allegations of tor-
 ture and of other cruel, inhuman, or degrading practices because it permits incom-
 municado detention and detention without trial. There were no known instances of
 authorities being punished for human rights abuses committed either this year or
 in any previous year.
 Opposition and human rights groups allege that the security forces sometimes
 threaten female detainees with rape and inflict other sexual abuses and harassment
 on them while they are in custody. These allegations are difficult either to confirm
 or deny.
 One death and one injury resulted from opposition bombing attacks on hotels and
 businesses in 1996. On June 30, a man was killed when an explosive device he was
 allegedly planting at a banking site detonated prematurely. On March 19, a female
 employee was severely injured when an explosive device detonated at a downtown
 hotel.
 Prison conditions are reportedly deteriorating. There are credible reports that, be-
 cause of overcrowding, the Government is now experiencing difficulties in providing
 prisoners with adequate sanitation, sleeping areas, food water, and health care.
 At the Government's invitation, the International dommittee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) sent a delegation to inspect the prisons in November. ICRC inspections are
 reportedy to continue into 1997.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile-The 1974 Constitution stated that "no
 person shall be arrested, detained imprisoned, searched or compelled to reside in
 a specified place      except in accordance with the provisions of the law and
 under the supervision of the judicial authorities." In practice, however, in matters
 regarding arrest, detention, or exile, the 1974 State Security Act takes precedence.
 Under the State Security Act, persons may be detained for up to 3 years without
 trial for engaging in activities or making statements regarded as a threat to the
 broadly defined concepts of national harmony and security, and the Government
 continued to arbitrarily arrest and detain citizens. In March the scope of the State
 Security Act of 1974 was expanded to include any case involving arson, explosions,
 or attacks on persons at their place of employment or because ofthe nature of their
 work. Detainees have the right to appeal such detentions after a period of 3 months
 and, if the appeal is denied, every 6 months thereafter from the date of the original
 detention.
 
 
 1234
 Government security forces used the State Security Act regularly during 1996 to
 detain persons believed by the Government to be engaging in antiregime activities,
 as well as those attempting to exercise their right of free speech, association, or
 other rights deemed to be in opposition to the Government. Activities that can also
 lead to detention, questioning, warning, or arrest by the security forces include:
 membership in illegal organizations or those deemed        subversive; painting
 antiregime slogans on walls; joining antigovernment demonstrations; possessing or
 circulating antiregime writings; preaching sermons considered by the Government
 to have an antiregime political tone; and harboring or associating with persons com-
 mitting such acts.
 In addition to overseeing the security service and police the Ministry of Interior
 also controls the Office of the Public Prosecutor, whose officers initially determine
 whether sufficient evidence exists to continue to hold a prisoner in investigative de-
 tention. The Ministry is responsible for all aspects of prison administration. In the
 early stages of detention, prisoners and their attorneys have no recourse to any au-
 thority outside the Ministry of Interior. The authorities rarely permit visits to in-
 mates who are incarcerated for security-related offenses and such prisoners may be
 held incommunicado for months, sometimes years. Prisoners detained for criminal
 offenses, however, generally may receive visits from family members, usually once
 a month.
 The number of women detained for questioning or placed under arrest for
 antigovernment offenses increased during 1996. However, credible sources within
 the legal profession state that the authorities do not as a rule hold women in deten-
 tion for long periods.
 Security forces are estimated to have held over 3,000 people in detention in 1996,
 including some who were arrested, released, and then arrested again. At year's end,
 as many as 1,500 detainees still remained in detention.
 Abdul Amir AI-Jamri, a prominent Shi'a cleric, longtime opposition activist, and
 one of the original 14 signers of the 1994 petition to the Amir calling for the restora-
 tion of the National Assembly, was arrested on January 21 and remains in deten-
 tion. A-Jamri is accused of committing a wide variety of security-related crimes, in-
 cluding treason. Several other Shi'a clerics associated with Al-Jamri, including
 Abdul Wahab Hussein, Hassan Mushaimaa, Hassan Sultan, Ali Bin Ahmed Al-
 Jedhafsi, and Haji Hassan Jarallah, were also arrested in January and remain in
 detention.
 While the authorities reserve their right to use exile and the revocation of citizen-
 ship to punish individuals suspected of, or convicted of, antiregime activity, there
 were no reports of exile orders issued in 1996. In the past, the Government has re-
 voked the citizenship of nationals who are considered security threats. The Govern-
 ment considers these individuals to have forfeited their nationality under the Citi-
 zenship Act of 1963 because they accepted foreign citizenship or passports, or en-
 gaged in antiregime activities abroad. B haii emigre groups and their local con-
 tacts have challenged this practice, arguing that the Goveent's revocation of citi-
 zenship without due process violates Bain's 1973 constitution. According to the
 emigre groups, as many as 500 Babrainis continue to live in exile. This figure in-
 cluds both those prohibited from returning to Bahrain and their family members
 who voluntarily live abroad with them.
 During the year the Government released over 150 persons detained in connection
 with antigovernment activities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial .-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, the courts are subject to government pressure regarding sentencing
 and appeals.
 The civil and criminal legal system consists of a conplex mix of courts, based on
 diverse lecal sources including Sunni and Si'a Shari'a (Islamic law), tribal law, and
 other civi codes and regulations. The 1974 State Security Act created a separate,
 closed security court system which was given wider jurisdiction in cases of
 antigovernmnent activity and was expanded from one to three courtrooms.
 The Bahrain Defense Force maintains a separate court system for military per-
 sonnel accused of offenses under the Military Code of Justice. Military courts do not
 review cases involving civilian criminal or security offenses.
 Defense attorneys are appointed by the Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs.
 Some attorneys and family members involved in politically sensitive criminal cases
 complained that the Government can and has interfered with court proceedings to
 influence the outcome or to prevent judgments from being carried out. There are
 periodic allegations of corruption in the judicial system.
 In past cases, the Amir, the Prime Minister, and other senior government officials
 have all lost civil cases brought against them by private citizens. The courts ordered
 these judgments to be carried out. Members of the ruling Al Khalifa family are well
 
 
 1235
 represented in the judiciary and do not generally excuse themselves from cases in-
 volving the interests of the regime.
 A person arrested may be tried in an ordinary criminal court or, if recommended
 by the prosecution, in the Security Court. Ordinary civil or criminal trials provide
 procedural guarantees for an open trial, the right to counsel (with legal aid avail-
 able when necessary), and the right to appeal. Criminal court proceedings generally
 do not appear to discriminate against women, children, or minority groups. How-
 ever there is credible evidence that persons accused of antigovernment crimes and
 tried in the criminal courts were denied fair trials. The accused are not permitted
 to speak with an attorney until their appearance before the judge at the preliminary
 hearing. Trials in the criminal courts for antiregime activities were held in secret.
 Security cases are tried in secret by the Supreme Court of Appeal, sitting as the
 Security Court. Family members are usually not permitted in the court until the
 final verdict is rendered. Procedures in the security courts do not provide for even
 the most basic safegards. The Security Court is exempt from adhering to the proce-
 dural guarantees of the Penal Code. efendants may be represented by counsel but
 seldom see their attorneys before the actual day of arraignment. Convictions may
 be based solely on confessions and police evidence or testimony that may be intro-
 duced in secret. There is no discovery. Defense lawyers complain that they are rare-
 ly given sufficient time to develop witnesses. There is no right to judicial review of
 the legality of arrests. There is no judicial appeal of a State Security Court verdict,
 but the defendant may request clemency from the Amir. Over 117 Security Court
 convictions were publicly acknowledged by the Government by year's end, compared
 with fewer than 50 the previous year.
 The number of political prisoners is difficult to determine because the Govern-
 ment does not release data on security cases, such cases are not tried in open court,
 and visits to prisoners convicted of security offenses are severely restricted. The
 Government denies that there are any political prisoners, claiming that all inmates
 incarcerated for committing security offenses were properly convicted of subversive
 acts such as espionage, espousing or committing violence, or belonging to terrorist
 organizations.
 In accordance with tradition, the Government releases and grants amnesty to
 some prisoners, including individuals imprisoned for political activities, on major
 holidays. The Government pardoned over 100 prisoners in May during the Eid Al-
 Adha holiday.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the law, the Ministry of Interior is empowered to authorize entry into private prem-
 ises without specific judicial intervention. Domestic and international telephone
 calls and correspondence are subject to monitoring. Police informer networks are ex-
 tensive and sophisticated.
 During the year, the Government infringed on citizens' right to privacy on a
 broad-scale, using illegal searches and arbitrary arrests as tactics to control political
 unrest. Security forces routinely raided villages at night, entered private homes
 without warrants, and took into custody residents who were suspectedof either par-
 ticipating in or having information regarding antigovernment activities. While con-
 ducting these raids, security forces frequently confiscated, damaged, or destroyed
 personal property for which owners were not compensated by the Government. Secu-
 rity forces also regularly set up checkpoints at the entrances to villages, requiring
 vehicle searches and proof of identity from anyone seeking to enter or exit. In many
 villages, although there were no official curfews, security forces routinely arrested
 villagers who ventured outside their residences after sundown. On one occasion, at
 least two villages were locked down completely by security forces, with residents un-
 able to enter or leave for several days. For a period of months in the early part of
 the year, the Government disabled all public telephones to prevent outside commu-
 nications. The Government generally jams either in whole or in part foreign broad-
 casts that carry antigovernment programming or commentary. In May the authori-
 ties jammed a satellite transmission of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)
 program Assignment because it contained a report on the political unrest that was
 critical of the Government. A government-controlled proxy prohibits user access to
 Internet sites considered to be antiregime or anti-Islamic (see Section 2.a.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While the Constitution provides for the right
 "to express and propagate opinions," Bahrainis are not, in practic, free to express
 public opposition to the Government in speech or writing. Press criticism of ruling
 personalities and of government policy regarding certain sensitive subjects--
 such as sectarian unrest and the dispute with Qatar over the Hawar Islands-are
 strictly prohibited. However, local press coverage and commentary on international
 
 
 1236
 
 issues is open, and discussion of local economic and commercial issues is also rel-
 atively unrestricted. Many individuals express critical opinions openly on domestic
 political and social issues in private settings but do not do so to leading government
 officials or in public forums.
 The Information Ministry exercises sweeping control over all local media. Bah-
 rain's newspapers are privately owned but routinely exercise self-censorship of sto-
 ries on sensitive topics. In January the Government changed its policy of withhold-
 ing information from the public regarding incidents of unrest and permitted more,
 albeit slanted, articles to be published in the local press. The Government does not
 condone unfavorable coverage of its domestic policies by the international media and
 has occasionally revoked the press credentials of offending journalists. Since the
 Ministry also sponsors foreign Journalists' residence permits, this action can lead to
 deportation. There were no deportations of journalists during the year. Ahmed Al-
 Shamoan, a local columnist and attorney, was jailed m         February for his
 antigovernment writings but was released in April when the charges against him
 were dropped. The Government generally afforded foreign journalists access to Bahi-
 rain and did not limit their contacts on the island, nor did they penalize reporters
 afterward for unfavorable stories.
 The State owns and operates all radio and television stations. Radio and tele-
 vision broadcasts in Arabic and Farsi from neighboring countries and Egypt can be
 received without interference. International news services, however, including the
 Associated Press, United Press International, and Agence France Presse, frequently
 complain about press restrictions. The Cable News Network is available on a 24-
 hour basis by subscription and the BBC world news service is carried on a local
 channel 24 hours a day free-of-charge. However, the Government generally jams
 wholy or paially foreign broadcasts that carry antigovernment programming or
 commentary.(see Section 1.f.
 Many senior government officials, ruling family members, and major hotels use
 satellite dishes to receive international broadcasts, as do well-to-do private citizens.
 The Ministry of Information closely controls access to.satellite dishes, and the im-
 portation or installation of dishes without prior government approval is illegal.
 The Internet system was introduced to Bahrain through the National Telephone
 Company (Batelco) in 1995. The number of users more than doubled during 1996.
 A government-contrlled proxy prohibits user access to sites considered to be
 antiregime or anti-Islamic, but e-mail access to information is unimpeded, although
 it may be subject to monitoring.
 Although there are no formal regulations limiting academic freedom, as a prac-
 tical matter academics try to avoid contentious political issues. In 1996 the Govern-
 ment introduced a new university admissions policy that appears to favor Sunnis
 and others who pose no question of loyalty and serity, rather than focusing only
 on professional experience and academic qualifications. This policy was accompanied
 by a major shakeup in the university's administration that removed many Shi'a
 from semor-level positios.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Despite the Constitution's pro-
 vision for the right of free assembly, the Government prohibits all public political
 demonstrations and meetings and controls religious gatherings that may take on po-
 litical overtones. Unauthorized public gatherings of more than five persons are pro-
 hibited by law. The Government monitors gatherings that might take on a political
 tone and frequently disperses such meetings.
 On a regular basis from January through July, the security forces used tear gas,
 rubber bullets, and, occasionally, live ammunition to disperse gatherings during
 which protesters called for the reestablishment of an elected parliament and the re-
 lease of prisoners; objected to Al Khalifa rule; denounced police brutality; protested
 foreigners in the security forces and in the labor force; and demanded increased em-
 ployment opportunities. After each of these incidents, suspected leaders and active
 participants were arrested.
 The Government prohibits political parties and organizations. Some professional
 societies and social/sports clubs have traditionally served as forums for discreet po-
 litical discussion, but they are restricted by law from engaging in political activity.
 Only the Bahraini Bar Association has been granted an exemption to the regulation
 requiring all associations to state in their constitutions that they will refrain from
 political activity. The Bar Association successfully argued that a lawyer's profes-
 sional duties may require certain political actions, such as interpreting legislation
 or participating in a politically sensitive trial. Other organized discussions and
 meetings are still actively discouraged. Permits are required for most public gather-
 ings, and permission is not routinely granted.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The population is overwhelmingly Muslim and Islam is
 the state religion. However, Christians and other non-Muslims, including Jews, Hin-
 
 
 1237
 dus, and Baha'is are free to practice their religion, maintain their own places of wor-
 ship and may display the sumbols of their relHgion. Bibles and other Christian publi-
 cations are displayed and sold openlyin local bookshops, which also sell Islamic and
 other religious literature. Some small groups worship in their homes. Notables from
 virtually every religion and denomination visit Bahrain and frequently meet with
 government and civic leaders. Religious tracts of all Islamic sects, cassettes of ser-
 mons delivered by Muslim preachers from other countries, and publications of other
 religions are readily available.
 Proselytizing by non-Muslims is discouraged, anti-Islamic writings prohibited, and
 conversions from Islam to other religions, while not illegal, are not well tolerated
 by societ.
 Both unni and Shi'a sects are subject to governmental control and monitoring.
 During the months of January and February, the Government closed mosques and
 ma'tams (Shi'a community centers) in certain locations to prevent religious leaders
 from delivering political speeches during their Friday prayers and sermons. There
 are also reports that security forces entered several religious facilities and removed
 communication equipment, such as computers, printers and facsimile machines,
 that were alleged to be used to further political unrest. in March the Government
 established the High Council for Islamic Affairs which includes among its functions
 review and approval of all clerical appointments within both the Sunni and Shi'a
 communities and program oversight for all citizens studying religion abroad. The
 Council is still awaiting several key appointments and has yet to issue any direc-
 tives. Public religious events, most notably the large annual commemorative
 marches by Shi'a, are permitted but are closely watched by the police. There are
 no restrictions on the number of citizens permitted to make pilgrimages to Shi'a
 shrines and holy sites in Iran, Iraq, and Syria. However, owing to conditions in Iraq,
 very few citizens make pilgrimages there. The Government monitors travel to Iran
 and scrutinizes carefully those who choose to pursue religious study there. Travel
 to Iran for pilgrimages, business trips, tourism, and family visits, however, is not
 forbidden.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to move within the country and change their place of
 residence or work. Passports, however, may be denied on political grounds. Approxi-
 mately 3 percent of the indigenous population, the "bidoon," or stateless persons,
 mostly Persian-origin Shi'a, do not have passports and cannot readily obtain them,
 although they may be issued travel documents as Bahraii residents (see Section
 5). About 150 Sunni bidoon, mostly from the Arabian Peninsula, were granted citi-
 zenship in 1995, and about 15 Egyptian citizens resident in Barain also received
 citizenship.
 Citizens living abroad who are suspected of political or criminal offenses may face
 arrest and trial upon return to Bahrain. Under the 1963 Citizenship Law, the Gov-
 ernment may reject applications to obtain or renew passports for reasonable cause,
 but the applicant has the right to appeal such decisions before the High Civil Court.
 The Government has also issued temporary passports, good for one trip within a
 year, to individuals whose travel it wishes to control or whose claim to Bahraini na-
 tionality is questionable. Noncitizen residents, including Bidoon of Iranian origin,
 may also obtain Bahraini laissez passers, usually valid for 2 years and renewable
 at Bahraini embassies overseas. Laissez passer holders also require visas to reenter
 Bahrain.
 Bahrain does not usually accept refugees due to its small size and limited re-
 sources.. In practice, however, refugees who arrive in Bahrain are not repatriated
 to countries from which they have fled. Many Iranian emigres who fled I ran after
 the Iranian revolution have been granted permission to remain in Bahrain, but they
 have not been granted citizenship. Although the Government cooperates with the
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to the maximun extent possible, it has not
 formulated a formal policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment.
 Citizens do not have the right or ability peacefully to change their government
 or their political system, and political activity is strictly controlled by the Govern-
 ment. Since the dissolution of the National Assembly in 1975, there have been no
 formal democratic political institutions. The Government permits neither political
 parties nor opposition organizations. The Prime Minister makes all appointments to
 the Cabinet. All other government positions are filled by the relevant ministries.
 About one-third of the cabinet ministers are Shi'a Muslim, although they do not
 hold security-related offices. The ordinary citizen may attempt to influence govern-
 ment decisions through submission of personal written petitions and informal con-
 
 
 1238
 tact with senior officials, including appeals to the Amir, the Prime Minister, and
 other officials at their regularly scheduled public audiences, called majlises.
 In 1992 the Amir establish by decree a Consultative Council (Majlis Al-Shura.)
 Its members are evenly divided between Sunni and Shi'a and are appointed by the
 Amir. They are selected to represent major constituent groups, including representa-
 tives from the business, labor, professional, and religious communities. There are no
 members of the ruling Al Khalifa family or religious extremists in the Majils. In
 September two Amiri decrees amended the Council's structure and mandate to allow
 for an expanded membership-from 30 to 40-and increased powers, including de-
 bate on issues not submitted to it by the Cabinet. The Majls may also summon cab-
 inet ministers to answer questions, but its recommendations are not binding on the
 Government. The Majlis held its fourth session from October 1995 to June 1996 and
 began a new session on October 1. The chairman is a prominent Shi'a who formerly
 was Minister of Transport and Communications.
 In 1996 the Majlis debated a number of contentious social and economic issues,
 including unemployment, labor policy, and education, drafting proposals on these
 and other subjects for government consideration. According to the Speaker of the
 Mailis, the Government responded positively to the majority of the Majlis's rec-
 ommendations by incorporating them into legislation or by taking other appropriate
 actions.
 There are no women in either the Consultative Council or at the ministerial levels
 of government. The majority of women who choose to work in government are in
 a support capacity and only a few have managed to attain senior positions within
 their respective ministries or agencies.
 Section 4. Government Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigations of Aleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights organizations. Because of the restrictions on free-
 dom of association and expression, any independent, domestically based investiga-
 tion or public criticism of the Government's human rights policies faces major obsta-
 cles. A number of groups based abroad claim to report on Bahraini human rights
 violations. These include the Damascus-based Committee for the Defense of Human
 Rights in Bahrain, the London-based Bahrain Freedom Movement and the Islamic
 Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, and the Copenhagen-based Bahrain Human
 Rights Organization, formerly the Committee for the Defense of Political Prisoners
 inBahrain. These groups are composed of small numbers of emigres living in self-
 imposed exile and reportedly receive funding from sources hostile to the Govern-
 ment. They are viewed by many local observers as espousing a political, rather than
 a purely human rights, agenda.
 The Government maintains that it is not opposed to visits in good faith by bonn
 fide human rights organizations and has engaged in dialog with the International
 Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International (AT). In practice, however,
 international human rights organizations have found it difficult to conduct activities
 in Bahrain. In October the Government invited the ICC to undertake inspections
 of Bahraines prisons, reportedly on the grounds that the ICrC's findings would not
 be made public. The inspections have been under way since November and are ex-
 pected to continue into early 1997.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that "liberty, equality, security, tranquility, education, so-
 cial solidarity, and equal opportunities for citizens shall be pillars of society assured
 by the State." It further states that every citizen shall have the right to medical
 care, welfare, education, property, capital, and work. In practice, however, these
 rights are unevenly protected, depending on the individual's social status, ethnicity,
 or sex.
 Women.-Violence against women occurs, but incidents are usually kept witbin
 the family. In general there is little public attention to, or discussion of, violence
 against women. No Government policies explicitly address violence against women.
 Women's gups and health care professionals state that spouse abuse is common,
 particulary in oorer communities. There are veiy few known instances of Baraini
 women seeking legal redress for violence. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the
 courts are not receptive to such cases.
 Cases are not uncommon of foreign women working as domestic servants who
 have been beaten or sexually abused. Numerous cases have been reported to local
 embassies and the police. Moast victims, however, are too intimidated to sue their
 employers. Those who do so appear to be received sympathetically in the courts.
 
 
 1239
 Islamic law (Shari'a) governs the legal rights of women. Specific rights vary ac-
 cording to Shi'a or Sunni interpretations of Islamic law, as determined by the indi-
 vidual faith, or by the court in which various contracts, including marriage, have
 been made.
 While both Shi'a and Sunni women have the right to initiate a divorce, religious
 courts may refuse the request. Although local religious courts may grant a divorce
 to Shi'a women in routine cases, occasionall Shi'a women seeking divorce under un-
 usual circumstances must travel outside olBahrain to seek a higher ranking opin-
 ion than is available in Bahrain. Women of either sect may own and inherit prop-
 erty and may represent themselves in all public and legal matters. In the absence
 of a direct male heir, Shi'a women may inherit all property. In contrast, Sunni
 women-in the absence of a direct male heir-inherit only a portion; the balance
 is divided among brothers, uncles, and male cousins of the deceased.
 In the event of divorce, the courts routinely grant Shi'a and Sunni women custody
 of daughters under the age of 9 and sons under age 7, although custody usually re-
 verts to the father once the children reach those respective ages. In all cir-
 cumstances except mental incapacitation, the father, regardless of custody, retains
 the right to make certain legal decisions for his children, such as guardianship of
 any property belonging to the child until the child reaches legal age. A non-Bahraini
 woman automatically loses custody of her children if she divorces their Bahraini fa-
 ther. Women may obtain passports and leave the country without the permission
 of the male head of the household. Bahraini women are free to work outside the
 home, to drive cars without escorts, and to wear the clothing of their choice (a large
 percentage wear Western dress outside the home), and have increasingly taken jobs
 previously reserved for men. Labor law does not discriminate against women- how-
 ever, in practice there is discrimination in the workplace, including inequality of
 wages and denial of opportunity for advancement. Women constitute over 20 percent
 of the work force. The Government has encouraged the hiring of women, enacted
 special laws to promote female entry into the work force, and is a leading employer
 of women. Labor law does not recognize the concept of equal pay for equal work,
 and women are generally paid less than men. Generally, women work outside the
 home during the years between secondary school or university and marriage.
 Women make up the majority of students at Bahrain's universities. There are wom-
 en's organizations that seek to improve the status of women under both civil and
 Islamic law.
 Some women have expressed the view that, despite their participation in the work
 force, women's rights are not significantly advancing and that much of the lack of
 progress is due to the influence of Islamic religious traditionalists. Other women,
 however, desire a return to more traditional religious values and support calls for
 a return to Islamic patterns of social behavior.
 Children.-The Government has often stated its commitment to the protection of
 children's rights and welfare within the social and religious framework of this tradi-
 tional society. It honors this commitment through enforcement of its civil and crimi-
 nal laws and an extensive social welfare network. Public education for children
 below the age of 16 is free and compulsory. Limited medical services for infants and
 adolescents are provided free of charge.
 The social status of children is shaped by tradition and religion to a greater ex-
 tent than by civil law. Public discussion of child abuse is rare, and the preference
 of the authorities has always been to leave such matters within the purview of the
 family or religious groups. The authorities actively enforce the laws against pros-
 titution, including child prostitution, procuring, and pimping. Violators are dealt
 with harshly and can be imprisoned, or if non-Bahrami, deported. In some cases,
 authorities reportedly will return children arrested for prostitution and other non-
 political crimes to their families rather than prosecute them, especially for first of-
 fenses. Some legal experts have called on the Government to establish a separate
 juvenile court. Other Bahrainis, however, insist that the protection of children is a
 religious, not a secular, function and oppose greater government involvement. Inde-
 penSent and quasi-governmental organizations such as the Balraini Society for the
 Protection of Children and the Mother and Child Welfare Society play an active part
 in protecting children by providing counseling, legal assistance, and advice an  in
 some cases, shelter and financial support to distressed children and families.
 Detentions and arrests of juveniles, some as young as 7 years old, increased in
 1996 in connection with the political unrest. These children were generally released
 without charges within several days of their arrests. However, those juveniles
 charged with security offenses received the same treatment as adult prisoners, i.e.,
 incommunicado detention and trial before a state security court.
 People With Disabilities.-The law protects the rights of people with disabilities,
 and a variety of governmental, quasi-governmental, and religious institutions are
 
 
 1240
 mandated to support and protect disabled persons. The Regional (Arabian Gulf)
 Center for the Treatment of the Blind is headquartered in Bahrain and a similar
 Center for the Education of Deaf Children was established in 1994. Bahraini society
 tends to view people with disabilities as special cases in need of protection rather
 than as fully functioning members of society. Nonetheless, the Government is re-
 quired by law to provide vocational training for disabled persons wishing to work
 and maintains a list of certified, trained disabled persons. The Labor Law of 1976
 also requires that any employer  of over 100 people must engage at least 2 percent
 of its employes from the Government's list of disabled workers. The Ministry of
 Labor and Social Affairs works actively to place people with disabilities in public
 sector jobs, such as in the public telephone exchanges. The Government's housing
 regulations require that access be provided to disabled persons. Most large public
 buildings are equipped with ramps and other aids that make them accessible to dis-
 abled persons.
 Reli ious Minorities.-Although there are notable exceptions, the Sunni Muslim
 minority enoys a favored status in Bahrain. Sunnis generally receive preference for
 employment in sensitive government positions and in the managerial ranks of the
 civil service. Shi'a citizens are not allowed to hold significant posts in the Bahrain
 defense and internal security forces. During 1996 employment opportunities for
 Shi'a citizens in the government sector became more restricted. In the private sec-
 tor Shi'a tend to be employed in lower paid, less skilled jobs.
 Educational, social, and municipal services in most Shi'a neighborhoods, particu-
 larly in rural villages, are inferior to those found in Sunni urban communities. In
 an effort to remedy social discrimination, improve living conditions for the Shi'a,
 and encourage integration, the Government has built numerous subsidized housing
 complexes open to all citizens on the basis of financial need.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-A group of approximately 9,000 to 15,000
 persons, mostly of Persian-origin and Shi'a, but including some Christians, are
 stateless. They are commonly known as bidoon and enjoy less than full citizenship
 under the Citizenship Act of 1963. Many of the bidoon are second- or third-genera-
 tion residents whose ancestors emigrated from Iran. Although they no longer claim
 Iranian citizenship, they have not ben gantd Baraini nationality. Without citi-
 zenship these individuals are officially unable to buy land, start a business, or ob-
 tain government loans, although in practice many do. The law does not address the
 citizenship rights of persons who were not registered with the authorities prior to
 1959, creating a legal problem for such persons and their descendants and resulting
 in economic and other hardships. The Government maintains that many of those
 who claim to be bidoon are actually citizens of Iran or other gulf states who have
 voluntarily chosen not to renew their foreign passports. Bidoon and Bahrainis who
 speak Farsi, rather than Arabic, as their first language also face significant social
 and economic obstacles, including difficulty finding employment.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The partially suspended 1973 Constitution recog-
 nizes the right of workers to organize, but internationally affiliated trade unions do
 not exist. The Constitution states that "freedom to form associations and trade
 unions on national bases and for lawful objectives and by peaceful means shall be
 guaranteed in accordance with the conditions and in the manner prescribed by the
 law. No person shall be compelled to join or remain in any association or union."
 In response to labor unrest in the mid-1950's, 1965, and 1974, the Government
 passed a series of labor regulations which, among other things, allow the formation
 of elected workers' committees in larger companies. Worker representation today is
 based on a system of Joint Labor-Management Committees (JLC's) established by
 ministerial decree. Between 1981 and 1984, 12 JLC's were established in the major
 state-owned industries. Four new JLC's were established in 1994 in the private sec-
 tor, including one in a major hotel.
 In 1995 elections were held for 2-year terms for representatives to the General
 Committee of Bahrain Workers (GCBW), which oversees the activities of the JLC's.
 Workers from all types of occupations were elected to the body in 1995, including
 Sunni and Shi'a Muslims, expatriates and, for the first time, a woman. These elec-
 tions, which were by secret ballot and appeared to be free, were carried out during
 the worst of the demonstrations. The Government is considering the further expan-
 sion of the JLC system into the tourism and banking sectors.
 The JLC's are composed of equal numbers of appointed management representa-
 tives and worker representatives elected from and by company employees. Each
 committee is chaired alternately by the management and worker representative.
 The selection of worker representatives appears to be fair; under the law the Min-
 istry of Interior may exclude worker candidates with criminal records or those
 
 
 1241
 deemed a threat to national security. The elected labor representatives of the JLC's
 select the 11 members of the GCBW, established in 1983 by law, which oversees
 and coordinates the work of the JLC's. The Committee also hears complaints from
 Bahraini and foreign workers and assists them in brin  their complaints to the
 attention of the Ministry of Labor or the courts. Although the Government and com-
 pany management are not represented on the GCBW, the Ministry of Labor closely
 monitors the bodys activities. It approves the GCBW's rules and the distribution
 of GCBW funds. The JLC-GCBW system represents nearly 70 percent of the island's
 indigenous industrial workers, although both government and labor representatives
 readily admit that nonindustrial workers and expatriates are cleary underrep-
 resented in the system. The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs has publicly urged
 the formation of JLC's in all public and private sector companies employing more
 than 200 workers. Although expatriate workers comprise 67 percent of the work
 force, expatriates are underrepresented in the GCBW . Expatriate workers can and
 do participate in JLC elections, and five expatriates currently serve on JLC's. None,
 however, currently sits on the board of the GCBW. It is a long-term goal of both
 the Government and the GCBW to replace expatriate workers with Bahrainis
 throughout all sectors of the economy and to create new jobs for Bahrainis seeking
 employment.
 K   Labor Law is silent on the right to strike, and there were no strikes in 1996.
 Actions perceived to be detrimental to the "existing relationship" between employers
 and employees or to the economic health of the State are forbidden by the 1974 Se-
 curity Law. There are no recent examples of major strikes, but walkouts and other
 job actions have been known to occur without governmental intervention and with
 positive results for the workers.
 The GCBW represents Bahraini workers at the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) and in the Arab Labor Organization, but does not belong to any international
 trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-As in the case of strikes, the
 Labor Law neither grants nor denies workers the right to organize and bargain col-
 lectively outside the JLC s!stem. While the JLC's are empowered to discuss labor
 disputes, organize workers services, and discuss wages, working conditions, and
 productivity, the workers have no independent, recognized vehicle for representing
 their interests on these or other labor-related issues. JLC's hold discussions with
 management on some working conditions and limited asects of wage issues. Mini-
 mum wage rates for public sector employees are established by Council of Minister
 decrees. Private businesses generally follow the Government's lead in establishing
 their wage rates.
 There are two export processing zones. Labor law and practice are the same in
 these zones as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law. In practice, the labor laws apply for the most part only to citizens,
 and abuses occur, particularly those involving domestic workers and those working
 illegally. In some cases, workers arrive in Bahrain under the sponsorship of an em-
 ployer and then switch jobs, while continuing to pay a fee to their original sponsor.
 The Government has announced its intention to abolish this illegal practice, which
 makes it difficult to monitor and control the employment conditions of domestic and
 other workers. However, no substantive action has yet been taken.
 Amendments to the Labor Law passed in November 1993 stiffened the penalties
 for engaging in visa switching to include jail sentences of up to 6 months for the
 sponsor of every illegally sponsored worker. In such cases, the workers involved are
 likely to be deported as illegal immigrants after the case is concluded.
 The sponsorship system leads to abuses. There are numerous reports that employ-
 ers withhold salaries from their foreign workers for months, even years, at a time
 and may refuse to grant them the necessary permission to leave the country. The
 Government and the courts generally work to rectify those abuses brought to its at-
 tention, but fear of deprtation or employer retaliation prevent man y foreign work-
 ers from making complaints to the authorities.
 Labor laws do not apply to domestic servants. There are credible reports that do-
 mestic servants, especially women, are sometimes forced to work 12- or 16-hour
 days, given little time off, and are subjected to verbal and physical abuse.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 14 years of age. Juveniles between the ages of 14 and 16 may not be employed
 in hazardous conditions or at night and may not work more than 6 hours per day
 or on a piecework basis. Child labor laws are effectively enforced by Ministry of
 Labor inspectors in the industrial sector, child labor outside that sector is less well
 monitored but is not believed to be significant outside family operated businesses.
 
 
 1242
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wage scales, set by government de-
 cree, exist for public sector employees and generally afford a decent standard of liv-
 ing forworkers and their families. The current minimum wage for the publicsector
 is $236.60 (91 dinars) a month. Wages in the private sector are determined on a
 contract basis. For foreign workers, employers consider benefits such as annual trips
 home and housing and education bonuses part of the salary.
 The Ministry of Labr enforces the labor laws, with periodic inspetions and fines
 routinely imposed on violators. Provisions to the LaborLaw passedin 1993 stiffened
 the fines and prison terms for certain violations. The press often performs an om-
 budsman function on labor problems, reporting job disputes and the results of labor
 cases brought before the courts. Once a cornplaint has been lodged by a worker, the
 Labor Ministry opens an investigation and often takes remedial action.
 The Labor Law, enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, mandates
 acceptable conditions of work for all adult workers, including adequate standards
 regarding hours of work (maximum 48 hours per week) and occupational safety and
 health. The Fourth High Court (Labor) has jurisdiction over cases involving alleged
 violations of the Labor Law.
 Complaints brought before the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs that cannot
 be settled through arbitration must, by law, be referred to the court within 15 days.
 In practice, most employers p refer to settle such disputes through arbitration, par-
 ticularly since the court and labor law are generally considered to favor the em-
 pboee Under the Labor Law workers have the right to remove themselves from
 dangerous work situations without jeopardy to their continued employment. In 1993
 the Government strengthened the Labor Law by Aniri decree, announcing that sig-
 nificant fines and jail sentences would be imposed upon private sector employers
 who fal to pay legal wages. This law applies equally to employers of citizens and
 expatriates and is intended to reduce abuses against foreign workers who have
 sometimes been denied legal salaries. The law provides equal protection to Baraini
 and foreign workers, but all foreign workers still require sponsorship by Bahrinis
 or Barain-based institutions and companies. Subject to sanctions for wrongful dis-
 missal, sponsors are able to cancel the residence permit of any person under their
 sponsorship and thereby block them for 1 year from obtaining entry or residence
 visas from another sponsor.
 Foreign workers, particularly those from developing countries, are often unwilling
 to report abuses for fear of losing residence rights and having to return to their na-
 tive countries. Instances of foreign workers being denied full wages, days off, vaca-
 tions, or other guaranteed conditions of employment without compensation are peri-
 odically reported in the local press, as well as the court rulings or Ministry of Labor
 and Social Affairs actions taken in response. Nonetheless, government attempts to
 address individual abuses in these and other cases are often hampered by the work-
 ers' unwillingness to make a formal complaint.
 In addition, the Labor Law specifically favors citizens over foreign workers, fol-
 lowed by Arab expatriates over other foreign workers, in hiring and firing. Because
 employers include housing and other allowances in their salary scales, expatriate
 workers can legally be paid lower regular wages than their Bahraini counterparts,
 although they sometimes receive the s me s or a greater total compensation package
 because of home leave and holiday pay allowances. Western expatriates and B a-
 raini workers are paid cornparable wages, with total compensation packages often
 significantly greater for the former. Women are entitled to 60 days of paid maternity
 leave, nursing periods during the day, and up to 1 year of unpaid maternity leave.
 However, women are generally paid less than men.
