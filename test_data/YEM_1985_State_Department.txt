 PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN*
 The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen) is a
 one-party state under the control of the Marxist-Leninist
 Yemen Socialist Party (YSP). The present leader of the YSP
 and President of South Yemen, Ali Nasir Mohammed, came to
 power in 1980 when his predecessor, Abd Al-Fattah Isma'il, was
 ousted in a bloodless coup and fled to exile in Moscow.
 Although confronted by an array of more militant Marxist
 rivals, including Abd Al-Fattah, who returned from the Soviet
 Union in 1985, Ali Nasir has retained his position because of
 Soviet support and was reelected to the party chairmanship at
 the Third YSP General Congress in October 1985. Since 1979,
 South Yemen has remained firmly within the Soviet sphere of
 influence.
 Because of governmental instability and efforts to restructure
 the country's traditional society, an estimated 25 percent of
 the population has fled since independence was achieved in
 1967, mostly to the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen).
 Approximately 40 percent of the population is engaged in
 agriculture, which produces about 12 percent of the gross
 national product. The economy continues to stagnate, with
 production low and employment scarce. Shortages have
 increased markedly since 1984. More than 150,000 men work
 outside the country, providing critically needed remittances.
 South Yemen is a Communist police state tightly controlled by
 a ruthless police and security apparatus, and human rights are
 subordinate to the political and economic interests of the
 ruling party and the Government.
 While South Yemen is a closed society in which it is difficult
 to gauge the extent of human rights abuses, reports from South
 Yemen in 1985 confirm that the suppression of human rights
 continues as a matter of state practice. The State Security
 Organization (SSO) and other intelligence and law enforcement
 organizations maintain tight control and surveillance over the
 inhabitants. Freedom of association is highly circumscribed,
 and confiscation of property continues as a method of
 controlling emigration. For the immediate future, there
 appears to be little to suggest any fundamental change in the
 human rights situation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Although there have been many political killings since 1967,
 there were no known cases in 1985.
 *The United States maintains no diplomatic mission in the
 People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, which severed
 diplomatic relations with the United States in 1969. It is
 difficult therefore to comment authoritatively on conditions
 in that country. This report does not take into account the
 developments ensuing upon the coup attempt in January 1986
 which may have left many dead and the country in turmoil.

 b. Disappearance
 Reports continued to be received in 1985 of the disappearance
 of regime opponents, and the whereabouts of others reported
 missing under mysterious circumstances remains unknown.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were continuing reports of torture by the SSO and other
 security organizations in 1985, despite the Constitution's
 prohibition of such actions. Prison conditions are far below
 acceptable medical and sanitary standards, and solitary
 confinement for. political dissidents is reportedly
 commonplace. Treatment of prisoners is reportedly harsh and
 often degrading.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Unconfirmed reports by refugees indicate that political
 dissidents continued to be arrested in 1985. Several South
 Yemeni political figures out of favor with the regime are
 under house arrest. The Government withholds information
 concerning the detention of political prisoners, and no recent
 estimates of numbers are available. State security
 considerations take precedence over the right to bail and due
 process. The evidence suggests that incommunicado detention
 has been practiced in the past. There are no reports of
 forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 From the limited information available, the judicial process
 appears subject to extensive political manipulation. Trials
 involving security considerations are closed, although a
 Ba'athist spy trial was televised in 1985.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Provisions of law intended to protect personal privacy and the
 home are legally subordinate to the interests of national
 security. The law requires that antiregime and antiparty
 statements be reported. There is also a complex system of
 informants, telephones are routinely monitored, mail is
 examined, and persons are searched arbitrarily.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is sharply limited both by laws aimed at
 protecting the regime and by the existence of an extensive
 informant system. Although guaranteed by law, freedom of the
 press does not exist in fact as the media are
 state-controlled. Only a few foreign publications are
 available.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 No public or professional associations except those sponsored
 by the Government or the party operate openly, and reports
 indicate that except for traditional religious and tribal
 functions, nonsanctioned public gatherings and associations
 
 
 1425
 PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
 are not allowed. The Yemeni Socialist Party does, however,
 sponsor community meetings, which are generally held for
 political indoctrination. Association with foreigners is
 strictly controlled. The Government has made a concerted
 effort to suppress traditional tribal identification.
 There are no independent trade organizations or labor unions,
 and government-sponsored labor unions are under close party
 control. Collective bargaining is forbidden. The State
 represents the rights of its employees. Measures such as the
 curtailment of overtime have aggravated the relationship
 between workers and the State. There is no nongovernment
 mechanism for addressing such grievances.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution declares Islam to be the state religion but
 guarantees freedom of religious expression. In practice, the
 Government has attempted to minimize the influence of
 religious leaders, a large number of whom were arrested during
 the late 1960's and early 1970's. Sermons for Friday prayer
 in Aden are reportedly provided by the Ministry of Awqaf
 (i.e., religious trusts) Affairs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government controls foreign travel, and citizens are
 required to pay a deposit to insure their return. Property is
 confiscated in case of failure to do so. Restrictions on
 travel to North Yemen, however, seem to have eased during
 recent years as a result of improved relations between the two
 countries. Citizens are free to travel within their province
 of residence without restriction and also need no special
 documentation for travel to other provinces, except for some
 restricted security areas.
 The Government has tried in the past several years to
 encourage South Yemeni exiles to return. Many exiles are
 skeptical of the Government's motives and fear for their
 safety if they were to return.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Political power is concentrated within the highest level of
 the Yemeni Socialist Party. Personal and factional
 allegiances play a major role in decisionmaking by the party
 leadership. The Constitution guarantees the right to vote to
 males and females over the age of 18, and elections are held
 regularly. However, only party-approved candidates may
 contest elections at any level, and no other parties or
 political action groups are permitted.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In its 1985 Report, Amnesty International noted that it was
 continuing to seek the release of 20 prisoners of conscience
 and to investigate the cases of 9 possible prisoners of
 conscience, all of whom were arrested between 1967 and 1977,
 and that, as in the past, no response was received from South
 
 
 1426
 PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
 Yemeni authorities to Amnesty International's inquiries.
 Freedom House rated South Yemen as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 South Yemen has a population of 2.2 million which is growing
 at an annual rate of 2.9 percent. Per capita gross national
 product was estimated at $520 in 1983. One-fourth of the
 population lives in the vicinity of Aden; about 150,000 are
 nomadic Bedouin, and the rest are scattered in the rural areas.
 Although the number of hospitals has dramatically increased
 since independence and health care is provided without charge,
 services are reported to be substandard and declining in
 quality. Life expectancy in 1985 was 47 years, and the infant
 mortality rate was 131 per 1,000 live births. As of 1980 only
 46 percent of the population had access to safe water (85
 percent in urban areas and 25 percent in rural areas). Since
 the 1982 floods, there has been a housing shortage.
 The- Government has made a major effort to increase the
 literacy rate. In 1981, the primary school enrollment ratio
 was 82 percent of primary school age children. Illiterate
 adults are required to attend literacy classes.
 Child labor is more prevalent in the rural areas than in urban
 centers, where children must compete with adults for scarce
 employment. Child labor in rural areas is often the result of
 traditional parent-child job training and apprenticeship
 rather than exploitation. Working conditions, once among the
 best in the area, have deteriorated markedly since the regime
 came to power, although the closed nature of the state has
 made it difficult to fully document these conditions.
 Equality of the sexes is guaranteed by law, and women
 frequently hold government and service jobs. Polygamy, child
 marriages, and arranged marriages are forbidden.
 There is little information available on the position of
 minorities, although some reports suggest that the Somali
 minority has been severely restricted in its activities, with
 many of its leading members intimidated.

 APPENDIX A
 Notes on Preparation of the Reports
 The annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices are based
 upon all information available to the United States
 Government. Sources include American officials, officials of
 foreign governments, private citizens, victims of human rights
 abuse, congressional studies, intelligence information, press
 reports, international organizations, and nongovernmental
 organizations concerned with human rights, We are particularly
 appreciative of, and make reference in most reports to, the
 role of nongovernmental human rights organizations, ranging
 from groups in a single country to major organizations that
 concern themselves with human rights matters in larger
 geographic regions or over the entire world. Much of the
 information we use is already public. For obvious reasons,
 much of our information cannot be attributed to specific
 sources.
 The reports must be submitted to Congress by January 31. To
 comply, United States diplomatic missions are given guidance in
 September for submission of draft reports during October and
 November; contributions are received from appropriate offices
 in the Department of State; and a final draft is prepared under
 the~cordination of the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian
 Affairs. Because of the preparation time required, it is
 possible that developments in the latter part of the year under
 review may not be fully reflected; moreover, reports from some
 of the nongovernmental organizations are for periods ending
 well before the end of the year. We make every effort to
 inblude reference to major events or significant changes in
 trends.
 We have attempted to make these country reports as
 comprehensive as space will allow, while taking care to make
 them objective and as uniform as possible in both scope and
 quality of coverage. We have given particular attention to
 attaining a high standard of consistency despite the
 multiplicity of sources and the obvious problems related to
 varying degrees of access to information, structural
 differences in political and social systems, and trends in
 world opinion regarding human rights practices in specific
 countries. There is a conceptual difficulty in applying a
 single standard of evaluation to societies with differing
 cultural and legal traditions. There is also a problem of
 perspective in discussing countries that face differing
 political realities, which must be taken into account in
 describing the human rights environment. Rather than viewing a
 country in isolation, these reports take as their point of
 departure the world as it is and then apply a consistent
 approach in assessing each country's human rights situation.
 While we have tried to make each report self-contained by
 including enough background information to place the human
 rights situation in context, readers who need to delve more
 deeply may wish to consult other sources, including previous
 country reports.
 To improve the uniformity of the reports, the introductory
 section of each report has been reorganized to provide a brief
 setting, indicating how the country is governed and providing
 the context for examining the country's human rights
 performance. A description of the political framework and a
 discussion of the security and law enforcement situation are
 followed by an economic background statement. The setting
 concludes with an overview of human rights developments in 1985.
 
 
 1428
 The format for the reports follows that of last year. "Respect
 for Human Rights" is covered in sections on respect for
 integrity of the person, respect for civil rights, and respect
 for political rights, followed by a section on governmental
 attitudes toward investigations of alleged human rights
 violations. The "Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation,"
 although not readily divisible into separate sections, is
 organized this year to present, in turn, a brief description of
 the economy, a summary of health care and education, a survey
 of working conditions, and a discussion of the status of women,
 followed, where applicable, by comments on the treatment of
 ethnic or national minorities.
 The following notes on specific categories of the report are
 not meant to be comprehensive descriptions of each category but
 to provide definitions of key terms as used in the reports and
 to explain the organization of material within the format:
 Political Killing--Includes killings in which there is evidence
 of government instigation without due process of law, or of
 political motivation by government or by opposition groups;
 also covers acts of violence, if pertinent to describe a
 situation where killing may occur; excludes combat deaths and
 killings by common criminals, if the likelihood of political
 motivation can be ruled out.
 Disappearance--Covers unresolved cases in which political
 victims have not been found or perpetrators have not been
 identified; cases eventually classed as identified political.
 killings are covered in the above category, those eventually
 identified as-arrest or detention are covered under "arbitrary
 arrest, detention, or exile."
 Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment--Includes "any act by which severe pain or
 suffering, physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted by or
 at the instigation of a public official on a person to obtain
 information or a confession, to punish him for actual or
 suspected commission of an act, or to intimidate him or others"
 (UNGA Resolution 3452 of 1975); discussion concentrates on
 actual practices and treatment, not on whether they fit the
 precise definition of torture.
 Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile--Covers cases in which
 detainees, including political detainees, are held in official
 custody without charges or, if charged, are denied a public
 preliminary judicial hearing within a reasonable period
 (persons charged after a hearing but held without bail would be
 discussed in the category that follows); covers forced or
 compulsory labor (see Appendix B) as a means of education,
 political coercion, or racial or social discrimination. (N.B.,
 if no mention is made of forced or compulsory labor, it may be
 assumed that the practice does not exist.)
 Denial of Fair Public Trial--Discusses not whether a trial has
 been denied but whether a trial held was both fair and public;
 failure to hold any trial is noted in the category above;
 includes discussion of "political prisoners" (political
 detainees are covered above), defined as those imprisoned for
 essentially political beliefs or acts, regardless of the actual
 charge, but not including those who have gone beyond advocacy
 and dissent to commit acts of violence.
 Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence--Discusses "passive" right of the individual to
 noninterference by the state; includes right to receive foreign
 
 
 1429
 publications, for example, while right to publish is discussed
 under the category that follows; does not include cultural or
 traditional practices, such as discrimination against women
 within marriage, which are addressed in the last part of the
 report.
 Freedom of Speech and Press--Includes academic freedom.
 Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association--Includes right of
 labor to organize and bargain collectively (see Appendix B).
 Freedom of Religion--Includes freedom to publish religious
 documents in foreign languages; addresses treatment of foreign
 clergy; addresses whether religious belief affects membership
 in a ruling party or a career in government.
 Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation--Includes discussion of forced
 resettlements; generally, "refugees" refers to those with
 'well-founded fear of persecution" in their country of origin
 or, if stateless, of habitual residence, on account of race,
 religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group,
 or political opinion.
 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change
 Their Government--Discusses extent to which citizens can freely
 choose, and change, the laws and officials that govern them;
 assesses whether elections are meaningful.
 Government Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental
 Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights--Includes
 discussion of domestic and foreign human rights organizations
 operating in the country; mention is made of a government's
 position on international human rights questions only if there
 is a particular point to be made.
 Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation--Selected economic and
 social indicators are designed to serve as reference points but
 not absolute standards in discussing the extent to which human
 needs are met. The quality of data is highly variable; for the
 sake of uniformity, World Bank figures have been used in most
 cases. The indicators chosen are those that are both most
 nearly representative and universal, although their usefulness
 declines in discussing fully developed countries (N.B., the
 indicator "Total school enrollment as a percentage of
 population in age group" frequently exceeds 100 percent because
 in countries with universal education many children below or
 above the official primary school age will be enrolled as well
 as all of the children within the age group). In addition to
 these indicators, the 1985 reports address conditions related
 to worker rights, including minimum age for the employment of
 children and acceptable conditions of work (see Appendix B).
