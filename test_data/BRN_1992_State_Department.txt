BRUJNEI
 Brunei Darussalam is a small, wealthy monarchy located on the north coast of
 Borneo. The population of roughly 270,000 is predominantly Malay, with Chinese
 and other minorities. Brunei is a hereditary sultanate ruledby the same family for
 600 years. It became a British protectorate in 1888 and fully independent in 1984.
 The 1959 Constitution providd for the first delegation of political power by the
 Sultan. In 1962 the Sultan invoked an article of the Constitution that allowed him
 to assume emergency powers for 2 years. These have been regularly renewed and
 remain in force. Although not all of the articles of the Constitution are suspended,
 the state of emergency places few limits on the Sultan's power. He also serves as
 Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, Dean of the National University, and chief reli-
 gious leader.
 The police force, which has responsibility for internal security, reports to the
 Prime Minister's oaice and is firmly under the control of civil authorities.
 Brunei produces an average of 163,000 barrels of oil per day and about 5.5 million
 tons of liquefied natural gas per year. This bountiful natural resoure endowment,
 in combination with Brunei's small population gives it one of the world's highest per
 capita gross national products.
 Brunci   generally tend not to engage in activities to exercise the freedoms of
 speech, press, and association contained in the Constitution. The right of citizens
 to change their government does not exist. Other areas of human rights abuse in-
 elude censorship, mandatory flogging of prisoners for a host of offenses, discrinina-
 tion against women, and repression of religious freedom. In 1992 the Government
 continued its efforts to strengthen observance of traditional Bruneian and Muslim
 values by continuing to promote a national ideology known as Melaya Islam Beraja
 or "Malay Muslim Monarchy." The resulting increased Islamisation of Bruneian so-
 ciety p laced significant onstraints on the religious freedom of non-Muslims pro-
 vided for in the 1959 Constitution.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicil Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings.
 B. Dizappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.  or    onstnof
 c. Tort  pur and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or  egrading Treatment      nse
 In 1988 whipping with a cane became mandatory punishment for 42 criminal and
 drug-related crimes and for vandalism. Since then, sentences of whipping have been
 han.ed down and carried out in the presence of a doctor who monitors implementa-
 tion with the authority to interrupt and postpone the punishment for medical rea-
 sons. The incidence of crime in B nei is low, and the actual carrying out of a
 caning sentence is infrequent.

 Hong Kong provides judges for Brunei's High Court and Court of Appeal under
 a Treaty of Friendship between Brunei and the United Kingdom. While there were
 reports in the past of some of these judges refusing to serve in Brunei due to man-
 datory caning, in 1992 there were no reports of reluctance to serve.
 dArbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exil.-The Constitution has no provision for ha.
 beas corpus. While legislative provisions granting the right of habeas corpus exist,
 those provisions, like the Constitution itself, can be superseded, either partially or
 wholly, through invocation of the emergency powers, which remain in effect, al-
 though such action has not occurred. Police officers have broad powers to arrest peo-
 ple without warrants. However, under normal cirumtances, a magistrate must en-
 dorse a warrant for arrest. On rare occasions, warrants are issued without this en-
 dorsement. The Internal Security Act (ISA) permits the Government to detain sus-
 pets without trial for renewable 2-year periods. The Government has occasionally
 used the ISA to detain persons suspected of antigovernment activity. The last re-
 maining ISA detainees were release in 1990.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Bruneian judicial system consists of five lev-
 els of courts: magistrate, intermediate high, and appellate, with final recourse
 available through the Privy Council in ondon. Although there is no trial by jury,
 -procedural safeguards, including the right to defense counsel, the right to an inter-
 reter, the right to a speedy trial and the right to confront accusers, are available.
 ecause Brunei has no senior juiciary of its own, the Chief Justice of the Brunei
 High Court is seconded from elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Nations. Other
 British judges are seconded as required. There were no known instances of govern-
 ment interference with the judiciary in 1992 and no trials of political opponents.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though the Government is empowered by law to intrude into the privacy of individ-
 ual persons, families, or homes, there are no reports that it has done so, except in
 an occasional drug case.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are
 not restricted by law, but the Government frequently censors international news-
 papers and periodicals by removing or blacking out articles or photographs found
 to be objectionable. Articles which are only mildly critical of the Sultan or the Gov-
 ernment or which have non-Islamic religious content have been censored. The inde-
 ndently owned local newspaper practices self-censorship by avoiding issues it
 nows the Government would object to. The only television station is government
 owned. (The broadcasts of two Malaysian television stations can also be received.)
 Because of the almost total absence of criticism or opposing views, the Government's
 tolerance of political criticism has not been effectively tested recently. In the past
 it has not hesitated to arrest those who attempted to espouse unwelcome political
 views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom to assemble for politi-
 cal purposes also has not been seriously tested in recent years. Following the 1967
 ban on political parties, the Government allowed two parties to be formed in 1985
 and 1986. The Government severely restricted membership in both parties, disband-
 ing one of them in 1988. The other political party, the Brunei National Solidarity
 Psrty, lingers on with a few dozen members.
 c. Freedom   of Religion.-The Constitution states   "he religion of Brunei
 Darussalam shal be the Muslim religion according to tie Shafeite sect of that reli-
 gion: provided that all other religions may be practised in peace and harmony by
 e person professing them in any part of BruniDarrussalam"
 In 1991 the Government began to reinforce the legitimacy of the hereditary mon-
 archy and the observance of traditional Bruneian and Muslim values by reasserting
 a national ideology known as the Malaya Islam Beraja or hMalay Muslim Monar-
 chy," the genesis of which reportedly dates back to the 15th century. The resulting
 Islamization of Broneian society has severely restricted the constitutional rights of
 non-Muslims to worship freely. In spite of a constitutional guarantee to the con-
 trary, the Government routinely restricts the practice of non-Muslim religions by
 prohibiting proselytization, not allowing the entry of foreign clergy, and refusing
 permission to build churches, temples, and shrines. The Government also uses oth-
 erwise unenforced zoning laws to close existing temples and shrines, including some
 located in private homes.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-While the movement of former political prisoners was restricted during
 the first year of their release, there are no restrictions on freedom of movement in
 the country for most citizens, permanent residents, and expatriates. The Govern-
 ment places some contractual restrictions on foreign travel for certain of its expatri-
 
 
 521
 ate employees, but this is limited to the first year of the contract. Private travel to
 Communist nations is restricte for all Brneians. While Brunei has not been will-
 ing to accept asylum meekers, it has agreed in principle, and sub to certain res-
 ervations, to the Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA) adopted by the 1989 Inter-
 national Conference on Indochinese Refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Right&- The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Brunian citizens are unable to change their government through established
 democratic processes. Under the continuing state of emergency, there are no elected,
 representative bodies at the national or local level. Citizens may seek to influence
 the Government by working through appointed village headmen and district officers,
 who meet regulariy with their constituents. They may also attempt to effect change
 by titioning the Sultan directly; however, access to the Sultan is tightly con-
 trolled.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no government or private organizations in Brunei that deal specifically
 with the protection of human rights. Given the tight restrictions on freedom of
 speech and press and the Government's unwillingness to tolerate criticism, any
 group or individual attempting to investigate and report publicly on human rights
 issues would face severe constraints. There were no known allegations of abuses or
 requests to visit by international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Based on Koranic precepts, women in Brunei are denied equal status with men
 in a number of important areas such as divorce, inheritance, and custody of chil-
 dren. Men are eligible for permanent positions in government service whether or not
 they hold university degrees; women are eligible to hold government positions only
 on a month-to-month basis unless they are university graduates. Women in month-
 to-month positions do not qualify for government pensions, receive fewer allowances,
 and get less annual leave than their male counterparts in permanent positions.
 While there are no separate pay scales for women and men, women in the work
 force traditionally have been less likely to find positions offering rapid advancement.
 In recent years, however, employment opportunities for women have improved
 significantly, in part due to a chronic shortage of white-collar and skilled labor. A
 growing number of women hold senior-level professional positions, and the number
 of female university graduates is also increasing. Religious authorities strongly en-
 courage Brunei Muslim women to wear the tudong, a traditional head covering, and
 a growing number do so. There is no pressure on non-Muslim women to wear the
 tudong, and few if any, choose to wear it. The Court of Appeals in 1992 found a
 high-ranking po'ice inspector civilly liable for improperly detaining a Chinese
 woman for failure to appear on a court summons. The incidence of domestic violence
 against women is extremely low. Rape cases are similarly rare. Because of the close-
 knit nature of Bruneian society  such behavior would be difficult if not imposible
 to conceal and would not be tolerated. The criminal penalty for a minor domestic
 assault is 1 to 2 weeks in jail and a r'me. An assault resulting in serious injury,
 such as broken bones would be punished by whipping and a longer jail sentence.
 Few of the substantial Chinese minority, constituting 18 percent of the popu-
 lation, are citizens. Those having no claims to other nationalities were "British-pro-
 tected persons" prior to independence, and are now stateless and either permanent
 or temporary residents. Noncitizens may not own land but may hold property
 through long-term leases.
 The process of obtaining citizenship in Brunei is long and difficult. Many aspi-
 rants complain that the Malay language test required for citizenship is adminis.
 tered so rigorously that it is virtually impossible for a nonnative speaker to pass.
 In general, however, the Chinese community which conducts much of the coun-
 try's commercial activity, has prospered in Brunei. While the Chinese have done
 well economically, many are now reevaluating their position in Brunei, especially
 the prospects of their children in a society in which ethnic Malay citizens are fa-
 vored in such areas as government employment and access to the National Univer-
 sity. Some Chinese are emigrating.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unions are legal in Brunei but must be reg-
 istered with the Government. Signatures of seven members are required for re-
 istration. There are four registered trade unions, all of them in the oil sector, with
 a total membership amounting to less than 5 percent of the work force. All workers,
 
 
 including civil servants other than those serving in the military and police may
 form or join trade unions. Unions are independent of the Government. The   'rade
 Unions Act of 1962 permits the formation of trade union federations in Brunei but
 forbids affiliation of-Brunei trade unions with labor organizations outside Brunei.
 An individual contract is required between an employer and each employee but
 legal trade union activities cannot be deemed to violate employee contracts. Local
 legal experts interpret this provision as conferring the right to strike, but there have
 been none.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivey.-The Government has not pre-
 vented the legal registration of trade unions, nor has it dissolved any. There is no
 government interference with lawful union activity. It is illegal to refuse employ-
 ment or discriminate against an employee on the basis of membership or
 nonmembership in a trade union.
 While unions are legal and easy to register, conditions in Brunei are not condu-
 cive to the development of trade unions; there is little interest on thepart of work-
 ers in forming trade unions; and existing unions are not very active. Brunei law is
 silent on collective bargaining, which occurs in only a few industries. Wage and ben-
 efit packages tend to exceed those of neighboring nations; there is a lack of those
 kinds of industries in which unions have traditionally developed; and there is a long
 cultural tradition favoring consensus over confrontation. Wage and benefit packages
 are based on market conditions.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by
 Chapter 93 of the Laws of Brunei and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Employment of children below the
 age of 16 is prohibited and below the age of 18 requires parental consent and ap-
 proval by the Labor Commission. Women under 18 may not work at night or on off-
 shore oil platforms. The Labor Department, which is a part of the Ministry of Home
 Affairs, effectively enforces laws on the employment of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Skilled labor is in short supply, and market
 forces enable most citizens of Brnei to command good salaries. Brunei has a gov-
 ernment-established minimum wage which is more than adequate to provide a
 worker and his family with a decent standard of living. Overtime is paid for work
 in excess of 48 hours, and double time is paid for work performed on legal holidays.
 Occupational health and safety standards are established by government regulation.
 Working conditions are subject to inspection on a routine basis and in response to
 complaints by Department of Labor (DOL) officials workin under the supervision
 of the Commissioner of Labor (who heads the DO. The DOL generally enforces
 labor regulations effectively; however, at the lower range of the labor sector, enforce-
 ment is lax, especially for foreign laborers. The DOL is empowered to close any
 workplace where health, safety, or working conditions are unsatisfactory.
