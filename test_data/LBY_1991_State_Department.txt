 LIBYA
 The Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is a
 dictatorship ruled by Colonel'Mu'ammar Al-Qadhafi, aided by
 extragovernmental Revolutionary Committees operating at his
 behest. The governing principles of the society are expressed.
 in Col. Qadhafi's "Green Book" rather than in a constitution.
 He has created a political system borrowing from pan-Islamic
 and pan-Arab sources and purporting to establish a "third way"
 superior to both capitalism and communism. In the past,'he has
 used assassination as one way to control his enemies abroad; at
 home, he uses a variety of summary and judicial proceedings to
 suppress all popular resistance. Ethnic minorities, such as
 Berbers, are tightly controlled.
 Libya maintains an extensive security apparatus consisting of
 several elite military units, including Col. Qadhafi's personal
 bodyguards. The local Revolutionary Committees and People's
 Committees also have security functions, designed to monitor as
 well as protect the populace. The result is multilayered,
 pervasive surveillance and control of individual activities.
 Despite continued efforts at privatization, the Libyan economy
 remains essentially state controlled. It is based almost
 exclusively on the country's rich oil resources, which are
 Libya's principal source of foreign exchange earnings. Libya
 has used its oil income to finance internal development (new
 schools, hospitals,.roads), but much has been wasted. Despite
 cutbacks in other areas, construction of a $28-billion water
 project, widely viewed as economically unsound, continued
 unhindered. The Government also continues to spend vast sums
 on military and weapons procurement. Foreign exchange controls
 remained tight in 1991. Although Libya's economy temporarily
 benefited from increased oil production and higher crude prices
 caused by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, all other sectors
 continued to stagnate.
 Human rights remained tightly restricted. Legal freedoms and
 rights are generally lacking. As a practical matter, there are
 no effective rights to peaceful association or assembly, to
 freedom of speech, to expression of views opposing those of the
 Government in any form, to formation of trade unions, or to
 strike. The same is true of personal rights such as the right
 to be considered innocent until proven guilty, to a public or
 speedy trial, to legal counsel, to be secure in one's home or
 person, or even to hold property. While some of these rights
 are guaranteed in principle by the Libyan Government, they do
 not exist in practice. Although Col. Qadhafi announced his
 support in 1988 for policies and reforms aimed at remedying
 past abuses of human rights, there has been little evidence of
 any significant change.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Reports by opposition groups that political killings took place
 in 1991 could not be verified.
 *Because the U.S. has no Embassy in Libya and because the
 regime strictly limits access to information, it is difficult
 to comment authoritatively on conditions in Libya.

 LIBYA
 A large number of offenses, including political offenses, are
 punishable by death under Libyan law. For example, Law No. 71
 of 1972 provides for the death penalty for anyone involved with
 any group activity based on any-ideology opposed to the
 principles of the revolution (see also Section l.e.).
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1991.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Libya is a State party to the United Nations Convention against
 Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment. Nevertheless, prisoners in Libya are reportedly
 tortured during interrogations or for discipline. There were
 unconfirmed reports in 1991 that som4 of the thousands of black
 African workers, whom the regime suddenly began expelling from
 Libya in the spring, were detained for months in camps under
 very difficult conditions before their expulsion and that they
 were tortured, causing at least one death, while under
 detention (see also Section 6.e.). Many prisoners are held
 incommunicado, which makes confirmation of torture difficult.
 Means of torture reportedly include: chaining to a wall for
 hours, clubbing, electric shock, corkscrews in the back, lemon
 juice in open wounds, breaking fingers and allowing the joints
 to heal without medical care, suffocation using plastic bags,
 deprivation of food and water, and beatings on the soles of the
 feet.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Libyan law, detainees may be held incommunicado for
 unlimited periods. Many political prisoners are held in
 unofficial detention centers controlled by members of the
 Revolutionary Committees, where prolonged periods of
 incommunicado detention are common. Many allegedly are held
 without charge or trial, apparently as an example to other
 would-be opponents of the regime. There are reliable reports
 that between 400 and 500 political detainees continued to be
 held at the end of the year. While undergoing interrogation,
 sometimes for periods of several months, prisoners are given no
 access to legal representation. Although Col. Qadhafi has
 claimed to be opposed to secret arrests, there is still no
 evidence he has issued explicit orders to stop that practice.
 Foreigners have also been subject to arbitrary arrest and
 torture. There are credible reports that some foreign workers
 in Libya have been forced into military training and military
 service on behalf of Libya or coerced into subversive
 activities against their own countries.
 Exile is not a form of punishment practiced in Libya; to the
 contrary, Col. Qadhafi seeks to pressure Libyans working or
 studying abroad to return to Libya. Libya does, however, expel
 noncitizens arbitrarily (see Section 6.e.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most civilians are tried in regular courts, but their cases may
 be referred to less formal "people's courts," or to military or
 revolutionary courts, depending on the arbitrary decision of
 the security forces. Security forces have the power to judge
 persons guilty without trial, particularly "traitors to the
 people." Some trials are held in private or in the absence of
 
 
 1497
 LIBYA
 the accused. Appeals of regular court decisions are allowed.
 A 1981 law prohibits the private practice of law and makes all
 attorneys employees of the Secretariat of Justice. Libya
 claims that it "guarantees prisoners all necessary means of
 defense and safeguards of justice adequate to the principles
 contained in the (Universal) Declaration of Human Rights" and
 provides for legal assistance "as soon as possible with respect
 to the exigencies of interrogation." Nevertheless, there
 continue to be numerous reports that these rights are
 frequently denied.
 Alleged political'offenses in the past often have been tried
 before ad hoc revolutionary courts rather than by civilian
 courts, with the opportunities to engage defense counsel
 severely restricted. A number of these trials have been held
 in secret. Despite the regime's 1988 announcement abolishing
 these "extraordinary" courts, they are still in operation and
 have been publicly discussed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not respect the right to privacy. The
 legal requirement that judicial warrants must be obtained
 before entering a private home is often disregarded. Local and
 international telephone calls are routinely monitored. The
 informer network is extensive, encouraged by both security
 agencies and Revolutionary Committees. Libyan exiles report
 that mere family ties to suspected regime opponents can result
 in harassment or even persecution and detention by the
 authorities. Property may be seized and burned if it belongs
 to "enemies of the people" or those who "cooperate" with
 foreign powers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Some difference of opinion is tolerated in People's Committee
 meetings and at the General People's Congress, but in general
 freedom of speech is severely limited. This is especially true
 with regard to any criticism of Col. Qadhafi or his regime.
 Political speech is repressed through legislation banning all
 polftical activities not sanctioned by the Government,
 including the nonviolent expression of conscientiously held
 beliefs. This legislation, making the dissemination of
 "hostile information" a crime, is so all-encompassing that
 almost any form of expression can be illegal. Fear of being
 informed upon by elements of the Revolutionary Committees and
 an underlying climate of mistrust at all levels of society
 further inhibit freedom of speech.
 Libyan media are owned and controlled by the State. There is a
 state-run daily newspaper, with a circulation of 40,000.
 Several smaller newspapers are run by the Revolutionary
 Committees and the Islamic Call Society. JANA, the official
 news agency, is the designated conduit for politically
 acceptable opinions. Publishing opinions contrary to
 government policy is not permitted. Newsweek, Time, the Herald
 Tribune, and Express Jeune Afrique are available, but
 censorship is applied at times. There are strict import
 controls of foreign publications at the Tripoli airport. In
 1991 Col. Qadhafi declared that the ban on Egyptian papers
 should be lifted, but it is unknown to what extent this has
 been done. Foreign'broadcasts can be received.

 LIBYA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public assembly is repressed unless it is government controlled
 and supportive of regime positiohs. The right of association
 is limited and granted only to institutions affiliated with the
 regime. According to Law No. 71 of 1972, party activities
 which are said to "constitute treason" are punishable by
 death. The law defines such party activity as "any grouping,
 organization, or formation, of whatever kind or number, which
 is based on a political concept opposed in its aims to the
 principles of the... Revolution." Organizations such as
 independent trade unions and professional associations are
 viewed as unnecessary, since Col. Qadhafi has vowed not to
 "accept intermediaries between the revolution and its working
 forces."
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim. In an apparent effort to
 eliminate any alternative power bases, the regime has banned
 the once powerful Sanusiyya Islamic religious sect.
 Members of some minority religions (e.g., Christianity) are
 allowed to conduct services, but Islamic groups at variance
 with the state-sanctioned version are banned. Services in
 Christian churches are attended by the foreign community.
 There is a resident Catholic bishop operating two churches and
 a small number of priests. Nuns reportedly are permitted to
 wear religious habits.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 With the exception of security areas, movement is not usually
 restricted for Libyan citizens. Traditionally, exit permits
 have been required for travel abroad, and currency controls
 also serve to restrict travel. Women need their husband's
 permission for them and their children to travel abroad.
 Border checks on the frontier with Tunisia remain relatively
 relaxed. In August Egypt and Libya agreed to open their mutual
 border to allow for the unrestricted flow of each other's
 nationals between the two countries. Thousands of Libyans
 reportedly go back and forth regularly. The Revolutionary
 Committees maintain surveillance of some Libyans while abroad.
 The right of return of Libyan nationals is theoretically
 protected even for opponents of Col. Qadhafi, so long as they
 are prepared "to repent." However, this "right" often appears
 to be more nearly an obligation; the regime often calls for
 students, many of whom are under government subsidy, and others
 working abroad to return on little or no notice and without
 regard to the impact on their studies or work. Libyans who
 study abroad are interrogated on their return home. A number
 of those called on to return refuse to do so.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The people of Libya have no right to change their government.
 Major government decisions are controlled by Col. Qadhafi
 himself, a few key figures around him, or by committees acting
 in his name. He appoints military officers and official
 functionaries down to junior levels. Power flows through a
 small circle of trusted associates. Corruption and tribalism
 in the administration are major problems, adversely affecting
 the efficiency of government.
 
 
 1499
 LIBYA
 Political parties and tribal or local groupings are prohibited.
 Participation in elections is mandatory, and all candidates are
 approved by the Revolutionary Committees from among persons who
 are not "merchants, contractors, tribal advocates, election
 .brokers, officials of the former (pre-1969) government, or
 people who have been attacked by the power of the revolution."
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No independent human rights organizations are permitted to
 function in Libya. The Libyan Arab Human Rights Committee, a
 government organization, was created in May 1989, reportedly to
 implement the reforms announced in 1988. However, there are no
 reports of any activities by the Committee.
 Libyan officials last met with Amnesty International (AI)
 representatives .during a June 1988 visit. Since then, the
 Government has refused to reply substantively to AI's repeated
 appeals on behalf of the 467 reported political detainees.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There are frequent allegations of discrimination based on
 tribal status, with particular discrimination alleged against
 Berbers in the interior and Tuaregs in the south. Col. Qadhafi
 has often complained about the continued power of tribal and
 other groups, but he also utilizes them for political action
 when he sponsors proregime demonstrations. In past years, he
 sought unsuccessfully to assure that Berbers married only
 non-Berbers, presumably in an effort to erode their tribal
 identity.
 In 1991 Col. Qadhaf! began expelling thousands of black African
 workers from-Libya under circumstances that appeared
 discriminatory (see Section 6.e.).
 The conservative cultural attitudes of Libya's Islamic society
 serve to restrict the rights of certain groups, most notably
 women. Col. Qadhafi has led efforts to change the status of
 women and expand their access to educational and employment
 opportunities. Women currently receive basic military training
 and are subject to the military draft, with some exceptions.
 The husband's permission is necessary for women or children to
 travel abroad. Female circumcision is reportedly still
 practiced among tribal groups in remote areas of the south. No
 information is available on the extent 'to which violence
 against women is a problem in Libya.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers do not have the right to form or join unions of their
 own choosing. The official trade union organization, the
 General Federation of Producers' Trade Unions, which was
 created in 1972, is under government control and administered
 through the People's Committee system. Every Libyan worker
 must be a member of a trade union (expatriates are not required
 to.join). Although unions are assured the right to "safeguard
 their interests," there is no right to strike (Col. Qadhafi has
 declared strikes unnecessary since the workers own their places
 of employment), and no strikes by Libyan workers have been
 reported for years.
 
 
 1500
 LIBYA
 With government financing, the official trade union
 organization plays a leading role.in the International
 Confederation of Arab Trade Unions, the Arab Maghreb Trade
 Union Federation (USTMA), and the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and exploits international trade union contacts to
 engage in propaganda efforts on behalf of the Government.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Although the Libyan Labor Code provides for'collective
 agreements, there is no collective bargaining in Libya.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of
 Experts in 1990 repeated its earlier observation that "persons
 expressing certain political views or views ideologically
 opposed to the established political, social or economic system
 may be punished with penalties of imprisonment...involving... an
 obligation to perform labor." It also noted that public
 employees in Libya may be imprisoned and sentenced to
 compulsory labor "...as a punishment for breaches of labour
 discipline or for participation in strikes even in services
 whose interruption would not endanger the life, personal
 safety, or health of the whole or part of the population." The
 Government later told the ILO that there have been changes in
 legislation which abolish these provisions, but no
 corroborating report has been submitted to the ILO.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment of children is 18. Education is
 compulsory to age 15.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Libya maintains a work force of around 1,120,000 workers (plus
 an additional 1.5 million expatriate workers) in a population
 of 4.3 million. There is a legally mandated minimum wage which
 affords a worker and his family a decent standard of living.
 The legal maximum workweek is 48 hours. Libyan labor law
 defines the rights and duties of workers and such aspects as
 compensation, pension rights, minimum rest periods, and length
 of the workday. There is reportedly some government effort to
 inspect workplaces for health and safety. Certain industries,
 such as the petroleum sector, try to maintain standards
 originally set by foreign companies.
 Libyan labor law does not apply to the approximately 1.5
 million foreign workers in Libya, who do much of the
 blue-collar and technical work. Their permission to stay in
 the country extends only for the duration of the contracts
 under which they are employed. Foreign workers are subject to
 arbitrary pressures, such as changes in work rules and
 contracts, with'little option but to accept or to depart the
 country, often without full compensation for work already
 performed. The conditions of their employment are subject to
 negotiation between the worker and the employer. Foreign
 workers who are not under contract enjoy no protection.
 In the spring, Col. Qadhafi suddenly began expelling thousands
 of black African workers, claiming they were in Libya
 illegally. Chadians, Nigerians, Nigeriens, Malians, and
 Ghanaians were unceremoniously rounded up at their homes or
 work sites, detained for varying amounts of time, and returned
 destitute to their countries, usually with no warning to their
 
 
 1501
 LIBYA
 governments. The press in several of these countries have
 carried unsubstantiated reports of arbitrary detention and
 mistreatment by Libyan authorities prior to expulsion.
