 ZAIRE
 President Mobutu Sese Seko, who seized power in 1965, heads
 both the Government (appointing the Prime Minister and his
 Cabinet) and the party, the Popular Movement of the Revolution,
 (appointing the members of its highest organ, the central
 committee) of Zaire. The President has the constitutional
 power to promulgate laws by decree. In theory, authority is
 shared with the popularly elected Legislative Council. In
 practice, the Parliament rarely disagrees with presidential
 decisions, although decrees are usually preceded by
 consultations with party leaders and legislators. The single
 party automatically includes all citizens as members. The
 Executive Council (Prime Minister and Council of Ministers),
 the Legislative Council (unicameral parliament), the judiciary,
 and the only labor union (National Union of Zairian Workers)
 are all organs of the party.
 A complex of security organizations, notably the civilian
 National Documentation Agency, the paramilitary gendarmerie and
 Civil Guard, and the armed forces (particularly the military
 intelligence action service and the Special Presidential
 Brigade) share responsibility for identifying and controlling
 potential internal and external threats to Zaire and the Mobutu
 Government. These organizations wield broad powers and
 influence, which allows arbitrary harassment and detention of
 ordinary citizens as well as suspected political opponents of
 the Government. Throughout 1985, continued instability
 affected the region along Lake Tanganyika in Eastern Zaire,
 from Uvira in Kivu region down to Moba, with rebel attacks
 against Kalemie and, once again in May, Moba itself, which had
 .been a rebel target in 1984.
 Zaire has a mixed economy. Though major mining and
 transportation activities are state-owned, private enterprise
 is the rule in the other sectors, with the State often holding
 a minority equity position in larger firms. Individuals are
 permitted to pursue business interests in almost all sectors of
 the economy and are allowed to own property. Zaire shares the
 economic problems of most sub-Saharan African countries,
 including low income levels and inadequate infrastructure and
 health care. More than 10 years of low base metal prices have
 had a severe effect in Zaire. After several unsuccessful
 attempts, Zaire launched a serious, extensive economic reform
 program in January 1983. That program achieved significant
 progress in stabilizing the economy and continued in force
 during 1985.
 The changes in the human rights situation in 1985 were mixed.
 The continuing instability in eastern Zaire led to a sharply
 deteriorating human rights situation there, with many civilian
 casualties caused by the fighting between government military
 forces and the rebels.   A number of members of a group
 advocating a second political party were rearrested and banned
 to the interior of the country in October and November.
 Harassment of citizens by law enforcement personnel and
 inordinate delays in processing of detainees remained serious
 problems. There were, however, concerted efforts by the
 Government to reconcile differences with political dissidents,
 notably former prime minister'Nguza Karl-I-Bond who returned to
 Zaire, as well as signs of greater government awareness of
 shortcomings in the judicial and penal systems. President
 Mobutu took over the Minister of Justice portfolio early in the
 year and named a commission to investigate prison and judicial
 performance which did effect at least short-term reforms in
 
 
 371
 ZAIRE
 some parts of the country. Less successful but still positive
 efforts were undertaken to end the corruption in prison
 administration which permits poor conditions, beatings, and in
 some cases prisoners to starve to death. Zaire continues to
 provide sanctuary to over 300,000 refugees and displaced
 persons from neighboring countries, primarily Angola.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The only substantiated reports of killing for political motives
 were in eastern Zaire where there was fighting between
 government forces and insurgents. There is credible evidence
 that both government forces and the insurgents carried out a
 number of summary executions early in the year, although it was
 not always possible to differentiate clearly between such
 killings and combat deaths.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been several reports of disappearance from detention
 facilities during the year, at least two of which appear to be
 credible. The situation was more serious in the insurgent area
 in eastern Zaire early in the year. There, people have
 disappeared and can be presumed to have been killed by
 government security forces. It is difficult to estimate the
 number of disappearances, as numerous individuals and entire
 villages have been affected by the fighting and have fled or
 relocated, making it virtually impossible to determine how many
 moved or died in the fighting and how many have disappeared
 under other circumstances. Although the situation appears to
 have improved significantly in late 1985 due primarily to
 better army leadership, there are reports that at least 100
 people have disappeared from the Kalemie-Moba area as a result
 of military reprisals.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Government claims not to condone torture and denies
 allegations that torture is administered by its officials
 during interrogation. However, Amnesty International maintains
 that torture and physical mistreatment of detainees is routine
 in most Zairian places of detention. There is little question
 that mistreatment of detainees, particularly beatings at time
 of arrest and during preliminary interrogation, is the rule
 rather than the exception. Criminal penalties do not include
 physical punishment or mutilation. In fact, however, abuses of
 all kinds are endemic in Zaire's jails and prisons, with
 reports of unsanitary and crowded facilities, malnutrition, and
 starvation among prisoners. The reasons for this situation
 include lack of concern at senior levels, incompetence,
 corruption, and budget reductions imposed as a result of the
 economic reform program. The Government has begun to take
 steps to correct some of these abuses. President Mobutu took
 personal charge of the Ministry of Justice early in 1985,
 primarily in response to evidence of malfeasance in the
 administration of justice and prisons. The Government has
 taken steps, described in section 1d, to remove and prosecute
 corrupt prison officials and to speed up processing of criminal
 
 
 372
 ZAIRE
 cases, but there probably have been only limited improvements
 in prison conditions. The underlying social and economic
 conditions which lead to abuses in the prisions are ingrained.
 Undisciplined and underpaid police and military personnel abuse
 their authority by harassing and extorting money from
 civilians. In 1985, there was a significant increase in
 reports of civilians killed in such incidents. In spite of the
 popular discontent these practices create, and some greater
 attention given by the authorities to improve discipline,
 security personnel are rarely punished for misconduct.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention without charges remain
 common occurrences, affecting most people who come into contact
 with the criminal justice system. Although habeas corpus or
 its equivalent and bail do not exist, by law those arrested
 must be brought before a magistrate to hear charges within 48
 hours of arrest. In practice, however, suspects are often
 arrested and held for months without a hearing. Detainees with
 financial resources are known to buy their way out of detention
 without ever having charges formally filed.
 The Government took serious steps during 1985 to begin coming
 to grips with this problem. -A high-level commission .composed
 of the Secretary of State for Justice, the President of the
 Supreme Court, the chief public prosecutor, and a legal adviser
 from the President's office was named in March to begin a
 nationwide investigation of prosecution practices and the
 status of the prison populations. The commission has completed
 its review of detainees in Kinshasa, leading to the release of
 numerous -etainees, the dropping of charges against many
 others, and faster processing of the remaining criminal cases.
 The commission has not yet had a significant impact on the
 interior of the country, where the situation is undoubtedly as
 bad as in Kinshasa, and it remains to be seen whether it will
 have any significant long-term effect. The Government and the
 bar association continue to implement other programs begun in
 1983 and 1984 intended to improve the system of administering
 justice, to provide free legal counsel, and to educate people
 on their legal rights. However, as is the case with poor
 prison conditions, the underlying social and economic
 conditions which lead to the abuses in the system are ingrained.
 Advocacy of a multiparty system or opposition to the
 party-state are both unconstitutional and illegal, as are
 actions which question the authority of the President and the
 political system,  When formally arraigned, most political
 detainees are charged with subversion or "attempts against the
 internal security of the state." In addition to judicial
 sanctions for such activity, nonjudicial sanctions against
 persons suspected of threatening state security are authorized
 by law, ranging from administrative detention and house arrest
 to internal exile to native villages and restriction of
 movement and travel. A number of militants of the group
 seeking recognition as a second political party, the Union for
 Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), including their
 spokesman, Tshisekedi Wa Mulumba, were arrested under these
 provisions in October. Tshisekedi and another leader were
 sentenced in January 1986 to 18 months in prison for insulting
 the President. In practice, most individuals detained for
 political reasons are held by means of these nonjudicial
 sanctions and are not formally charged or tried, remaining in
 
 
 373
 ZAIRE
 detention or internal exile until the President chooses to
 release them. Such arrests are made openly, and the
 whereabouts of detainees is known, at least unofficially,
 although it is sometimes not acknowledged by the Government.
 There are security prisoners in Kinshasa who have not been
 visited by family members for over a year and who can be
 considered as being in incommunicado detention. There were no
 known cases of exile or expulsion of Zairians from the country
 in 1985.
 Estimates of people detained or sentenced for essentially
 nonviolent expression of political beliefs vary greatly and are
 often out of date as detainees are released or others arrested,
 often for short periods of time. Estimates early in 1985 ran
 as high as 100 or more. An amnesty granted in June included a
 large number of people associated with the UDPS who had either
 been detained or relegated to native villages, including the
 remaining members of the "group of 13." By mid-September, UDPS
 officials believed that only about 12 sympathizers remained in
 detention, most of them having been detained in Kasai Oriental
 region in March after disturbances in a village to which a UDPS
 leader was "relegated." That situation changed in October as a
 number of additional UDPS sympathizers were held for varying
 periods of time. In addition, as many as 10 people who were
 arrested in connection with the 1984 bombing incidents in
 Kinshasa remain in custody. The Government maintains that they
 are terrorists but has never formally charged or tried them.
 Many people remain in detention in the Kalemie-Moba area in
 eastern Zaire, although it is difficult to distinguish
 political detainees or prisoners from those detained for
 participation in an armed insurgency. The best estimate of the
 number of political detainees or prisoners at the end of 1985
 was 50-60. The Government maintains that it holds no political
 prisoners.
 At its 1983 session, the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 in Geneva cited the Government of Zaire for not being in
 conformity with ILO Convention 29 pertaining to forced labor.
 This citation stemmed from Zairian legislation providing for
 compulsory civilian service for graduates from pedagogical and
 technical institutes, as well as from a government ordinance
 providing for imprisonment with compulsory labor for tax
 defaulters. The Government responded that amendments to the
 legislation were in process, although it is not clear whether
 they have been passed. There are no known instances in which
 tax defaulters have actually been sentenced to compulsory
 labor, although imprisonment at hard labor is a common sentence
 for those convicted of crimes.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants are guaranteed by the Constitution the right to a
 public trial and defense counsel. In practice, however, most
 citizens are not aware of those rights, and there are
 insufficient lawyers in Zaire to provide adequate counsel to
 most defendants. When available, defense counsel generally
 function freely and without coercion from the Government. Most
 defendants who are aware of their rights avail themselves of
 the right to appeal. Decisions of the court of state security
 involving national security, armed robbery, and smuggling are
 not subject to appeal (appeal to the Court of Cassation is
 permitted only on questions of law, not of fact), although all
 other procedural protections of the criminal code do apply.
 Military court procedures also do not provide for appeal.
 
 
 374
 ZAIRE
 While military courts generally try only cases involving
 military personnel, in time of emergency or during military
 operations (as was done in the Moba-Kalemie area in late 1984),
 the President can suspend civilian courts and transfer
 jurisdiction over all cases to military courts.
 The fairness of trials is uneven. Poorly paid magistrates are
 known to accept bribes, and it is essentially those unable to
 pay such bribes who are subject to the full rigor of the
 judical system. All judges are members of the sole political
 party and are subject to party discipline. The result is that,
 while judges are nominally independent and in fact perform
 their function without political interference in the great
 majority of cases, in sensitive or highly politicized cases the
 judges operate under instructions from the executive or
 security forces.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 All-Zairians are automatically members of the sole political
 party, the Popular Movement for the Revolution (MPR). The
 ideology of the MPR, and thus the only acceptable profession of
 political thought, comprises the views and policies of the
 party's president and founder, Mobutu Sese Seko.
 The party and state security organizations extend down to the
 neighborhood level, and both maintain liaison offices in all
 government agencies (including military units, universities,
 Legislative Council, ministries, etc.). Party officials, civil
 servants, armed forces personnel, parliamentarians, and
 employees of state enterprises pay an obligatory tax to support
 the activities of the party's major organs (cadre training,
 mobilization, propaganda, and youth). These party cadres are
 also required to attend the party's training institute.
 Nonattendance can result in reprimands and suspensions.
 Government employees, market vendors, and blue-collar workers
 are often required to participate in public events--parades,
 official arrival and departure ceremonies, etc.--or risk being
 suspended from their jobs.
 Mail is opened sporadically by security services, some
 telephone conversations are tapped, and government informers
 monitor places of residence as well as of work. In line with
 the party-state's ideology of "Zairian authenticity," Zairian
 men are forbidden to wear ties and women to wear slacks or
 wigs. Zairians are also forbidden to use non-African names.
 Judicial warrants are required by law before the police are
 permitted to search a home, except in cases of threats to
 national security. In practice, however, police and security
 authorities enter and search without such warrants. In civil
 cases where defendants have been found guilty of fraud or
 embezzlement from the Government, their property and homes can
 be seized and confiscated without reimbursement.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees the right of every citizen freely
 to express his opinions and feelings, either orally or in
 writing, but subordinates that and all other rights to the need
 to ensure "public order and good conduct."
 
 
 375
 ZAIRE
 Radio and television are owned and operated by the State. The
 major newspapers are privately owned but are believed to depend
 upon significant government subsidies to survive. In addition,
 they receive most of their news from the Zairian National Press
 Agency (AZAP), a state-owned and -operated organization. AZAP
 is also the principal source of information about news from
 abroad (drawn primarily from the French and Chinese news
 agencies' wire services) disseminated to Zaire's media. All of
 the media are expected to promote the ideals and principles of
 the sole political party. Publishers and editors are generally
 active party members. Commentary on politically sensitive
 internal issues as well as on foreign policy options is
 discouraged, and direct criticism of the President is
 forbidden. While journalists are circumspect in their
 criticism of other high officials as well, criticism of certain
 government practices, inadequate services, and corruption
 frequently appears in print.
 Media censorship tends to be self-imposed. Journalists must be
 members of the press union in order to practice their
 profession, and the threat of ouster from the union and
 consequent loss of livelihood reinforces self-censorship.
 There are several clandestine presses which operate
 sporadically, printing flyers and handbills critical of the
 Government and the ruling elite. The theater, songs, and
 organized street gossip are important forms of communicating
 popular opinions and news.
 Artistic and academic freedom of expression are subject to the
 same restrictions and self-censorship as the press. Mandatory
 membership in professional organizations and well-developed
 informer networks serve to discourage dissent. From time to
 time, books, records, films, and certain issues of magazines
 are banned. Imported publications, including books and
 periodicals, are subject to censorship if they are critical of
 Zaire or its Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Only the party and its affiliates may hold public meetings.
 The Government permits the existence of nonpolitical
 associations, but they must notify authorities when they plan
 meetings or activities involving more than five people. The
 Government can also prohibit meetings which continue after 9
 p.m. Meetings of nonofficial organizations and of some
 religious sects (see Section 2c below) have been disrupted on
 occasion by government agents because of suspected political
 activities.
 The labor movement in Zaire is limited to one national union,
 The National Union of Zairian Workers (UNTZA), which is an
 integral unit of the sole political party. The secretary
 general of UNTZA is a member of the party's central committee,
 and union officials at the regional level serve on regional
 party committees. UNTZA has the right to bargain collectively
 and provides significant social and educational services to
 members and their families. It works with the Government to
 improve worker benefits. However, it is unable to promote
 worker interests or defend worker rights which differ from
 those approved by the Government and party. The right to
 strike is embodied in the labor law, but because the law
 establishes lengthy and mandatory arbitration and appeal
 procedures which result in the resolution of most labor
 disputes, in practice officially authorized strikes do not
 
 
 376
 ZAIRE
 occur. There were numerous short, unauthorized but tolerated
 strikes in both the public and private sectors during 1985
 which generally succeeded in focusing government and management
 attention on union concerns.
 Membership in UNTZA is compulsory for civil servants, employees
 of state enterprises, and employees of private firms with at
 least 20 employees. Over 800,000 workers are dues-paying
 members. However, the overwhelming majority of the work force
 is self-employed, either in the unofficial sector or in
 subsistence agriculture, and is not covered by the Union.
 UNTZA participates actively in the ILO and the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity, and maintains ties with a number of
 foreign labor confederations.-
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Zairians enjoy freedom of religion, which is recognized in the
 Constitution. The Government officially sanctions most of the
 major world religions and provides procedures for new churches
 to obtain government recognition. Traditional African
 religious groups are tolerated but not officially recognized.
 The major religions in Zaire are: Catholicism--50 percent,
 Protestantism (including Kimbanguism)--36 percent, and Islam--5
 percent. The Government has at times banned or harassed
 religious groups or activities considered to present a
 political challenge. Although in recent years this has not
 happened to the large recognized religious groups, there were
 instances in 1985 of small sects being harassed or closed down
 when they were suspected of pursuing political rather than
 religious aims.
 Recognized religions are free to establish places of worship
 and to train clergy. Expatriate missionaries are allowed to
 proselytize and to serve both Zairian and expatriate
 congregations. Most churches maintain active links with
 coreligionists outside the country. Religious affiliation
 confers neither advantage nor disadvantage with respect to
 secular status.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government at times imposes special documentation
 requirements for travel to areas of unrest or security
 concern. As noted earlier, the Government also imposes against
 some dissidents the nonjudicial sanction of restriction to
 villages of origin. All citizens, refugees, and permanent
 residents must carry government-issued identity cards, and
 police and military personnel often set up checkpoints along
 major roads to inspect papers. Those whose papers are not in
 order pay a fine or spend time in jail. In principle, any
 Zairian citizen may obtain a passport and exit visa, although
 on occasion government and security officials have impeded
 issuance in order to prevent or disrupt travel of persons
 suspected of political opposition. A married woman must have
 her husband's permission before obtaining a passport but does
 not need his approval to travel.
 In May 1985, there were approximately 50,000 Zairians living as
 displaced persons or refugees in neighboring countries. Many
 refugees and displaced persons have returned under amnesties
 declared in 1978 and 1983, and negotiations occur sporadically
 with refugee groups or the countries where they reside for
 
 
 377
 ZAIRE
 additional repatriations. It is likely that many Zairian
 displaced persons could return to Zaire if they wished. A
 number of political opponents of the Government, however, live
 in self-imposed exile in Europe and probably could not safely
 return without renouncing their political views.
 In May 1985, Zaire was providing a safehaven to approximately
 330,000 displaced persons from neighboring countries.
 Generally such people pass freely into Zaire and are allowed to
 settle on the land or seek employment. They tend to become
 self-sufficient and are often integrated into the Zairian
 economic system within a few years of arrival. The Government
 considers them to be resettled until such time as they decide
 to return to their country of origin. Although the Zairian
 Government generally accepts displaced persons, it does not
 have the resources to provide assistance beyond free land, and
 international agencies play an active role in providing
 humanitarian assistance. At times, displaced persons from
 neighboring countries (particularly Angola) have been detained
 or harassed by security forces on suspicion of illegal
 political activity.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The key instruments of political power in Zaire are highly
 centralized and controlled by the President, who makes all
 important decisions. Under Zaire's Constitution, the state is
 essentially the executive organ of the country's sole political
 party, the Popular Movement of the Revolution. Party
 congresses meet every 5 years under the guidance of the
 President to set national political guidelines which are then
 supplemented by resolutions of the party's central committee.
 These policies are executed by the Prime Minister and Cabinet,
 who are appointed by the President.
 Suffrage is universal over age 18 and voting is mandatory,
 enforced by penalties including fines or arrest. The national
 Parliament, municipal councils, rural and urban zone councils
 are chosen by direct popular elections which take place every 5
 years, with the most recent having been in 1982. All
 candidates are members of the party (as are all citizens of
 Zaire) and are screened by party committees at the appropriate
 level, but voters generally have a choice of candidates (in the
 1982 parliamentary election there were an average of five
 candidates per district). The President is popularly elected
 for a 7-year term, after nomination by the party central
 committee. President Mobutu was reelected in 1984 to a third
 term in office.
 Citizens have no right to change their government through
 present institutions. Since 1980, a group of former
 parliamentarians has been involved in an effort to establish a
 second political party, the Union for Democracy and Social
 Progress (UDPS). Their efforts have generally been rebuffed by
 the official party and by the President, and they have suffered
 arrest and detention at various times over the past 5 years.
 Most members of the group, including all of its leaders, were
 released from internal exile in June 1985 and later entered
 into a dialogue with President Mobutu. That dialogue succeeded
 neither in convincing the UDPS members to rejoin the official
 party nor in convincing the President to open up the political
 system to another party. Later in 1985, a number of UDPS
 members were again arrested and banished to the interior.
 
 
 378
 ZAIRE
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains that Zaire has nothing to hide in
 terms of human rights policies, and it denies charges of
 systematic or serious violations. Its attitude toward external
 investigation of alleged human rights violations has been
 mixed. Zaire allows the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) to visit detention places and prisons. The ICRC,
 which has had a permanent representation in Zaire since 1978,
 continued its efforts in 1985 to gain access to all detainees
 held for security reasons. In 1985, the ICRC visited detention
 centers and prisons in Kinshasa, Kasai Oriental, Shaba, and
 Kivu. Moreover, the ICRC was given access to evaluate the
 situation in the subregion of Tanganyika following the
 insurgent attacks in the Kalemie-Moba area.
 Amnesty International's 1985 Report levels harsh criticism at
 Zaire, although most of the examples used in that report date
 from 1984 and earlier. In April, Amnesty International
 submitted information on its human rights concerns under the
 U.N. procedures for confidentially reviewing communications
 about human rights violations. The Government contends that
 Amnesty International's reports are inaccurate, biased, and.
 derived primarily from misinformed Zairian dissidents in
 Europe. Zaire has not allowed its representatives to visit the
 country since July 1982. The Government has consistently
 maintained that international action in the field of human
 rights should be strictly circumscribed by the principle of
 noninterference in the internal affairs of sovereign states. A
 local organization purports to study human rights issues, but
 it does not address itself to specific Zairian problems,
 concentrating instead on general issues. Freedom House rates
 Zaire as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Zaire is sub-Saharan Africa's second largest country in area
 and third largest in population (32 million). The annual
 population growth rate is approximately 2.7 percent, and the
 per capita gross domestic product was estimated at only $170 in
 1983. Because of low capital investment and poor maintenance,
 Zaire's basic infrastructure, particularly transportation,
 marketing, and communications, has deteriorated steadily since
 independence.
 At the end of 1982, the Government instituted a stringent
 economic and financial recovery program developed with the
 assistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Zaire has
 adhered to that program for 3 years, implementing measures to
 liberalize its economy and instituting management reforms.
 Price liberalization has encouraged greater food production.
 Limiting public expenditures and employment is another reform
 measure. While there are now signs that the economy is
 beginning to recover after more than a decade of decline, the
 short-term social and economic effects of the measures have
 aggravated the already precarious economic circumstances of
 many urban people. Major structural problems in
 transportation, public health, and education will be overcome
 only with time.
 Unemployment and underemployment are serious problems. Since
 independence, the percentage of rural population engagdd in
 subsistence agriculture has increased to 75 percent. During
 
 
 379
 ZAIRE
 the past several years, industry has operated at only 30 to 40
 percent of capacity. Since remuneration in the public service
 sector is inadequate and sporadic, many civil servants must
 supplement their incomes through commercial activities. Low
 salaries and job insecurity have also contributed to corruption
 in the Government and military. Low wage levels remain a
 problem, although government reforms include a new minimum
 agricultural wage, a higher minimum industrial wage, and
 revision of the Government's personnel system to provide
 comparable pay for comparable work throughout the military and
 civil service.
 Reflecting malnutrition and other health problems, the infant
 mortality rate in 1985 was 106 per 6,000 live births, and the
 life expectancy at birth was 51.6 years. Health care is
 curative rather than preventive and is extremely limited in
 quality and availability in both urban and rural areas. In
 1979, the population per physician was 14,780 and per hospital
 bed was 350. Access to safe water is limited, especially in
 rural areas.
 The literacy rate in Zaire for persons over 15 varies
 regionally but was estimated at 55 percent nationally in 1980.
 Approximately 37 percent of women are literate. Lack of books
 and supplies, high dropout rates at all levels, teacher
 strikes, poor teacher quality and, most recently, serious
 reductions in teaching and research staff have contributed to a
 declining quality of education at all levels throughout the
 country. Unofficial regional and ethnic quotas designed to
 protect various ethnic groups from exclusion are implemented in
 the university system.
 Worker rights are protected by law, but the fact that such a
 large percentage of the work force is in the unofficial sector
 limits the effectiveness of those laws. The minimum age for
 employment in Zaire is 14 years. However, many children
 younger than 14 engage in various income-earning activities and
 are often a major source of family income. The same is true
 with regard to conditions of work. Workers employed in the
 public and organized private sector have generally acceptable
 conditions of work: working hours are set by law and
 collective bargaining and do not exceed 48 hours a week;
 workers enjoy a full 24-hour rest day per week, and many have a
 48 hour weekend; paid holidays and vacations are required by
 law and are included in all labor contracts; and workplaces are
 required to meet minimum health standards set by law. While
 wages are generally above the minimum wage, that minimum, by
 itself, is insufficient to provide a decent living for a
 worker. In the official private sector, benefits often make up
 more than half of the total wage package, but in the public
 sector total remuneration does not provide a decent living.
 The results are corruption and workers taking on second jobs,
 often in the unregulated informal sector.
 The role of women in Zairian society is given great emphasis in
 party doctrine. Women's rights to own property and participate
 in the political and economic sectors are protected by law, and
 a growing number of women work in the professions, government
 service, and the universities. Nevertheless, custom,
 tradition, and existing .law continue to constrain women from
 attaining a position of complete equality in society. Women
 generally earn less than their male counterparts in the same
 jobs. In addition, married women must obtain their husband's
 authorization before opening a bank account, accepting a job,
 and renting or selling real estate.
