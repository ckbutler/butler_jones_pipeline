 THE BAHAMAS
 A member of the British Commonwealth, The Bahamas is a
 constitutional, multiparty democracy. Its political and legal
 traditions are similar to those of Great Britain, with emphasis
 on the r-ights of individuals. The. Queen of England is
 recognized as Head of State; she is. represented by an appointed
 Governor General. The Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) has
 governed since 1967 under the same leader, Prime Minister Sir
 Lynden 0. Pindling, an--r~tned-power-foqloiing general
 elections in June 1987.
 The police and small defense force respect constitutional and
 legal human rights provisions. There have been cases of
 drug-related corruption of law enforcement officers, as there
 -have been allegations of such corruption of other public
 figures. 'The Bahamas has a well-established judicial system
 based on common law and British procedures. Violent crime,
 drug addiction, and narcotics trafficking continue to be
 serious societal problems.
 The Constitution provides for the protection of fundamental
 rights and freedoms without discrimination by reason of sex,
 race, religion, origin, or political opinion, and its
 provisions are generally observed.
 The Bahamas' overall human rights record with respect to
 Bahamian citizens was generally good in 1987. Problems in the
 treatment of illegal Haitian immigrants continued; however,
 there was a marked improvement beginning at midyear.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of killings for political motives.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other forms of cruel or
 degrading treatment or punishment. Americans and Bahamians
 detained by police have on occasion reported instances of
 police brutality in the course of arrests and interrogations;
 however, as far as can'be determined, no charges were ever
 filed. Prison conditions in Nassau have been characterized as
 dirty, and the food barely adequate. In 1987 the Government
 installed a cential sewage system in the Nassau prison in
 order to improve sanitary conditions.
 d.- Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention. The
 right to a judicial determination of the legality of detention
 is respected; charges are normally brought within 48 hours of
 arrest; and those arrested are usually allowed access to an
 attorney of their own choosing.

 THE BAHAMAS
 Arbitrary mass arrests of Haitians suspected of being illegal
 residents continued during the first half of 1987. Those
 arrested were denied bail and languished in jail, for weeks in
 some cases, until their cases were heard. In May the Grand
 Bahamas Human Rights Association and L'Abri Ministries (an
 umbrella group of religious organizations) joined in filing a
 petition with the Organization of American States'
 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights denouncing the
 Government's treatment of Haitian detainees.. However, prior
 to the June 19 general elections the Government ended mass
 roundups and, with the resignation-in June of the National
 Security Minister and abolition of the National Security
 Ministry, Haitian detainees have been processed rapidly,
 spending in some cases only 1 day in detention. In May the
 Government announced its first monthlong amnesty since 1985
 for illegal aliens to register with the authorities and accept
 voluntary repatriation. In July the newly appointed Haitian
 consul characterized relations between Haiti and The Bahamas
 as "very good," and commented favorably on the improved
 treatment of Haitian detainees in Nassau's Fox Hill prison.
 The Constitution specifically prohibits forced or compulsory
 labor, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 An independent judiciary conducts fair and public trials. The
 Constitution entitles defendants to counsel, and Access to
 defendants is freely-permitted. These protections have not
 always been afforded to Haitians detained on immigration
 charges. Legal representation at public expense is provided
 only for capital cases. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not interfere in the private lives.of its
 citizens. The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search,
 or seizure, and the law requires warrants to be issued before
 privately owned property can be entered and searched. Police
 have sometimes broken down doors before presenting a warrant.
 The Government neither censqrs mail nor restricts receipt of
 foreign correspondence or publications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press exist in The Bahamas. There are
 three privately owned daily newspapers And one government-
 owned radio and television station. Political parties publish
 weekly newspapers. While there is no government censorship,
 the press does refrain from coverage of certain figures and
 events because of the bountry's stringent libel laws. In
 September. the Nassau Guardian declined even to report a
 Supreme Court decision in an extradition case involving a
 local attorney accused of drug trafficking, due to libel
 concerns. The 1986 libel case against the editor of the
 opposition party's newspaper remains unresolved.
 While the press is free, opposing points of view are not
 accorded fair radio and television treatment. The opposition
 party is prohibited by 1974 legislation from purchasing air
 time to broadcast its views, other than one spot each year.
 The time allotted for the spot is based upon the number of
 
 
 380
 THE BAHAMAS
 seats held in Parliament, with a minimum 15-minute time
 allocation. In the June general elections, the government-
 owned broadcasting corporation (ZNS) gave highly favorable
 coverage to the ruling party at the expense of both the
 opposition party and dissidents within the ruling party.
 Opposition leaders were afforded no opportunity to respond to
 many of the charges against their party during the campaign,
 particularly an election-eve attack blaming the opposition for
 a forged letter purporting to show that the Prime Minister
 planned to leave the country if defeated.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution protects the right to free assembly and
 association and specifically mentions political parties and
 trade unions. Labor organizations are free to organize,
 bargain, and strike. Occasional wage disputes by hotel
 workers have been settled through collective bargaining.
 Bahamian labor unions are associated with counterparts in
 other countries and are not controlled by the Government or
 the political parties. Union leaders continue to be outspoken
 in demanding greater worker protection under Bahamian labor
 laws.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is full freedom of religion in The Bahamas, and
 discrimination based on creed is prohibited. There is no
 favored or official state religion. Most church members
 belong to Protestant denominations. Some members of the small
 Rastafariad cult believe they are singled out for persecution
 by the police; the police deny their allegations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are free-to travel within The Bahamas and abroad.
 There are no restrictions on the right to change residence or
 workplace. The forced repatriation of Haitians, however,
 continued to be a concern as large groups continued to enter
 Bahamian waters on unseaworthy vessels which, in some
 instances, became disabled. In May 22 Haitians were stranded
 on Cay Lobos for 5 days after Bahamian authorities refused
 assistance and denied hospital access to four seriously or
 critically ill persons in the group, leaving the United States
 Coast Guard to respond to the emergency situation. Members of
 the party were repatriated safely to Haiti, with many suffering
 from exposure, dehydration, and other illnesses. Following the
 breakup of the National Security Ministry in June, however,
 Bahamian Defense Force vessels began -to provide helpful
 assistance to Haitian vessels in distress and have worked
 effectively-since then with the United States Coast Guard in
 repatriating Haitians.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to-Change Their Government
 The Bahamas is a constitutional democracy with a multiparty
 political system. The political process is open to all
 members of society, with citizens age 18 and over eligible to
 register and vote. There are two principal parties: the
 governing Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) and the opposition
 Free National Movement (FNM). The PLP led the country for
 
 
 381
 THE BAHAMAS
 5 years of internal self-government before independence in
 1973 and has held power without interruption since.
 General elections were held in June 1987 in which the PLP was
 returned to power with a clear parliamentary majority. The
 FNM, however, claimed the eleq~ion was marred by extensive
 electoral violations and challenged the results in the
 electoral court. As a result of-these challenges, the PLP
 responded in a countermove by challenging seats won by the
 FNM. The electorpl court is not expected to rule on these
 challenges until. arly 1988.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of. Human Rights
 The OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights included in
 its 1987 annual report the Bahamas Human Rights Association
 case alleging abuse against Haitians. No international human
 rights organization has visited The Bahamas to investigate
 human rights conditions. The Government has generally not
 been active in human rights affairs but has strongly
 criticized human rights violations in South Africa.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Bahamian law prohibits discrimination on grounds of sex, race,
 and religion, and The Bahamas has a good record in this regard.
 Women participate prominently at all levels of government and
 are well represented in the judiciary as well as in
 professional and private sectors. There does not appear to be
 a significant wage gap. The Constitution does, however, make
 several distinctions between the sexes regarding citizenship
 by, for example, preventing female Bahamians from bestowing
 citizenship upon their spouses. Women's rights activists have
 stated that Bahamian law puts women at a disadvantage
 concerning child care, inheritance, and property ownership.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There is no minimum wage lawin The Bahamas; however, wage
 levels in this touifist-dependent. economy are considered to.
 provide for a generally decent standard of living for workers.
 The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1970 states that employers
 cannot permit their employees to work more than 48 hours per
 week. Althougb the law does not address specifically the
 question of child labor, the requirement of compulsory
 education until .age 14 effectively discourages the employment
 of children. The Director of Labour conducts periodic checks
 of workplace's.for lighting, safety,. ventilation, and machine
 protection guards. Employers cooperate with these inspections
 and in implementing recommended safety measures. Following
 the June general elections, labor leaders announced their
 intention.to pursue in the new Parliament laws providing
 greater job protection for workers, particularly, those facing
 disciplinary or dismissal actions.
