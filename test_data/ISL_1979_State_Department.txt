 ICELAND
 Iceland has the oldest elected parliament in the world, the
 Althing, which first met in 930. Democratic traditions and
 ideals are deeply rooted, and there is broad legal and social
 support for human rights. Elections to the Althing are held
 at least every four years, and the President of the Republic
 is popularly elected every four years as well.
 Iceland is a signatory of both the International Covenant on
 Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on
 Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Free-
 dom from:
 a.   Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Pun-
 ishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Prisons and jails are modern and clean; health care and diet
 are excellent. There are no problems regarding family or
 attorney visits. There have been no executions in Iceland
 in modern history.
 P.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. There is a form of habeas
 _orpu ; anyone detained must be brought before a judge within
 24 hours and charged or released. There is no preventive
 detention, and there are no political prisoners.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed. The courts are under the
 Minister of Justice for administrative purposes but are inde-
 pendent of political control, and there are no military or
 other special courts. Defendants are entitled to legal counsel,
 and the state will pay the fees if the defendant cannot.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Judicial warrants are required except
 in cases of hot pursuit. There have been no allegations of
 illegal entry.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 National policy stresses full employment and provision of
 decent social services, education, and housing. Education
 through the university level is free. There are extensive
 programs to encourage private ownership of homes and to provide

 a comprehensive system of medical and dental care, as well as
 necessary social services, for the entire population. A social
 welfare state on the Scandinavian pattern, Iceland has compre-
 hensive programs of old age and disability pensions, unemployment
 compensation, sickness insurance, and child and family care.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and custom and are in
 effect.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and emigration.
 The only practical obstacle to foreign travel is a limit on the
 amount of money travelers may take abroad. Many people find
 this an inconvenience, but it does not seriously impede either
 business or vacation travel.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Civil and political liberties in Iceland are fully respected.
 The labor movement, a dominant social and political force within
 the country, fully guarantees the rights of all workers, a
 policy backed by advanced and comprehensive public welfare
 legislation. Democratic processes exist at all levels, assuring
 the freedom to participate in the political process. Women are
 legally equal to men. They may participate freely in social,
 economic and political life. Women tend to remain in traditional
 roles; however, they also comprise approximately 30% of the work
 force and are active in every aspect of Icelandic political,
 economic and cultural life.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violation
 of Human Rights
 No requests have been made for outside investigation of the
 human rights situation in Iceland.
