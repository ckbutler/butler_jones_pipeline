 BHUTAN*
 The Wangchuck dynasty of hereditary monarchs has ruled Bhutan
 since 1907. Isolated in the Himalayas between India and Tibet,
 the small Kingdom has been able to escape domination by any
 external power since the 10th century. King Jigme Dorji
 Wangchuck (1952-72) took steps to move the Kingdom from
 centuries of medieval seclusion toward a more representative
 political system, a more productive economy, and ties with
 other countries. Although he retained strong executive powers,
 the King created several important institutions, including the
 National Assembly (1953), the Royal Advisory Council.(1965),
 and the Council of Ministers (1968), to provide broader
 participation in the Government. Serfdom was abolished, land
 reform introduced, laws codified, and the judiciary separated
 from the executive. There is no written constitution or bill
 of rights. The present monarch, Jigme Singye Wangchuck,-who
 has held power since 1974, has continued Bhutan's social and
 political evolution, although progress has been seriously
 handicapped by the Kingdom's limited administrative capacity
 and resources and, more recently, by ethnic tensions in the
 south. Buddhists constitute approximately half of the,
 population, roughly divided between the ruling Drukpas and the
 Sarchokpas; at least a third of the population, mostly from the
 southern districts, is of Nepali Hindu ethnic origin.
 Internal security is maintained by the Royal Bhutan Police. It
 is assisted in this function by the Royal Bhutan Army, which
 consists of 8,000 lightly armed men.
 Calculating national income statistics for Bhutan is doubly
 difficult. Government officials now acknowledge that the
 official population figure of 1.4 million is greatly
 exaggerated; the actual number is between 600,000 and 700,000.
 This change alone would double the official per capita income
 figure, raising Bhutan from its status as the poorest country
 in South Asia to a position on a relative par with India. Even
 this figure is deceptive, however, since the largely rural
 population grows much of its own food and the ratio of man to
 land is the lowest in South Asia. Bhutan is dependent on
 foreign aid to cover much of its development costs; India is
 the principal donor. The large majority of the population is
 illiterate and rural, living on subsistence agriculture and
 pastoral pursuits in a largely barter economy. Bhutan
 continues to restrict access by the outside world in the hope
 of minimizing the spread of foreign influences. The number of
 tourists is limited strictly to 3,000 a year.
 The human rights situation in Bhutan in 1991 showed further
 deterioration due to government implementation of a nationality
 law, which resulted in the expulsion of several thousand ethnic
 Nepalese, as well as a code of "Bhutanization." A.resistance
 movement gained strength among ethnic Nepalese in the south who
 view these policies as an effort by the Government to suppress
 their ethnic and cultural identity and to drive many of them.
 out of the country. Major human rights problems in 1991
 *Bhutan and the United States have not exchanged diplomatic
 representatives, and U.S. officials travel there infrequently.
 Since few scholars have published studies on the contemporary
 Bhutanese polity or society, information on Bhutanese practices
 which bear on human rights is neither readily available nor
 complete.

 included denial of the right of citizens to change their
 government; limitations on the right to a fair public trial;
 restrictions on freedoms of speech and press, peaceful
 association and assembly, and worker rights. There were also
 credible reports of arbitrary arrests, beatings, torture, rape,
 robberies, and other forms of intimidation by police and army
 officials of ethnic Nepalese suspected of supporting the
 resistance movement. It appeared that dissidents also were
 guilty of serious human rights abuses, including beating,
 kidnaping, and killing government officials and suspected
 informers, as well as using intimidation and extortion against
 those who do not support their cause. Thousands of ethnic
 Nepalese have fled the turmoil in southern Bhutan to Nepal and
 India since the middle of 1990.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The People's Forum for Human Rights (PFHR), an organization of
 ethnic-Nepali Bhutanese which operates primarily in Nepal,
 claimed to have documented cases in which six ethnic Nepalese
 women died following a gang rape by members of the army. In
 addition, it accused government forces of both the execution of
 targeted dissidents and the indiscriminate killing of innocent
 ethnic Nepalese in retaliation for antigovernment actions by
 dissidents. The Government denied such accusations and pointed
 to an order by the King for police and army forces not to use
 lethal force when dealing with dissidents or demonstrators as
 evidence of its desire to avoid bloodshed. The Government
 accused dissidents of carrying on a reign of terror in the
 south, including arson, bombings, and assassinations which
 resulted in the deaths of civilians, government officials, and
 members of the police and army. There was no independent
 confirmation of any of these claims.
 b. Disappearance
 The PFHR as well as Nepali and Indian human rights groups
 interviewed.hundreds of ethnic Nepalese both in southern Bhutan
 and in Nepal and India. They reported widespread instances
 since September 1990 of police and army forces rounding up men
 suspected of supporting the resistance movement. The PFHR
 claimed that hundreds of these men were never seen again after
 being taken away; it presumed they were either being held by
 the Government without charge or had been killed. These claims
 could not be confirmed; however, the consistency of stories
 among so many people, most of whom have fled Bhutan, lent
 credence to their charges. The Government denied such
 disappearances took place; it accused the PFHR and other
 organizations such as the Bhutan People's Party and the
 Students' Union of Bhutan of carrying out antinational
 propaganda campaigns.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Ethnic Nepali refugees in India and Nepal recounted to human
 rights groups hundreds of cases in which police and army forces
 allegedly had beaten, raped, and robbed suspected supporters of
 the resistance and their families. These stories could not be
 confirmed but appeared credible based on the number of similar
 
 
 1369
 BHUTAN
 accounts. The PFHR also claimed that government authorities
 regularly tortured detainees and prisoners; the Government
 denied these allegations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were no reports of arbitrary arrest and detention in
 1991. As far as is known, exile is not used as a form of
 punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Criminal cases and a variety of civil matters are adjudicated
 under an 18th century legal code, revised in 1957, which
 applies to all Bhutanese regardless of ethnic origin. Judges
 appointed by and accountable to the King are responsible for
 all aspects of a case, including investigation, filing of
 charges, prosecution, and judgment of the defendant. The
 judicial system consists of local, district, and national
 courts. Appeals to higher courts are permitted, and final
 appeals may be made to the King. The legal system does not
 provide for jury trials or the right to a court-appointed
 defense'attorney. Prosecuting and defense attorneys are
 generally not available because the number of lawyers in the
 country is insufficient to serve in these capacities.
 Questions of family law, such as marriage, divorce, and
 adoption, are resolved separately according to the traditional
 Buddhist law for the majority of Bhutanese and according to
 Hindu law in areas where persons of Nepali origin predominate.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There are no written guarantees of privacy, but cultural
 tradition is highly respectful of personal privacy. At the
 same time, the Government places great emphasis on promoting
 national integration. For example, under a 1989 decree, the
 wearing of Drukpa national dress was made compulsory for all
 citizens. Anyone found violating the decree may be fined about
 $10 or sentenced to jail for a week. From all reports, there
 is a degree of tolerance for'noncompliance in urban areas, but
 in other parts, particularly in the south, officials appear to
 enforce the decree more rigorously.
 According to human rights groups, police regularly conducted
 house-to-house searches for suspected dissidents without
 offerinq explanations or justifications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 With an adult literacy rate of around 12 percent,.Bhutan's
 population is relatively unaffected by the print media. The
 Government's weekly newspaper Kuensel is the .country's only
 regular publication. Indian and other foreign newspapers and
 publications are distributed without apparent government
 control. Bhutan has no television. In 1989 the Government
 ordered the dismantling of al television antennas to prevent
 the people from watching programs originating outside Bhutan.
 The government radio station broadcasts for 3 hours daily in
 the four major national languages. Criticism of the King is
 permitted in the National Assembly but not in the public
 media. The use of the Nepalese language in schools was banned
 
 
 1370
 BHUTAN
 at the end of 1990. As a result of ethnic unrest in the area,
 most public schools in the south were closed throughout 1991.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 No written guarantees of these freedoms exist. Bhutanese may
 engage in peaceful assembly and association for purposes
 approved by the Government. However, political parties are
 discouraged, and there are no private voluntary social,
 communal, or economic associations and no professional or trade
 organizations. The Bhutan People's Party (BPP), organized by
 Nepali-origin Bhutanese, has been labeled "terrorist and
 antinational" by the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Buddhism is the state religion of Bhutan. The Government
 subsidizes monasteries and shrines and provides aid to about
 half of the Kingdom's 12,000 monks. The monastic establishment
 enjoys statutory representation in the National Assembly and
 Royal Advisory Council and is an influential voice on public
 policy. Citizens of other faiths, largely Hindus, enjoy
 freedom of worship but may not proselytize (under Bhutanese
 law, conversions are illegal). The King has declared major
 Hindu festivals to be national holidays, and the royal family
 participates in them. Foreign missionaries are not permitted
 to proselytize in the Kingdom, nor were there any resident in
 Bhutan in 1991.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Bhutan for all Bhutanese
 citizens and no bar on emigration or foreign travel. For many
 years, Bhutanese traveled little inside or outside the Kingdom,
 but the recent construction of roads and the establishment of
 air links with New Delhi, Calcutta, Dhaka, and Kathmandu have
 encouraged travel. Bhutan's southern border with India is
 open, and there is free movement across this border of people
 residing in the immediate areas. Indians from other regions
 who enter Bhutan by airplane or stay in hotels must have visas
 and fall under the overall limitation of 3,000 tourists per
 year.
 Since 1986, Bhutan has been conducting a drive to identify
 illegal immigrants by implementing a nationality law which
 requires people to document that they or their families have
 been residing in Bhutan since 1958 or before. Those who
 qualify are granted citizenship; the others must register as
 aliens and are subject to expulsion. In this process, about
 10,000 foreigners have been expelled from the Kingdom, mostly
 ethnic Nepalese. Many more have left because of the
 Government's Bhutanization policies. They complain the law
 makes unfair demands for 30-year-old documentation on largely
 illiterate people in a country that has only recently adopted
 basic administrative procedures. Human rights groups claim
 many ethnic Nepalese known to have been in Bhutan for
 generations face expulsion because they. are unable to document
 their claims to residence.
 Bhutan traditionally has welcomed refugees and exiles from
 other countries in the region. However, doubts about the
 loyalty to Bhutan of Tibetan refugees prompted the Government
 to require that they accept Bhutanese citizenship or face
 expulsion. Many sought refuge in India. Tibetans who accepted
 
 
 1371
 BHUTAN
 Bhutanese citizenship have been assured by the Government that
 they will be free to return to their homeland. The Government,
 however, no longer accepts new refugees from Tibet.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The citizens of Bhutan do not have the right to change their
 government. Bhutan'is a traditional monarchy, with sovereign
 power vested in the King. It is a highly elitist system, with
 decisionmaking centered in the palace and involving only a
 small number of officials in the civil and religious
 establishment. Although the present King and his father have
 made attempts to integrate women and southerners (ethnic
 Nepalese) into the body politic, the system is still dominated
 by the male members of an aristocracy of Tibetan Buddhist
 ancestry. Political parties do not exist, and thnir formation
 is discouraged. The Bhutan People's Party (BPP), founded in
 1989, was banned by the Government in 1990 and operates
 primarily out of Nepal and India, supported by ethnic Nepalese
 who have fled there. The BPP claims support in the
 predominantly Nepali southern regions of Bhutan, but there are
 no reliable reports on the party's actual membership.
 The 150-member National Assembly is composed of 105 members
 elected by limited franchise (heads of family in Hindu areas,
 village headmen in Buddhist'regions), 12 elected by the
 monastic establishment, and 33 high-level officials of the
 government administration appointed by the King. Its principal
 functions are to enact laws, approve senior appointments in the
 Government, and advise the King on matters of national
 importance. It also provides a forum for presenting grievances
 and rectifying cases of maladministration. Voting is by secret
 ballot, with a simple maj6rity needed to pass a measure.
 The King cannot formally veto legislation passed by the
 Assembly, but he can refer bills back to it for further
 consideration. The Assembly occasionally has rejected the
 King's recommendations or delayed their implementation, but the
 King has always had enough influence to persuade the Assembly
 to approve any legislation he considers essential or to
 withdraw any proposed legislation he opposes. Government
 officials may be questioned by the body, and ministers can be
 forced to resign by a two-thirds vote of no confidence.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No nongovernmental human rights groups are known to exist in
 Bhutan, and the Government would be likely to discourage their
 formation. The PFHR, representing ethnic Nepalese dissident
 opposition (see Section l.c.), claims to be based in Bhutan but
 operates primarily from Nepal. Several international human
 rights organizations, including Amnesty International, have
 sought entry into Bhutan to investigate human rights
 conditions. The Government has not permitted such visits; it
 has, however, allowed foreign journalists to travel throughout
 the country.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although the Government over the past 10 years has adopted a
 number of liberal measures that have benefited Bhutan's ethnic
 
 
 1372
 BHUTAN
 Nepalese minority, more recently it has implemented a
 nationality law and Bhutanization program which have had an
 adverse and discriminatory impact on ethnic Nepalese. At the
 root of this problem is the divisive issue of how to
 accommodate the growing segment, estimated to be at least a
 third of the population, of Nepali Hindu origin. The country's
 Buddhist majority has long been concerned about being
 outnumbered by immigrants from Nepal, as occurred in
 neighboring Sikkim. In the past, the Government responded to
 this concern by tightly limiting immigration and restricting
 residence and employment of the Nepali population to the
 southern part of the country. In an attempt to assimilate the
 existing ethnic Nepalese, the Government liberalized certain
 policies toward the Nepali minority by encouraging
 intermarriage, educating some students in regions other than
 their own, and giving priority to economic development of the
 south. In the last decade, the King has allocated 2,500 acres
 of land to 1,000.landless households in southern Bhutan, and
 about 200 farmers and orange growers have been given special
 loans, according to Bhutanese government sources. By law,
 southerners may own land and establish business in the north,
 and northerners have the same right in the south. Nonetheless
 it is reportedly still difficult for non-Buddhist Bhutanese
 (except government officials) to buy property in Buddhist
 areas.
 More young Bhutanese of Nepali origin are entering public
 economic and administrative bodies, and laws concerning land
 tenure and taxation in the south are being liberalized.
 Although the language of instruction is English, there is a
 requirement that Dzongkha, the language of the western
 highlands, be taught in all schools, and this requirement is
 said to disadvantage students from otlier areas. In addition,
 instruction in Nepali has been terminated throughout the
 country. Groups of ethnic Nepalese from Bhutan who are now
 taking refuge in Nepal and India protest against "cultural
 discrimination" and call for democratic reforms in Bhutan. The
 size of these groups and the amount of support they attract in
 southern Bhutan are not known.
 Families with ties to the palace and senior levels of the
 Government are strongly favored in their access to state
 scholarships for foreign education. Nevertheless, the King is
 making a serious effort to send other qualified candidates for
 education overseas as well, drawing particularly from Bhutan's
 prestigious civil bureaucracy.
 Bhutan has not developed either a rigid caste system or customs
 which sequester or disenfranchise women. Family land is
 divided equally between sons and daughters. Bhutanese
 traditionally place girls in a lower status than boys, however,
 and girls receive poorer nutrition and less medical attention
 than boys. Boys outnumber girls by about two to one in primary
 school and seven to one at secondary level. The Government is
 conscious of the disparity and has taken steps to encourage
 equal trbatment for girls and increased enrollment of girls at
 school. The disparity between the higher mortality rates of
 female versus male infants has resulted in an overall ratio of
 97.2 females per 100 males, one of the lowest in the world.
 The sexes mix relatively freely, marriages can be arranged by
 partners themselves as well as by their parents, and divorce is
 common. A man is allowed by law to have three wives, but
 polyandry is no longer sanctioned. Legislation has been
 enacted in recent years making marriage registration compulsory
 
 
 1373
 BHUTAN
 and favoring women in matters of alimony. About 10 percent of
 the persons employed by the various government ministries and
 departments are women.
 No reliable information is available on the extent to which
 violence against women may be a problem in Bhutan.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unionism is not permitted and Bhutan has no labor
 unions. There are no export processing zones.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no collective bargaining or legislation addressing
 labor-related issues pertaining to the small industrial work
 force, which makes up less than I percent of the population.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 As far as is known, there is no law prohibiting forced or
 compulsory labor, but it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There are no laws governing the employment of children.
 Children are not employed in the industrial sector, but many
 assist their families in the traditional economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 As noted above, there is no legislation addressing labor
 issues. There is no legislated minimum wage, standard
 workweek, or health and safety standards. Labor markets are
 highly segmented by region, and monitoring wage developments is
 inhibited by the preponderance of subsistence agriculture and
 the practice of barter. The largest salaried labor market is
 the government service, which has an administered wage
 structure last revised in 1988. The shortage of labor in
 Bhutan is such that the larger industrial firms, all of which
 were established relatively recently, are organized along
 modern lines and incorporate a considerable amount of
 labor-saving technology. No industrial plant employs more than
 60 to 70 workers. Apart from a few of these larger plants, the
 entire industrial sector consists of home-based handicrafts and
 some 60 privately owned small- or medium-scale factories
 producing consumer goods.
