 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka is a longstanding democratic republic with an active multiparty system.
 Constitutional power is shared between the popularly elected President and the 225-
 member Parliament. President Chandrika Kumaratunga leads the People's Alliance
 (PA) a coalition of parties, which holds a single seat majority in parlament. Both
 the Parliament and the President were elected in free and fair elections in 1994.
 The Government respects constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary.
 The conflict between the Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
 (LTrE), an insurgent organization fighting for a separate state for the country's
 Tamil minority, continued beyond its 13th year and intensified. A 6-month govern-
 ment military offensive captured the LTTE heartland of the Jaffna Peninsula in
 April, adding tens of thousands to the ranks of displaced persons. The LTTE in-
 flicted a major military defeat on government forces at Mullaitivu army base in the
 north, killing upwards of 1,500 troops.
 The Government controls all security forces. The 50,000-member police force is re-
 sponsible for internal security in most areas of the country. The 80,000 member
 army, and the small navy and air force, conduct the war against the LTTE insur-
 gents. The plice paramilitary Special Task Force (STF) also battles the LTTE. The
 5,000 strong Home Guards, an armed force drawn from local communities, provides
 security for Muslim and Sinhalese village communities in or near the war zone. The
 Government also arms and directs various Taml militias opposed to the LTTE,
 though at times these gups act independently of government authority. During the
 year, some members of the security forces committed serious human rights abuses.
 Sri Lanka is a low-income country with a market economy that is based on the
 export of textiles, garments, tea, rubber, coconuts, and gems, and on earnings from
 tourism. The gross domestic product per capita is about $700. The economy grew
 in excess of 5 percent per year during 1990-1995. However, a severe drought cou-
 pled with the ongoing civil war, slowed economic growth to less than 4 percent dur-
 ing 1996. During the year, the Government made significant steps toward economic
 reform, including trimming subsidies, privatizing government enterprises, and pro-
 moting foreign investment and trade.
 The Government generally remained committed to the human rights of its citi-
 zens. However, the intensification of the war with the LTTE was accompanied by
 a deterioration in the human rights record of the security forces in some areas. In
 February the security forces were responsible for the extrajudicial killings of at least
 50 Tamils, including the murder of 24 civilians in the eastern village of
 Kumarapuram by army troops. At least 300 individuals are believed to have dis-
 appeared from security force custody on the Jaffna Peninsula, while 50 more dis-
 appeared elsewhere on the island. Torture remained a serious problem, and prison
 conditions remained poor. There were an increase in detentions and short-term
 mass arrests, often accompanied by failure to comply with some of the protective
 provisions of the Emergency Regulations (ER). Impunity for those responsible for
 human rights abuses remained a problem. Progress was made in some unresolved,
 high-profile cases of extrajudicial killing and disappearance. In others, however, the
 investigations or judicial processes were inactive, giving the appearance of impunity
 for those responsible for human rights violations. At year's end concern was mount-
 ing over the failure of both the Government and the LITE to take prisoners of war
 on the battlefield. From April to October, the Government censored all domestic
 news reports relating to military or police matters. Discrimination and violence
 against women, child prostitution, and child labor continued to be problems.
 In positive developments, the Government took steps to control the abuses. Legis-
 lation was passed establishing a permanent human rights commission, although the
 c.mmission was not yet operational at year's end. Prosecutions of security force per-
 sonnel alleged to have engged in human rights abuse continued, including that of
 8 soldiers charged in the Kumarapuram massacre. There was no attempt, as in the
 past, to use the ER to cover up security force misdeeds. Sixteen police and army
 personnel were arrested for the rape and murder of two young women in Jaffna.
 Through its rulings, the judiciary continued to uphold individual civil rights. Gov-
 ernment security forces took effective measures to limit civilian casualties during
 the military offensive against the LTTE in Jaffna. The Government also provided
 relief to those displaced by the conflict even though many were still under the con-
 
 
 1484
 
 trol of the LTTE. Three regional commissions established to investigate disappear-
 ances continued their investigations. The Government ratified the Optional Protocol
 to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
 The LTrE made terrorist attacks against civilians, although there were no re-
 ported attacks in the second half of the year. The LTIE regularly committed
 extrajudicial killings (including civilian massacres and assassinations), and was also
 responsible for disappearances, arbitrary arrests, detentions, and torture. The LTTE
 terrorist bombing of-the Central Bank in Colombo in January killed 90 civilians.
 Seventy commuters in Colombo died in a train bombing in July. LTTE guerrillas
 routinely used excessive force in the war. In the attack on Mullaitivu, which killed
 1,500 government troops, the LTTE claims to have taken no prisoners. Though
 largely dislodged from the Jaffna Peninsula by government forces, the LTTE contin-
 ued to control large sections of the north and east of the country through authoritar-
 ian military rule, denying the people under its authority the right to change their
 government, routinely violating their civil liberties, and severely discriminating
 against ethnic and religious minorities. The use of rape by the LITE as a weapon
 of terror, first noted in 1995, did not reoccur.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Police (mostly STF officers) and
 army personnel committed extrajudicial killings in both Jaffna and the Eastern
 Province. Most of these were associated with operations against the LTTE insur-
 gents or interrogation of suspected rebels. In excess of 50 individuals were killed,
 although the exact number was impossible to ascertain due to a long period of cen-
 sorship of news relating to military or police operations, and lack of access to the
 north and east where the civil war was bing waged. In February army troops mur-
 dered 24 Tamil villagers, including 2 children under 12 years of age, in the eastern
 village of Kumarapuram. Eight soldiers were arrested and the Attorney General's
 offie reommended to the High Court that they be indicted on 101 counts of murder
 and attempted murder. They had not yet come to trial at year's end.
 In some cases these extrajudicial killings were reprisals against civilians for
 LITE attacks in which members of the security forces were killed or injured. Sev-
 eral such reprisals occurred during operations by the STF. In many cases, the secu-
 rity forces claimed that the victims were members of the LTTE. However, human
 rights monitors have determined that these victims were civilians. With the excep-
 tion of the Kumarapuram incident, the perpetrators of these killings had not been
 arrested by the Government at year's end. There were also a number of suspicious
 deaths attributed to the security forces, mostly involving detainees acting as govern-
 ment informants who died during operational missions against the LTTE.
 In October 1995, 22 members of the STF were arrested and detained under the
 ER on suspicion of murdering 23 Tamil youths whose bodies were found floating in
 Bolgoda Laike and other bodies of water near Colombo. The suspects were released
 on bail and resumed their police functions in February. In July the charred body
 of a Tamil textile merchant who had been detained under the ER was found at
 Giribawa in North Central Province. Six police officers, including the officer in
 charge of the police countersubversive unit in Vavuniya, were arrested and detained
 under the ER. In both cases, the police investigation was submitted to the Attorney
 General's department, which had not yet mae any recommendations to the High
 Court by year's end. In the case of the Bolgoda Lake killings, problems with the
 Government's evidence have reportedly contributed to the delay.
 A presidential commission was established to investigate torture and murder in
 the late 1980's at a government-run detention center at Batalanda Housing Estate
 near Colombo. In August five police officers were arrested for alleged complicity.
 The investigation was continuing at year's end.
 In November, 16 police and army personnel were arrested for the rape and mur-
 der of Krishanthi Kumaraswamy, the murder of her family member, and the rape
 and murder of Rajini Velayuthapillai in Jaffna. The 11 accused in the
 Kumaraswamy case were brought before the magistrate's court in Colombo and
 charged with rape and murder.
 The PA Government came to power in 1994 promising to bring to justice the per-
 petrators of extrajudicial killings from previous years. In 1994 it began prosecutions
 of suspects in several extrajudicial murders allegedly perpetrated by members of the
 security forces. The trial of 21 soldiers, accused of massacring 35 Tamil civilians in
 1992 in the village of Mailanthani in Batticaloa district, was transferred to the
 Colombo High Court. The Attorney General recommended to the Court that the sus-
 pects be indicted on 40 counts of murder. The trial of 4 police officers indicted in
 
 
 1485
 1994 for the 1990 murders of 12 civilians in Wavulkelle was still ongoing at year's
 end.
 There were no developments in the government investigations into the mass
 =raves at Sooriyakanda, which contain an estimated 300 bodies, or the grave at
 kumbura, which is thought to contain the bodies of 36 people killed by the police
 in 1989. In addition, there were no developments in the Nikaweratiya army camp
 incident in which 20 youths were allegedly killed by soldiers in 1989.
 In April the ER, which had previously been in force only in areas of the north
 and east directly affected by the insurgency and in Colombo, was reimposed nation-
 wide. There was no evidence that the Government was using them, as in previous
 years, to conceal extrajudicial killings or disappearances. However, crucial safe-
 guards built into the ER were being routinely ignored by the security forces--espe-
 cialy those prvisions requiring receipts to be s~sued for arress and ordering the
 security forces to notify the Human Rights Task Force (HRTl) of any arrest within
 24 hours. The HRTF is a quasi-independent government body established by an ER
 to register detainees held under the-ER and the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA),
 and monitor their welfare. Although security force personnel can be fined or jailed
 for failure to comply with the ER, none was known to have been punished during
 the year.
 In the east and in Vavuniya in the north, the military wing of the People's Libera-
 tion Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), the Mohan Group, and the Rasheek
 Group-progovernment Tamil militant organizations-were responsible for the kill-
 ing of a number of people. Though armed and nominally under the control of the
 security forces, these groups frequently acted independently of government author-
 ity. It was imposible to determine the number of victims because of the secrecy with
 which these groups operated. However, those killed included both LTIE operatives
 and civilians who failed to comply with extortion demands.
 Violence between supporters of the major political parties worsened during the
 year. Politically motivated attacks resulted in a number of deaths, including eight
 people in the coastal town of Negombo in September.
 There were no developments in the October 1994 suicide bombing that killed the
 United National Party's presidential candidate, Gamini Dissanayake, and 58 other
 people, although it is generally believed to be the work of the LTTE.
 The LTTE continued to commit extrajudicial killings. In January a midmorning
 bomb blast at the Central Bank in the heart of Colombo killed more than 90 civil-
 ians. In July, 70 commuters in Colombo died in a train bombing. In the same
 month, an attempted assassination attempt against the Minister of Housing by a
 suicide bomber in Jaffna left 25 dead, including an army brigadier. Numerous assas-
 sinations of political opponents in the east were perpetrated by "pistol gangs', who
 successfully carried out their attacks using motorcycles and revolvers. Massacres of
 civilians continued. In June, 14 Sinhalese villagers were killed in Puttalam district.
 In September, 11 Sinhalese travelers were murdered in an ambush on a bus in
 Ampara district. The LITE continued to execute suspected government informants.
 In the past, the LiTE has killed university professors, members of nonviolent Tamil
 opposition parties, and human rights monitors.
 b. Disappearance.-Disappearance at the .hands of the security forces increased
 alarmingly, especially in the east and north, though some occurred in Colombo.
 Most of these were associated with the arrest of suspected LTTE insurgents. In ex-
 cess of 300 individuals are believed to have disappeared on the Jaffna Peninsula in
 the second half of the year, and more than 50 elsewhere in the country throughout
 the year. As with extrajudicial killings, the exact number was impossible to ascer-
 tain due to censorship of news about security force operations, and lack of access
 to the north and east.
 There were 34 confirmed cases of disappearance in 1995, and 10 cases in 1994,
 the lowest number on record in at least a decade. Those who disappeared in 1996
 and in previous years are presumed dead. The disappearances involved persons last
 known to be in police or army custody. The Commander of the Army and the Inspec-
 tor General of Police have both issued directives condemning disappearances and
 stating that perpetrators would be called to account. In November, the Ministry of
 Defense established a Board of Investigation to look into disappearances in the
 north and east and review security forces procedures. However at year's end, the
 Government had not identified or charged those responsible for disappearances dur-
 ingthe year.
 The Government continued investigations into past disappearances. The three re-
 gional commissions set up in November 1994 to inquire into disappearances occur-
 ring after January 1, 1988, worked throughout the year. Through August the com-
 missions received 61,300 complaints. Most of these cases date from 1988-90, when
 a terrorist insurrection organized by the Janata Vimukti Peramuna (JVP) threat-
 
 
 1486
 
 ened to plunge te country into chaos until it was put down by a brutal
 counterinsurgency campaign. Of these, they were able to review 38,000 individual
 cases, leaving 23,000 outstanding. Chargedwith producing final reports for Presi-
 dent Kumaratunga, including recomnendations or legal action, the commissions
 were believed to have accumulated sufficient information to prosecute as many as
 200 members of the security forces for human rights violations. No final reports
 were produced, as the mandates of the commissions were extended into 1997. The
 November 1995 final report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the In-
 voluntary Removal of Persons was made available to the three regional commis-
 sions. The Commission was formed in 1991 to investigate disappearances after that
 date.
 The trial of 11 suspects, including an army brigadier general, in the disappear-
 ance of 32 school boys from the southern town of Embiipitiya in 1989 and 1990 con-
 tinued at year's end. However, there were no developments in the Vantharamulle
 case, in which army troops allegedly abducted 15 Tamils from a refugee camp in
 Batticaloa district in 1990. Observers maintain that there is credible evidence ia-
 tifing the alleged petrators. There were also no developments in the case of 31
 youths who allegedly  appeared followin theirarrestsin Divlapitiya in 1989.
 The Government continued to give the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) unhindered access to detention centers, police stations, and army camps.
 This played an important role in enabling the ICRC to monitor the human rights
 practi ces of the security forces, as did the work of the HRTF. However, at year's
 end the HRTF had no yt established operatios on the Jaffna Peninsula, in part
 because government approval had been delayed until October.
 Progoverment Tmi miitants in the east and north, acting independently of
 government authority, were also responsible for disappearances. As in the case of
 extrajudicial killings, it was impossible to determine the exact number of victims be-
 cause of the secrecy with whic these groups operated. The Government has taken
 no clear ybic steps to condemn the militants' actions or to stop them.
 The L      was responsible for an undetermined number of civilian disappear-
 ances in the northeastern part of the island. Most of the 400 to 600 police officers
 captured by the LTTE in 1990 are believed to be dead, as are over 200 security force
 personnel captured at a battle in  Poonryin 1993. Althougn the LTtE denies tak-
 rng anc prisoners following the Mullaitivu battle in July, it is suspected of holdin
 some. The vice chancellor of Eastern University, who was kidnaped by the LTTe
 in November 1995, was released in January.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 In 1994 the Government acceded to the Convention Ag   st Torture and Other
 Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Pariiament also enacted
 legislation to implement the iorture Convention by making torture a punishable of-
 fense. However, the Government has not yet developed e ective regulations under
 the new legislation to prosecute and punish military and police personnel respon-
 sible for torture, although it has ceased paying fines incurred by security force per-
 sonnel guilty of the offense.
 Memers of the security forces continued to torture and mistreat detainees and
 other prisoners, bth male and female, particulariy during interrogation. Although
 the number of torture reports was somewhat lower than in previous years in the
 Colombo area, the situation in Eastern Province did not improve. Torture also
 emerged as a problem in the newly recaptured Jaffna Peninsula. In November a Su-
 preme Court judge stated publicly that torture continued unabated in police stations
 in spite of a number of judicial pronouncements against its use. Progvernmnent
 Taml militants in the east and north, directly responsible to the security forces,
 also engaged in torture. Most torture victims were Tamils suspected of being LTTE
 surgets or cllab  oros.
 Metrods of trture included electric shock, beatings (especially on the soles of the
 feet), suspension by the wrists or feet in contorted positions, burning, near
 drownings, placing of insecticide, chili powder, or gasline-saked bags over the
 head, and forced positions. Detainees have reported broken bones and other serious
 injuries as a result of their mistreatment. There were no reports of rape in deten-
 tion.
 Under fundamental rights provisions in the Constitution, torture victims may file
 civil suit for compensation in the Supreme Court. The Court granted awards rang-
 ing from $200 to $2,000. Most cases, however, take 2 years or more to move through
 the courts. Moreover, because the new antitrture law imposes a heavy minimum
 punishment of 7 years imprisonment, the Court is scrutningfundmental rights
 cases more carefully than in the past, since findings would weigh heavily in criminal
 prosecutions of torturers. During the year, no one was convicted of torture under
 the antitorture law.
 
 
 1487
 The LTrE reportedly used torture on a routine basis. However, because of the se-
 cretive nature of the LTIE, no first-hand information was available.
 Prison conditions are generally poor and do not meet minimum international
 standards because of overcrowding and lack of sanitary facilities. An increase in the
 number of detentions associated with the war with the LTTE caused a significant
 deterioration in already poor standards in short-term detention centers. However,
 the Government permitted representatives from the ICRC to visit more than 400
 places of detention.
 Conditions are also believed to be poor inprsns operated by the LMTE.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under ordinary law, authorities must in-
 form an arrested person of the reason for arrest and bring that person before a mag-
 istrate within 24 hours. In practice, persons detained under ordinary law generally
 appear before a magistrate within a few days of arrest. The magistrate may author-
 ize bail or order continued pretrial detention for up to 3 months or longer. Under
 the ER and the PTA, security forces may detain suspects for extended periods of
 time without court approval. The ER, in force throughout the nation, allow pretrial
 detention for a maximum of four consecutive 3-month periods. A magistrate must
 order further detention. Detainees may challenge their detention and sue the Gov-
 ernment for violating their civil rights in the Supreme Court.
 In spite of government announcements that it would close all secret detention cen-
 ters, there were continued reports that the security forces held people in such a
 manner, especially on the Jaffna Peninsula. Tamil militant groups, ostensibly under
 the direct control of the security forces, were known to be operating illegal-and
 unmonitored--detention centers in the east and in Vavuniya.
 Detention of Tamils continued to increase as a result of the continuaing hostilities
 with the LTTE. At year's end the Government held as many as 1,500 detainees
 under the ER, up from 380 at the end of 1994 and 940 at the end of 1995. Many
 of these detainees were arrested during operations against the LTTE. Between June
 and September, 460 suspected members of the LTME were detained on the Jaffna
 Peninsula. The Government continued to detain up to 300 individuals under the
 PTA, which permits detention without charge for up to 18 months. A hunger strike
 in June by Tamils detained without charge under the PTA highlighted the fact that
 some had been so incarcerated for up to 4 years.
 Arrests and detentions by the police increasingly took place in violation of the
 legal safeguards built into the ER, particularly regarding requirements that receipts
 be issued and that the HRTF be notified of any arrest within 24 hours. Due to cen-
 sorship and lack of access, it was unclear what happened to detainees on the Jaffna
 Peninsula.
 Security forces continued to conduct mass arrests of young Tamils, both male and
 female, especially following the LTTE assassination attempt in Jaffna against the
 Minister of Housing, and the LTTE attack on Mullaitivu in July. Major sweeps and
 arrests occurred in Colombo, the east, and increasingly, on the Jaffna Peninsula. Al-
 though exact numbers of arrests were impossible to determine, they clearly num-
 bered in the thousands. Upwards of 1,000 Tamils at a time were picked up during
 police actions. Most were released after identity checks lasting several hours to sev-
 eral days. The Government justified the arrests on security grounds, but many
 Tamils claimed that the arrests were a form of harassment. In addition, those ar-
 rested, most of whom were innocent of any wrongdoing, were detained in prisons
 together with hardened criminals.
 The HRTF continued to investigate the legality of detention in cases referred to
 it by the Supreme Court and private citizens. Although the HRTF is legally con-
 stituted under the ER to exercise oversight over arrests and detentions by the secu-
 rity forces and to undertake visits to prisons, members of the security forces rou-
 tinely breached the regulations and failed to cooperate with the HRTF. Moreover,
 following the capture of Jaffna in April, the HRTF was not given permission by the
 Ministry of Defense to set up operations on the peninsula until October, in spite of
 provisions in the ER legally requiring the security forces to assist the statutory
 body. At year's end the HRTF had not yet opened an office on the Jaffna Peninsula.
 There were unconfirmed reports that the LTTE was detaining more than 2,000
 civilians in the northern part of the island. The LTrE did not permit the ICRC or
 any other humanitarian organization to visit its detainees-aside from 22 security
 force personnel, 17 Sinhalese fishermen, and 8 crew members of a civilian ferry hi-
 jacked in 1995.
 The Government does not practice exile. There are no legal provisions allowing
 or prohibiting its use.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects these provisions in practice.
 
 
 1488
 The President appoints judges to the Supreme Court, the courts of appeal, and
 the high courts. A judicial service commission, comprised of the Chief Justice and
 two Supreme Court judges, appoints, transfers, and dismisses lower court judges.
 Judges serve until mandatory retirement age, which is 65 for the Supreme Court
 and 62 for judges on other courts.
 In criminal cases, defendants are tried in public by juries. They are informed of
 the charges and evidence against them, may be represented by the counsel of their
 choice, and have the right to appeal. The Government provides counsel for indigent
 persons tried on criminal charges in the high courts and the court of appeal but not
 in other cases; private legal aid organizations assist some defendants. There are no
 jury trials in cases brought under the PTA. Confessions, which are inadmissible in
 criminal proceedings, are allowed in PTA cases. Most convictions under the PTA
 rely heavily on them. Defendants bear the burden of proof to demonstrate that their
 confessions were obtained by coercion. Defendants in PTA cases have the right to
 appeal.
 The Government claims that all persons held under the ER and the PTA are sus-
 pected members of the LTTE and therefore legitimate security threats. There is in-
 sufficient information to determine whether these detainees or members of the now
 legal Sinhalese Janatha Vimukhti Peramuna (JVP), similarly detained in past
 years, were political prisoners. Between 200 and 300 of those previously detained-
 mostly JVP members--have been convicted under- criminal law and remain incarcer-
 ated. In many cases, human rights monitors question the legitimacy of the criminal
 charges brought against these people.
 The LITE has its own court system, composed of young judges with little or no
 legal training. The courts reportedly impose severe punishments. However, the
 courts operate without codified or defined legal authority, and essentially operate
 as agents of the LTTE rather than as an independent judiciary.
 The L1T0E also holds a number of political prisoners. The number is impossible
 to determine because of the secretive nature of the organization.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government generally respects the constitutional protections of individual privacy
 and the sanctity of the family and home. The police obtain proper warrants for ar-
 rests and searches conducted under ordinary law. However, the security forces are
 not required to obtain warrants for searches conducted under the PTA. The Sec-
 retary of Defense is responsible for providing oversight for such searches. There is
 no jdicial review or other means of redress for alleged illegal searches under the
 The Government is believed to monitor telephone conversations and correspond-
 ence on a selective basis. The security forces routinely open mail destined for the
 LTTE-controlled areas and seize contraband.
 The LTTE routinely invades the privacy of citizens. It maintains an effective net-
 work of informants. In 1990 the LTTE evicted thousands of Muslim residents from
 their homes in the north. They currently live in refugee camps.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Hostilities between the Government and the LTTE continued throughout the
 year. However, the security forces generally exercised much greater restraint in the
 use of excessive force than they had previously. From October 1995 through April
 1996, the Government conducted coordinated military attacks on LTTE-held terri-
 tory in the Jaffna Peninsula, resulting in the capture of Jaffna City in December
 1995 and the remainder of the peninsula by April. Government forces also captured
 the town of Kilinochchi in September. Altogether, the fierce fighting in the north
 resulted in many casualties on both sides and upwards of 480,000 displaced persons.
 The Government, however, took measures to limit the number of civilian casual-
 ties in the war. Notices were dropped warning civilians to congregate in schools,
 churches, and temples to minimize risk. In addition, during the Jaffna offensive,
 shelling in advance of troops attacking through populated areas was kept to a mini-
 mum in order to spare civilians, though Kilinochchi was shelled to a much greater
 extent in the July advance. Civilian casualties were also reduced due to the rel-
 atively slow and methodical manner in which government security forces pushed
 forward, which enabled civilians to flee well in advance of troop movements. The
 Government, assisted by international relief organizations, continued to channel
 emergency food and limited medical supplies to the civilians displaced in the fight-
 ing, including those living in areas controlled by the LTTE. The security forces also
 continued to carry out human rights instruction as part of their training courses
 (see Section 4).
 Nonetheless, a massacre of villagers by army troops occurred at Kumarapuram
 in the east (see Section L.a.). In an incident in December 1995, members of the STF
 in Batticaloa district in the east commandeered a civilian bus to move quickly to
 
 
 1489
 defend an STF camp at Pudukudiirippu that was under attack by the LTTE. They
 forced the civilians to remain on board, resulting in several civilian deaths when
 the bus came under LTTE fire. There has been no investigation into this incident.
 The Government held only three LTTE cadres as prisoners of war (POW's). All
 were captured in previous years. In the past the number of POW's was limited by
 the guerrilla tactics of the LTTE, the LTTE practice to make every effort to remove
 wounded cadres from the battlefield before they fell prisoner, and the proclivity of
 LTTIE cadres to choose suicide over capture. However, at year's end concern was
 mounting over the army's failure to report new POW's in spite of large offensives
 that resulted in heavy battlefield casualties for the LTrE, a though there were no
 specific reports that POW's had been killed. Some observers were worried that a
 taLke-no-prisoners policy was in effect. The LTTE admits that it kills security force
 personnel rather than take them prisoner. It admits to holding only 22 security
 force prisoners. The L'I'E is believed to have killed most of the police officers and
 security force personnel it has captured in recent years.
 The LITE used excessive force in the war, killing an undetermined number of ci-
 vilians. It was accused of using church and temple compounds (where civilians are
 instructed by the Government to congregate in the event of hostilities) as shields
 for the storage of munitions. In the July attack on the army base at Mullaitivu, the
 TrE killed upwards of 1,500 government troops, reportedl killing even those
 troops who attempted to surrender. During the government offensive on the Jaffna
 Peninsula, LTIE cadre forced some civilians to abandon their homes and retreat
 with them, allegedly as human shields, in the face of advancing government troops.
 The LTTE also reportedly recruited children into its military forces. The bodies of
 dead LTTE insurgents recovered by the Government following a major battle at
 Weli    a in July 1995 were found to be as young as 14 years of age. Reports that
 the LTT was conscripting children were impossib e to verify.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and expression, restrictions are permitted on national security grounds.
 The Government controls the country's largest newspaper chain, two major tele-
 vision stations, and the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. However, there are
 also a variety of independent newspapers, journals, radio, and television stations.
 Independent journalists reported that from the death of United National Party
 (UNP) President Premadasa in 1993 until September 1995 their freedom to report
 openly and critically about the Government had improved markedly. They had been
 able to provide an unimpeded range of views and openly criticize the Government
 and political parties. However, from September to December 1995, and from April
 until October, the Government abridged press freedom. Under the ER, it subjected
 all news relating to the conduct of the war by the armed forces and the police to
 government censorship. Journalists believe that the Government's implementation
 of the censorship regulations was arbitrary and overly broad.
 A number of other government actions during the year were also of concern to
 the media. The Government failed to reform the Press Law and privatize govern-
 ment-owned media as promised during the election campsign. Two defamation of
 character suits stemming from news stories filed by President Kumaratunga in 1995
 against leading editors were still pending. They were viewed by journalists as frivo-
 lous, intended only to harass and intimidate the media. Journalists were also con-
 cerned about the fierce nature of political attacks onhe e local press by leading poli-
 ticians. In August the President charged newspapers with publishing deliberate lies
 and threatened those that published false reports on the war effort with closure.
 In an incident that called the Government's commitment to press freedom into
 question, four Danish journalists were detained under the ER in November. The
 journalists came to Sri Lanka to cover the story of a teenage Tamil girl deported
 from Denmark. According to the Government, their detention was necessary because
 of their close association with the girl, who allegedly had ties to the LTTE. The Gov-
 ernment also claimed that the failed to register with the Department of Informa-
 tion and lied on their airport dsemarkation cards about the purpose of their visit
 to Sri Lanka. After a brief detention, the four were deported. A local journalist was
 also arrested in connection with the incident and was scheduled to appear in court
 in January 1997. On December 31, in another incident, the police arrested Ishini
 Perera, news director of an independent television and radio company, charging her
 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) with broadcasting erroneous news.
 Most journalists regarded the use of the PTA in this matter as heavy handed har-
 assment.
 The Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act stipulates an unlimited fine or up
 to 2 years' imprisonment for anyone who criticizes a Member of Parliament (M.P.).
 
 
 1490
 "Although the Government has not invoked the law since 1992, journalists and civil
 libertarians complain that the act is an unjustified infringement on freedom of the
 press.
 The Government generally respects academic freedom. During 1996 the ER were
 not used, as in the past, to control students.
 The LTTE does not tolerate freedom of expression. It tightly restricts the print
 and broadcast media in areas under its control and has often killed those who op-
 pose it. The LTTE also does not respect academic freedom and has repressed and
 killed intellectuals who criticize it, such as Thiagarajah Selvanithy, a Jaffna poet
 and women's rights activist killed in 1991 for her views. In November 1995, the
 LTI'E kidnaped a university vice chancellor, he was released in January. It has se-
 verely repressed the University Teachers for Human Rights, which was formerly
 basedon the Jaffna Peninsula; most former members of this group have been killed.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice. Although the PTA may re-
 strict such freedoms, the Government did not use the Act for that purpose in 1996.
 The Government generally granted permits for demonstrations, though it banned
 May Day processions. In spite of this ban, the police allowed a political party sup-
 porting the Government to march on May Day, while they broke up an attempted
 procession by an opposition group.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution establishes Buddhism as the official na-
 tional religion, but it also provides for the right of members of other faiths to prac-
 tice their religions freely. The Government respects this right in practice. Foreign
 clergy may work in Sri Lanka, but for more than 30 years the Government has pro-
 hibited the entry of new foreign Jesuit clergy. It permits those already in the coun-
 try to remain.
 Evangelical Christians, who constitute less than 1 percent of the population, have
 expressed concern that their efforts at proselytization are often met with hostility
 and harassment by the local Buddhist clergy and others opposed to their work (see
 Section 5). They sometimes complain that the Government tacitly condones such
 harassment. However, there is no evidence to support this.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, orei  Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution grants every citizen  freedom of movement and of
 choosing his residence" and "freedom to return to Sri Lanka." the Government gen-
 erally respects the right to domestic and foreign travel. However, the war with the
 LiTE prompted the Government to impose more stringent checks on travelers from
 the north and the east and on movement in Colombo, particularly after dark. These
 security measures had the effect of restricting the movement of Tamils, especially
 young males.
 Prior to the government military offensive on the Jaffna Peninsula in 1995 and
 1996, an estimated 600,000 citizens had been displaced by the insurgency. Most live
 in camps financed by the Government and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's).
 The Jaffna offensive, in addition to the military advance on Kilinochchi in the Vanni
 region in July, resulted in the displacement of 480,000 people in LTTE-controlled
 areas of the Vanni. Some lived with friends or relatives, or in "welfare centers" in
 schools, religious institutions, and other public buildings. Many others lived in
 makeshift shelters or camped out under trees. The Government continued to supply
 them with food, medicine, and other essential supplies.
 Prior to 1996, the LTTE severely restricted the movement of Tamils under its con-
 trol, often levying a large "exit tax" on persons wishing to travel to areas under gov-
 ernment control and requiring travelers to leave all their property in escrow. In ad-
 dition, it would usually grant permission to only one family member to travel at a
 time. However, following the Government capture of Jaffna, the LTTE began to
 allow people to move more freely into government-controlled areas. About 16,000
 people are estimated to have moved out of LTTE-controlled regions into Vavuniya
 during the last 3 months of the year. About 6,000 persons moved on to the govern-
 ment-controlled Jaffna Peninsula or returned to the LTTE-controlled Vanni. The re-
 maining 10,000 displaced persons were effectively detained under substandard con-
 ditions in camps inVavumya pending security clearances which had not been grant-
 ed at year's end.
 In response to the military action in the north, upwards of 6,000 refugees are be-
 lieve to have fled LITE-controlled areas to Tamil Nadu in southern India as of Octo-
 ber 1. An estimated 69,000 Tamil refugees were already estimated to live in camps
 there. Another 100,000 refugees are believed to have been integrated into Tamil so-
 ciety in southern India.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The issue of
 the provision of first asylum did not arise in 1996. The Government does not permit
 
 
 1491
 the entry of refugees into the country, nor does it aid those who manage to enter
 to seek permanent residence elsewhere. There were, however, no instances of forc-
 ible repatriation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their Government through peri-
 odic multiparty elections based on universal adult suffrage. This right was last exer-
 cised during parliamentary elections in August 1994, when the People's Alliance
 party ended the 17-year rule of the United National Party, and during the presi-
 dential election in November 1994, when PA presidential candidate Chandrika
 Kumaratunga won 62 percent of the vote. International election monitors judged the
 elections to be free and fair.
 Local elections for municipal, urban, and village councils, which should have been
 held by June under existing legislation, were postponed by the President under the
 ER, at least temporarily denying the people the right to change their local govern-
 ment bodies. The Government cited an adverse security environment. The opposi-
 tion charged that the Government initiated the delay to gain political advantage.
 The elections were rescheduled for 1997.
 In January the Government attempted to dissolve two legally elected provincial
 councils controlled by the opposition UNP, citing mismanagement and malfeasance.
 The opposition claimed that the move was politically motivated and that it denied
 the electorate due process. In March the Court of Appeal overturned the dissolution,
 stating that the Government had not acted in accordance with the law.
 In November the Government announced and set in motion mechanisms to hold
 elections for local government bodies on the Jaffna Peninsula in early 1997.
 The Commissioner of Elections recognizes 26 parties; 9 hold seats in the 225-
 member Parliament. The two most influential parties, the PA and the UNP, gen-
 erally draw their support from the majority Sinhalese community. Historically,
 these two parties have alternated in power. There are 27 Tamil and 21 Muslim
 M.P.'s.
 Although there are no legal impediments to the participation of women in politics
 or government, the social mores in some communities limit women's activities out-
 side the home. In August 1994, voters elected a female prime minister for the third
 time in Sri Lanka's history. In November 1994, for the first time, a woman was
 elected president. Eleven women hold seats in the Parliament. In addition to the
 Prime Minister and the Minister of Transport, Environment, and Women's Affairs,
 four deputy ministers are women.
 The LTTE refuses to allow elections in areas under its control.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In July Parliament passed the Human Rights Commission Act, which created a
 permanent human rights commission. The five-member body is empowered to mon-
 itor government human rights practices, to ensure compliance with constitutional
 fundamental rights provisions, and to investigate complaints of human rights abuse.
 The legislation also provides safeguards for people detained under the PTA and ER,
 and gives the commission the power to monitor the welfare of detainees. Although
 the legislation was passed, the commission had not yet been established by year's
 end.
 The Cabinet ratified the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil
 and Political Rights in September. The Protocol provides for the right of individual
 petition and permits individuals to submit complaints about governmental violations
 of Sri Lankan obligations under the Covenant, i.e., any citizen of Sri Lanka has the
 right to petition individually to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in the
 event that he or she has been the victim of human rights violations as set out in
 the Covenant, and has not received justice. As a party to the Optional Protocol, Sri
 Lanka is obliged to recognize the competence of the Committee to receive and adju-
 dicate such petitions.
 There are several local human rights groups, including the Movement for Inter-
 racial Justice and Equality (MIJE), the University Teachers for Human Rights,
 the Civil Rights Movement (CRM), and the Law and Society Trust (LST), which
 monitor civil and political liberties. There are no adverse government regulations
 governing the activities of local and foreign NGO's.
 The Government continued to allow the ICRC unrestricted access to detention fa-
 cilities. The ICRC provided human rights training materials and training to the se-
 curity forces. The UNHCR, ICRC, and a variety of international NGO's assisted in
 the delivery of food, medical, and other essential supplies to the northern war zone.
 
 
 1492
 
 However, following the capture of the Jaffna Peninsula in April, the army seriously
 restricted the movement of supplies by international organizations and NGO's to
 LTTE-controlled areas. Restricted supplies include materials the LTTE might use
 in its war effort, such as surgical supplies and antibiotics, building and shelter ma-
 terials, well-drilling and water purification equipment, diesel fuel and gasoline.
 There have also been serious delays in approving the movement of many other med-
 ical supplies into LITE-controlled areas.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution guarantees equal rights under the law for all people in Sri
 Lanka. The Government generally respects these rights. The Supreme Court regu-
 larly upholds court rulings in cases in which individuals file suit over the
 abridgement of their fundamental civil rights.
 Women.-Sexual assault, rape, and spousal abuse (often associated with alcohol)
 represent serious and pervasive forms of societal violence against women. However,
 new amendments to the Penal Code were introduced in 1995 that specifically ad-
 dressed sexual abuse and exploitation. Rape laws were modified to create a more
 equitable burden of proof and to make punishments more stringent. Marital rape
 is now considered an offense in cases of spouses living under judicial separation,
 and new laws govern sexual harassment in the workplace and sexual molestation.
 While the new Penal Code may ease some of the problems faced by victims of sexual
 assault, many women's organizations believe that greater sensitization of police and
 judicial officials are also required. Laws against procuring and trafficking were
 strengthened in 1995, facilitating the prosecution of brothel owners. Police statistics
 indicated that there were 31,241 crimes against women during the period from Jan-
 uary to June, compared with 24,766 crimes during the same period in 1995.
 The Constitution provides for equal employment opportunities in the public sec-
 tor, but women have no legal protection against discrimination in the private sector,
 where they are sometimes paid less than men for equal work and often face dif-
 ficulty in rising to supervisory positions. Women constitute approximately one-half
 of the formal work force.
 Women have equal rights under national civil and criminal law. However, issues
 related to family law, including divorce, child custody, and inheritance, are adju-
 dicated by the customary law of each ethnic or religious group. In 1995 the Govern-
 ment raised the minimum age of marriage for women from 12 to 18 years, except
 in the case of Muslims, who continue to follow their customary marriage practices.
 The application of different legal practices based on membership in a religious or
 ethnic group often results in discrimination against women.
 During massacres of civilians in the east in October 1995, the LTTE raped a num-
 ber of the victims. This marked the first time in the ethnic conflict that the LTTE
 deliberately used rape as a weapon of terror. However, such abuses was not re-
 ported in 1996.
 Children.-The Government is committed to protecting the welfare and rights of
 children but is constrained by lack of resources.
 The Government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's rights and wel-
 fare through its widespread systems of public education and medical care. Education
 is compulsory to the age of 12 and free through university. Health care, including
 immunization programs, is also free.
 There is a significant problem of child prostitution in certain coastal resort areas.
 The Government estimates that there are more than 2,000 active child prostitutes
 in the country, but private groups claim that the number is much higher. Many of
 these prostitutes are boys who sell themselves to foreign tourists. The Penal Code
 was amended to strengthen punishments for trafficking of persons. In 1995 the Min-
 istry of Media, Tourism, and Aviation created a task force specifically to study the
 problem of sex tourism and related offenses, but no new legislation has resulted.
 During the first half of 1996, police recorded a total of 3,687 crimes (of all types)
 against children, an increase from 1,997 crimes in the first half of 1995. NGO's at-
 tribute the problem of exploitation of children to the lack of law enforcement rather
 than inadequate legislation.
 Upwards of 20,600 children are known to be fully employed. Additional thousands
 of children are believed to be working in domestic service. There have been reports
 that rural children working as domestic servants in urban households-often given
 into service by poverty stricken parents--have been abused by their employers.
 Some of these children have reportedly been starved, beaten, sexually abused, and
 forced into prostitution. The Government does not have sufficient resources to pro-
 tect these children from such exploitation (see Section 6.d.).
 
 
 1493
 
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not mandate accessibility to buildings or
 government services for people with disabilities. The World Health Organization es-
 timates that 7 percent of the population is disabled. Most disabled people who are
 unable to work are cared for by their families. The Department of Social Services
 runs eight vocational training schools for the physically and mentally disabled and
 sponsors a program of job training and job placement for graduates. The Govern-
 ment provides some financial support to NGO's assisting the disabled, subsidizes
 prosthetic devices and other medical aids for the disabled, makes some purchases
 from disabled suppliers, and has registered 74 schools and training institutions for
 the disabled run by NGO's. In December an act of Parliament was passed forbidding
 discrimination against any person on the grounds of his or her disability.
 Indigenous People.-The indigenous people of Sri Lanka, known as Veddas, num-
 ber less than a thousand. They prefer to maintain their isolated traditional way of
 life and are protected by the Constitution. There are no legal restrictions on their
 participation in the political or economic life of the nation.However, some Veddas
 complain that they are being forced off their traditional land and not allowed to live
 according to their own culture and traditions. For the first time in 1996, Veddas
 were allowed by the Government to participate in the U.N. Working Group on Indig-
 enous People in Geneva, where they were able to air their grievances.
 Religious Minorities.-Discrimination based on religious differences is much less
 common than discrimination based on ethnic group or caste. In general, the mem-
 bers of the various faiths tend to be tolerant of each other's religious beliefs. How-
 ever, evangelical Christians have, on occasion, been harassed by Buddhist monks for
 their attempts to convert Buddhists to Christianity (see Section 2.c.).
 In the northern part of the island, LTTE insurgents expelled some 46,000 Muslim
 inhabitants from their homes in 1990-virtually the entire Muslim population. The
 LTTE has expropriated Muslim homes, lands, and businesses and threatened Mus-
 lim families with death if they attempt to return.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There are approximately 1 million Tamils of
 comparatively recent Indian origin living in Sri Lanka. Abeut 85,000 of these people
 do not qualify for either Indian or Sri Lanan citizenship and face discrimination,
 especially in the allocation of government funds for education. Without national
 identity cards, they are vulnerable to arrest by the security forces. However, the
 Government has stated that none of these people will be forced to depart the coun-
 try.
 Tamils maintain that they have long been the victims of systematic discrimina-
 tion in university education, government employment, and in other matters con-
 trolled by the Government. However, in recent years there has been little clear evi-
 dence of overt discrimination in university enrollment or government employment,
 although some groups continue to assert that it exists.
 In January the Government established a parliamentary select committee to con-
 sider a "devolution" package originally proposed in August 1995, which is designed
 to devolve wid-ranging powers to local governments, thereby providing ethnic mi-
 norities greater autonomy in governing their local affairs. The devolution proposals
 were still being debated at year's end.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associction.-The Government respects the constitutional right of
 workers to establish labor unions. Any seven workers may form a union, adopt a
 charter, elect leaders, and publicize their views. About 75 percent cf the plantation
 work force is unionized. Approximately 50 to 60 percent of the nonagricultural work
 force (about 25 to 30 percent of the total work force) is also unionized, Moat workers
 in large private firms are represented by unions, but those in small-scale agriculture
 and smal businesses usually donot belong to unions.
 Most large unions are affiliated with political parties and together play a promi-
 nent role in the political process. More than 30 labor unions have political affili-
 ations, but there are also a small number of unaffiliated unions.
 The Department of Labor registered 96 new unions and canceled the registration
 of 12 others. The Department of Labor is authorized by law to cancel the registra-
 tion of any union that does not submit an annual report. That requirement is the
 only legal grounds for cancellation of registration.
 All workers, other than civil servants and workers in "essential" services, have
 the right to strike. By law, workers may also lodge complaints with the Commis-
 sioner of Labor, a labor tribunal, or the Supreme Court to protect their rights. Be-
 fore September 1994, the Government controlled strikes by declaring some indus-
 tries to be essential under the ER. Subsequently, this practice largely ceased. How-
 ever, the President retains the power to designate any industry as an essential serv-
 ice. ihe International Labor Organization (ILO) has pointed out to the Government
 
 
 1494
 
 that essential services should be limited to services where an interruption would en-
 danger the life, personal safety, or health of the population.
 Civil servants may collectively submit labor grievances to the Public Service Com-
 mission but have no legal grounds to strike. Nonetheless, government workers in
 the transportation, telecommunication, and ports sectors have staged brief strikes
 and other work actions in past years. In May government power sector workers
 walked out. The President declared the government-run pwer sector to be an essen-
 tial service and ordered the workers back to work to end a 3-day nationwide power
 outage. During 1996 there were 187 strikes.
 The law prohibits retribution against strikers in nonessential sectors. Employers
 may dismiss workers only for insubordination. Incompetence or low productivity are
 not grounds for dismissal.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international bodies and many of them have done
 SO.
 In September 1995 the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training released a
 "workers' charter" designed to provide a basis for legislation to strengthen worker
 rights. The proposed charter consolidates existing labor legislation and reaffirms the
 rights of workers to organize and bargain collectively. It also proposes new amend-
 ments to the Labor Law that would guarantee the right of workers to join unions,
 ensure that employers recognize and bargain with unions, establish a national
 wages commission to review minimum wages in all industries, ensure that all work-
 ers are covered under relevant labor laws, and establish a social security scheme.
 It is opposed by business leaders, largely because of the provisions that compel man-
 agement to recognize all unions, collect union dues, and pay above-market wages.
 The charter had not become law by year's end.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to collective baainng, and it is widely practiced. Large firms may have employees
 in as man  as    different unions. In enterprises that do not have unions, including
 those in the Export Processing Zones (EPZ's), work councils--composed of employ-
 ees, employers, and often a public sector representative-are often the forums for
 labor/management negotiation. However, the councils are not mandatory outside the
 EPZ's and do not have the power to negotiate binding contracts.
 The law currently does not require management to recognize or bargain with
 unions, and in some cases, employers have declined to recogmze the unions in their
 factories. However, the law prohibits antiunion discrimination. Employers found
 guilty of such discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activi-
 ties but have the right to transfer them to different locations.
 There are 95,464 workers employed in the EPZ's. Under the law, workers in the
 EPZ's have the same rights to join unions as other workers. However, few if any
 unions have been formed, in part because employers in the EPZ's offer higher wages
 and better working conditions. In the past, there have been allegations that the
 Government's Board of Investment (BOI), which manages the EPZ's, has discour-
 aged union activity. Work councils in the EPZ's are chaired by the BOI and consist
 of equal delegations from labor and management.
 In most instances, wage boards establish minimum wages and conditions of em-
 ployment, except in the EPZ's, where wages and work conditions are set by the BOI.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and is almost nonexistent. However, according to some reports, a few
 rural children are employed in debt bondage as domestic servants in urban house-
 holds. The Government does not have sufficient resources to protect these children
 from such exploitation.
 The LTI'E continues to conscript high-school age children for work as cooks, mes-
 sengers, and clerks, and in some cases, building fortifications. Children as young as
 10 are said to be recruited and placed for 2 to 4 years in special schools that provide
 them with a mixture of LTTE ideology and formal education.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 15 years of age. However, the law permits the employment of younger children
 by their parents or guardians in limited agricultural work. It also permits employ-
 ment in any school or institution for training purposes.
 Persons under the age of 16 may not be employed in any public enterprise in
 which life or limb is endangered. Children are not employed in the EPZ's, the plan-
 tations, the garment industry, or any other export industry. About 85 percent of
 children below the age of 16 attend school. The law provides that the employment
 of such persons is permitted for not more than 1 hour on any day before school.
 Despite legislation, some child labor still exists. A 1995 labor department survey
 found that 20,600 children between the ages of 10 and 14 were fully employed. This
 included 13,700 males and 6,900 females. Additional thousands of children were be-
 lieved to be employed in domestic service, though this situation was undocumented.
 
 
 1495
 A significant portion of employed children work outside their families. In addition
 to domestic service, regular employment of children occurs mainly in the informal
 sector and in family enterprises such as family farms, crafts, small trade establish-
 ments, eating houses, and repair shops. Children are also involved in the manufac-
 ture of coconut fiber products, fishing, wrapping tobacco, street trading, domestic
 service, and farming. Government inspections have been unable to eliminate these
 forms of child labor(see Section 5.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Department of Labor effectively enforces
 the minimum wage law. While there is no universal national minimum wage, some
 38 wage boards set minimum wages and working conditions by sector and industry.
 According to the Statistics Department of the Labor Ministry, current minimum
 wage rates average $36 (2,000 rupees) per month in industry, commerce, and the
 service sector, and $1.40 (75 rupees) per day in agriculture. The minimum wage in
 the garment industry is $36 (2,000 rupees) per month. These minimum wages are
 insufficient to support a worker and the standard family of five, but the vast major-
 ity of families have more than one breadwinner.
 Most permanent full-time workers are covered by laws that prohibit them from
 working regularly more than 45 hours per week (a 5  day workweek). Such work-
 ers also receive 14 days of annual leave, 14 to 21 days of medical leave, and some
 20 local holidays each year. Maternity leave is available for permanent and casual
 female workers. Employers must contribute 12 percent of a worker's wage to an em-
 ployee's provident fund and 3 percent to an employee's trust fund. Employers who
 fal to corply may be fined.
 Several laws protect the safety and health of industrial workers. However, the De-
 partment of Labor's small staff of inspectors is inadequate to enforce compliance
 with the laws. Workers have the statutory right to remove themselves from situa-
 tions that endanger their health, but many workers are unaware of, or indifferent
 to, health risks, and fear that they will lose their jobs if they remove themselves.
