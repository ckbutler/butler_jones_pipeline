 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The climate for civil and political rights in 1981 was
 dominated by the strong "law and order" measures
 enacted by the government of President Chun. In
 preparation for lifting martial law in January 1981,
 the legislature enacted 189 laws that profoundly
 affected the political system. Election laws and
 procedures were promulgated, sharply limiting political
 organizing and campaigning. Other laws established
 strict government control over the press, public
 assembly and demonstrations, and labor organizations.
 The security services were reorganized, and the police
 and security agencies were given power to suppress
 social and civil disturbances that the government
 believed could endanger national security.
 Under the new rules, political parties were permitted
 to organize and campaign to choose a presidential
 electoral college on February 11, and a new national
 assembly on March 25. International observers believe
 the elections were fair, but with other potential
 leading candidates barred from the race and 567
 former politicians prohibited from any political
 activity for eight years, the election of President
 Chun and the pro-government Democratic Justice Party
 was never in doubt.
 South Korea faces a hostile North Korea. Only an
 unstable truce has existed since the end of open
 hostilities in 1953. Concern that North Korea could
 attack again if the Republic seemed vulnerable has led
 to heavy emphasis on the maintenance of security and
 domestic political stability, and a primary goal of
 Koreans is to remain strong and united in the face of
 the North Korean threat. Successive governments have
 sometimes exploited the threat for their own purposes;
 however, the leadership has maintained that special
 circumstances require acceptance of some limits on
 individual freedom.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The constitution states that no citizen shall be tortured
 or compelled to testify against himself. Confessions
 determined to have been made involuntarily, under
 torture, intimidation or similar means,..cannot be
 admitted in evidence, and a confession cannot be used
 for conviction if it is the only evidence aganst the
 defendant.
 There were numerous allegations of torture in 1981, but
 detainees about to be released were routinely required
 to sign a statement that they had not been tortured
 during their incarceration; thus, reports of torture
 are difficult to confirm or dismiss. One incident
 involved two editors of a Seoul newspaper who were
 arrested and tortured for printing material considered
 critical of President Chun. In another case, the 660-
 member Seoul United Bar Association in October protested
 the police torture of a suspect in the murder of a
 college coed. The suspect was held for two weeks and
 released without being charged because of lack of
 evidence.

 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prison conditions in the Republic of Korea are apartan,
 and discipline is strict. The International Committee
 of the Red Cross has not had access to prisons. The
 government does not allow interviews with prisoners
 except by their legal counsel and immediate family
 members, and has on some occasions blocked access to
 persons under house arrest. Adequate medical attention
 has sometimes been denied and visitation rights for
 political prisoners are sometimes denied or limited to
 periods as short as ten minutes per month. There were
 no summary executions in 1981 or in other recent years.
 c.   Disappearances
 Except for periods of detention prior to the filing of
 formal charges (see the section below on arbitrary
 arrest), there is no evidence of abduction, secret
 arrest or clandestine detention.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution includes elements of hAbeas corpus laws
 providing the right of prompt legal assistance and the
 right to court review of an arrest. These protections
 may be suspended in grave, extraordinary circumstances,
 as defined by the government.
 It is usual Korean police practice to detain suspects
 for several days, or longer in sensitive political
 cases, without informing the detainees' families of
 their detention or whereabouts. Once charges are formally
 filed, families are notified and are permitted to visit
 prisoners. Reliable statistics are not available, but
 sources generally agree that the number of persons
 detained without charge for short periods and then
 either released or formally charged has decreased in
 1981 compared to 1980.
 Government spokesmen acknowledge that 1,572 persons, who
 were apparently arrested in 1980 as part of a "purification
 campaign," are still being held under provisions of the
 Preventive Detention Law. This law, passed in December
 1980, allows "hooligans" deemed by special government
 committee as dangerous to society to be detained for
 periods of up to ten years for rehabilitation.
 Since January, when martial law was lifted, the government
 has granted several amnesties which have freed or reduced
 the sentences of more than 6,000 prisoners, including
 some individuals connected with opposition party politician
 Kim Dae Jung and with the Kwangju turmoil of May 1980.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Civil and criminal trials are public; those involving
 charges of a political nature are usually open to
 families only. The constitution permits the closing of
 trials for "justifiable reasons.- The constitution
 protects in theory many rights of the defendants: the
 right against self-incrimination, ex post facto laws,
 protection against double jeopardy; the right to a
 speedy trial, the presumption of innocence, and the
 right to counsel. Defendants in politically sensitive
 cases have had difficulty in obtaining adequate counsel;
 whether because of government pressure or reluctance on
 the part of counselors to accept such cases is unclear.
 Defendants have the right to appeal their convictions up
 to the supreme court. At the direction of the
 
 
 628
 president, on January 22, 1981, the cabinet examined the
 case against Kim Dae Jung and subsequently commuted his
 death sentence to life imprisonment and reduced the
 sentences of his co-defendants.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 The constitution requires that a warrant be issued by a
 judge upon request of a prosecutor prior to search and
 seizure in a residence. Under martial law, search and
 seizure were permitted without warrant, and in fact did
 occur.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press, religion, and assembly are
 guaranteed under the constitution. With the exception
 of religion, all continue to be circumscribed severely.
 Korea's traditionally controlled press remained tightly
 controlled in 1981. The government withdrew its
 subsidy of the Christian Broadcasting Service because
 of critical news commentary, and the service is in
 serious economic trouble due to a government ban on
 revenue from outside advertising. Of the two remaining
 news networks, the government owns one and holds
 majority ownership in the other. Detailed press
 guidelines have replaced prior censorship. Specified
 political matters, certain institutions and foreign
 policies are not to be criticized; criticism of other
 (specified) issues is permitted. The ministry of
 culture and information may stop publication or broad-
 casting of information deemed to endanger national
 security or for other justifiable reasons. Incidents
 of intimidation of reporters and publishers were
 reported in 1981, including the July arrest and inter-
 rogation for 12 hours of four employees of a leading
 daily newspaper. The managing editors of other news-
 papers were pointedly informed of the arrests by the
 ministry of culture and information.
 The government has permitted some reporting critical of
 the government, notably opposition politicians' campaign
 speeches and interpellations of government ministers in
 the national assembly.
 In contrast to the tight control of domestic. media,
 controls on foreign journalists in Korea have been
 relaxed. It is now rare that foreign publications are
 censored. Moreover, several Japanese news agencies
 have been permitted to reopen offices in Korea this
 year after being expelled in 1980.
 The law on assemblies and demonstrations is strict.
 Penalties against those who plan or instigate assemblies
 or demonstrations deemed by the government as likely to
 undermine public order or cause social unrest are up to
 a maximum seven years in prison and three million won
 fine. Those hampering peaceful assemblies may be
 sentenced to a maximum ten years in prison. The law
 permits police to enter areas and buildings where
 illegal gatherings are taking place and expands the
 police role in intervening in outdoor gatherings.
 Police broke up a number of small campus demonstrations
 in 1981. As has happened in past years, there were a
 number of incidents caused by North Korean infiltrators
 and agents,-msinly near the Demilitarized Zone. At
 least one resulted in Injuries.
 
 
 629
 Labor union rights are severely abridged. Bargaining in
 confined to individual enterprise level, local enterprise
 unions are not permitted to receive outside aid or ..
 advice even from their national union, and negotiated
 union shop provisions in contracts have been ended.
 Other provisions on union leadership and control of
 union finances have further weakened independent union
 strength. Collective action and strikes are not
 permitted. Unions in industries, public utilities or
 enterprises which have a serious impact on the national
 economy are denied freedom of independent association.
 Union membership reportedly declined about 12 percent
 in the first six months of 1981.
 There is no state or state-favored religion in Korea,
 and traditional religious activities by all faiths take
 place without government interference. Foreign missionary
 activity is extensive--there are some 900 American
 missionaries in Korea--and proselytizing is not restricted.
 Programs of religious organizations which have a direct
 impact on the social or political life of Korea have
 aroused government suspicion. Some organizations
 involved in such activities have experienced surveillance,
 harassment, and occasional arrests of members. Nevertheless,
 some socio-political activities of Christian churches
 continue to be allowed.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within the country and a
 liberal emigration policy. There are some restrictions
 on foreign travel, essentially for balance of payments
 reasons, but these controls were somewhat relaxed in
 August 1981. While, in general, the new passport
 regulations do not apply to politically suspect citizens
 whose foreign travel is curtailed, in at least three
 cases politically suspect individuals were granted
 passports. In addition, many Korean expatriates, who
 for years have been denied permission to return to
 their homeland because of opposition activities, are
 once again allowed to enter and remain in the country.
 Over 600 Vietnamese boat refugees have arrived in Korea
 since 1977. Most of those who arrived before 1981 have
 been resettled abroad. Refugees awaiting resettlement
 live in a camp in Pusan; they may not settle in Korea
 permanently. They are cared for through the Korean Red
 Cross. The time between arrival of refugees in Korea
 and their resettlement abroad has ranged between 6
 months and two years.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Under martial law, 11 existing political parties were
 dissolved and 567 persons were banned from political
 activities for eight years. The government encouraged
 formation of new parties for the national assembly
 elections held in March. About twenty parties were
 formed, of which eight survived. The government can
 dissolve any political party it deems contrary to
 "basic democratic order." The 'electoral laws place
 severe temporal and fiscal limits on campaigning,
 making it difficult for opposition parties to publicize
 their candidates and present their programs. The new
 law established a proportional representative system
 that reserves 92 seats for proportional representation,
 of which two-thirds go to the party that gains a plurality.
 The elections on March 25 were reported to be largely
 free of voting irregularities, and 78 percent of the
 eligible voters participated. The government party won
 90 of the 92 seats it contested and, because of the
 proportional representation system (outlined above),
 
 
 630
 has a comfortable national Assembly majority of 151 out of
 276 seats. Non-goverm1ent parties and independents
 divided the remAining 125 seats of which 94 were won by
 direct ballot And 31 through the proportional "bonus"
 system. Opposition politicians were permitted to speak
 against the government in the national assembly (but
 not against the president}.'
 Two minorities suffer from lack of citizenship. There
 are about 400 Vietnamesq in Korea, unrelated to the
 boat people, mostly ex-wives and children of Korean
 servicemen who served in Vietnam. The lack of family
 ties, of language and job skills, and of Korean citizen-
 ship, make their existence precarious. The Korean
 Government takes no official cognizance of them.
 The larger group consists of a thousand or more Amer-
 asian children of American servicemen. Many do not
 have Korean citizenship, and even those who do have
 often experience difficulties with education, marriage,
 and employment. Foreign charitable organizations and
 the government provide limited assistance to the
 Amerasians.
 The status of women has improved considerably in recent
 years, and the 1980 constitution calls for marriage and
 family life "on the basis of individual dignity and
 equality of the sexes." Women still frequently receive
 lower wages than men for equal work, and their career
 opportunities, though improving, are more limited.
 Women have access to the educational system at all
 levels; laws on compulsory education are the same for
 both sexes.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The government is inhospitable to non-government involve-
 ment in the human rights area. It tolerates the existence
 of domestic human rights groups but closely restricts
 their operations. There were no formal government-
 sanctioned investigations into human rights in 1981.
 Though not a member of the United Nations, however, the
 government has cooperated with the UN Human Rights
 CoMnission's consideration of human rights problems in
 Korea under the confidential 1503 procedures. Individual
 foreign religious leaders in Korea-who have involved
 themselves in human rights problems have encountered
 difficulties with government authorities. Major religious
 orders and churches have generally avoided systematic
 involvement in human rights causes. Visiting foreigners
 with a professed interest in human rights, including
 clergymen and U.S. congressmen, have been able to meet
 with local human rights activists and also with senior
 government officials, including the president. The
 Korean Government is not active in regional human rights
 organizations other than those concerned with refugees
 in Southeast Asia. According to the 1981 Amnesty Inter-
 national report, on March 2, 1981, Amnesty International
 launched "a worldwide campaign to publicize its concerns
 in the Republic of Korea and to persuade the authorities
 to stop using political imprisonment, torture, unfair
 trial and the death penalty." These concerns were
 described in Republic of Korea:: Violations of Human
 Rights, an Amnesty International Report publ-ished at the
 beginning of the campaign.

 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Korea has a mixed economy with extensive government
 intervention to stimulate 'the free market system.
 Economic and social development during the last two
 decades has been remarkable. President Chun has
 pledged to continue the rapid increase in the national
 standard of living during his administration to achieve
 the goal of a "welfare state" in which basic food
 supplies, health care, education, and shelter are
 assured to all. Korea has relatively little arable
 land, few natural resources, and a large population of
 37.2 million in 1980, yet per capita GNP increased from
 180 U.S. dollars in 1960 to 410 U.S. dollars in 1970
 and 1,480 U.S. dollars in 1979, according to World Bank
 data.
 Population growth rate increased from 2.1 in 1961 to
 2.7 in 1970 but decreased to 1.9 in 1979. Improving
 health services and-nutrition have contributed to
 increasing life expectancy at birth from age 54.2 in
 1960 to age 63.4 in 1979 while infant mortality declined
 during the same years from 62 to 37 deaths per 1,000
 live births.
 Access to safe drinking water has increased dramatically
 in recent years. In 1960, only 12 percent of the
 population had access to safe water. By 1979, the
 national percentage was 71 percent, of which 85 percent
 of urban inhabitants and 54.9 percent of rural inhabitants
 enjoyed safe water. During the same years the caloric
 intake increased from 94 percent to 119 percent as a
 percentage of minimum nutritional requirements.
 Education receives a high priority in government
 policy. The adult literacy rate has increased from
 70.6 percent in 1960 to 93 percent in 1979. Primary.
 school education is universal for both males and
 females, and government statistics indicate that 91
 percent of elementary students entered secondary
 schools in 1979. Entrance to institutions of higher
 education is very competitive, and only about 50 percent
 of those who wish to attend are able to enter. There
 is easy social mobility based on the merit principle in
 education and employment. There is no national unem-
 ployment insurance or pension plan.
 The constitution states that all citizens shall be
 equal before the law and that there will be no discrim-
 ination in political, economic, civic or cultural life
 on account of sex, religion or social status. In spite
 of these legal guarantees and general freedom for
 Korean women to work in all professions and occupations,
 women do not have full.equality. While more women have
 entered the work force in recent years, increasing from
 566,000 women workers in manufacturing industries in
 1971 to 1,398,000 in 1979, the average monthly salary
 for women workers in 1979 was only 42.3 percent of that
 received by male workers. Inheritance laws discriminate
 in favor of male children.
