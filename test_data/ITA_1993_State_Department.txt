 ITkLY
 Italy is a democratic, multiparty republic with a parliamentary system of govern-
 ment. Legislative power is vested in the Parliament, which is directly and freely
 elected on the basis of universal adult suffrage. Executive authority is vested in the
 Council of Ministers, headed by the President of the Council (the Prime Minister).
 Italy's judiciary is independent of the executive although subject to occasional politi-
 cal party interference.
 Terrorist violence of both the left and the right remained at low levels, though
 organized crime elements continued to use terrorist tactics. Bomb attacks in May
 and July in Florence, Milan, and Rome, which appeared to be aimed more at sym-
 bols of Italian culture than at people, killed a .otal of 10 persons. At year's end one
 official of the disbanded Italian Intelligence Service SISDE was under arrest along
 with three others in connection with bombing attempts.
 Starting in 1992-with the beginning of nationwide judicial investigations into
 kickbacks and corruption over public contracts and "he concomitant weakering of
 the traditional political parties--the judiciary has been under less political party
 pressure than in the past. However, human rights groups and others criticized the
 extensive use of preventive detention for persons accused of corruption.
 Italy has an industrialized market economy. Although heavy government owner-
 rhip of the primary industrial sectors persists, the Government and Parliament
 have moved forward on privatization, now well underway. In 1993 econom'c growth
 was slightly negative, with unemployment at over 11 percent, though irflation was
 held to less than 5 percent. Once dynamic small and medium-sized firms were seri-
 ously hit by economic recession.
 Worker rights are generally respected and the Government openly addresses
 human rights issues which a~ise. The Government consisteantly condemned sporadic
 acts of violence and discrimination aimed at ethnic or religious minorities. Italy con-
 tinued to experience a substantial influx of third-world and eastern European immi-
 grants; public attention continued to focus on the problem of racism.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Neither government forces nor legal
 opposition organizations engaged in politically motivated killings. However, in Sep-
 tember a 10-year-old Gypsy' was killed in a carabinieri station shortly after his ar-
 rest, reportedly as a result of a scuffle over an officer's weapon. An investigation
 was launched but no conclusion had been announced by year's end. In March an
 Iranian opposition leader was shot dead in Rome. No assailants had been arrested
 for this offense at year's end.
 An official of SISDE, along with three accomplices, two of whom are from orga-
 nized crime families, were arrested on the charge of placing a fake bomb on a train;
 government authorities are examining possible links with other bombing attempts.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no cases of politically motivated disappearances or
 kidnapings.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Freedom from torture is provided for by law and respected in practice. Cruel and
 degrading punishment is forbidden by law. There were credible reports, however
 that detainees and prisoners were abused during police interrogation in several
 cases. The most common forms of alleged ill-treatment were repeated kicks and
 punches and prolonged beatings with batons. There were also complaints of severe
 overcrowding, poor sanitation, and inadequate medical assistance. A May 1993 re-
 port by Amnesty International (AI) denounced an increase in alleged ill-treatment
 of prisoners by prison guards, noting that "sharply deteriorating living conditions
 and increased detention in jails also may have played a role. According to Al, the
 Government replied to only one of its requests for an inquiry into the alleged mal-
 treatment. In its reply, the Government denied there had been any ill-treatment of
 prisoners and noted that there might have been "misunderstandings" over the "spe-
 cial treatment" of and the "severe restrictions" for Mafia-related convicts.
 Those perpetrating ill-treatment of detainees and prisoners rarely have been the
 object of disciplinary proceedings.
 On December 15, 1992, a group of lawyers presented a report to the Naples Public
 Prosecutor about allegations of "systematic beatings and gratuitous ill-treatment"
 being inflicted on inmates of Secondigliano Prison by prison guards and requested
 an immediate judicial inquiry. The Deputy Public Prosecutor led a judicial inquiry
 which included a nighttime visit to the prison on January 28, during which a num-
 ber of prisoners bearing signs of physical injury were reportedly seen. On February
 18, the Parliamentary Committee for Prison Affairs conducted a visit of inspection
 of the prison. On April 26, the commandant of the prison guards at the prison and
 five superintendents were suspended from duty for a preliminary period of 2 months
 in connection with possible criminal charges, including abusing their authority,
 striking prisoners, and giving false testimony. The commandant was suspected of
 having instigated the beating of inmates by prison guards and of opening the pris-
 oners' outgoing mail and threatening them with further violence if they failed to re-
 move passages referring to their alleged ill-treatment. The charges were ultimately
 dropped. At the end of April, an additional 60 to 70 guards were reportedly under
 judicial investigation in connection with the ill-treatment of prisoners. Here, too, the
 charges were dropped. On November 16, the director of a jail in the northern city
 of Pavia was suspended from duty and committed to trial on charges of having
 placed in isolation a detainee for whom a medical doctor had instead recommended
 hospitalization. His trial is scheduled for mid-January.
 At the end of August, the jail population reached 52,320 persons, more than a 10-
 percent increase over 1992 and approximately a 100-percent increase over 1991. The
 increase was due partly to more efficacious police operations and partly to the slow-
 ness of the Italian judicial system. The capacity of penal facilities, however, has re-
 mained the same. Some prisons had populations double or triple their capacity. Ac-
 cording to the Justice Ministry, from January through October, 49 inmates commit-
 ted suicide, compared to a total of 47 suicides in 1992 and 29 in 1991. Protests
 against overcrowding sparked hunger strikes in jails nationwide in May, July, and
 November.
 In August the Government passed legislation aimed at reducing the jail popu-
 lation by making it easier for certain categories of offenders to receive house arrests
 or other alternative sentences. Also in August, the Government dedicated approxi-
 mately $90 million at the then prevailing exchange rate (150 billion lira) to complete
 the building of new jails. Authorities are in the process of separating less serious
 offenders from other prisoners in existing facilities. Felony offenders and high-risk
 prisoners such as Mafiosi are held in high-security wings of regular jails. The Gov-
 ernment permits independent monitoring of prison conditions, under the supervision
 
 
 928
 of jail directors, by parliamentarians, local human rights groups, the media, and
 other organizations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Police procedures are controlled by law
 and judicial oversight. Arbitrary arrest is not practiced. Anyone detained by the au-
 thorities must be charged within 48 hours, except for Mafia-related suspects who
 may be charged "as soon as possible." Italy does not have a system of bail. Judges
 may grant provisional liberty to persons awaiting trial; this occurs frequently. The
 law imposes broad time limits on pretrial investigative or preventive detention,
 which includes detention in connection with one specific offense prior to the conclu-
 sion of all appeals. Preventive detention is implemented to prevent a suspect from
 fleeing or destroying evidence while authorities investigate and is not permitted for
 minor offenses .In normal criminal cases, the maximum permissible duration of pre-
 ventive or investigative detention is 4 ye.rs, with no more that 2 years at each step
 of the trial during the apeals process. The Government moved to extend the total
 period to 6 years for de endants accused of Mafia-related crimes. Preventive deten-
 tion is sometimes longer than the penalty for the crime; restitution for unjust deten-
 tion is provided for in the Constitution and in law.
 In practice, pretrial detention is extended when the accused, already being held
 without bail on specific charges, is charged with additional offenses. This has often
 been the case during judiciary proceedings connected to kickbacks and corruption
 over government contrscts (widely known as "clean hands" proceedings), which
 started in Milan in February 1992 and have since spread throughout the country.
 Politicians of all parties as well as officials of private and public companies have
 been implicated.
 Each offense with which "clean hands' defendants are charged allows a maximum
 preventive custody of 3 months. Since most of the defendants are charged with more
 than one offense, some have remained in jail for longer than 3 months. In early
 1993, the Italian League of Human Rights published a warning by a French human
 rights expert regarding the potential for abuse of this provision. In July, following
 the suicide of a "clean hands" detainee there was considerable public criticism,
 though not from human rights groups of the extensive use of preventive detention
 for t ose accused of such offenses. On becember 1, Parliament voted to ask the Gov-
 ernment to revise the law on preventive custody to avoid accumulation of charges
 against defendants and the consequent extension of the terms of pretrial custody.
 This revision had not been implemented at year's end.
 According to official figures of the Justice Department, defendants awaiting trial
 comprise 50 percent of the total jail population; those awaiting their first trial com-
 prise 29 percent of the total jail population. Because of chronic understaffing in the
 judiciary, police, and clerical tf and lack of office space, equipment, and training
 courses, the average waiting period for trials is about 18 months but can exceed 24
 months. Thus, despite the judiciary's efforts to extend the periods of preventive cus-
 tody in order to keep a prisoner in jail until the beginning of the trial, many defend-
 ants are released before the proceedings start.
 Arrest warrants are issued by investigating judges. People h.ld in detention are
 allowed prompt and regular access to lawyers of their choosing. If detainees are in-
 digent a lawyer is provided by the State. Normally, people held in detention are
 also allowed prompt and regular access to family members. However, defendants
 charged with more serious offenses, including Mafia-related crimes, are allowed reg-
 ular.but limited contacts with their families. As a safeguard against possible abuses
 involving unjustified detention, "liberty tribunals" are empowered to review avail-
 able evidence in cases of persons awaiting trial and to decide whether continued de-
 tention is warranted. Judges in "liberty tribunals" are drawn from the normal court-
 houses but only review cases involving the detention of prisoners.
 Exile abroad as a form of punishment is not practiced. In July Parliament passed
 a bill that negates the possibility of domestic exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-A fair and public trial is assured by law and
 broadly observed in practice. Counsel is provided for the accused, free of charge if
 necessary. Good faith efforts are made to guarantee due process rights. Neverthe-
 less, trial procedures are often cumbersome; trials frequently last years.
 A revised Code of Criminal Procedure which entered into force in 1989 sought to
 streamline the process. The Code provides for a more adversarial system designed
 to promote speedier trials. Initial unfamiliarity with the new system on the part of
 judicial authorities created bureaucratic problems, increased delays, and further in-
 creased existing backlogs, yet to be fully cleared. In addition, parts of the new crimi-
 nal code did not prove workable and are slowly being amended by Parliament to
 restore time-saving devices of the old code, such as admitting pretrial testimony.
 All court cases may be appealed to the highest appellate court, the Court of Cas-
 sation. There are no political or security courts or political prisoners. The judiciary
 
 
 is formally autonomous and independent of the executive. Nonetheless before the
 start of the "clean hands*judicial proceedings in 1992, there was a broaa perception
 that magistrates were subject to political influence and that the political views of
 certain judges affected prooedings. Since the start of the "clean hands" investiga-
 tions, magistrates have increasingly disengaged themselves from traditional pres-
 sure by political parties and are investigating members of all parties for kickbacks,
 corruption, and reception of stolen goods.
 Over 25 magistrates so far have come under investigation on suspicion of links
 with the Mafia; the list continues to grow. One judge of the Supreme Court of Cas-
 sation, who for 6 years overruled a total of 400 verdicts of the lower courts for al-
 leged technical errors in reaching judgments in Mafia trials, was placed under in-
 vestigation by the Superior Magistrates Council (CSM) in September 1992. In
 March 1993, the office of the Palermo public prosecutor began judicial investigations
 against him for ties with organized crime; in April he was suspended from office.
 In December 1992, a Sicilian judge committed suicide because of suspicion of collu-
 sion with the Cosa Nostra. In May 1993, the Naples judiciary arrested a judge with
 ties with the Camorra (a criminal organization); he was the first judge to be ar-
 rested on such charges.
 Several sitting andi former judges and other magistrates in Bari, Milan, Florence,
 Perugia, and throughout Sicily are under judicial investigation or under suspension
 in connection with antiorganized crime cases or as part of proceedings in the "clean
 hands" corruption scandals. In December the Justice Minister started disciplinary
 proceedinp against 21 magistrates belonging to Masonry lodges for "incompatibility
 with the impartial behavior required by their position. He also asked the CSM to
 transfer these judges. The judiciary in the southern city of Palmi is investigating
 several other judges for Masonic association.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 concept of the privacy of the home is safeguarded legally and respected by the au-
 thorities. Searches and electronic monitoring may be carried out only under judicial
 warrant and in carefully defined circumstances.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Free speech and a free press are assured by law
 and observed in practice. Publications are free from government control and present
 views across the political spectrum without censorship. Under Italian law, publica-
 tions may be seized for violation of obscenity laws or for defamation of state institu-
 tions. These powers are seldom invoked; they have not been used in the past several
 years.
 In addition to government-run radio and television, many private radio stations
 operate. The political views of these stations differ widely. A lively political debate
 over the issue of media regulation reflects public concern over the potential for mo-
 nopolistic power on the part of the private media. The Government's controversial
 allocation of private television channels in 1990 and 1992 came under the scrutiny
 of the judiciary on the suspicion that political parties gained an advantage from the
 allocation of stations through their links with the private owners. On October 27,
 Parliament approved a decree giving the Government a mandate to redefine the al-
 location plan by October 1994.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Citizens freely exercise their
 right of peaceful assembly, which is limited only in cases where national security
 or public safety is endangered. Permits are not required for meetings, but organizers
 of public demonstrations must notify the police in advance, Professional and em-
 ployer associations organize and represent their constituencies freely.
 While allowing freedom of association, the Constitution and law prohibit secret as-
 sociations, associations that pursue political aims by using paramilitary structures,
 and the reorganization of the dissolved Fascist Party. An increasing number of epi-
 sodes of violence perpetrated in 1992 and early 1993 by neo-Fascist groups against
 Jews, Gypsies, and third- country nationals led the Government to issue a decree
 in April allowing the arrest of members of groups inciting racial, ethnic, national,
 or religious discrimination. The decree allows the police to search and close neo-Fas-
 cist meetingplaces. These measures led to the arrest in May of a person for having
 burned thesraeli flag and in July of nine persons on chares of seeking to reora-
 nize the Fascist Party. At least 15 other persons were under judicial investigation
 for the same charge at year's end.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Individuals are free to profess and practice any religious
 faith. All religions are free to organize and proselytize within the limits imposed by
 the laws govern.-g public order. Italy's relations with the Roman Catholic Church
 are governed by a I984 agreement (Concordat) between the Government and the
 Holy See, ratified in 1985. The agreement, which replaced the Concordat of 1929,
 
 
 930
 recognized the rights of Catholicism and its historic presence in Italy but no longer
 accorded Catholicism the status of a state religion. The Roman Catholic Church con-
 tinues informally to enjoy special standing partly as a result of the Concordat but
 also because of the presence of the Vatican and because the overwhelming majority
 of Italians are Roman Catholic. Taxpayers may elect to designate a small percentage
 of their tax payment to the Catholic Church, the Adventist Church, the Assemblies
 of God, or the State for social or humanitarian purposes; the percentage is the same
 regardless of the recipient. In November the Italian Buddhist community initiated
 procedures to receive similar funding.
 Roman Catholic religious instruction is offered in the public schools as an optional
 subject. The Ministry of Education has instructed schools to provide an optional
 course (such as the history of religions or drawing but not mandatory courses such
 as mathematics or literature) to students who do not want to attend the "hour of
 religion." Some schools allow free time to students who do not elect to take either
 course.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens may travel freely both within the country and abroad. Emigra-
 tion is unrestricted. Citizens who leave are guaranteed the right to return, and the
 Constitution forbids deprivation of citizenship for political reasons. According to gov-
 ernment statistics in September, a total of 19,182 refugees came to Italy, primarily
 from the former Yugoslavia. Government authorities in December estimated the
 total number for 1993 at 26,000, mostly from the former Yugoslavia and a few hun-
 dred from Somalia. The Government arranged for their temporary stay. There is no
 reliable estimate of the number of unregistered refugees who also entered. Some re-
 gional governments provided assistance in employment, housing, health care, and
 education.
 A new law on citizenship which came into force in August 1992 reduced from 5
 to 3 years the period of residence necessary for some immigrants (those born in Italy
 or of Italian origin) to acquire Italian citizenship. The law retained the 5-year resi-
 dency requirement for immigrants from European Community (EC) countries and
 increased from 5 to 10 years the required residence period for non-EC immigrants.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Italy has a parliamentary system with members of Parliament elected on the
 basis of universal adult suffrage. Although the Constitution outlaws the Fascist
 Party, a wide range of organized and active political parties exists from the far left
 to the far right of the political spectrum. Election campaigns are free and open, and
 voting is by secret ballot. The two chambers of Parliament and regional provincial,
 and municipal councils are elected at regular intervals of 5 years; the Constitution
 allows the President of the Republic to call special parliamentary elections. A 1992
 electoral reform provided for the direct election of mayors in municipalities with
 over 15,000 inhabitants. A 1993 reform provided for 75 percent of the seats of both
 houses of Parliament to be elected on a majority basis in single-member districts
 and 25 percent to continue to be elected on a proportional basis.
 There are no restrictions in law on the participation of women in government and
 politics. Political and social customs continue to result, however, in a lower percent-
 age of participation by women than by men. In 1993, 3 of 24 Cabinet members, 31
 of 325 Senators, and 51 of 630 deputies in the lower house were women. New elec-
 toral laws have provisions that either encourage more female candidates or place
 them higher on proportional voting lists.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental organizations, including human rights organizations, are free to
 investigate conditions in Italy, attend trials, and publish their findings.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 There is no legal discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex (except with re-
 gard to work regarded as dangerous; see below), ethnic background, or political
 opinion. In practice, discrimination based on sex and ethnic background, among
 other factors, continues.
 Women.-Women participate freely in political and social life but still face dis-
 crimination, sometimes legally. For instance, no women, regardless of age, are per-
 mitted to be employed underground in quarries, mines, or tunnels. Despite legal
 guarantees, employers continue to favor men over women in filling jobs, particularly
 those with prospects for advancement to management. Women fill approximately 10
 percent of managerial positions and are poorly represented in the professions.
 
 
 931
 Women tend to remain in employment areas such as schoolteaching and in public
 employment sectors such as post offices, government ministries, the national health
 service, national social security institute, and national statistical office. The Italian
 media has reported a 10-percent increase in the number of female police officers.
 Labor agreements in significant sectors such as metalworking (the leading indus-
 trial sector), local administration, and public service prohibit sexual harassment,
 which, however, is not prohibited by law. This makes it difficult for women success-
 fully to pursut such cases in court. For example, in a prominent case in the Pied-
 mont region, a female employee was unable to win a harassment case despite hav-
 ing15 witnesses who confirmed her accusations against her supervisor.
 Women enjoy legal equality with men in marriage. In the event of divorce, a
 woman is entitled to a share of the survivor's pension and any inheritance in the
 event of the death of her ex-husband. The property of a married couple is considered
 community property unless husband and wife agree to keep their property divided.
 All assets acquired prior to marriage are exempt from the community property pro-
 vision.
 Legislation seeks to provide women protection from physical abuse. Police and
 judges are not reluctant to intervene and mete out punishment in such cases.
 Spousal rape was tried in the courts in 1993 under the Criminal Code. Although
 there are no statistically reliable studies attesting to the extent of domestic violence
 against women, newspaper reports of such violence are common and it is thought
 to be widespread. The Government provides a public telephone service, Telefona
 Rosa, which offers legal, practical, social, and psychological counseling for women
 in difficulty. The Prime Minister's Office on the Status of Women has stated that,
 while laws exist to punish those who commit acts of violence against women and
 the laws are enforced, victims often do not bring charges due to fear, shame, or igno-
 rance of the law.
 Children.-In recent years, el-'ents of Italian society have manifested growing
 concern over violence against children. A privately financed, nationwide, toll-free
 telephone hotline service to help abused children, established in 1987, has received
 over 270,000 calls. Private volunteer organizations operate to protect minors from
 potential abuse; social workers either on their own initiative or with orders from a
 Judge of Minors" can take remedial or punitive action. Social workers can also
 place abused children in family shelters.
 Reliable, consistent statistics on child abuse are often not readily available. Ac-
 cording to the national hotline for children, most callers complain of psychological
 violence, physical abuse, or negligence. Available evidence suggests that most of
 those calling to denounce maltreatment of children ate adults, but the number of
 children using child-abuse protection telephone line  s increasing. Some experts in
 the field believe thathat abuse is increasing, this may sig-
 nify that children's fear of reachingout for support is diminishing. According to
 ese statistics, about 50 percent of th,se calling are from northern Italy and mostly
 denounce cases of physical abuse. The remainder is evenly divided between the
 central and southern regions, where the child mistreatment most commonly de-
 nounced is sexual abuse. An assessment by another private institution (for the pro-
 tection of maltreated children) indicates 100,000-150,000 cases of child abuse are
 perpetrated every year, of which 50,000 are physical abuse and about 40,000 are
 sexual.
 The Government in 1993 reorganized the Department of Social Affairs to give it
 principal responsibility for children's rights. In September an 8-member committee
 was established with the task of advising the Minister on policy concerning minors.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorits.-North Africans resi   an  working in Italy
 and the population of Gypsy origin are subject to discrimination.
 Aggressive racial incidents aimed at foreigners and immigrants increased and
 spread all over Italy in 1993. Among the most significant incidents were the beating
 of several hundred  North African tmato-pickers by the population of a southern
 Italian town, who were aroused nd spurred on by persons operating illegal employ-
 ment schemes historically present in southern Italy under a system called
 "capo alato; beatings of North African drug-peddlers and destitutes in the northern
 city of Genoa the burning of a Caritas assistance center being readied for immi-
 grants near  aserta, in the south, and the burningof lodgings for immigrants in
 Rome and of housing for North Africans in the north central city of Bologna. Some
 arrests were made in the Genoa beatings, but at year's end other perpetrators had
 not yet been apprehended.
 Despite official efforts to integrate the Gypsy population into Italian society,
 Gypsy communities continue to stand out and to attract negative, sometimes vio-
 lent, attention because of an increase in pickpocketing and other street crime in
 
 
 932
 
 which some members of these groups are popularly viewed to be predominant par-
 ticipants.
 As in 1992, during the first half of 1993 trailers in Gypsy camps in Rome and
 Bologna were set on fire. Police regularly investigate such incidents. While the per-
 petrators of these particular crimes have not yet been apprehended, the Government
 prosecutes such offenders when they are apprehended. Locsl administrations and
 communities have shown sensitivity to the need to ensure equal treatment of those
 who belong to nomadic groups and who are, for the most part, Italian citizens. Local
 and regional authorities in Rome and Florence, for example, have worked to provide
 sanitation to Gypsy campsites. Approximately 4,000 Gypsies reside in the greater
 Rome area. Most of them live in precarious and unhygienic conditions.
 As a result of the increasing influx of legal and illegal immigration from Africa
 and East European countries, these issues are being examined with greater atten-
 tion by the general public and by political parties. Employees of international orga-
 nizations from third-world countries living in Rome report more difficulty than their
 European colleagues in finding housing. The Governmeut funds nonprotit organiza-
 tions that provide social assistance to third-world nationals living in Italy. In this
 area, the Government also works closely with the Roman Catholic Church, which
 has been a powerful public voice condemning discrimination against, and mistreat-
 ment of, minorities and which supports social assistance gr)ups and activities.
 Recently enacted changes in the Special Statute for AIto Adige (along the Aus-
 trian border) give German speakers there added safeguards against alleged risks to
 their culture and language. Some in the Italian-speaking community in the Alto
 Adige claimed reverse discrimination. The German-Rpeaking ommunity is also
 pressing local authorities to change the names of several towns from the Italian
 wording to what they claim were the original German versions prior to World War
 I.
 The Government and Parliament began to discuss revision of the 1990 Law en
 Immigration, including the possible introduction of a quota system and the applica-
 tion of stricter administrative controls.
 There are about 35,000 Jews in Italy. Occasional anti-Semitic incidents, such as
 the desecration of tombs in a Jewish cemetery and the appearance of anti-Semitic
 graffiti, continued to occur during the year. The police suspect that perpetrators are
 members of the various anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi groups that have emerged re-
 cently. However, only one person was caught in the act of desecrating Jewish graves
 and arrested on charges of ethnic and religious discrimination.
 People with Disabilities.-There are no restrictions on employment of physically
 disabled persons in Italy, and since 1968 employers employing 35 or more persons
 have been required, with limited exemptions, to staff 15 percent of their work force
 with disabled persons. In practice, however, only about 4 percent of the work force
 in these firms are disabled. A comprehensive framework law was adopted in 1992
 covering assistance, social integration, and rights of handicapped persons. The
 Labor lnspectorate of the Ministry of Labor eaforces this law; employers who do not
 obey the law are fined and obliged to comply; repeat offenders receive higher pen-
 alties.
 Protection against discrimination in education has been guaranteed at all levels
 since 1977, and this was successfully defended in the courts in 1987. The 1992 Law
 on the Rights of Handicapped Persons reinforced this guarantee. A 1971 law calls
 for physical accessibility for the disabled to public buildings; compliance in schools
 and other public buildings is thus far not universal.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Workers' Statute of 1970 provides for the right
 to establish trade unions, to join unions, and to carry out union activities in the
 workplace. Trade unions are not government controlled, and the Constitution fully
 protects the right to strike, which is frequently exercised. In practice, the thre'
 major labor confederations possess status and influence (in comparison to the sniali-
 er independent unions) for reasons that go well beyond their membership size. They
 have strong historical ties to two of the three major political parties and administer
 certain social welfare services for the Government, which compensates them accord-
 ingly.
 Moreover, the Workers' Statute favors the three confederations to the extent that
 it is difficult for small unions, including the so-called Base Committees (Cobas) at
 the shop floor level, to obtain recognition. In July a tripartite agreement was
 reached, which, among other things, laid the basis for election of unitary union rep-
 resentation (RSU) in all workplaces. If enacted into law, two-thirds of the RSU
 would be elected by all employees in the workplace and one-third nominated by
 those unions that signed the National Labor Contract affecting those workers.
 
 
 933
 A 1990 law limits the right to strike in essential public services such as transpor-
 tation, sanitation, and health. Public sector workers, including those covered by
 these restrictions, engaged in demonstrations and a partial general strike in early
 1993 in support of union demands in national tripartite negotiations and in conjunc-
 tion with a Europe-wide day of action called by the European Trade Union Confed-
 eration. However, minimum services in essential public services were provided. Ital-
 ian unions associated freely and actively with international trade union organiza-
 tions.
 The Workers' Statute (Law 300 of 1970) prohibits employers in firms employing
 more than 15 workers (more than 5 in agriculture) from taking retribution against
 strikers other than deduction of wages for the duration of the strike. The Govern-
 ment enforces this effectively. Hiring of personnel to replace strikers is effectively
 prohibited.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right of workers to orga-
 nize and bargain collectively is protected by the Constitution and is freely practiced.
 Labor-management relations are governed by legislation, custom, collective bar-
 gaining agreements, and labor contracts. In Ju y an agreement was signed by rep-
 resentatives of labor, management, and government laying down a new collective
 bargaining structure. All future national labor contracts are to be of 4 years' dura-
 tion. Wage increases for the first 2 years are to respect guidelines established
 through consultations at the national level; wages ma be renegotiated after 2
 years. Company-level bargaining on issues not covered i the national contract is
 to take place once during the life of the agreement at a time to be specified in the
 national contract. Company-level wage increases are to depend on performance of
 the frm.
 National collective bargaining aeements in practice apply to all workers, regard-
 less of union membership. The Juy agement cale for further legislation to make
 these agements legally binding on all firms in the pertinent sector.
 The [aw prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union members
 and organizers. Judges of first instance (Pretre) resolve complaints of discrimina-
 tion. A 1990 law encourages workers in small enterprises (less than 16 employees)
 tojoin unions and requires  just cause" for dismissals from employment.
 Employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate
 workers fired for union activities if the firm has more than 15 employees. In firma
 with less than that number, the employer has the option to reinstate or pay com-
 pensation up to approximately $15,000 at th  ear-       agerate (2.5 million
 lira) or 6 months' wages, whichever is larger. In special cases, this can be increased
 to 10 or 15 months' wages. Protection of worker rights in the case of transfer of com-
 pany ownership is provided in a law that complies with a Europe an Community
 (EC) directive on the subject. The law requires that the unions of both the former
 and the new owners' companies be consulted in advance of the sale and that no
 worker benefits be lost as a result of the transfer.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and does not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law provides that no child
 under 15 years of age maybe employed (with some specified exceptions). The Min-
 yof Labor, having onsulted with the labor organizations, may, as an exception,
 authorize the employment of children over 12 years of age on specific jobs. There
 are also specific restrictions on employment in various dangerous or unhealthful oc-
 cupations up to the age of 18 for men and 21 for women. In general, minimum
 laws are effectively enforced. However, some employment of children occurs in te
 shadow economy, particularly in the agricultural sector in the less prosperous south-
 ern parts of Italy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage set under Italian
 law; basic wage and salary levels are st forth in collective bargaining agreements.
 National collective bargaining agreements contain minimum standards to which in-
 dividual employment contracts must conform. In the absence of agreement between
 the parties, the courts may step in to determine fair wages on the basis of practice
 in related activities or related collective bargaining agreements.
 Working time and safety standards are established by law and buttressed and ex-
 tended in collective labor contracts. The Basic Law of 1923 provides for a maximum
 workweek of 48 hours-ono more than 6 days per week and 8 hours per day. The
 8-hour day may be exceeded for same special categories. Most collective bargaining
 agreements provide for a 36- to 38-hour week. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours
 per day or an average of 12 hours per week.
 Basic health and safety standards and guidelines for lm nsation for on-the-job
 injuries are set forth in an extensive body of law and regultions. While 13 of the
 
 
 EC's directives on safety and health were incorporated into Italian law in 1991, 8
 had not yet been implemented in late 1993. Most of these health and safety stand-
 ards are exceeded in collective bargaining agreements. Enforcement of health and
 safety regulations is entrusted to labor inspectors, who are either employees of local
 health units or of the Ministry of Labor and have the same status as judicial police
 officers. Inspectors make periodic visits to companies to ensure observance of safety
 regulations. Violators may be fined or even imprisoned; it is common for Italian
 judges to fine employers guilty of infractions. Trade unions also play an important
 role in reporting safety violations to inspectors. Coverage is hampered by the inad-
 equate number of inspectors. Union sources claim that many companies fail to keep
 records on potential health risks in their plants, as required by law.
 Because of high unemployment, there is pressure on workers to accept unsafe con-
 ditions. There are many substandard workplaces, especially in the south. Following
 a serious accident at a refinery in Sicily in June, the Government decided to set up
 a special agency to deal with industrial accidents. At year's end, this unit had not
 begun to function.
