 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1975 following
 a decade of guerrilla warfare. The Front for the Liberation
 of Mozambique (FRELIMO), the only'party allowed, is the key
 decisionmaking organ and articulates government policies.
 Joaquim Chissano completed his first full year as President of
 Mozambique and Chairman of FRELIMO, following his predecessor's
 death in an airplane crash in October 1986. The Council of
 Ministers is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the
 Government. A self-proclaimed nonaligned, nationalist, and
 Marxist-Leninist party, FRELIMO's approach has been
 increasingly pragmatic, aimed at dealing with the economic and
 political realities of catastrophic drought and growing civil
 conflict, which together have uprooted millions of people,
 destroged much of the economic and social infrastructure, and
 caused widespread civilian casualties.
 The security forces include the military, the People's Forces
 for the Liberation of Mozambique (FPIM), numbering about
 30,000 soldiers, a People's Militia, and the Mozambican
 National Security Service (SNASP). Since the late 1970's the
 Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) has waged a guerrilla
 war against the Government, resulting in the death of thousands
 of civilians. RENAMO's strength is estimated at 15,000 to
 20,000 persons, and RENAMO is active in Mozambique's 10
 provinces. Originally the creation of the Rhodesian
 Intelligence Service, it now reportedly receives support from
 South Africa. In 1987 the Government appointed new FPLM
 leadership and sought additional military assistance from the
 international community. Among the outside participants, the
 Soviet Union and its allies, the United Kingdom, Italy, and
 Portugal provide military training and assistance to
 Mozambique, while Zimbabwe ,has a large military presence,
 ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 troops. In addition, Tanzania has
 about 2,500 troops and Malawi 600 to 1,000 soldiers in
 Mozambique. In September 1987, Mozambique and South Africa
 resumed discussions aimed at reviving the 1984 Nkomati accord,
 which committed them to cease hostile acts against each other
 and to search for ways to increase economic cooperation.
 President Chissano's Government pressed forward in 1987 with
 economic reforms, including rescheduling its $3.2 billion
 debt, drastically devaluing its currency, encouraging the
 private sector, and seeking foreign assistance. In January
 the Government signed agreements with the International
 Monetary Fund and World Bank. At the end of 1987, a major
 international relief effort was underway to help avert the
 danger of famine for 4 to 5 million people.
 The Government in 1987 took steps to improve military justice
 and to allow increased religious freedom. In addition, the
 People's Assembly enacted legislation extending amnesty to
 insurgents who seek reintegration into society and reducing
 sentences for those convicted under security laws. However,
 the overall human rights situation in the country deteriorated
 due mainly to the conflict. Both Mozambican security forces
 and RENAMO reportedly committed serious abuses against
 civilians. However, the line between violence perpetrated by
 RENAMO, undisciplined government forces, and renegade elements
 without political affiliation was sometimes not clear. By the
 end of 1987, over 2 million Mozambicans of a population of 14
 million had fled to more secure areas in the country or to
 neighboring'countries. The increased toll on civilians was
 dramatically evident in a series of massacres in the second
 
 
 196
 MOZAMBIQUE
 half of 1987 commencing with the killing of a reported 424
 inhabitants of Homoine in Inhambane Province on July 18.
 Although no group claimed responsibility, circumstantial
 evidence and the credible reports of eyewitness observers
 indicated that these actions probably were perpetrated by
 RENAMO insurgents.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The continuing war between the Government and RENAMO has led
 to the death of many Mozambicans. Precise figures are
 unavailable, and the two sides exaggerate accusations against
 each other, but the total number of fatalities over the past
 few years is certainly in the thousands. There were no
 reliable reports of politically motivated killings in 1987
 other than those attributable to the conflict between the
 Government and RENAMO. There were no reports of public
 executions.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed reports of government-perpetrated
 disappearances in 1987. The Government's commitment to the
 prompt notification of relatives and friends of detained
 persons remained suspect, however, and it was often impossible
 to know whether a person had disappeared or was in detention.
 Security forces, operating under security legislation,
 sometimes held detainees incommunicado for extended periods,
 despite the fact that detainees have the legal right to contact
 their relatives and to receive visitors. The Government has
 remained largely unresponsive to international inquiries about
 the welfare of detained persons.
 According to reliable eyewitness reports, RENAMO continued to
 abduct large numbers of rural villagers. Some of the victims
 were released after being required to transport captured
 materials for long distances or to perform other tasks.
 Others were held in rural areas outside of formal government
 control. RENAMO also continued kidnaping foreigners in 1987.
 Six expatriates taken by RENAMO in December 1986 and January
 1987 were held until April 1987. Seven expatriates, including
 one American citizen, were held captive from May 13 until their
 release at the Malawi border on August 18. RENAMO acknowledged
 in June 1987 that it was holding a Portuguese citizen and his
 family and one other foreigner. They are still believed to be
 in RENAMO's hands, as is a British citizen captured by RENAMO
 in July 1987.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In the early years after independence, political prisoners at
 remote government-organized "reeducation camps" were brutally
 bound, beaten, and often killed. These camps were used to
 intern political prisoners and "antisocial elements." While
 the Government has publicly referred to one model
 "rehabilitation center" in Inhambane Province, it has claimed
 that all except one of the former reeducation camps have been
 closed. Precise information on the- location and nature of any
 reeducation or rehabilitation camps which may exist is not
 available.
 
 
 197
 MOZAMBIQUE
 In 1987 the Government launched several campaigns to improve
 discipline and effectiveness within the armed forces, militia,
 and police. Government officials, including President
 Chissano, have publicly stressed fhat the security forces must
 protect and respect citizens. A major reorganization of the
 military high command was ordered in June, and the military
 justice system is being reformed. The government-influenced
 media have publicized abuses by police and security forces,
 and some responsible officials have been disciplined. For
 example, local officials and an FPLM political commissioner in
 Sofala province were convicted and sentenced for ordering the
 execution of two citizens suspected of witchcraft. In another
 instance, three militiamen were given prison terms varying
 from 4.to 8 years for abuse of power in abduction-rape cases.
 As a result of these steps, most observers believe there were
 fewer instances of torture in 1987. Nevertheless, there
 continued to be reports of capricious and cruel treatment by
 some members of the security and defense forces. In addition,
 the Government continued the practice of flogging (for example,
 as punishment for economic crimes), particularly in rural areas
 where incarceration is difficult. Ministry of Justice
 officials have publicly condemned excessive and illegal
 floggings.
 RENAMO reportedly has tortured, maimed, and mistreated both
 military prisoners and civilians. Numerous eyewitnesses have
 confirmed these reports, referring to RENAMO mutilations of
 civilians believed to sympathize with the Government by cutting
 off noses, ears, and lips. Thousands of Mozambicans, including
 children, are reported to have undergone such disfigurement.
 In some instances, abducted villagers have reportedly been
 compelled to watch as civilians who attempted to escape or who
 had otherwise offended against the harsh regime in RENAMO
 camps were slowly hacked to death with machetes.
 Prisons in Mozambique are generally marked by inadequate food,
 hygiene, and medical care. The Government has sought foreign
 and local assistance to improve prison conditions. The
 Mozambican Red Cross is now assisting the Government to
 improve prison conditions.
 In general, there is no information about the Government's
 treatment of RENAIMO prisoners, but Amnesty International's
 1987 Report noted that in 1986 some RENAMO prisoners were
 known to be in the custody of SNASP, living in harsh conditions
 and with. insufficient water and exercise. Reportedly, there
 are several reeducation centers for selected RENAMO prisoners,
 including a prison in Inhambane where they receive training in
 various skills to prepare them for "reintegration" into
 society. The length of detention of such prisoners may be
 indefinite.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Since 1979 two separate legal systems have existed. One is
 the regular civil/criminal system composed of the judiciary
 (courts) and a police force under the authority of the
 Ministry of Interior. The other, characterized as
 transitional, is the military-run state security system which
 incorporates the Ministry of National Security (SNASP). The
 latter system, established to deal with the growing armed
 insurgency, has jurisdiction over both political and economic
 (sabotage) crimes against the State. These two systems
 operate separately and are subject to separate controls.
 
 
 198
 MOZAMBIQUE
 Under the state security system, all investigations and
 arrests are carried out by SNASP. Detainees may be held
 indefinitely, often incommunicado, without formal charges.
 They do not have the right to challenge the legality of their
 detention. SNASP has the power to conduct pretrial inquiries
 without reference to a judge. Amnesty International has
 recommended that SNASP's power to detain persons be drastically
 reduced because such unlimited authority invites abuse.
 There are no reliable estimates of the numbers of persons
 detained for political reasons. Amnesty International
 estimated that there were approximately 4,000 to 5,000 RENAMO
 detainees, a figure the Government publicly acknowledged.
 Neither the Government nor RENAMO have agreed to allow the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit
 detainees.
 Under the regular civil/criminal court system, persons accused
 of the most serious crimes can be detained up to 84 days
 without investigation. With court approval, such detainees
 can then be held for two additional periods of 84 days while
 the police complete their investigation. While being detained,
 individuals have the right to counsel and to contact relatives
 or friends. In some cases, detainees may be released from
 prison while the investigation proceeds, but the bail system
 in Mozambique remains ill-defined. The law stipulates that if
 the prescribed period for investigation has been completed and
 no charges have been brought, the detainee must be released.
 In practice, these procedures are not always followed, and
 legal counsel is frequently not available. However, the
 Government is making efforts to improve the administration of
 justice and due process; in 1987 it began training 25 public
 defenders to handle cases before the Mozambican courts.
 In 1985 as part of the "offensive for legality," the
 Government set up a judicial inspectorate to help supervise
 the administration of courts and prisons. During 1987 the
 Ministry of Justice continued its effort to ensure that
 detainees held by police were afforded access to government-
 provided legal assistance. The Ministry of Justice also
 launched programs to publicize basic laws and rights of
 defendants, families, and children and to conduct seminars on
 human rights throughout the country.
 During 1987 there were no reports of anyone being exiled from
 Mozambique (see also Section 2.d.). As far as is known,
 compulsory labor is not practiced by the Government. RENAMO
 reportedly makes extensive use of captive labor to carry
 supplies and to perform other support functions.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The modern judicial system is based on Portuguese civil law.
 There are a series of People's Courts at the district and
 provincial levels, and a Superior Court of Appeals in Maputo.
 Nonpolitical trials conducted by the regular civil/criminal
 court system are generally fair and are held in public.
 At the local level, there are also customary courts. Trials
 are often conducted in a public place in the village where the
 crime was allegedly committed in order to encourage public
 attendance and participation. The proceedings are conducted
 by a trained representative of the Ministry of Justice,
 assisted by two or four popularly elected "judges." Since the
 legal knowledge of those involved is limited, they are
 
 
 199
 MOZAMBIQUE
 instructed to exercise common sense and to apply locally
 accepted principles.
 These traditional or customary courts can handle only minor
 offenses; more serious crimes are tried in the people's courts
 at the district and provincial levels. District and
 provincial trials are also open to the public. In certain
 cases, such as rape, the defendant can request a closed
 trial. Persons convicted of a serious crime have the
 automatic right of appeal to the next higher court.
 Inspections of the judiciary process in several provinces
 during 1987 were reported by the media, and efforts were made
 to give defendants speedier access to trial.
 Prisoneis charged with crimes against the State are tried by
 the Revolutionary Military Tribunal and are denied most due
 process rights. Trials are held in camera, and there is no
 appeal. Defendants are generally not informed of the precise
 charges against them and are not permitted to call witnesses
 for their defense. In 1987 the People's Assembly approved the
 country's first military crimes law and a military tribunal
 law. The military crimes law will take force in July 1988 to
 allow time for organization of the military tribunals. The
 military crimes law can be applied to military personnel and
 civilians alike. It defines a military crime as "any socially
 dangerous action or omission which affects military ethics and
 discipline, or that endangers, prejudices, or disturbs combat
 capacity or military security, and which is covered in
 existing military law." Penalties range from 30 days'
 imprisonment to death.
 In 1987 the People's Assembly passed legislation authorizing
 pardons and amnesty for about 1,500 convicts, and the media
 carried stories regarding the release of some of these
 persons. In March the media reported that 380 prisoners were
 granted clemency in Sofala province and 40 in Inhambane
 province. In December 1987, President Chissano proposed, and
 the People's Assembly approved, two important'laws on amnesty
 and pardon. The first gives amnesty to insurgents who turn
 themselves in to local authorities and seek reintegration into
 society. The second shortens the sentences of persons
 convicted of crimes under the 1979 security legislation.
 Government officials have said that in connection with these
 two new laws, efforts would be made to speed the processing of
 persons who have been held for extended periods without being
 tried. The pardon law specifically states that time spent in
 detention prior to trial will count toward sentence reduction
 if the detainee is eventually convicted of a crime.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The party apparatus is used to monitor daily life. In areas
 of active insurgency, homes are entered at will by security or
 police forces. It is widely assumed that surveillance devices
 are employed to monitor the local and international
 telecommunications systems. There have also been reports of
 tampering with mail, especially mail from abroad. Regular
 foreign broadcasts are received without interference, and
 there is no restriction on listening to them. The Government
 does not generally interfere with family affairs such as
 marriage or the rearing of children.
 
 
 200
 MOZAMBIQUE
 g. Violations of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts
 Both government forces and RENAMO have been responsible for
 the death of civilians in the course of the conflict between
 them. Strong circumstantial evidence suggests that RENAMO was
 responsible for a series of massacres of civilians in southern
 Mozambique and the eastern fringes of Zimbabwe during the
 second half of 1987. The most brutal attack occurred on July
 18 at Homoine in Inhambane Province, in which 424 civilians
 were killed, according to the Government. An American
 eyewitness saw the attackers shoot and kill a group of women
 and children and reported that other victims had been killed
 with machetes and bayonets. Similar attacks occurred in
 Manjacaze on August 10 in Gaza Province in which the
 Government said 93 civilians were killed; at a Methodist
 mission station in Cambine, where church sources report 15
 were killed; and Michafutene in Maputo Province, where the
 Government said 27 persons were killed. Expatriate missionary
 personnel working in these areas stated that other attacks of
 this sort occurred in Gaza and Inhambane provinces. In
 addition, the Government stated that more than 300 persons
 were killed in two separate attacks on convoys near Taninga in
 Maputo province in October 1987. Foreign diplomats who
 visited the site shortly after the second attack saw more than
 .90 burned out vehicles, including trucks carrying food aid,
 and passengers' belongings strewn along the highway. RENAMO
 spokesmen acknowledged carrying out attacks in southern
 Mozambique but denied attacking civilians.
 On November 5, the Government appealed to the international
 community for assistance in treating 30 children (ages 5 to
 16) whom it said it had brought to Maputo from RENAMO camps
 destroyed by government forces. The children had reportedly
 been abducted by RENAMO and trained to participate in its
 attacks. Several children had been mutilated.
 The Government publicly rejects negotiations and continues
 aggressive efforts to combat RENAMO. There have been
 unconfirmed reports that errant Mozambican troops and militia
 rob vehicles on highways and sometimes kill passengers to
 prevent identification. Civilian casualties may have occurred
 during large-scale operations by government troops in the
 central provinces, which sometimes included bombing raids.
 RENAMO claimed that 50 civilians were killed during a bombing
 raid by Zimbabwean forces in Sofala province in December.
 Amnesty International has received reports of killings and
 mutilations of captives by both government and opposition
 forces. The Catholic bishops of Mozambique publicly decried
 the violence perpetrated against the civilian population by
 both sides and called for dialog and national reconciliation.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedoms of speech and press are circumscribed. However, in
 1987 the Government exhibited greater tolerance for public
 criticism of government policies and officials. The President
 held a series of "town meetings" in half of the country's
 provinces in early 1987. He heard numerous criticisms of
 officials and official policies at each stop. Subsequently,
 he announced that ombudsmen offices would be established in
 the provinces for citizens to register their complaints
 without fear of retribution. Offices have already been
 established in at least two provinces.
 
 
 201
 MOZAMBIQUE
 The Government exerts control, either directly or indirectly,
 over all authorized media in the country, ranging from the
 radio and experimental television facilities to the nominally
 independent daily Noticias. Some'foreign publications,
 including independent Western newsmagazines, are available in
 bookstores. The Mozambican media promote the Government's
 general philosophy and its positions on issues. There is,
 however, controlled reporting on abuses within the system or
 flaws in the implementation of government policies in those
 areas where the Government has admitted to errors or wishes to
 initiate changes. For example, in Nampula province, the
 Government established a commission of inquiry to investigate
 allegations of local reports of torture which first appeared
 in Noticias. Magazines and newspapers frequently contain
 articles or letters to the editor complaining about the lack
 of goods or social services or the ineffectiveness of a
 particular official.
 Western journalists (including Americans) are welcome in
 Mozambique, and the Government generally works to make their
 visits productive.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political opposition to the Government is not permitted.
 Public meetings other than purely social or recreational
 gatherings are controlled by the local authorities. The
 Government has organized several "mass movements" for groups
 such as women, youth, and workers and utilizes them to
 motivate and to receive feedback from the general population.
 There are also several professional associations, such as the
 Mozambican Writers' Organization, which are linked to the
 party. Although membership in these organizations is
 theoretically voluntary, the party occasionally exerts
 pressure to join.
 The formation of independent labor unions is not permitted,
 and strikes are forbidden. In 1983 the Government established
 the Mozambique Workers' Organization which was intended to
 function as a national labor union under party guidance. The
 Organization has little influence on economic policy or
 politics, but the number of party-controlled unions under this
 umbrella organization was expanded during 1987. There were a
 number of exchanges of delegations in the labor field with
 other countries, most often with Eastern European countries,
 but occasionally with'Western nations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and
 separation of church and state. In the past, the Government
 restricted religious activities, reserving the right to decide
 whether individual church buildings could be utilized, and it
 nationalized church schools and hospitals. However, the
 improvemen  in church/state relations, which began several
 years ago, continued in 1987, and organized religions
 generally operated without official harassment. A number of
 religious delegations visited Mozambique during the year, and
 the Government and the Vatican discussed further means of
 improving relations between church and state. Also in 1987,
 2,000 Jehovah's Witnesses who had been deported or exiled by
 the Government in 1976 were allowed to return home. A pastoral
 letter issued by the Catholic bishops in May calling for dialog
 and national reconciliation to end the conflict was attacked
 in the government-influenced media, but the Government did not
 
 
 202
 MOZA4BIQUE
 block the reading of the letter from pulpits or its
 circulation. The government-influenced media have publicized
 various aspects of Protestant, Catholic, and Muslim
 humanitarian relief efforts.
 Although the Government reserves the right to decide whether
 individual clergy can visit outlying areas, it usually allows
 such travel in connection with pastoral duties. Most churches
 have been allowed to reopen, and services are well attended.
 The Muslim community has established a national organization,
 resumed religious training, reopened mosques, and sent groups
 on pilgrimages to Mecca. Party members are not formally
 prohibited from membership in a church or mosque, although
 such membership is discouraged.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel and relocation within the country are controlled by
 security and employment requirements under the rationale of
 assuring public and social order. Ambushes by insurgents make
 road travel hazardous throughout the country. Mozambicans
 planning to travel outside their district must obtain a travel
 permit from local government authorities. In practice, this
 system is not always enforced, especially with regard to
 travel within the general vicinity of one's residence.
 Mozambican law does not address the issue of emigration, but
 in practice Mozambicans can emigrate if they wish. In recent
 years, over 2 million persons have been dislocated within
 Mozambique, and more than 750,000 persons have fled across
 borders to neighboring countries as refugees or displaced
 persons due to the intensification of the conflict and
 famine. The Government cooperates with the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees and is committed to resettling
 these refugees when security conditions permit their
 repatriation. The Government has publicly and privately made
 clear its opposition to forced repatriation, but in June some
 9,000 Mozambicans were forcibly repatriated from Zimbabwe at
 the unilateral initiative of the Government of Zimbabwe.
 Moreover, it is not clear, because of security conditions,
 that repatriates would be free to return to their home areas.
 Since 1981 the Government has had a policy of welcoming back
 Mozambicans who left the country, and President Chissano
 specifically invited Mozambicans who have been living abroad
 for economic or political reasons to return. In the past,
 some Mozambicans who had opposed the party before independence
 were jailed upon their return to Mozambique. Such imprisonment
 remains a possibility, but Mozambicans who since 1986 have
 accepted the Government's invitation to return apparently have
 not suffered harassment or retribution. Supporters of the
 insurgency or outspoken critics of the Government generally
 have opted not to return to Mozambique.
 A 1982 law allowed for the reacquisition of citizenship by
 Mozambicans who left the country and assumed another
 nationality. In December the People's Assembly enacted a
 nationality law restoring Mozambican citizenship to women who
 lost it through marriage to foreigners.
 Since independence, the Government readily provided asylum to
 refugees from neighboring countries. Because of the difficult
 conditions within Mozambique, there were only an estimated 500
 refugees in the country at the end of 1987. Most refugees in
 
 
 203
 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambique are from South Africa and Chile. Since signing the
 Nkomati Accord in 1984, the Government has restricted entry of
 members and supporters of the African National Congress.
 Despite poor economic conditions dnd civil war, the Government
 continues to assist refugees by providing land, housing, relief
 assistance, social services and, in some cases, employment.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens are not free to change their Government: no organized
 political opposition is allowed. The FRELIMO party and the
 Government are controlled by a small cadre of senior officials
 in the.Politburo, but there is scope for political
 participation for those who are not party members. Some
 government ministers are not members of the party. The
 legislature, the People's Assembly, serves to ratify
 legislation prepared by the government party. Its votes
 usually are unanimous. However, the Assembly held spirited
 discussions in 1987 and revised several reports presented to
 the second session. The Assembly normally convenes twice a
 year for 1-week sessions. The Constitution is being revised
 under party and government supervision, reportedly with the
 objective of increasing political participation within the
 one-party structure.
 The party and Government espouse a system of "people's
 democracy" whereby decisions theoretically are made by
 consensus: in practice, this means that policies and
 initiatives emanate from above. The electoral process is
 closely controlled by the party. The first national elections
 since 1977 for People's Assemblies at the local, district,
 provincial,.and national levels were held in 1986. The party
 drew up single slates of candidates for the elections, and
 party structures reviewed these slates with the local
 population prior to the election. Voters had some degree of
 choice since there were, by law, 20 percent more candidates
 than seats available in the vaiious assemblies. Some members
 of the provincial and district People's Assemblies are not
 party members, and at least 15 members of the national
 People's Assembly do not belong to the party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government's attitude regarding such outside investigation
 has been mixed. The Government has discussed the status of
 RENAMO prisoners with international relief organizations,
 including the ICRC, but it does not permit, as yet, ICRC
 access to political detainees. RENAMO categorically refuses
 to allow ICRC visitations to prisoners. The Government did
 not respond to inquiries and recommendations by Amnesty
 International to strengthen controls against torture and to
 limit the right of security forces to hold detainees for
 unlimited periods without charge. In some cases, however, the
 Government has responded to inquiries on specific detainees'
 cases, and it has reportedly responded positively to some
 allegations of torture by establishing a provincial commission
 of inquiry and dismissing a military officer.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 In spite of the strains imposed by the conflict and the
 economic collapse, racial harmony remains a hallmark of
 
 
 204
 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambican society. While the majority of the FRELIMO
 leadership are members of the southern-based Shangaan tribe,
 within the black population of Mozambique the individual
 ethnic groups are treated fairly by the Government. RENAMO
 has sought to obtain support by exploiting historically based
 intertribal antipathies, especially in the central and
 northern part of the country. As a result of the greater
 educational opportunities which were available to ethnic
 Asians and whites prior to independence, they hold important
 positions in numbers much greater than their proportion of the
 general population.
 Women have, in theory, equal rights under Mozambique's
 Constitution, and, with government support, are increasingly
 prominent in government positions, particularly at the working
 levels. The Government is continuing efforts to improve the
 legal status of women. For example, a main purpose of the
 nationality law passed by the People's Assembly in December
 1987 was to give women equal rights in this important area, by
 allowing women who marry foreigners, and their children, to
 retain Mozambican nationality. The Organization of Mozambican
 Women is the party's mass organization that aims to assist
 women as, for example, in helping to establish day-care
 centers. However, in a largely rural society, the reality is
 that the vast majority of women are still bound to traditional
 roles, such as childbearing and tilling the fields.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Most of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture
 and is outside much of the wage economy and government
 regulations concerning working conditions. In the small
 modern sector, the Government has enacted health and
 environmental laws to protect workers. On occasion, the
 Government has closed down firms for noncompliance of these
 laws, but enforcement is limited and difficult in the current
 economic situation. Legislation containing job-related
 safeguards for pregnant women and new mothers provides for the
 right to 60 days' maternity leave. If firms have day-care
 facilities, women reportedly have the right to two half-hour
 breaks daily for a year to feed their children. Child labor
 is also controlled, and the minimum working age (excluding
 agriculture) is 16. The Government sets wage rates. As part
 of the economic reform program, after currency devaluations
 totaling almost 1,000 percent, the Government increased wages
 by 50 to 90 percent, but wages are still woefully inadequate,
 given the high rate of inflation and price rises that are part
 of the economic reform process. The minimum wage is
 approximately $28 per month.
 Until recently labor law in Mozambique placed extensive
 restrictions on employers' control over their employees.
 However, the Government has enacted a comprehensive
 labor law that increases the autonomy of employers. Among
 other things, it allows both public and private firms to fire
 employees without obtaining governmental permission. Companies
 may now also reward their best workers with bonuses and
 penalize less productive employees.
