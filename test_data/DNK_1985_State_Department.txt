 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a strongly
 established tradition of democratic parliamentary rule. The
 reigning monarch is Queen Margrethe II. A Cabinet headed by
 the Prime Minister and accountable to the unicameral
 Parliament (Folketing) has responsibility for government
 decisions. The 179 members of the Folketing are elected in
 free and open elections under a complex system of proportional
 representation designed to protect the rights of minority
 parties and to reflect the popular vote. Since late 1982,
 Denmark has been governed by a four-party minority coalition
 led by Prime Minister Schlueter's Conservative Party, which is
 dependent on support from other parties to maintain a
 parliamentary majority.
 Human rights are highly respected and well protected in
 Denmark, both in principle and in practice. The Constitution
 establishes the Folketing's "Ombudsman," to whom any citizen
 may protest if he or she feels wrongly or unreasonably treated
 by any Danish national or municipal authority. At the global
 level, Denmark participates actively in a number of
 international commissions concerned with the protection and
 preservation of human rights.
 Denmark has displayed high concern for the rights of
 minorities, particularly the indigenous populations of
 territories such as Greenland and the Faroe Islands, which now
 enjoy broad powers of home rule.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Danish authorities do not engage in political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detentions are
 prohibited by statutes which arp respected in practice.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Protection against torture and inhuman treatment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. A rehabilitation and
 research center for torture victims established in 1983 in
 Copenhagen treats patients in the refugee community. An
 estimated 150 foreign torture victims obtain asylum yearly.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No person in Denmark can be deprived of personal liberty
 without due process of law. Arrested individuals must be
 taken before a judge within 24 hours of detention. The judge
 has the authority to determine whether the person should be
 detained in pretrial custody or released pending trial. The
 Constitution makes provision for bail. Arrested individuals
 have access to legal counsel of their choice or court-
 appointed attorneys. Non-Danish speakers are provided with
 interpreters at government expense. The occasional use of
 isolation during the pretrial custody period has been
 
 
 961
 DENMARK
 criticized in the media, but police authorities maintain that
 isolation is necessary to protect the investigation. The
 system continues to be used, though only in the most serious
 crimes such as narcotics violations. Forced or compulsory
 labor is prohibited.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are fair and public. The trial judge may order
 exceptions to this principle but only within narrowly drawn
 parameters, such as paternity and divorce trials. In criminal
 cases, trials are only closed when it is necessary to protect
 the privacy of the victim, such as in rape or child
 molestation cases, or when it is deemed necessary to protect
 the identity Qf a witness. Danish courts make extensive
 efforts to obtain the facts of a case, and the rights of the
 accused are carefully protected. All indigent defendants have
 the right to a court-appointed attorney at government expense.
 The defendant is free to change the court-appointed attorney.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the Danish Constitution, searches of the home, seizure
 and examination of papers, and breaches of the secrecy of
 communications are prohibited in the absence of a judicial
 order, unless a particular exception is provided for by
 statute. These provisions are respected in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Denmark has a free and open society. An individual may
 express an opinion in written or oral form on any matter,
 subject only to the condition that the person can be held
 responsible in a court of law. Media representatives and
 private individuals make full use of the freedom of
 expression. Criticism of the Government or government policy
 is not a punishable offense, and censorship is not utilized.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Danish residents are free to assemble and form associations
 for any lawful purpose. Police are entitled to be present at
 public meetings or demonstrations which could constitute a
 danger to the public peace.
 Approximately 85 percent of Danish wage earners are members of
 trade unions. Under the General Agreement of 1960, workers
 and employers acknowledged each other's right to organize.
 Labor agreements and legislation protect the rights of workers
 and employers and regulate the work environment.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Under the Constitution, the Evangelical Lutheran Church is
 recognized as the established church of Denmark. However,
 religious freedom is guaranteed to all residents of Denmark.
 No one may be discriminated against because of religious
 beliefs. These laws are strictly enforced in practice.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Danes have complete freedom to travel and to reenter Denmark.
 Denmark is a homogeneous ethnocentric society with
 historically only a small number of non-northern European
 residents who have been accorded a high level of acceptance.
 Refugees and asylum seekers are provided with travel
 documents, when needed, which permit return to Denmark.
 Forced repatriation is not utilized. The new Alien Act of
 1983 spells out in detail the rights of aliens in Denmark and
 provides for appeal procedures when residence permission is
 denied. Measures designed to protect the rights of potential
 refugees or asylum seekers include the establishment of a
 refugee board with authority to reverse decisions of the Alien
 Directorate and guaranteed access to legal counsel and
 interpreter service.
 Since 1983 there has been a massive influx of refugees.
 From January 1984 to May 1985, 5,000 people have asked for
 political asylum, 3,500 of them from Iran. This large number
 of ethnically dissimilar people who require shelter,
 education, and public assistance has generated additional
 pressure on the Danish welfare system. The average Dane's
 tolerance does not extend to what he perceives as a threat to
 the Danish way of life, and the Queen's New Year's plea for
 greater kindness to foreigners was subject to unusual
 criticism. Tension in this area escalated to several violent
 demonstrations by Danes at Iranian refugee centers. Many
 Danes were shocked by these xenophobic outbursts. The vast
 majority of Danish political leaders continue to emphasize the
 need for Danish tolerance and magnanimity toward the recent
 arrivals and have begun what they realize is an educational
 process for Danish society, now more exposed to the outside
 world than ever before.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Denmark is governed by a Cabinet responsible to the Folketing
 (Parliament). The Prime Minister is appointed by the Queen-
 after consultation with the political parties represented in
 the Folketing. The present Government, formed in September
 1982, is composed of four parties under the leadership of the
 Conservatives. Members of the Folketing are selected in open
 elections in which every Danish citizen 18 years or over may
 participate. A political party must obtain at least 2 percent
 of the total vote to obtain representation in the Folketing.
 Nine political parties with a variety of political beliefs are
 represented in the current Parliament. The Constitution states
 that parliamentary elections must be held at least every
 4 years. The Government can be changed by calling new
 elections or, as happened in 1982, by the resignation of the
 government in power and the formation of a new government
 composed of parties already represented in the Folketing.
 All Danish citizens and subjects are guaranteed equal
 protection under the law. The territories of Greenland and
 the Faroe Islands have home rule governments with broad powers
 encompassing all but foreign and security affairs. Native
 Greenlanders enjoy all the rights and privileges of other
 Danish citizens. In addition, Greenland's representation in
 the national Parliament is disproportionately large, and the
 island has'a special criminal code designed for local customs
 
 
 963
 DENMARK
 and conditions. Native Greenlanders freely participate in
 international ethnic organizations such as the Inuit
 Circumpolar Conference, based in Greenland, which was recently
 recognized by the United Nations. Despite periodic
 disagreements between home rule authorities and the
 Government, there have been no accusations of human rights
 violations made against the Government before any
 international organization.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Denmark is a party to various international human rights
 conventions designed to promote and protect human rights.
 The Government's commitment to human rights issues is fully
 supported by the Danish population. Amnesty International
 does not mention Denmark in its 1985 Report. Freedoi House
 rated Denmark as "free."
 ECONOMIC,'SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Denmark has a population of 5,100,000. Per capita gross
 national product in 1983 was approximately $9,720.
 Over 50 percent of the national budget is devoted to welfare,
 housing, labor, and education. Austerity measures introduced
 by the present Government have reduced social benefits
 modestly. However, this step has not materially altered the
 extensive welfare protection provided to Danish subjects.
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion.
 At birth, Danish men can expect to live to 71.5 years of age,
 and Danish women to 77.5 years of age. The infant mortality
 rate is 8.85 for males and 6.57 for females per 1,000 live
 births. All school-aged children have access to free public
 education, and the nation is 99 percent literate.
 The minimum age for the employment of children is 15, and
 specific limitations described in detail in the Working
 Environment Act of 1975 apply to the type of work which may be
 performed by those between 15 and 18 years of age. This Act
 also describes acceptable conditions of work, including safety
 and health; the general duties of employers, supervisors,
 employees, and suppliers; the performance of work; rest
 periods and rest days; and medical examinations. The Act also
 establishes a Labor Inspections Service.
 The Equal Rights Council has worked sucoessfully to eliminate
 laws and regulations which contained sex discrimination
 provisions. Women hold positions of authority at all levels
 of society and actively participate at all levels of the
 political process. They hold positions of authority in
 political parties, local governments, and in the national
 Government. Women head five cabinet ministries (Labor,
 Interior, Culture, Social Affairs, and Ecclesiastical Affairs)
 and hold about 26 percent of the seats in the Parliament.
 The living standards and educational levels of native
 Greenlanders (Eskimos) are lower than those of other Danish
 citizens, but they are improving steadily, in part because of
 heavy spending on housing, health, and education programs by
 the Government.
