 FRANCE
 France is a constitutional democracy with a directly elected president and Na-
 tional Assembly and an independent judiciary.
 The law enforcement and internal security apparatus consists of a Gendarmerie,
 national police, and municipal police forces in major cities, all of which are under
 effective civilian control.
 France's highly developed, diversified, and pri-marily market-based economy pro-
 vides residents with a high standard of living.
 The Government fully respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and
 judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse. Ra-
 cially motivated attacks by extremists caused the death of two members of ethnic
 minorities. The Government has taken important steps to combat violence against
 women and gender-based job dis crimination. Abuse of children is a serious problem.
 A series of apparently po*ltically motivated terrorist bombings killed 8 persons in
 mainland France and 37 in Corsica.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government officials.
 A series of apparently politically motivated terrorist bombings killed 8 persons
 and wounded more than 160 others in Paris. In two other cases, extreme rightwing
 youths attacked and killed members of minority ethnic groups (see Section 5).
 In Corsica, there were 37 assassinations and an average of one bombing a day,
 some of which were politically motivated. In October a court found a plice officer
 guilty of involuntary manslaughter for shooting 17-year-old Rachd Ardjouni during
 the course of a 1993 arrest. The plice officer was sentenced to 24 months in prison,
 16 of which were suspended, and ordered to pay damages to ArIouni's family. In
 another 1993 case, an appeals court ordered a police officer to stand trial for murder
 in the fatal shooting of Makome M'Bowole, a 17-year-old youth from Zaire, during
 an interrogation at a Paris police station. Still under judicial investigation are two
 cases from 1994 where police were accused of using force which resulted in deaths.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices and the authorities punish officials who employ
 them. Isolated instances of police misconduct occurred, but there is no evidence of
 a pattern of such abuses.
 In August three Marseille police officers severely beat a young Frenchman of
 North African origin. All officers have been suspended and are under investigation
 for the assault. An appeals court found sufficient grounds to order a Paris police
 officer, previously found innocent of assault and battery during a 1994 identity
 check, to pay damages to Dr. Pierre Kongo of the Central African Republic.
 Prison conditions generally exceed international standards and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors. Most prisons provide opportunities for
 paid employment as well as recreational facilities. Foreign prisoners are offered
 ourses in the French language. In its 1994 report the French organization, "Inter-
 national Observer of Prisons (lOP), " noted cases of overcrowding and mistreatment
 in some prisons. The report questioned whether the deaths in prison of two inmates
 in 1994 were really suicides, as determined by the authorities. The IOP also noted
 that prisoners have greater access to health care, following implementation of a
 1994 lw.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile and the Government observes this prohibition.
 
 
 859
 During 1994 and 1995, however, the European Court of Human Rights found in
 five of the seven cases brought for review that authorities had exceeded a "reason-
 able delay" in bringing defendants to trial.
 In narcotics trafficking convictions, courts often assess a customs fine based on
 the estimated street value of the drugs in addition to a jail sentence. At the end
 of their jail terms, prisoners who cannot pay the fine are detained for up to 2 years
 while customs officials attempt to reach the largest possible settlement. This prac-
 tice has been criticized by the European Court of Justice.
 On June 20, in a coordinated action police arrested 140 persons around the coun-
 try who were suspected of supporting Islamic militants in Algeria through arms
 trafficking or of being linked to the wave of terrorist bombings in France. All were
 released within I to 4 days, except for 20 who remain in custody under investigation
 for charges related to terrorism.
 A 1994 case where French police detained 26 resident non-French Muslims sus-
 pected of supporting Algerian terrorists continues. The 26 were held several weeks
 before 20 were deported-to Burkina Faso. French human rights groups claimed that
 the detainees' constitutional rights were violated in that: they were never charged
 with a crime; they were not permitted to remain in their own place of residence;
 and those deported were not given a hearing. The Government argued that the 26
 presented an imminent danger to public order and security, and that it therefore
 acted within the law. One individual has since been permitted to return to France.
 At least seven deportees appealed to the administrative courts; a court has over-
 turned one deportation order, involving several defendants, but the Government has
 apealed this decision. Other deportees' cases were awaiting decision at year's end.
 There are no provisions for exile, and it does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The law provides for an independent judiciary,
 and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. There is
 a system of local courts, 35 regional courts of appeal, and the highest criminal court,
 the Court of Cassation, which considers appeals on procedural grounds only.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Famil, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 A wiretap of an official who was believed to be involved in a political corruption
 case was found to be illegal in February by a Paris appeals court.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and of
 the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent
 press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine
 to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 In January the Government ordered a 24-hour shutdown of Skyrock Radio on the
 grunds that a talk show host had broken the law concerning "respect for human
 beigs in praising the recent killing of a police officer. The station ignored the Gov-
 ernment request and stayed open. The Government subsequently took the station-
 which remains on the air-to court. In a separate proceeding, a civil court ruled in
 favor of the dead officer's family, which had brought suit against the talk show host.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for separation of church and state, and
 the Government respects this right in practice.
 The State subsidizes private schools, including those that are church-affiliated.
 Central or local governments also own and provide upkeep for other religious build-
 ings constructed before 1905, the date of the law separating church and state. Cul-
 tural associations with religious affiliations may also qualify for government sub-
 sidies. Contrary to practice in the rest of France, the Jewish, Lutheran, Reformed,
 and Roman Catholic religions in three departments of Alsace and Lorraine enjoy
 special legal status. Adherents of these four religions may choose to have a portion
 of their income tax allocated to their church in a system administered by the central
 Government.
 Debate continues in France over whether denying some Muslim girls the right to
 wear headscarves in public schools constitutes a violation of the right to practice
 their religion. In 1989 the highest administrative court ruled that the "ostentatious"
 wearing of these headscarves violated a law prohibiting proselytizing in schools.
 After much    media attention-mainly unfavorable-to the wearing of such
 headscarves, in 1994 the Ministry of Education issued a directive that prohibits the
 wearing of "ostentatious political and religious symbols" in schools. The directive
 
 
 860
 does not specify the 'symbols" in question leaving school administrators consider-
 able authority to do so. France's highest administrative court affirmed in 1995 that
 simply wearing a headscarf does not provide grounds for exclusion from school, and
 several hundred students continue to wear them.
 In April the highest administrative court ruled that Jewish students could be ex-
 cused from attending classes on Saturdays, the Jewish Sabbath. The court said that
 a 1991 law laying out the rights and responsibilities of students in public schools
 could not be used to prevent authorized absence from school for religious worship
 or the celebration of a religious holiday.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice. The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no re-
 ports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: the Right of Citizens to Change their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to peacefully change their gov-
 ernment, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 There are no restrictions in law on the participation of women in politics or gov-
 ernment, but they remain significantly underrepresented in public offices, especially
 at the national level. Four of 32 cabinet members, 18 of 321 Senators, and 29 of
 577 Deputies in the National Assembly are women. To increase women's participa-
 tion, some parties have established quotas for them on electoral lists or in party
 management.
 The citizens of the "collective territory" of Mayotte and the territories of French
 Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia determine their legal and politi-
 cal relationships to France by means of referendums, and they elect Deputies and
 Senators to the French Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of local and international human rights organizations operate free-
 ly, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government
 officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views. The French Na-
 tional Consultative Commission on Human Rights (NCCHR)-which has nongovern-
 mental as well as government members-also monitors complaints and advises the
 Government on policies and legislation. It is an independent body within the Office
 of the Prime Minister.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Statutes ban discrimination based on race, religion, sex, ethnic background, or po-
 litical opinion, and the Government effectively enforces them.
 Women.-The penal code prohibits abuse as well as violence against women. Wife
 beating is a felony. The penalty for rape ranges from 5 to 20 years in prison, with
 no differentiation between spousal and other rape. There were 6,540 reported rapes
 or sexual assaults in 1995. Some 15,700 incidents of wife beating (including 98
 which resulted in death) were reported to police in 1993 (latest data). The Govern-
 ment offers shelter, counseling, and financial assistance, and operates a telephone
 hot-line, and in 1995 added 500 additional staff members at these welcome centers.
 About 60 private associations also help battered women.
 While the law requires that women receive equal pay for equal work, this is often
 not the reality. A 1994 study (latest data) found a mean discrepancy between wages
 of women and men of 20 percent in the private sector and 18 percent in the public
 sector. The same study found that the unemployment rate for women averaged
 about 4 points higher than that for men.
 Children.-The government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. The Ministry for Family Affairs oversees implementation of the Government's
 programs for children. There are strict laws against child abuse, particularly when
 committed by a parent or guardian. In 1994 (latest data) there were 15,000 reported
 cases of mistreatment (physical violence, sexual abuse, mental cruelty, or severe
 negligence) against children. Special sections of the national police and judiciary are
 charged with handling these cases. The Government provides counseling, financial
 aid, foster homes, an orphanages, depending on the extent of the problem. Various
 associations also help minors seek justice in cases of mistreatment by parents.
 
 
 861
 Some immigrants from countries where female genital mutilation (FGM) is cus-
 tomary subject their children to this practice, which is widely condemned by inter-
 national health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological he   Au-
 thorities have prosecuted some cases involving FGM and have undertaken an infor-
 mation campaign to inform immigrants that FGM is contrary to the law and will
 be prosecuted.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. The Government
 announced several measures this year to boost employment opportunities for the
 handicapped. A 1991 law requires new public buildings to be accessible to the phys-
 ically handicapped, but they are unable to enter most older buildings and public
 transportation.
 Religious Minorities-The annual NCCHR report released in March noted a 10
 percent decrease in the number of threats or attacks against Jews, from 181 in 1993
 to 162 in 1994 (latest data). There were eight arrests in 1994. These cases are under
 judicial investigation.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Anti-immigrant sentiments sparked inci-
 dents including occasional attacks by skinheads on members of the large Arab/Mus-
 lim and Black African communities, and the Jewish population. In March the an-
 nual report of the NCCHR (see Section 4) noted a 13 percent rise in racist attacks
 and threats, from 172 in 1993 to 194 in 1994 (latest data).
 On the fringes of a May 1 National Front political rally a skinhead reportedly
 pushed Brahim Bouraam, a young Moroccan bystander, off a quay to his death. An
 attacker has been charged in the case and is awaiting trial. The Government de-
 nounced the attack and then-President Mitterrand participated in a large anti-rac-
 ism demonstration held shortly thereafter. Three National Front youths have been
 arrested and charged in the February murder in Marseille of Ibrahim Ali, a 17-year-
 old Comoran. The Government strongly condemns such attacks, has strict anti-defa-
 mation laws and prosecutes perpetrators whenever possible. Government programs
 attempt to combat racism and anti-Semitism by promoting public awareness and
 bringing together local officials, police, and citizen groups. There are also antiracist
 educational programs in some public school systems.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association
 for all workers. French trade unions exercise significant economic and political influ-
 ence, although only about 10 percent of the total work force is unionized. Unions
 have legally mandated roles (as do employers) in the administration of social insti-
 tutions, including social security (health care and most retirement systems), the un-
 employment insurance system, labor courts, and the economic and social council, a
 constitutionally-mandated consultative body.
 Unions are independent of the Government, and most are not aligned with any
 political party. Many of the leaders of the General Confederation of Labor and its
 unions, however, belong to the Communist Party. Unions can freely join federations
 and confederations, including international bodies.
 Workers, including civil servants, are free to strike except when a strike threatens
 public safety. One-fourth of all salaried employees work for the Government: strikes
 in the public sector tend to be fairly numerous and receive extensive media cov-
 erage. The end of 1995 saw large-scale industrial action against government efforts
 to reduce budget deficits. These actions brought out large numbers of trade union
 demonstrators and involved significant work stoppages.
 The law prohibits retaliation against strikers and strike leaders, and the Govern-
 ment effectively enforces this provision.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers, including those in
 the three small export processing zones, have the right to organize and bargain col-
 lectively. The law strictly prohibits antiunion discrimination; employers found guilty
 of such activity are required to correct it, including reinstatement of workers fired
 for union activities.
 A 1982 law requires at least annual bargaining in the public and private sector
 on wages, hours, and working conditions at beth plant and industry levels, but does
 not require that negotiations result in a signed contract. In case of an impasse, gov-
 ernment mediators may impose solutions that are binding unless formally rejected
 by either side within a week. If no new agreement can be reached, the contract from
 the previous year remains valid. Over 90 percent of the private-sector work force
 is covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated at national or local levels.
 Trilateral consultations (i.e., unions, management, and government) also take place
 on such subjects as the minimum wage, temporary work, social security, and unem-
 
 
 ployment benefits. Labor tribunals, composed of worker and employer representa-
 tives, are available to resolve complaints.
 The -law requires businesses with more than 50 employees to establish a works
 council, through which workers are consulted on training, working conditions, profit-
 sharing, and similar issues. Works councils, which are open to both union and non-
 union employees, are elected every 2 years.
 The Constitution's provisions or trade union rights extend to France's overseas
 departments and territories.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and the Government effectively enforces this provision. In its 1993
 report, however, the International Labor Organization's Committee of Experts
 (COE) questioned the French practice of obliging French prisoners to work for pri-
 vate enterprises at less than the national minimum wage. In June 1995, the Gov-
 ernment officially responded to the COE, pointing out that prisoners participate in
 a work program on a voluntary-not a mandatory--basis, that more prisoners re-
 quest work than can be accommodated, and that the work is designed to prepare
 prisoners for reentry into the labor force. The Government is awaiting a response
 from the ILO to its submission.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-With a few exceptions for those
 enrolled in certain apprenticeship programs, children under the age of 16 may not
 be employed. Generally, work considered arduous or work between the hours of 10
 p.m. and 5 a.m. may not be performed by minors under age 18. Laws prohibiting
 child employment are effectively enforced through periodic checks by labor inspec-
 tors, who have the authority to take employers to court for noncompliance with the
 law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-France has an administratively determined
 minimum wage, revised whenever the cost-of-living index rises 2 percentage points,
 and it is sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 The wage was raised to $7.62 (F 36.98) per hour as of July 1.
 The legal workweek is 39 hours, with a minimum break of 24 hours per week.
 Overtime is restricted to 9 hours per week.
 The Ministry of Labor has overall responsibility for policing occupational health
 and safety laws. Standards are high and effectively enforced. Workers have the
 right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations. The law requires each
 enterprise with 50 or more employees to establish an occupational health and safety
 committee. Over 75 percent of all enterprises, covering more than 75 percent of all
 employees, have fully functioning health and safety committees.
