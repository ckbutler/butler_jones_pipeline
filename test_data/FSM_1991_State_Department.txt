 FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA
 The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is composed of 607
 small islands, mostly uninhabited, extending over 1 million'
 square miles of the Central Pacific. Comprise 4 states, Chuuk
 (formerly Truk), Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap comprise the
 federation. The population is estimated to exceed 100,000,
 most of them of Micronesian origin. The four states were part
 of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, administered by
 the United States from 1947 to 1986 pursuant to an agreement
 with the United Nations.
 Political legitimacy rests on the popular will expressed by a
 majority vote in accordance with the Constitution, which is
 based in large part on the U.S. model. There are three
 branches of government: a president as chief executive and
 head of state, a unicameral legislature elected from the four
 constituent states, and a judicial system that applies criminal
 and civil laws and procedures closely paralleling those of the
 United States.
 Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is
 responsible for defense and national security. The FSM has no
 security forces of its own, aside from local police and other
 law enforcement officers, all of whom are firmly under the
 control of the civil authorities.
 The economy depends heavily on transfer payments from the
 United States, fishing, tourism, and subsistence agriculture.
 No major human rights abuses were reported in 1991. However,
 traditional customs sustain a value system which distinguishes
 between people on the basis of social 'status and sex.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS-
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person; Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No political killings occurred.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no disappearances or'abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 A single case of cruel and degrading treatment of a prisoner in
 Pohnpei jail was reported in 1991. The case was brought to
 trial and thoroughly discussed in open court. Guilty parties
 and government offices were fined, with the avowed purpose of
 improving general jail conditions and tightening official
 responsibility for the civil rights of prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Legal procedures for the most part are'patterned after U.S. law
 in its provisions for due process. These provisions are
 carefully observed. There is no exile.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Public trial is provided for in the Bill of Rights, and trials
 are conducted fairly. Juveniles may have closed hearings. The
 Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (currently a U.S. citizen)
 is appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of
 the Congress.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The law prohibits such arbitrary interference, and in practice
 there is none.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are constitutionally assured and faithfully
 observed. Each of the four state governments controls a radio
 station, broadcasting primarily in the local language. Yap
 also controls a small television station. The Federal
 Government and the Governors of Kosrae and Chuuk publish
 newsletters. Several private and municipal newsletters in
 Kosrae, Chuuk, and Pohnpei, however, do not hesitate to
 challenge governmental policies. Religious groups operate
 private radio stations in Pohnpei and Chuuk, and two commercial
 television stations broadcast on Pohnpei.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Bill of Rights guarantees freedom of peaceful assembly and
 association, and these rights are honored in practice. During
 political campaigns, citizens often question candidates at
 public meetings. Formal associations are uncommon in
 Micronesia. Nevertheless, student organizations and at least
 one lobbying group exist.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Federated States is extremely hospitable to diverse
 religions, and missionaries of many faiths work within the
 nation. The Bill of Rights forbids establishment of a state
 religion and governmental restrictions on freedom of religion.
 Most of the citizens are Christians.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel,.Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions in any of these areas. The Compact
 of Free Association permits citizens to travel to, reside in,
 and work in the United States without having to obtain visas.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Congress is elected by popular vote from each state;
 Congress then chooses the President and Vice President from its
 ranks by majority vote. State governors, state legislators,
 and municipal governments are all elected by direct popular
 vote. Elections are conducted honestly, and political
 campaigning is unrestricted. Although there are no
 restrictions on the formation of political groups, to date
 there have been no efforts to form political parties.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights -
 No Human Rights violations have ever been alleged, nor are
 there any known requests for investigations. While there are
 no official restrictions, no local groups concern themselves
 with human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides explicit protection against
 discrimination based on race, sex, language, or religion, but
 the various traditional cultures establish hierarchies of
 social status. These traditional rankings can influence access
 to political office and education, even though such access is
 in principle open to all. Traditional culture is greatly
 respected by the peoples of the Federated States, and is
 protected by Article V of the Constitution. Although the
 traditional social orders are losing ground as Westernization
 and a monetized economy take a greater hold upon young people,
 male dominance remains a fact of life throughout Micronesia.
 Women are still at the early stages of finding jobs-beyond the
 entry level in both the public and private sectors. Their
 roles within the family as wife, mother, homemaker, and
 child-rearer remain virtually unchanged from earlier times.
 Allegations of violence against.women are almost exclusively
 concerned with domestic conflict between husband and wife, and
 wife beating under certain circumstandes still is condoned
 among more traditional elements of the population. While
 assault by a husband or other male relative on women and
 children within the family is a criminal offense under law,
 most women are reluctant to bring formal charges. The general
 attitude is that such issues are best left to the extended
 family unit to resolve. Local support groups are begihning to
 hold meetings in some of the state capitals to publicize issues
 of violence within the family and to highlight the effects of
 widespread alcohol and drug abuse. These meetings serve to
 create a greater awareness of social problems and help to
 publicize the rights of all citizens under the law.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Citizens have the right to form or join associations, and
 national government employees by law may form associations to
 "present their views" to the Government. There are as yet,
 however, no trade unions in this largely nonindustrial society.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no law dealing specifically with trade unions or with
 the right to collective bargaining. There are no export
 processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution specifically prohibits involuntary servitude,
 and there is no evidence of its practice.

 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no law establishing a minimum age for employment of
 children. In practice, there is no employment of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 .The only government-established minimum wage is for government
 workers. It and the wages customarily paid to unskilled
 workers are sufficient to provide an acceptable standard of
 living under local conditions. There are no laws regulating
 hours of work or prescribing standards of occupational safety
 and health, but a federal regulation requires that employers
 provide a safe place of employment.
