 BENIN
 The People's Republic of Benin is a one-party state headed by
 President Mathieu Kerekou, who came to power in 1972 in a
 military coup. President Kerekou declared Benin to be a
 Marxist-Leninist state under the direction of a single
 political party, the People's Revolutionary Party of Benin, in
 1974. The military retains heavy influence in the present
 civilian Government (7 of 15 cabinet members are military
 officers) and in the Political Bureau of the party.
 Benin's armed forces number approximately 3,000 personnel. In
 addition to the regular army, there are small navy, air force,
 and militia contingents. The army is the main internal
 security force, backed by the paramilitary gendarmerie and
 regular police units as well as the presidential guard.
 Benin's underdeveloped economy is largely based on subsistence
 agriculture, cotton production, regional trade, and a low
 level of offshore oil production. In 1988 the economy
 remained depressed due to falling world prices for exports,
 high debt servicing charges, and wide-scale unemployment. The
 Government continued to introduce an economic reform package,
 with projected assistance from the International Monetary Fund
 and World Bank, aimed at reducing the number of state
 enterprises, cutting fiscal spending, and encouraging private
 investment.
 There continued to be significant human rights problems in
 Benin in 1988, including tight restrictions on freedom of
 speech and press. Detention and mistreatment of political
 prisoners continued to be an important issue following the
 publication of a special report by Amnesty International
 (AI). The Government withstood two apparent coup plots in
 1988 and in the process detained several hundred persons.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings, although there
 were rumors of detainees dying in custody as a result of poor
 prison conditions and torture.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1988.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Beninese penal code requires that prisoners be treated as
 appropriate to "prison discipline and security." Mistreatment
 of prisoners and detainees, however, is common. In its August
 1988 report entitled "Benin: Political Imprisonment and
 Torture," AI noted that it had received reports of
 ill-treatment of political prisoners and detainees, including
 beatings, whippings, and "rodeo" torture, in which the victim
 is allegedly forced to crawl on his hands and knees on sharp
 gravel while being beaten by his captors.

 BENIN
 Prison conditions in Benin are very poor. Sanitation and
 medical facilities are deficient, and prison food is
 inadequate unless supplemented by food from friends or
 relatives. AI's 1988 report (covering 1987) stressed the poor
 conditions at Segbana Civil Prison, which was exacerbated by
 the authorities' denying family visits. AI noted that the
 Minister of Interior visited that prison, and subsequently
 detainees were given medical treatment. In April 1988, the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was permitted
 to visit several prisons in Benin, including several known to
 hold political detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Benin's legal system provides for the review of detention by a
 court of law, but this is not applied in political cases. The
 Constitution states that no citizen may be arrested without an
 order of arrest by an established judicial body. However,
 there is no time limit with respect to charginq a defendant or
 bringing the accused to trial. In practice, persons have been
 detained incommunicado, some for extended periods, without
 charge and without recourse to legal assistance or judicial
 hearing.
 The American Association for the Advancement of Science has
 reported that a Beninese physician, Dr. Afolabi Biaou, was
 arrested in November 1984 and has been detained without charge
 since that time. Biaou was previously involved with the
 "Support Committee for Former Political Prisoners" in Benin
 and was allegedly arrested en route to the presidential palace
 where he had been summoned for a meeting. Other long-term
 detainees include Toko Chabi Yako, a university professor
 before his detention in 1985, and Bouraima Male Hossou, who
 has been held without charge for suspected antigovernment
 activities since December 1987.
 AI's 1988 report notes that in 1987 more than 80 persons had
 been held without trial since 1985 or 1986, including many
 University of Benin students. In recent years, political
 detainees and prisoners reportedly have been interrogated by
 the National Commission of Inquiry on State Security, headed
 by a senior military officer, apparently to determine the
 extent of detainee ties to opposition groups. The
 Commission's review led to the release of some detainees in
 1987 and 1988.
 In March the authorities reportedly detained over 150
 Beninese, including a large number of army officers, for
 alleged conspiracy to overthrow the Government. Many of these
 detainees were reported to have been released after
 questioning. A second coup attempt reportedly took place a
 few months later while the President was attending the
 Economic Community of West Africa summit in Togo. At least a
 dozen of Kerekou's closest associates were apparently
 involved, including the head of the presidential guard. The
 precise number of detainees at the end of 1988 was unknown.
 AI estimated that over 200 political prisoners were being held
 without charge in Benin in 1988. Most political prisoners and
 detainees in Benin continue to be held at security police
 facilities, although some individuals are reportedly held at
 military camps.
 There was no evidence that exile was used as a means of
 political control in 1988. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 
 
 BENIN
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Benin's legal system is based on French civil law and
 customary law. In recent years, the Government has used a
 civilian "Revolutionary Court System," organized on provincial
 and national levels, with the Central People's Court as the
 highest court of appeal. In September the Government held
 elections for civilians to sit on local tribunals for the
 first time. The judicial system is not permitted to function
 independently in political cases. In such instances,
 defendants may or may not be permitted legal counsel or
 granted a public trial.
 The Government rarely brings security cases to the trial
 stage. However, at the end of 1988, there were indications
 that the Government was preparing to bring a number of
 political opponents to trial, something which has not occurred
 in Benin in the past 10 years.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Benin's Constitution provides for the inviolability of the
 home and requires a warrant from a judge before the police can
 enter a residence. However, there have been repeated reports
 of forced entries into homes by security forces in political
 cases. Other reports indicate that the security police
 monitor telephones and the mail of suspected persons.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The public expression of political opinion by Beninese is
 tightly controlled. In general, opposition to government
 policies and open criticism of the Government are not
 tolerated. However, the general atmosphere in Benin is not
 one of fear and repression, and many Beninese are willing to
 discuss politics freely in private or in small groups.
 With a few exceptions, the local press, radio, and television
 are all government owned and operated. Exceptions include
 three independent newspapers, as well as La Croix, a weekly
 paper published by the Catholic Church, and Echo, a monthly
 journal of opinion circulated throughout West Africa.
 However, all publications treat political issues with
 circumspection, and journalists practice self-censorship. One
 weekly newspaper published a series of articles questioning
 the practices of the state-run commercial bank, a first for
 Benin. The official media carry only those stories that are
 approved by or serve the interests of the party or the State.
 Academic freedom is restricted with regard to political
 issues, although there is normally no censorship of foreign
 books and artistic works. Foreign periodicals are widely
 displayed on newsstands and foreign radio broadcasts are
 readily available to much of the population through shortwave
 radio. No attempt is made to interfere with radio reception.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are restricted in the political sphere. All
 meetings of a political nature must be sponsored by the single
 political party, and organized public opposition to the
 Government itself is not permitted. In recent years, the
 
 
 16
 BENIN
 Government has permitted the formation of a number of private
 social, service, and professional organizations.
 The Government cracked down on student unrest in 1988. In
 February it handled with restraint a demonstration organized
 by a number of National University of Benin students
 protesting cuts in the education budget. However, in July it
 arrested several student leaders after student demonstrations
 against the high unemployment rate. They were released less
 than a month later.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Christianity, Islam, and traditional religions all coexist in
 Benin, and adherence to a particular faith does not confer any
 special status or benefit. There are no restrictions on
 religious ceremonies or teachings, and religious conversion is
 freely permitted. In September the Government announced that
 national observance of two Roman Catholic holidays, the Feast
 of the Assumption and All Saints Day, would henceforth be
 restored. Several other Christian and Islamic holidays,
 including Easter, Pentecost, Ascension, Ramadan, and Tabaski,
 continue to be observed as national holidays.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic movement is not restricted, although recently
 released prisoners may be subject to travel restrictions.
 Passport and exit permits are necessary for travel outside
 West African countries but are usually not difficult to obtain.
 Emigration is common: many Beninese move to neighboring
 countries to earn a living and do so without jeopardizing
 their citizenship. The Government encourages the repatriation
 of Beninese living abroad but with only limited success thus
 far.
 According to the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees, there are 3,033 identified refugees in Benin,
 largely Chadians who have fled the fighting in their country.
 Many of them are now permanently settled in Benin, although
 they are free to return to Chad if they wish.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The current one-party political system dominated by President
 Kerekou and the Political Bureau provides no mechanism for
 citizens to change their government through democratic means.
 Leadership is exercised by President Kerekou and a small group
 of senior party officials, several of whom also hold positions
 in the Government. The military continues to exert
 considerable influence within the Government. Brigadier
 General Kerekou's 15-member Cabinet includes 7 military
 officers.
 The People's Revolutionary Party controls, among other things,
 the selection of candidates for the National Revolutionary
 Assembly--in theory the principal decisionmaking body of the
 Government--and local government bodies. The Assembly itself
 rarely takes issue with policies formulated by the party
 
 
 17
 BENIN
 leadership. The electoral process allows for some citizen
 participation in the nomination of candidates for the National
 Assembly, and party membership is not a requisite for holding
 office or for civil service employment. The final selection
 of candidates for the single national slate, however, is made
 by the party leadership. No opposition parties or slates are
 permitted.
 While there are no women in ministerial positions, a number of
 women figure prominently in executive-level positions within
 the Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In the past, the Government has considered any attempt to
 investigate human rights practices in Benin to be interference
 in its internal affairs. The 1988 ICRC visit represented an
 important change, but Amnesty International has not yet been
 permitted to visit political prisoners despite repeated
 requests to do so. The establishment of the National
 Commission of Inquiry on State Security to investigate
 political detainees may have been related in part to AI's
 inquiries. The Government did not respond formally to AI's
 special report on torture. At present, there are no internal
 human rights organizations, either official or nongovernmental.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Beninese Constitution states that women are by law the
 equals of men in the political, economic, cultural, and social
 spheres. The Constitution also guarantees that female
 employees have the right to paid maternity leave. The actual
 enjoyment of this benefit is mostly limited to civil servants
 and teachers.
 Although Beninese women have played a major role in the
 commercial sector as well as in small-scale family farming,
 they have not had the same educational opportunities as men.
 Most boys now attend primary school, but only about one out of
 two girls complete the primary grades. Nevertheless, the
 Government officially encourages new opportunities for women,
 and the ruling party's women's organization, the Revolutionary
 Women's Organization of Benin (RWOB), focuses on women's
 issues, e.g., health care. As do other specialized party
 organizations, the RWOB serves to transmit party policy to its
 members and make known women's views to the party leadership.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 While approximately 75 percent of wage-earners belong to
 organized labor unions in Benin, all unions must join a
 general labor organization, the National Workers' Union of
 Benin (UNSTB), an affiliate of the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). The UNSTB frequently plays
 the role of a mass organization of the People's Revolutionary
 Party. Workers are not free to organize and join labor unions
 free of government control. Benin's Constitution states that
 "union activities are guaranteed to workers" but "must be used
 for the elevation of the conscience of the proletarian class
 
 
 18
 BENIN
 and for the augmentation and continued development of
 production."
 While the right to strike is not explicitly denied or
 protected in the Beninese labor code, the last labor strike in
 Benin occurred in 1975 and was forcefully suppressed by the
 Government after 3 days.
 Individual labor unions negotiate with employers on labor
 matters and represent workers' grievances to employers and to
 the Government. The Government often plays the role of
 arbiter. Labor legislation is applied uniformly throughout
 the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited under Beninese law. There were no
 reports alleging use of forced or compulsory labor in 1988.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Beninese labor code prohibits the employment or
 apprenticeship of children under the age of 14 in any
 enterprise. However, enforcement is erratic at best, and in a
 society as poor as Benin's, some child labor doubtless
 occurs. In the subsistence economy, children below the age of
 14 often work on family farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Benin's labor force of 1.9 million (out of a population of 4.5
 million) is primarily employed in agriculture (80 percent),
 with less than 2 percent of the population involved in the
 industrial sector. The Government has given vigorous support
 to policies designed to improve the conditions of workers in
 both the agricultural and industrial sectors. It has, for
 example, committed itself to the gradual extension of free or
 low-cost medical care and social services and occupational
 safety standards.
 The Beninese labor code establishes a 40-hour workweek and
 sets a minimum wage of approximately $40 per month. In many
 instances, however, the Government's ability to enforce labor
 laws and regulations in the wage sector is limited by a
 shortage of administrative and financial resources and a
 difficult economic environment in which unemployment is high.
 The minimum wage level provides for some degree of food and
 housing for a family, but would have to be supplemented by
 other means, such as some subsistence farming.
