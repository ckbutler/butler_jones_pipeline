 MOLDOVA
 Moldova, independent from the Soviet Union since 1991, adopted a new Constitu-
 tion on August 27 which provides for a multiparty representative government with
 power divided among a directly elected president, the Cabinet, Parliament, and the
 judiciary. The first multiparty elections were held in February; ndep endent observ-
 ers considered them generally free and fair. The Democrati Agrarian Party
 achieved a slight majority and formed the new Government with Andrei Sanghell
 as Prime Minister, a post he has held since 1992.
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs has responsibility for the police, who continue to
 employ beatings in dealing with some detainees and prisoners. The Ministry of Na-
 tional Security controls the security organs. The Constitution assigns to Parliament
 the authority to investigate the activities of these Ministries to ensure they comply
 with legislation in effect, and it did so on several occasions. There are credible accu-
 sations that security forces monitor political opposition members and use unauthor-
 ized wiretaps. Opposition parties claimed that Security Ministry officials in some
 cases interfered with opposition activities during the election campaign. No public
 investigation of these charges took place.
 Moldova made considerable progress in economic reform in 1994. A privatization
 program based on vouchers issued to all citizens is under way. Approximately 35
 percent of enterprises will be privatized for vouchers. However, the economy is
 arely based on agriculture, and agricultural privatization ontinues to lag behind.
 Approximately 75 percent of collective farms have become joint stock companies,
 with ownership documents being issued to collective farmers. In addition, over
 12,000 Moldovans have claimed land and are fanning privately.
 The new Constitution improved protection for basic human rights but incor-
 porated language potentially1imiting the activities of political parties and the press,
 especially Article 32, which forbids "ontesting or defaming the State and the peo-
 ple," and Article 41, which declares unconstitutional parties that militate against
 the sovereigty, independence, and territorial integrity of Moldova. Interethnic rela-
 tions improved as the new Parliament delayed the implementation of the controver-
 sial testing for competence in the state language Romanian (Moldovan), which many
 members of the minorities do not speak. The new Constitution guarantees parents
 the right to choose the language of education for their children addressing another
 minority  onern. Based on evaluations from the Council of Europe and the Con-
 ference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Parliament liberalized
 the restrictive draft press law under consideration, addressing many of the concerns
 of journalists regarding the initial draft. A draft "concept" of judicial reform, which
 would strengthen judicial independence, was approved, but many new laws needed
 to implement the concept were not enacted in 1994.
 Moldova remained divided, with mostly Slavic separatists still controlling the
 Transdniester region. This separatist movement, led by a pro-Soviet group, entered
 negotiations with the Government on the possibility of a special political status for
 the region. Progress was blocked, however, by the separatists' demands for "state-
 hood" and the creation of a confederation of two equal states. The CSCE and the
 Russian Federation acted as mediators. There are continuing credible reports that
 Transdniester authorities committed human rights abuses, although the scale of se-
 rious abuses is much smaller than in 1992. The two sides generally observed the
 cease-fire of July 1992, which ended armed conflict between them. In December Par-
 liament passed a law according increased local autonomy to the region in the south
 inhabited largely by the Gagauz (Christian Turkic) minority.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In the Transdniester region con-
 trolled by separatist forces, an attempt was made in March to kill a controversial
 prosecutor, Boris Lucik. Lucik's wife and bodyguard were killed in the attempt, and
 Lucik was seriously injured. It is not known who perpetrated the act; some sources
 accuse organized crime groups, while others accuse political opponents within the
 separatist regime. There were no other reports of politically motivated killings. In-
 formation from the Transdniester region is, however, limited.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no allegations of torture of civil or criminal prisoners by Moldovan au-
 thorities in 1994, but there were credible reports that police sometimes beat pris-
 oners or suspects in their custody.
 
 
 895
 In the Transdniester region, four Moldovans, whose trial was criticized by inter-
 national human rights organizations, corn laned of mistreatment, including beat-
 ings and use of psychoactive drugs by authorities. Their treatment improvedsome-
 what in 1994, and they were permitted more regular access to their families. Two
 other members of this group were released in 1994. One publicly stated that his evi-
 dence at the trial implicating the others had been the result of beatings and intimi-
 dation while in the custody of separatist authorities (see Section 1.e.). The Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which visited ie llascu on two occa-
 sions (1992, 1993) in Tiraspol (Transdniester region), was denied the possibility to
 repeat such visits, despite numerous representations to the Tiraspol authorities.
 Prisoners complained of extremely harsh conditions in prisons, including inad-
 equate sanitation, medical care, and food supplies. Prisoners also reported, credibly,
 that jailers did not intervene toprevent some prisoners from abusing others. In Sep-
 tember parliamentarians formed a special commission to investigate charges of mis-
 conduct toward prisoners and detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The former Soviet Code on Penal Proce-
 dure remains in force with some amendments. Prosecutors, rather than judges,
 issue arrest warrants. Under the new Constitution, a suspect may be detained with-
 out charge for 24 hours (previously, detention of 72 hours was permitted). The sus-
 pect is normally allowed family visits during this period. The 72-hour time limit ap-
 peared to be generally respected; it is too soon to judge whether the new time limit
 is respected as well. if charged, a suspect may be released pending trial. There is
 no system of bail, but in some cases a friend or relative, in order to arrange release,
 may give a written undertaking that the accused will appear for trial.
 Suspects accused of violent or serious crimes are generally not released before
 trial. The Criminal Code permitted pretrial detention for up to 18 months at the
 prosecutor's discretion. The new Constitution permits pretrial arrest for an initial
 period of 30 days, which may be extended to 6 monthi. Although arrest warrants
 are still issued by aprosecutor, the accused has the right under the new Constitu-
 tion to a hearing before a court regarding the legality of his arrest. In exceptional
 cases, Parliament may approve extension of pretrial detention on an individual
 basis up to 12 months.
 According to the new Constitution, a detained person must be informed imme-
 diately of the reason for his arrest, and he must be made aware of charges against
 him "as quickly as possible." The accused is provided the right to a defense attorney
 throughout the entire process, and the attorney must be present when the charges
 are brought.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The independence of the judiciary has increased
 since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The draft 'concept' on judicial reform ap-
 proved by Parliament moves toward further consolidating this independence but
 still falls short of providing a legal framework guaranteeing independence. The new
 Constitution provides that the President, on the nomination of an expert judicial
 body, the Superior Council of Magistrates, appoints judges for an initial period of
 5 years. They may be reappointed for a subsequent 10 years, after which they serve
 until retirement age. The fact that judges may not be removed during their period
 of service should contribute to the independence of the judiciary.
 While the proposed judicial reform would establish regional courts and an appeals
 court, the current structure has only two levels: local courts on the city or district
 level, and the Supreme Court, which acts as an appellate court. By law, defendants
 in criminal cases are presumed innocent. In practice, prosecutors' recommendations
 still carry considerable weight and limit defendants' right to a presumption of inno-
 cence.
 Generally, trials are open to the public. Defendants have the right to attend pro-
 ceedings, confront witnesses, and present evidence. Defense attorneys are able to re-
 view the evidence against their clients when preparing their cases. The accused en-
 joys a right to appeal to the Supreme Court. In a number of cases, decisions of the
 lower court were overturned on appeal.
 Members of the Russian-speaking minority have expressed concern that they will
 not receive equal treatment before the courts. To date, no pattern of discrimination
 has emerged in the judicial system. The new Constitution guarantees the right of
 the accused to have an interpreter both at the trial and in reviewing the documents
 in the case. If the majority of participants agree, trials may take place in Russian
 or another acceptable a   age instead of Romanian/Moldovan.
 There continue to be credible reports that local prosecutors have brought unjusti-
 fied charges against individuals in retribution for accusations of official corruption,
 or for political reasons.
 In 1994 a small group of former Russian army soldiers were convicted of a series
 of auto thefts. Some ethnic Russian groups alleged that they did not receive a fair
 
 
 trial and that their treatment in detention and their sentences were unduly harsh.
 The soldiers appealed their convictions, but the Supreme Court let the sentences
 stand.
 In the Transdniester region, four Moldovans, members of the "Tiraspol Six," re-
 main in prison following their conviction in 1993 for allegedly assassinating two sep-
 aratist officials. Two were released during 1994. International human rights groups
 raised serious questions about the fairness of the trial, and local organizations al-
 leged that the Moldovans were prosecuted solely because of their membership in the
 Christian Democratic Popular Front, a Moldovan party that favors reunification
 with Romania (see Section 1.c.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Accord-
 ing to the 1990 police law, prosecutors, rather than judges, issue search warrants.
 There have been numerous instances in which searches were conducted without
 warrants, and courts do not exclude evidence that was illegally obtained. There is
 no judicial review of search warrants.
 The new Constitution specifies that searches must be carried out "in accordance
 with law" but does not specify the consequences if the law is not respected. It also
 forbids searches at night, except in the case of flagrant crime.
 Opponents of the Government continue to claim that security forces monitored
 and harassed them, especially during the election campaign. It is widely believed
 that the security forces continued to use electronic monitoring of residences and
 telephones in some cases, although confirmation of such activities is lacking. By law,
 the prosecutor's office must authorize wiretaps and may do so only if a criminal in-
 vestigation is under way. In practice, the prosecutor's office lacks the ability to con-
 trol the security organs and police and prevent them from using wiretaps illegally.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech is not abridged, and the
 print media express a wide variety of political views and commentary. National and
 city governments own most newspapers, but political parties and professional orga-
 nizations including trade unions, also publish newspapers.
 Several independent radio stations began operation in 1994, including at least one
 religiously oriented station. The Government continues to control television (except
 for the increasingly popular cable television stations) as well as the major radio sta-
 tions.
 While the Government does not engage in censorship, journalists complain that
 editors encourage them to soften criticisms of government officials in order to avoid
 confrontation and possible retribution. In 1994 the state-run Television and Radio
 Company dismissed a number of employees, citing the need to reduce staff in view
 of budget restrictions. Many employees, alleging that they were dismissed for their
 political beliefs, appealed to the courts and were reinstated. Some press organs are
 making use of the new possibilities for free expression. The city paper of Chisinau,
 for example, published several articles critical of police activities; while the Ministry
 of Internal Affairs responded with an angry and critical rebuttal, there have been
 no reprisals by year's end against the newspaper.
 Parliament considered a new law on the press which journalists strongly criticized
 because it would have limited their right to criticize government policies. Although
 Parliament approved the draft on the first reading, it later adopted a redrafted ver-
 sion of the law taking into account recommendations from the Council of Europe
 and the CSCE, although the draft retains language forbidding "contesting or defam-
 ing the State or the people" (restrictions also contained in the new Constitution).
 This restriction appears to be aimed at journalists publishing material in favor of
 reunification with Romania and questioning the legal right of the Republic of
 Moldova to exist.
 The Government does not restrict foreign publications. Western publications do
 not circulate widely since they are very expensive by local standards. Romanian and
 Russian publications have also become rather more difficult to obtain due to ex-
 pense. Moldova receives television and radio broadcasts from Romania and Russia.
 In the separatist Transdniester region, the authorities cut off financial support for
 two newspapers which had occasionally been critical of some policies and formed a
 new "officia newspaper. In the separatist "capital" Tiraspol, the independent cable
 television station Asket came under pressure from authorities, taking the form of
 attacks on the premises and cut cables, because it broadcast reports critical of the
 separatist authorities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law protects the right to
 peaceful assembly. The mayor's office generally issues permits for demonstrations;
 it ma consult the national Government if the demonstration is likely to be ex-
 tremely large.
 
 
 897
 In 1994 the Government refused permission for opposition parties to use the large
 central square in front of the government buildings for several demonstrations. They
 issued permits for a nearby park or other central locations instead. Officials threat-
 ened to take one opposition leader to court when a demonstration moved closer to
 the government buldings than was authorized but took no action by year's end. In
 October opposition parties demonstrated in the central square despite the lack of
 permission; no action was taken against demonstrators.
 Private organizations, including political parties, are required to register, but ap-
 plications are handled routinely.
 c. Freedom of Reliion.-The practice of religion is generally free. Parliament
 passed a law on religion in 1992 which codified religious freedoms, although it con-
 tained restrictions that could inhibit the activities of some reli ious groups. The law
 guarantees freedom of religious practie, including each :persona right to profess his
 reigio n   any form. It also provides for alternative military service for conscien-
 tious objectors, protects the secrets of thle confessional, allows denominations to es-
 tablish associations and foundations, and states that the Government my not inter-
 fere in the religious activities of denominations. The law, however, also rquires
 that rel.gous grups register with the Government in order to function and that de-
 nominations obtain specific government approval to hire noncitizens. The law also
 prohibits proselytizing.
 Some Protestant denominations are concerned that the prohbition on proselytism
 could inhibit their activities, although many denominations hold large revival meet-
 ings apparently without official interference. To date, the authorities have taken no
 legal action against individuals for proselytizing, despite a substantial amount of
 such activity.
 Although Eastern Orthodoxy is not designated as the official religion of Moldova
 in the law on religion, it continued to be the strongest religious force and exerted
 significant influence. The Government still refused to register the "Metropelitanate
 of Bessarabia--Old Style," which broke away from the Moldovan Orthodox Church,
 under the authority of the Patriarch of Moscow, to adhere to the Romanian Ortho-
 dox Church in 1992. The Government cites unresolved problems connected to the
 new church's property claims as the principal reason it cannot register the gr~oup.
 Priests who have joined this church have credibly alleged that local authorities have
 sometimes harassed them and have taken no action to prevent their harassment by
 priests who remained loyal to the majority church.
 Protestant groups have increased their ties with coreligionists abroad; foreign
 missionaries are aso established in Moldova. Eighteen denominations are registere
 and active in Moldova, including Bahai, followers of Krishna, and Jehovahs Wit-
 nesses-groups that had been denied registration in the past. The Salvation Army,
 however, has not been able to register as a religious denomination because it does
 not meet the requirement of having a Moldovan citizen as the organization's legal
 head. It has aso  en unable to register as a social organization.
 The Jewish community, althouh small, remained-very active in 1994. Jewish
 leaders report that their relations with the Government and local authorities are
 cooperative. There were no reports of organized anti-Semitic activities in 1994. In
 the Transdniester region, Jewish leaders complained about anti-Semitic statements
 made during official celebrations of the .separatist "republic" by an alleged Serbian
 nun, who gave strongly nationalist speeches.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and R-
 patriation.-There are no closed areas or restrictions on travel within Moldova.
 Moldovans generally were able to travel and emigrate freely in 1994. aDurng the
 fist part ofthe year while old Soviet legislation was still in effect, exit visas were
 required and routinely issued. The requirhmet for exit visas was lifted in July. Re-
 strictions on emigration remain in force, however, including the requirement to gain
 the permission of close relatives in order to emigrate. The Government may also
 deny permission to emate if the appiat had access to state secrets. New legis-
 lation, passed in Novenber, retained these emigration restrictions. Such cases, are,
 however, very rare, and none were reported in 1994.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Moldova held its first multiparty parliamentary elections in February. Inter-
 national monitors from CSCE member countries observing the elections deemed
 them enerally free and fair. Some observers, however noted several problem areas,
 including unequal access to the media and the use of state resources by the domi-
 nant party.
 The elections were based on straight proportional representation, with a 4-percent
 threshold for entry into Parliament. Four parties or blocs entered Parliament. The
 
 
 898
 Democratic Agrarian Party, the largest bloc in the former Parliament, won 56 of the
 104 seats. A coalition of the Socialist Party and a minority rights organization called
 Edinstvo (Unity) won 28 seats. The other seats are held by two groups--the Peas-
 ants and Intellectuals Bloc and the Christian Democratic Popular Front-which em-
 phasize the importance of increased use of the Romanian language in public life,
 closer economic and cultural ties with Romania, and increased privatization of agri-
 cultural land. Some members of these groups advocate reunification with neighbor-
 ing Romania.
 The new Constitution provides for the division of power between the popularly
 elected President, the Cabinet, Parliament, and the judiciary. The President, as
 Head of State, in consultation with the Parliament appoints the Cabinet and the
 Prime Minister, who functions as the Head of Government. Most of the mechanisms
 for manifesting this division of power, however, remained untried by year's end.
 Parliamentary elections are scheduled every 4 years, as are presidential elections.
 The new Constitution states that citizens are free to form parties and other social-
 political organizations. A controversial article states, however, that those organiza-
 tions that "militate against political pluralism, the principles of the rule of law, or
 of the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the Republic of
 Moldova, are unconstitutional." Opposition parties, some of which favor rapid or
 eventual reunification with neighboring Romania, have charged that this provision
 is intended to impede their political activities. In September the prosecutor's office
 suggested to the Ministr of Justice the 'suspension7 of the activities of several par-
 ties until they brought their platforms into line with the Constitution. Inparticular,
 the prosecutor stated that the position of the Popular Front in support of reunifica-
 tion was anticonstitutional, as was the alleged support of the Unity party for the
 federalization of Moldova. The Ministry of Justice rejected this view, and the au-
 thorities took no further action in 1994.
 The government press has also strongly criticized opposition parties for campaign-
 ing in favor of amendments to the new Constitution, particularly provisions identify-
 ing the local language as "Moldovan" rather than "Romanian" and those permitting
 the grant of special status to the separatist regions. These parties continue to collect
 signatures to force a vote on their proposed amendments.
 There are a small number of female representatives in Parliament. The Associa-
 tion of Moldovan Women, a social-political organization, competed in the elections
 but received less than 3 percent of the vote. Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, and
 Gagauz minorities are represented in Parliament; debate takes place in either the
 Romanian/Moldovan or Russian language, with translation provided. There are no
 restrictions in law or practice barring the participation of women or minorities in
 political life. However, the increasing use of Romanian/Moldovan in official settings
 may present an obstacle to those members of minorities who do not speak the state
 language, and women are generally not well represented in leading positions of po-
 litical parties. Women hold 5 of the 104 parliamentary seats.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several local human rights groups exist in Moldova. The local Helsinki Watch or-
 ganization maintains contacts with international human rights organizations, as
 does the Helsinki Citizens Assembly, whose president is the chairman of the par-
 liamentary Human Rights Commission and leader of the minority rights movement
 Unity. Human rights groups operate without government interference.
 The Government welcomed and supported the work of the CSCE, which has a
 mission in the country to assist with finding a resolution for the separatist conflict.
 The Transdniester separatist authorities stated that they will cooperate with the
 CSCE mission. However, after almost a year of negotiations, they continued to
 refuse to permit CSCE representatives to participate in all meetings of the tripartite
 commission (Russian, Moldovan, Transdniester) which reviews violations of the
 cease-fire agreement. They did, however, agree to permit the CSCE to participate
 in about hal the meetings, and they allowed the mission improved access to the "se-
 curity zone" along the river dividing the separatist-controlled territory from the rest
 of Moldova.
 Moldova has cooperated with the ICRC in the past, permitting visits to prisoners
 from the 1992 conflict (since released).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The law provides that women shall be equal to men before the law and
 public authorities. They are generally underrepresented in government and leader-
 
 
 899
 ship positions, however, and, according to statistics, have been disproportionately af-
 fectd by growing unemployment.
 Women who suffer physical abuse by their husbands have the right to press
 charges; husbands convicted of such abuse may receive prison sentences (up to 6
 months is not uncommon). Public awareness of the problem of violence in families
 generally is not very high, and no special government programs exist to combat
 spouse abuse. According to knowledgeable sources, women do not generally appeal
 to polie or the courts for protection against abusive spouses because they are em-
 barrassed to do so. Police generally do not consider spouse abuse a serious crime,
 although, when cases do reach a court, they appear to be treated seriously. Women
 and legal authorities do not identify spouse abuse as a common problem.
 Children.-Moldova has extensive legislation designed to protect children, includ-
 ing extended paid maternity leave and government supplementary payments for
 families with many children. The health system devotes extensive resources to child
 care. No special problems with child abuse came to light in 1994.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Moldova has a population of about 4.3 mil-
 lion, of which 65 percent are ethnic Romanian Moldovans. Ukrainians (14 percent)
 and Russians (13 percent) are the two largest minorities. A Christian Turkic minor-
 ity, the Gagauz, lives primarily in the southern regions. They are largely Russian-
 speaking and represent about 3.5 percent of the population.
 Moldova's citizenship law, adopted in 1990, offered an equal opportunity to all
 persons resident in Moldova at the time of independence to adopt Moldovan citizen-
 ship. The CSCE's Office of Democratic Initiatives and Human Rights praised the
 law as being very liberal The law permits dual citizenship on thebasis of a bilat-
 eral agreement, but no such agreements were in effect in 1994.
 Several steps taken in 1994 led to an improvement in the relations between Ro-
 manian/Moldovan and Russian speakers. InRarch citizens participated in a "public
 opinion survey" (actually, a referendum) in which they overwhelmingly voted in
 favor of Moldovan independence. This quieted fears expressed by the Russian-speak-
 ing population rega      reunification with Romania, an alternative which is fa-
 vored by a small minority of Moldovan citizens.
 The new Parliament voted to delay the implementation of the language testing
 foreseen in the language law of 1989 and due to begin in 1994. The principle inher-
 ent in the language law is that, in dealing with any official or commercial entity,
 the citizen should be able to pick the language to use. Officials are therefore obli-
 gated to know Russian and Romanian/Moldovan "to the degree necessary to fulfill
 their professional obligations." Since many Russian-speakers do not speak Roma-
 nian/Moldovan (while all educated Moldovans speak both lages) they argued
 for a delay in the implementation of the law to permit more time to learn the lan-
 guage. Parliament also decided to review the procedures for testing and the cat-
 egories of individuals to be tested. The new Constitution guarantees the rights of
 parents to choose the language of instruction for their children.
 These changes, combined with increased efforts on the part of the new Parliament
 and Government to improve interethnic relations, led to an easing of tensions in
 1994.
 In the separatist region, however, discrimination against Romanian/Moldovan-
 speakers increased. The regime continued its insistence that all Moldovan schools
 in the region use the Cyrillic alphabet only. (The Cyrillic script was used in Moldova
 until 1989, since "Moldovan" during the Soviet era was officially decreed to be a dif-
 ferent language than Romanian, which is written in the Latin alphabet. The 1989
 language law reinstituted the use of the Latin script.) Many teachers, parents, and
 students have objected to returning to the Cyrillic script. They believe it disadvan-
 tages the children, who are less competitive for higher education opportunities in
 the rest of Moldova or even Romania. They further object since it is a return to one
 of the more oppressive and despised policies of the pre-Gorbachev era. There were
 several student strikes against the policy. Some teachers have reportedly been
 threatened, and the regime has applied considerable pressure on the schools. In re-
 sponse to actions by parents and teachers, who blocked railroad tracks in Benderi
 (Tighina) to protest the imposition of the Cyrillic alphabet, the separatist leaders
 made some concessions on this issue.
 People With Disabilities.-While there is no legal discrimination against people
 with disabilities, there are no laws providing for accessibility for them, and there
 are few government resources devoted to training people with disabilities. The Gov-
 ernment does provide tax advantages to charitable groups that assist the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1990 Soviet law on trade unions, which was en-
 dorsed by Moldova's then Supreme Soviet and is still in effect, provides for inde-
 
 
 900
 pendent trade unions. Moldovan laws passed in 1989 and 1991, which give citizens
 the right to form all kinds of social organizations, also provide a legal basis for the
 formation of independent unions. The new Constitution further declares that any
 employee may found a union or join a union which defends his interests. However,
 there have been no known attempts to establish alternate trade union structures
 independent of the successor to the previously existing official organizations which
 were part of the Soviet trade union system.
 The successor organization is the Federation of Independent Trade Unions
 (F1TU). FITU's continuing role in mana    the state insurance system and its re-
 tention of previously existing official union eadquarters and vacation facilities pro-
 vide an inherent advantage over any newcomers who might wish to form a union
 outside its structure. However, its industrial or branch unions are becoming more
 independent entities; they maintain that their membership in FITU is voluntary
 and that they can withdraw if they wish. Virtually all employed adults are members
 of a union.
 FITU has insisted on the right to have union representatives involved in the nego-
 tiations to set wages. It opposed government measures to raise prices before back
 salaries were paid. In the parliamentary elections in February, several high union
 officials endorsed the small opposition Social Democratic Party and ran for Par-
 liament on that ticket. Some of the member unions protested this decision, stating
 that they did not support the Social Democratic Party and did not believe the
 unions should support any party. These steps indicate that F1TU has begun to play
 a role independent of the Government and the governing party.
 Government workers do not have the right to strike, nor do those in essential
 services such as health care and energy. Other unions may strike if two-thirds of
 the members vote for a strike in a secret ballot. There were several very small-scale
 labor actions in 1994 for payment of back wages, including brief strikes by teachers
 at a police academy and employees of a cement plant. Very high hidden unemploy-
 ment and rising open unemployment made worker concerned primarily about job
 security.
 Unions may affiliate and maintain contacts with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Moldovan law, which is still
 based on former Soviet legislation, provides for collective bargaining rights. How-
 ever, wages are set through a tripartite negotiation process involving government,
 management, and unions. On the national level, the three parties meet and nego-
 tiate national minimum  wages for all categories of workers. Then, each of the
 branch unions representing a particular industry negotiates with management and
 the government ministries responsible for that industry. They may set wages higher
 than the minimum set on the national level and often do, especially if the industry
 in question is more profitable than average. Finally, on the enterprise level, union
 and management representatives negotiate directly on wages. Again, they may set
 wages higher than negotiators on the previous level. In 1994 bargaining on the na-
 tional agreement was not completed until July, since management insisted on delay-
 ing negotiations until the new Government was in place after the February elec-
 tions.
 There were no reports of actions taken against union members for union activi-
 ties. The 1990 Soviet law on trade unions provides that union leaders may not be
 fired from their jobs while in leadership positions or for a period after they leave
 those positions. This law has not been tested in Moldova.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Article 44 of the new Constitution
 prohibits forced labor. No instances of forced labor were reported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 under unrestricted conditions is 18 years. Employment of those aged 16 to 18 is per-
 mitted under special conditions, including shorter workdays, no night shifts, and
 longer vacations. The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection is primarily respon-
 sible for enforcing these restrictions, and the Ministry of Health also has a role.
 Child labor is not used in Moldovan industry, though children living on farms do
 sometimes assist in the agricultural sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-The minimum monthiy wage of $3.50 (13.5
 Moldovan lei) was raised to $4.50 (18 Moldovan lei) in July 1994. The average wage
 of $20.25 (81 Moldovan lei) does not provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and family. The new Constitution sets the maximum workweek at 40 hours, and
 the Labor Code provides for at least 1 day off per week. Due to severe budgetary
 constraints, the Government and enterprises often did not meet the payroll for em-
 ployees in 1994.
