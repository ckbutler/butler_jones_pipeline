 WESTERN SAHARA
 The sovereignty of the Western Sahara remains the subject of diplomatic and
 military dispute. Morocco assumed administration of the northern three provinces
 of the Western Sahara after the withdrawal of Spanish forces in 1975 and of the
 southernmost province of Oued ed Dahab in 1979 when Mauritania renounced its
 claim to the area. After unifying the territory, Morocco undertook a massive
 infrastructural and economic development program that resulted in substantial
 growth in the region's cities.
 Since 1973 the Polisario Front, with support from Algeria, has sought independ-
 ence for the Western Sahara by challenging first Spain s and later Morocco's claim
 to the territory. Moroccan and Polisario forces have continued to fight intermittently
 since 1975. Several military actions occurred in the weeks leading up to the U.N.-
 monitored cease-fire that began on September 6, 1991, but no fighting has occurred
 since then.
 At the request of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), the Inter-
 national Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion in 1975. The Court held that
 the ties of Morocco and Mauritania to the Western Sahara did not establish a rela-
 tionship of sovereignty, nor did they affect the decolonization process set out in the
 UNGA resolutions, including application of the principle of self-determination
 through the free and genuine expression of the will of the peoples of the Territory.
 The Organization of African Unity (OAU) attempted without success to mediate a
 solution. In 1981 Morocco agreed to hold a referendum to determine the population's
 wishes regarding independence or integration with Morocco. Attempts to resolve the
 question of sovereignty through mediation or referendum collapsed in 1984 when
 the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), the civilian arm of the Polisario,
 was seated at the OAU summit and Morocco withdrew from the OAU in protest.
 In 1986 Morocco agreed to revive efforts to reach a solution and asked the United
 Nations to administer a referendum; the same year U.N. Secretary General Perez
 de Cuellar began efforts to arrange it. In November and December 1987 a U.N.
 technical team visited the territory to explore the practical arrangements for a ref-
 erendum. On August 30, 1988, Morocco and the SADR accepted in principle the Sec-
 
 
 1067
 retary General's proposal for a referendum under U.N. and OAU auspices, and the
 Secretary General named a special representative to work out the details.
 In April 1991 the Secretary General presented a plan for a referendum in the
 Western Sahara in which the Sahrawis (Western Sahara natives) would decide be-
 tween integration with Morocco and independence. The plan, approved by the Secu-
 rity Council in May 1991, called for a cease-fire established under the supervision
 of a U.N. Monitoring Force (MINURSO), to be followed within 20 weeks by a ref-
 erendum vote. This was to be accompanied by the voluntary repatriation to Western
 Sahara of the Sahrwi refugees in Algeria under the auspices of the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Reugees (UNHCR). The 1974 Spanish census of the region
 was to serve as the basis for the voting list. Morocco challenged the accuracy and
 completeness of the list and presented to the U.N. a supplemental list containing
 in excess of 120,000 names.
 On September 6, 1991, the cease-fire went into effect and the initial MINURSO
 forces were deployed. Similarly, the UNHCR mobilized an international team to im-
 plement the repatriation of Sarawi refugees. Although the referendum was origi-
 nally scheduled to take p lace in late January 1992, the Secretary General an-
 nounced in December 1991that the resolution of the contentious voter identification
 issue would delay the referendum for at least several months. Before he left office
 in late December, the Secretary General presented to the U.N. Security Council a
 report containing proposed criteria for resolving the voter identification issue. On
 December 31, 1991, the Security Council passed a resolution 'welcoming" the report,
 but the Polisario rejected the Secretary General's proposed criteria for eligibility of
 voters.
 On March 3 U.N. Secretary General Boutros-Ghali issued a report to the Security
 Council outlining unresolved problems in the dispute. On March 24 Boutros-Ghali
 named a new special representative for the Western Sahara, Sahabzada Yaqub.
 Khan who undertook to resolve remaining disagreements between the two sides.
 The Secretary General issued further status reports to the Security Council in May,
 August and September.
 The Polisario accused Morocco of undermining the U.N. peace process by: (a) dis-
 patching over 100,000 people from Morocco to the Western Sahara; (b) including the
 Western Sahara in a constitutional referendum and in local and legislative elec-
 tions; and (c) violating the cease-fire. The Secretary General's report of August 22
 noted that it would have been preferable for Morocco to postpone its plans for elec-
 tions and a plebiscite. At his request, Morocco gave formal assurances to the United
 Nations that the voting would not prejudice the final status of the Western Sahara.
 The Secretary General's reports noted a substantial decline in cease-fire violations,
 but attributed almost all ofthe violations to Morocco.
 Since 1977 the northern provinces of Laayoune, Smara, and Boujdour have par-
 ticipated in Moroccan elections. The southernmost province of Oued ed Dahab also
 participated in the 1983 and 1984 Moroccan elections. In the Moroccan Parliament
 that left office in July Sahrawis filled all 10 of the seats allotted to the Western
 Sahara. Three of the four governors of the region, who are appointed by the King
 of Morocco, are Sahrawis.
 When it became apparent in May that a referendum would not be held before Sep-
 tember, King Hassan chose to proceed with national elections, including in the
 Western Sahara. The region participated in the September referendtim to amend
 the Moroccan Constitution, and the Moroccan Government reported that 99.99 per-
 cent of registered voters in the provinces turned out for the referendum, with over
 99 percent approving the changes. The region also participated in October 16 munic-
 ipal elections.
 The civilian population in the approximately 85 percent of the Western Sahara
 under Moroccan control is subject to Moroccan law. U.N. observers and foreign
 human rights groups have reported that Sahrawis often have more difficulty obtain-
 ing passports, that their political views are more closely monitored than those of
 residents of Morocco proper, and that police and paramilitary authorities react
 harshly against those suspected of supporting the Polisario. There were credible re-
 ports in February of widescale arrests of Sahrawi youths, especially in Laayoune.
 Several hundred youths were said to have been held incommunicado for varying
 lengths of time. The Moroccan Government formally denied those charges, counter-
 ing with reports of Polisario human rights abuses. The Polisario also accused Moroc-
 can authorities of mistreating some participants in demonstrations in Laayoune and
 elsewhere in the Western Sahara in October and November 1992, but the Moroccans
 denied these accusations. A number of Sahrawis who returned to Morocco from
 Polisario camps near Tindouf stated that the Polisario tortured and mistreated
 Sahrawis of Western Saharan origin residing in the camps. For its part, the
 Polisario claims that the Moroccans tortured suspected Polisario supporters. Given

 the difficulty of access, neither the Moroccan nor the Polisario allegations can be
 confirmed or refuted.
 In June 1991 King Hassan II of Morocco granted a general amnesty to an unspec-
 ified number of Sahrawi prisoners arrested during military operations or because
 of their alleged cooperation with the Polisario. Many of those released included
 Sahrawis who "disappeared" in the 1970's and 1980's and whom the Moroccan Gov-
 ernment had previously denied holding. Despite this release of about 300 prisoners,
 the Polisario and foreign human rights groups continued to claim that Morocco was
 holding in excess of 800 Sahrawis as political prisoners. The Government responded
 informally to the charge by claiming that the 800 names consisted of people who
 were dead, released former prisoners, and persons who were never detained and
 who reside in Moroccan-controlled territory. The Royal Consultative Council on
 Human Rights (CCDH) asked the Moroccan Government to verify the release of all
 Sahrawi prisoners. The Government provided the CCDH with a list of the released
 prisoners names but did not tell the CCDH which government agency was respon-
 sible for making the list. The Government formally denied that any more Sahrawis
 were in Moroccan detention. Given the reports of arbitrary arrests during the year
 and the Government's history of denying such charges even when true, the accuracy
 of the Government's statements was questionable.
 The UNHCR, using figures provided by the Government of Algeria, estimates that
 approximately 165,000 refugees reside in camps near Tindouf, Algeria. Recently re-
 turned Sahrawis in Morocco and members of MINURSO estimate, however, that no
 more than 80,000 refugees inhabit the camps. They believe that 40,000 to 50,000
 of those are Sahrawis, with the remainder coming from other countries in the re-
 gion. The Government of Morocco alleges that the Sahrawis are held in the Tindouf
 camps against their will, but the Polisario denies these allegations.
 Freedom of movement within the Western Sahara is limited in militarily sensitive
 areas. While technically unrestricted elsewhere, travelers inside and outside the
 cities are reportedly subjected to arbitrary questioning, detention, and even abuse
 by the Moroccan security forces.
 The same labor laws that apply in Morocco apply in the Moroccan-controlled areas
 of the Western Sahara, and enforcement is equivalent to that in Morocco proper.
 Within the Western Sahara there is little organized labor activity. Since salaries in
 both the private and public sectors are significantly higher than those in Morocco,
 wage demands are not an issue.
 Outside the territory controlled by Morocco, the Polisario established a labor wing
 called the Sario Federation of Labor (UGTSARIO), which in the past reportedly en-
 joyed close relations with a few Arab and African national labor centers. The
 UGTSARIO does not engage in customary trade union activities in the Polisario-con-
 trolled areas.
