 IRELAND
 The Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy with a long
 tradition of orderly transfer of power. Individual liberties
 and civil rights are protected by'the 1937 Irish Constitution
 andsubsequent Supreme Court decisions.
 A civilian police force maintains public safety. Successive
 Irish governments have had to deal with the spillover into the
 Republic of terrorist violence 'from Northern Ireland. That
 violence led Irish authorities to adopt special legislation in
 1984 granting the police increased powers to detain and
 interrogate those suspected of acts of terrorism. During 1991
 Irish officials continued to show restraint in exercising these
 powers,
 The Irish economy, based largely on free enterprise, has grown
 rapidly as a result of long-term policies of industrialization
 and diversification which are agreed among government, the labor
 unions, and the business community. It performed well in 1991
 despite continued fiscal austerity and a 17-percent rate of
 unemployment. Exports were strong, and the' budget deficit was
 reduced.
 The Government and people of Ireland attach great importance to
 the observance and maintenance of human rights. There were no
 reports 6f significant human rights abuses in 1991.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 In the past, politically motivated killings have occurred in
 Ireland as a spilloyer from the violende in Northern Ireland.
 In these cases, such groups as the Provisional Irish Republican
 Army (PIRA) or the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) usually
 claim responsibility. The Government uses the full force of
 the law to pursue and prosecute such cases wherever possible.
 In 1991 there was one such political killing in the Republic.
 b. Disappearance
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detention by the Irish authorities.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment are
 prohibited by laws which are observed in practice.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that a person shall be deprived of
 personal liberty only in accordance with the law. This is
 respected in practice.' The same section of the Constitution
 provides for a judicial determination of the legality of a
 person's detention and requires in such cases that the
 arresting authorities make written explanation to the court
 about the person concerned.. Neither in law nor in practice is
 anyone subject to arrest for the expression of political or
 religious views.

 IRELAND
 The use of short-term detention without charges being brought
 is restricted. It is permitted for a maximum of 48 hours in
 cases covered by the Offenses Against the State Act of 1939,
 legislation designed to "prevent actions and conduct calculated
 to undermine public order and the authority of the State." This
 legislation, reactivated in 1972, was broadened to include other
 "scheduled offenses" against peace and order. The police may
 now arrest and detain for questioning anyone suspected of any
 terrorist offense involving firearms, explosives, membership in
 an unlawful organization, or malicious damage to property.
 After the 48-hour period, the person must be brought before a
 magistrate, presented with written charges, and given legal
 representation.
 The Omnibus Criminal Justice Act of 1984 gives the police some
 increased powers in the area of detention for interrogation.
 It did not come into effect until 1987 after implementation of
 the companion complaints procedure. Neither incommunicado
 detention nor exile is used.
 e.- Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is provided for by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. A defendant has the right to legal
 counsel. The courts are independent, and jury trial is the
 norm. 'There is provision for free legal aid and appeal against
 conviction or sentence.
 The Constitution provides, however, for the creation of
 "special courts" to deal with cases in which the "ordinary
 courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of
 justice, and the preservation of public peace and order." The
 Offenses Against the State Act of 1939 formally set up such
 courts and provided that they may try persons for offenses
 against national security, particularly cases of political
 violence perpetrated by terrorist groups likely to intimidate
 regular juries. Rather than having juries, these courts have
 panels of judges, each consisting of an uneven number of judges,
 but in any event not less than three. Their verdicts are by
 majority vote. Rules of evidence generally are similar to those
 of regular courts,- except that the sworn statement of a police
 chief superintendent that the accused is a member of an illegal
 organization is considered prima facie evidence of such
 membership. Court sessions are usually public but may exclude
 certain persons, other than genuine press representatives.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Though not specifically provided for in the Constitution, the
 inviolability of personal privacy, family, and home is affirmed
 by the Supreme Court and generally observed. The Constitution,
 however, provides that the State shall enact no law "providing
 for the grant of the dissolution of marriage." A proposal to
 amend the Constitution to permit divorce in limited
 circumstances was overwhelmingly defeated in a 1986 nationwide
 referendum. In the same year, the European Court of Human
 Rights ruled that the prohibition of divorce is not a breach of
 the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Ireland is a
 party.

 IRELAND
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are provided for bythe Constitution and
 respected in practice. Publication or utterance of
 "blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter" is an offense
 punishable by.law. The law in practice is directed against
 pornographic material.. Convictions result.in sentences
 requiring fines.
 Official censorship is used in certain circumstances. In
 particular, the state-owned radio and television network, on
 the basis, of the constitutional provisions dealing with public
 order and jhe authority of:the State,' denies air time to members
 of organizations ona list that includes (Provisional) Sinn
 Fein, the legal political wing of the illegal PIRA. In 1982
 the Irish Supreme Court upheld this action on constitutional
 grounds.' All political parties not on the list are given
 access to both publicly owned radio and television facilities
 and major independent.daily newspapers. Criticism of the
 Government in such media flourishes. Academic freedom is
 respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are provided for by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Certain terrorist organizations, such
 as PIRA and INLA, however, are illegal, and membership in them
 is an offgnse against national security. Political parties or
 groups associated with such organizations, such as (ProvisiQnal)
 Sinn Fein, are not proscribed.
 c. Freedom-of,Religion
 The population of Ireland is 94 percent Roman Catholic. The
 Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and there are no
 restrictions upon freedom of worship. Some Irish laws, such as
 the prohibition against divorce, reflect the point of view of
 the majority of the population. The atea of family law--
 including the rights of illegitimate children-is the subject
 of current debate in which minority religious communities have
 taken a vocal and active role.
 d. Freedom of Movement-Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of movement within the country, as
 well as freedom-to engage in foreign travel, emigration, and
 voluntary-repatriation. Irish authorities have accepted asylum
 seekers only on a limited basis and firmly apply international
 definitions to those who claim refugee status.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since the end of the Irish civil war in 1923, periodic elections
 have resulted in the orderly transfer of political power. There
 are several political parties, and independents may stand for
 election to either house of the Parliament. The constitutional
 requirement that elections be held-at least every 7 years has
 always been met. Ireland uses a proportional voting system,
 and the secrecy of the ballot is fully safeguarded. There is
 .universal'suffrage for those over 18 years of age.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Irish Council for Civil Liberties operates freely and
 without hindrance as the principal independent organization
 interested in domestic human rights issues. The Council for
 the Status of Women, representing over 70 national women's
 organizations, provides the central focus in Ireland for
 pursuit of legislative and other reforms to end discrimination
 against women and to promote fuller participation by women in
 the social, economic, and political life of the country.
 Irish governments generally cooperate with independent outside
 investigations of alleged human rights abuses, although they
 have not always been receptive to prisoners' rights groups.
 Ireland has also actively promoted observance of human rights
 in various international forums, including the U.N. Human
 Rights Commission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Government social services provide adequate shelter, nutrition,
 health care, and education without regard to race, religion,
 sex, ethnic background, or political opinion. Those whose
 means are inadequate and who are not entitled to other benefits
 may receive pensions or other payments from public funds.
 The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act of 1974 and the Employment
 Equality Act of 1977 seek to provide protection and redress
 against sex and pay discrimination. The Employment Equality
 Agency monitors their operation. The number of cases has fallen
 in recent years, but there has been only modest progress in
 eliminating the differential in the key index of average hourly
 earnings in industry. In June 1990, women's hourly earnings in
 the manufacturing sector were 69.75 percent of men's earnings.
 Violence against women occurs, but there have been no reliable
 studies to show the extent of the problem. The Rape (Amendment)
 Act of 1990 has criminalized rape within marriage. It also
 makes provision for free legal advice to the rape victim.
 Women's groups are seeking the extension of this provision to
 that of actual legal representation, as well as increased
 counseling and other support services for the victims of rape
 and domestic violence.
 The Prime Minister established a new Commission on the Status
 of Women in 1990 with the mandate of promoting greater equality
 for women in all facets of Irish life. As priority objectives,
 the Commission identified child care, training and education,
 the development of employment opportunities, legal rights and
 protection, and the appropriate funding of representative bodies
 and support services. At the Government's request, the
 Commission in 1991 paid particular attention to the needs of the
 full-time homemaker (only a third of Irish women work outside
 the home). In this regard, the Commission obtained from the
 Government an early date for the introduction of legislation
 providing for automatic joint ownership of the family home. In
 addition, the women's movement continues to highlight family
 law, rape law reform, and social welfare discrimination as
 problem areas.

 IRELAND
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely and to strike. The
 right to join a union is guaranteed by law, as is the right to
 refrain from joining. The Industrial Relations Act of 1990
 introduced some limitations on picketing but generally renewed
 legal guarantees of immunity to union members and officials for
 industrial actions with regard to terms or conditions of
 employment.
 About 58 percent of workers in the private and public sectors
 are memqbers of unions. Police and military personnel are
 prohibited from joining unions or striking, but they may form
 associations to-represent them in matters of pay, working
 conditions, and general welfare. The right to strike is freely
 exercised in both the public and private sectors. A 2-week
 strike.by employees of the state-owned Electricity Supply Board
 in the spring of 1990 led the Labor Relations Commission to
 draft a code of conduct for industrial relations in essential
 services which is still underdiscussion by the concerned
 parties.
 The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), which represents
 unions in'both the Republic and Northern Ireland, has 73 member
 unions with 682,592 members. Both the ICTU and the unaffiliated
 unions are independent of the Government and of the political
 parties.* The ICTU is affiliated with the European Trade Union
 Confederation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Labor unions have full freedom to organize and to engage in
 free collective bargaining. Legislation prohibits antiunion
 discrimination. Most terms and conditions of employment are
 determined through collective bargaining, which took place in
 1991 in the context of a national economic pact (Program for
 Economic and Social Progress, or PESP) negotiated by
 representatives of unions, employers, farmers, and the
 Government. PESP included an agreement between the ICTU and
 the Federation of Irish Employers establishing standard pay
 increases for the 3-year period of PESP. In addition, the
 agreement provides for a wage increase of up to 3 percent to be
 negotiated at the local level during the second year of PESP.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1990 established the Labour
 Relations Commission which provides advice and conciliation
 services in industrial disputes. The Commission may refer
 unresolved disputes to the Labour Court. The Labour Court,
 consisting of an employer representative, a trade union
 representative, and an independent chairman, may investigate
 trade union disputes; recommend the terms of settlement, engage
 in conciliation and arbitration, and set up joint committees to
 regulate conditions of employment and.minimum rates of pay for
 workers in a given trade or industry. There are no export
 processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law and does not exist in
 practice.

 IRELAND
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 14 years with the written
 permission of the parents. Irish laws limit the hours of
 employment for those 15 years of age to 8 hours per day and 40
 hours per week. Those from 16 to 17 years of age may work up
 to 9 hours per day and 40 hours per week. These provisions are
 effectively enforced by the Labour Department.
 e.. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no general minimum wage legislation. However, some
 workers are covered by minimum wage laws applicable to specific
 industrial sectors, mainly those that tend to pay lower than
 average wages. Although the lowest of these minimum wage rates
 would not be sufficient to provide a decent living for a family
 of four, additional benefits are available to low income
 families, including subsidized housing and children's
 allowances. WorKing hours in the industrial sector are limited
 to 9 hours per day and 48 hours per week. Overtime work is
 limited to 2 hours per day, 12 hours per week, and 240 hours in
 a year. As part of the national economic pact adopted in 1987,
 the standard workweek has been reduced to 39 hours.
 The Labour Department is responsible for enforcing four basic
 laws dealing with occupational safety that provide adequate and
 comprehensive coverage. There were no significant complaints
 from either labor or management in 1991 regarding enforcement
 of these laws.
