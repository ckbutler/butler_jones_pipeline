 ETHIOPIA
 Ethiopia is ruled by Chairman Mengistu Haile-Mariam and a
 small group of associates who exercise power through arbitrary
 arrest and intimidation. Mengistu's position and continuation
 in power derive from his successful domination of military
 rivals in the years following the fall of Emperor Haile
 Selassie. Mengistu holds the top post of Secretary-General in
 the Workers Party of Ethiopia, which was formally established
 on September 6, 1984. The stated goal of the party is to
 transform the country into a Marxist-Leninist state.
 Marxist-Leninist ideology is pervasive in the press,
 throughout the educational system, in the "kebele" (urban
 neighborhood association) network, and increasingly in the
 military and workplace.
 Ethiopia deploys the largest standing army in Africa south of
 the Sahara, numbering over 250,000 soldiers. It uses this
 power to pursue military solutions to the armed insurgencies
 of varying intensities directed against the Government.
 Ethiopia also supports rebel movements against its neighbors,
 Sudan and Somalia, ostensibly in retaliation for their alleged
 support of Ethiopia's internal opponents. The Government has
 an extensive security apparatus which uses a comprehensive
 system of surveillance and informers to strengthen its control
 over the population.
 Ethiopia's economic problems are considerable and growing in
 scope, in important part due to the imposition on independent
 farmers of a system of collectivized agriculture. One of the
 worst droughts in Ethiopia in a century reached a climax in
 1985. Approximately 7.5 million persons were directly
 affected by the drought, and food shortages and record high
 food prices affected the entire population. Although much of
 Ethiopia had near-normal rains in 1985, lack of seeds, plow
 oxen, and human laborers caused by 3 years of drought greatly
 reduced plantings. The 1986 harvest will remain well below
 Ethiopia's already insufficient average production.
 Ethiopia's record on human rights is deplorable, and 1985 saw
 no improvement. The country remains without civil or
 political freedoms and without institutions or laws to protect
 its citizens' human rights. The Provisional Military
 Government of Socialist Ethiopia (PMGSE) maintains complete
 control over the media, labor, education, internal and
 external movements of Ethiopian citizens, and all political
 processes. Mengistu has never held a general election of any
 kind to legitimize himself or his Workers' Party of Ethiopia
 (WPE). Persons expressing opposition to the regime or
 suspected of not supporting it are routinely arrested by
 security police and subjected to torture in varying degrees;
 some executions have been reported as well. The individual
 citizen may be detained at any time without explanation and
 may be held indefinitely without trial.
 Bombing and shelling of suspected guerrilla positions in
 populated areas by Ethiopian forces, together with frequent
 infighting between rival factions within the dissident groups,
 continued to produce civilian casualties and dislocations in
 the contested areas. Second to the suffering brought on by
 the widespread fighting, the most alarming abuse of human
 rights in 1985 was the Government's massive resettlement
 program, which, after the initial movements, was carried out
 involuntarily with considerable loss in human lives. In
 support of its resettlement effort, the Government closed all
 
 
 104
 ETHIOPIA
 institutions of higher learning for 2 months and transported
 virtually the entire academic population of 21,496 students,
 teachers, and administrators to resettlement areas to perform
 manual labor, often in abysmal conditions. Thousands of party
 cadres have also been required to work in resettlement areas,
 some for more than 8 months at a time. In 1985, the Ethiopian
 Government repeatedly denounced the airlift of Ethiopian
 refugee Jews from Sudan to Israel even as it continued
 severely to restrict the right of all its citizens to emigrate
 freely.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 From time to time during 1985 there were reports of summary
 executions. In the insurgent areas, political killings by
 both government forces and the contending factions continued.
 Guerrilla forces used assassination, sniping, and the mining
 of roadways as tactics against the Government while the
 Government continued to execute captured combatants and to
 bomb civilian population centers. Both government and rebel
 forces are believed to have destroyed crops and homes in their
 opponents' areas.
 b. Disappearance
 As in previous years, there were in 1985 documented cases of
 Ethiopians being abducted without charge by plainclothes
 security police and held incommunicado for extended periods.
 Families are not notified of their relatives' arrest or, if
 they are, are frequently not informed of their whereabouts.
 Prisoners have also disappeared from their jail cells, never
 to be seen again. Six Ethiopian employees of the United
 Nations Economic Commission for Africa, headquartered in Addis
 Ababa, and abducted several years ago by Ethiopian police,
 were finally released in 1985. Amnesty International in its
 1985 report (covering 1984) expressed concern over the
 regime's continued failure to account for some 15 political
 prisoners who disappeared in 1979. Rebel forces have also
 occasionally taken civilian prisoners, including foreign
 nationals. These prisoners are generally not detained
 indefinitely but are required to travel on foot for up to 6
 weeks before being released in Sudan.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 Torture, including severe beatings, crushing of bones of the
 hand, and the use of electric shocks, is reportedly practiced
 in cases involving insurgent combatants and on those engaged
 in activities such as statements or writings against the
 Government. Amnesty International states that torture is
 often practiced on Ethiopian prisoners interrogated at the
 central revolutionary investigation department ("third police
 station") in the capital and is routinely used in other parts
 of the country, such as Nazareth, to interrogate prisoners
 about opposition organizations, especially those engaged in
 armed conflict against the Government.
 
 
 ETHIOPIA
 In Ethiopia's main prison, called central investigations, as
 many as 30 prisoners are assigned to a single room. They
 share mattresses by sleeping head to foot. Blankets are not
 issued. Four such rooms share one toilet. Since the rooms
 are in the basement, there is no natural light or fresh air,
 and a light is on at all times. Food is minimal: three
 pieces of bread and two cups of tea per day. Blankets and
 additional food is the responsibility of the inmates'
 families. Visitors to the prison never actually see the
 inmates but must send items and messages through trusties.
 Inmates are allowed out of their cells for 3 hours each day.
 Interrogations can be scheduled at any time, but beatings are
 usually administered between 5 p.m.and 8 p.m. The inmate
 population is mixed between political prisoners and criminals,
 and it is the political prisoners (mostly Eritreans and
 Tigreans) who receive the majority of the beatings. Older
 prisoners are usually not beaten but are suspended (by ropes
 attached to wrists or under arms) for long periods without
 food or water. Fatalities occur from the beatings. The
 prison clinic dispenses medicine except to political
 prisoners, who are left to recover or not without medication.
 Conditions in one of the main detention centers in the
 capital, where members of the royal family and other political
 prisoners are held, are said to be relatively good.
 Occupational and academic training is available, and books and
 magazines are provided. Families and friends are allowed to
 visit with some frequency. Former prisoners held at the Gebi
 Palace Prison, below Mengistu's offices, have reported that '
 they were relatively well treated, though their quarters were
 crowded and damp, and brief visits by family members were
 allowed only once a year. Those held at Gebi Palace are
 mostly high-ranking officials from the former government.
 However, the son of one of the imprisoned royal family members
 reported that his mother and five other women relatives of
 Haile Selassie are kept in small cells, are not allowed out
 for exercise or fresh air, and are not given access to basic
 medical care.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Ethiopians suspected of antigovernment actions or sentiments
 are subject to arrest or detention without charge or judicial
 review. Remarks considered critical or derisive of the
 Government, failure to attend mandatory political or kebele
 meetings, suspicion of association or sympathy with
 organizations opposed to the Government and, in the case of
 Ethiopian women, suspicion of sexual liaison with foreign
 visitors are all common justifications for arbitrary arrest
 and detention. In most cases, political detainees are held
 incommunicado, at least initially and sometimes for the length
 of their term of incarceration. The term of confinement for a
 suspect held without legal charge is subject to the whims of
 the incarcerators who can be from any level of government,
 from the Politburo down to the local kebele. Prisoners have
 been held without charge for periods of up to 9 years.
 In February 1984, the Government announced that it had been
 holding 18 persons in detention since December 1983 for
 "distributing antirevolutionary pamphlets." There is
 uncertainty regarding the fate of these detainees as only 1 of
 the 18 was known for certain to be alive in early 1985. In
 politically sensitive arrests, the Government generallyprefers
 
 
 106
 ETHIOPIA
 to operate in secret, taking the suspect from home at night.
 However, arbitrary arrest is not limited to the politically
 suspect. Even people with no record of political activity or
 political affiliations are arrested and detained for months or
 longer with no explanation given. In September 1985, the
 Government announced its customary amnesty to coincide with
 national day celebrations. The names of the 88 political
 detainees (described as young and without influence) and the
 689 common criminals released were not revealed. The royal
 family members still imprisoned were not released.
 The Government uses both convict and forced kebele labor.
 Prisoners are used in various construction projects, such as
 road building and forestation. Kebele dwellers, young and
 old, male and female, are obligated to "volunteer" their
 services for work programs upon the demand of kebele officials.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is no discernible separation between the executive
 branch and the judiciary. Courts are subject to political
 control and are responsive to the requests and directions of
 Ethiopia's leadership. Ordinary criminal and civil cases are
 more generally based upon the submission of evidence in a
 public setting. Minor cases are tried at the kebele level,
 while more serious criminal accusations are tried in courts
 where the accused has access to court-appointed lawyers.
 Ethiopian political prisoners generally do not receive trials,
 public or otherwise. No guarantee of a public trial with
 counsel exists, nor is the accused permitted to present
 witnesses or evidence in his or her defense. Political trials
 are almost always held in secret with only the verdict (if
 even that) publicly announced. Prisoners who are cleared of
 charges or whose terms have been completed are not always
 released from prisons.
 There are conflicting reports about the current number of
 political prisoners, which is virtually impossible to estimate
 accurately. If the total includes those taken prisoner as a
 result of ethnic insurgencies, it could well number in the
 thousands. Amnesty International believes thousands are still
 being held without trial or charges.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Warrants are not required for entry into or search of offices
 or private homes in Ethiopia. As a result, forced entry is
 commonly used by the police and security forces, although the
 level of this activity is currently much lower than during the
 "Red Terror" period of 1977-78. However, surveillance of
 individuals, both visual or through listening devices, has
 increased and continues with no legal strictures.
 All mail is subject to monitoring by the Government.
 Ethiopian citizens can be called in at any time for
 questioning by authorities and for mandatory kebele meetings,
 political rallies, or marches. Refusal to appear for any of
 the above may result in imprisonment without hearing. Every
 Ethiopian lives under the watchful eye of local kebele or
 rural dwellers' association officials. These officials
 monitor visitors received, items brought in and out of houses,
 any meetings, and adherence to local curfews. They are also
 
 
 107
 ETHIOPIA
 empowered to arrest anyone whom they deem guilty of illegal or
 suspicious conduct. Ethiopian citizens are often forced to
 join "mass" organizations, including, reportedly, the party.
 In November 1984, the Government began a massive and forced
 resettlement of famine victims, especially from the northern
 regions to other parts of the country. To date, this program
 has involved the removal, transport, and resettlement of over
 500,000 persons, and resettlement of 1 million more is
 planned. Many of these persons have been forcibly rounded up
 in their villages, at relief camps, and at feeding sites and
 confined under armed guard at "transit camps." From these
 camps, they have been transported by Soviet-supplied aircraft
 in extremely crowded conditions to airbases, usually near
 Addis Ababa, and then transported overland in trucks and buses
 under armed guard to resettlement sites. These sites are
 located in primitive wilderness areas totally lacking in basic
 health, sanitation, and other essential services. Those
 resettled are compelled to perform long hours of hard labor
 clearing and cultivating the land while receiving only minimal
 shelter and food rations. Many families are separated through
 the resettlement process.
 Reputable research into the resettlement program has uncovered
 what the researchers called "a consistent pattern of murder
 and severe PMGSE human rights abuses". Several persons who
 subsequently escaped from the resettlement sites claimed to
 have witnessed murder or to have been the victims of beatings,
 imprisonment, deprivation, and what they considered
 enslavement in a regimented work environment where mortality
 rates were exceedingly-high. The resettlement program also
 diverts badly needed transport and logistical support and
 supplies from the famine relief effort.
 In addition, there is another large program underway, called
 villagization, which moves people off their farms and into
 newly prepared villages. The old homes are either moved to
 new sites or destroyed so people will not return. The purpose
 of the program appears to be better political control. The
 program appears to be detrimental to food production and
 coercive in nature.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no freedom of speech or press in Ethiopia. The
 Government owns and operates all information media and
 exercises censorship through editorial boards and the Ministry
 of Culture. Expression of political opinion which is
 unauthorized or at variance with the official government line
 can result in imprisonment. Political, economic, and social
 policies in Ethiopia are formulated at top levels of
 government, then disseminated and monitored through the
 government-controlled media and government-organized citizens'
 groups, i.e., women, youth, worker, and peasant associations,
 kebeles, and military commissariats.
 In particular, the Government closely monitors the
 pronouncements of public officials, academics, and clergy.
 Some instructors and professors in secondary schools and at
 the university have resisted the politicization of education.
 Academic freedom, although circumscribed, especially in the
 political and social sciences, still finds limited
 
 
 108
 ETHIOPIA
 expressionat the university. Private secondary schools, where
 affluent Ethiopians can send their children, are mostly free
 of political orientation. Many, including people in the
 Government, seek to send their children abroad for education.
 Books and magazines can be confiscated if deemed opposed to
 the revolution. Foreign magazines and newspapers are not
 readily available. Foreign radio broadcasts are widely
 listened to in Ethiopia. There is no evidence of overt
 attempts by the Government to interfere with radio reception.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Assembly of any sort not previously approved by the Government
 is strictly forbidden under penalty of arrest. In contrast,
 attendance at government-backed rallies, meetings, and parades
 is mandatory and enforceable by arrest and detention.
 Ethiopians are cautious in their associations with one another
 and with foreigners. There is a pervasive system of informers
 and surveillance. Frequent association with foreigners can
 result in questioning, arrest, and detention. Professional
 associations such as the Rotary and Lions are allowed to
 operate, though their membership and activities are presumably
 monitored by the Government.
 Workers are not permitted to organize independently in
 Ethiopia, and labor-management negotiations are not allowed.
 Strikes and slowdowns are strictly forbidden. The only labor
 organization allowed to operate is the government-controlled
 All-Ethiopia Trade Union (ATEU). The ATEU, one of Ethiopia's
 .mass organizations," is basically a political group utilized
 by the Government to implement its policies, expand party
 control within the workplace, and prevent work stoppages. A
 number of AETU's top leaders have been trained in Eastern
 Europe, and the organization has close ties with Soviet and
 East European labor organizations. The 1985 report of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of Experts
 criticizes the mandatory single trade union structure in
 Ethiopia and repeats its request that freedom of association
 be extended to rural workers and public servants.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 With the overthrow of the Haile Selassie regime, the Ethiopian
 Orthodox ("Coptic") Church lost its favored position, along
 with its lands and most of its property. The Government
 allows the Orthodox Church and the Muslim religion (each
 claims to make up about 50 percent of Ethiopia's population)
 freedom .of worship and proselytism. However, the Orthodox
 Church has government-appointed officials within its
 administration to ensure its conformity.
 Orthodox and Muslim holidays are recognized by the Government,
 and officials of both religions are allowed to exercise
 jurisdiction over civil matters such as marriages. There is,
 however, a continuing effort to deemphasize the presence and
 importance of religion in Ethiopian life, e.g., references to
 any deity are expunged from dialogue in television programs
 and movies, and are forbidden in government statements or
 publications. Nevertheless, in 1985 there was a notable
 resurgence in religious observances and church attendance,
 deemed by many to be a popular response to the regime's
 efforts to curb religion.
 
 
 109
 ETHIOPIA
 In May 1985, the state-appointed administrator of the
 Ethiopian Orthodox Church attempted to remove certain
 religious artifacts from a church in Addis Ababa. An angry
 mob of worshipers prevented the removal, killing a
 state-sponsored priest and a deacon in the melee.
 Other religions, particularly protestant evangelical
 organizations', have found their activities sharply curtailed
 by the Government, through the closure of churches, the
 seizure and nationalization of property and facilities, and
 harassment and surveillance. At least one organization's
 congregation, its leader imprisoned since 1977, now assembles
 in secret "safe areas" for worship and other church-related
 meetings. The Government gives permits to foreign
 missionaries to enter and work in Ethiopia in limited numbers,
 although usually as development specialists, not as
 missionaries. Amnesty International's 1985 report notes that
 over 40 officials of the Ethiopian Evangelical Mekan Yesus
 church had been detained, with 17 still imprisoned at the end
 of 1984 for their nonviolent beliefs.
 There has been considerable illegal emigration by Ethiopian
 Jews (Falashas) during 1985, continuing a trend started in
 previous years. Legal emigration of this group is greatly
 restricted. The Government reacted angrily to the
 humanitarian airlifting of thousands of Ethiopian refugee Jews
 from Sudan to Israel, denouncing it as "kidnapping." Access
 by foreign Jewish and Israeli visitors to Falasha villages in
 the Gondar region was erratic and shut off for much of 1985.
 Frictions continue to mark government relations with the
 Ethiopian Jewish community, resulting from government efforts
 to prevent emigration, to restrict Hebrew instruction, and to
 force Marxist-Leninist indoctrination. Although Ethiopian
 Jews live in areas of insurgency (Tigre, Gondar) where they
 are frequently caught in military crossfire, stories of
 "genocidal" actions by Ethiopian authorities or of highly
 brutal behavior toward Falashas appear to be unfounded.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Restrictions on freedom of travel within Ethiopia exist as a
 result of the insurgencies (several areas, mainly in the
 northern administrative zones, are closed to travel for
 security reasons). Moreover, permission is required for
 Ethiopian citizens to change their places of residence, and
 persons considered politically suspect may even be forbidden
 to travel outside their home areas.
 Travel abroad by Ethiopians is heavily restricted by the
 Government. A passport application can be denied for failure
 to attend the mandatory Sunday morning political meeting or to
 "volunteer" for kebele work activities. It is not unusual for
 bribes to be solicited when an application is received.
 During 1985, as in the past, issuance of external travel
 permits to Ethiopians was occasionally shut off with no
 warning, then suddenly renewed shortly thereafter.
 Emigration is highly restricted except in special
 circumstances such as marriage to or adoption by a foreign
 national, although some emigration has been allowed on the
 basis of family reunification. Leaving Ethiopia without
 authorization is regarded by the Government as a serious
 offense punishable by 5 to 25 years' imprisonment or, in
 
 
 110
 ETHIOPIA
 exceptional cases, reportedly by death. There is nonetheless
 considerable illegal emigration, undertaken either under the
 subterfuge of travel abroad for business or to visit
 relatives, or by arduous treks overland and surreptitious
 crossing of the border.
 The Government recognizes the right of voluntary repatriation,
 and its proclamation of mass amnesty for those Ethiopians
 living abroad (numbering more than 1 million) remains in
 effect. The Government does not forcibly repatriate refugees
 from other countries. There are approximately 180,000
 Sudanese resident in Ethiopia, some of whom are genuine
 refugees, others of whom are persons displaced by drought and
 insurgency in Southern Sudan.
 The drought/famine and civil strife severely affected many
 areas in Ethiopia and displaced a large number of persons who
 crossed over into neighboring countries, especially Sudan, in
 search of food. With the return of near-normal rains in 1985,
 many of these displaced persons voluntarily returned to their
 homes. Eyewitnesses reported that groups of such displaced
 persons and others transporting relief supplies have at times
 been strafed by the Ethiopian Air Force, although this may
 result from a misidentification of those crossing the border
 as rebel troops. There were approximately 500,000 Ethiopians
 in camps in Eastern Sudan at the end of 1985. There is no
 evidence that the Government discriminates against these
 persons upon their return to Ethiopia.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Ethiopian citizens have no legal right or means to change
 their Government. All power to determine policy in Ethiopia
 resides in the upper echelons of government, led by Chairman
 Mengistu and a small group of former military officers.
 Political and economic policies are dictated to the
 population. The Provisional Military Government of Socialist
 Ethiopia invariably claims to be speaking on behalf of the
 whole Ethiopian people. The Workers' Party of Ethiopia
 purports to offer Ethiopian citizens a means of participation
 in government, but its role is to ensure that all government
 ministries, mass organizations, and nationalized businesses
 remain faithful to Marxist-Leninist principles. Kebeles and
 peasants' associations, which are the primary party/government
 control mechanisms at the local level, control housing
 allocation, basic food rationing, political indoctrination,
 and implement other government policies, such as registering
 youths for national military service.
 The highest government echelons are no longer dominated by the
 Amhara ethnic group but include many Oromos and some Eritreans
 and Tigreans. Almost all senior government and political
 figures are of Christian origin although the population is 50
 percent Muslim. Women are very poorly represented at the top
 echelons of government. Only one woman, a vice minister,
 holds a senior position.
 Plans are currently underway to adopt a new constitution
 which, according to reports from the party congress in March
 1985, would provide for the creation of a People's Democratic
 Republic of Ethiopia and representation by "nationality" or
 ethnic group in national and regional parliaments. The extent
 of autonomy that will be permitted groups such as the
 
 
 111
 ETHIOPIA
 Eritreans, Tigreans, and Oromos is not clear. Until that key
 issue is resolved to the satisfaction of the population,
 antigovernment insurgencies will continue.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There is no governmental or private body to investigate
 alleged human rights violations. The Government opposes any
 attempt by international and nongovernmental organizations to
 investigate such allegations. Representatives of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Addis Ababa
 are not allowed to visit political prisoners, though they are
 allowed to visit prisoners of war from the 1977-78 war with
 Somalia. Moreover, the ICRC does not have access to prisoners
 taken in fighting with insurgent groups or 'to prisoners held
 by Ethiopian-backed rebel groups opposing the Governments of
 Sudan and Somalia. In December 1985, Ethiopia expelled a
 private French relief organization, Doctors Without Borders,
 for alleged criticism of the forced resettlement program.
 Some of Amnesty International's concerns, as expressed in its
 1985 report, are included in l.b., l.c., and 2.c. above.
 Freedom House rated Ethiopia as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Ethiopia's first census indicated that its diverse population
 reached 42,266,000 in 1985 and is growing, according to 1984
 World Bank data, at more than 2.7 percent per year.
 Approximately 85 percent of the population lives in rural
 areas, and the majority resides over half a day's walk from an
 all-weather road. Ethiopia's per capita income in 1983 was
 about $120, one of the lowest in the world. Of the more than
 40 different ethnic groups, the Ahmara, Tigreans, and Oromo
 make up more than three-fourths of the population.
 According to the World Bank, gross domestic product grew at an
 average rate of 2.3 percent during the decade ending in
 1982/83. However, the economy is currently suffering not only
 from the drought and civil strife (military expenditures take
 25 percent of the budget) but also from ideological
 constraints, notably in the PMGSE efforts to impose upon its
 nation of small, independent farmers a system of inefficient
 collectivized agriculture and state farms, especially in the
 resettlement areas. The PMGSE also imposes artificially low
 official market prices on the sale of basic foodstuffs and
 forces farmers to sell at these prices. Lacking essential
 incentives to produce, Ethiopia's farmers have tended to
 reduce their production to that amount needed for their
 families. At the same time, industrial production is
 stagnating due to overcentralization (there is government
 ownership of almost all industrial facilities), shortages in
 spare parts (due to chronic foreign exchange problems), a lack
 of capital investment, and managerial inefficiency.
 In February 1985, the Government announced an austerity
 program which has further slowed economic activity. Imports
 have again been reduced, gasoline rationed, and a special
 drought emergency tax of 1 month's salary per annum imposed on
 all wage earners earning over $25 per month. While consumer
 prices have soared, wages have not risen in 10 years. The
 rate of underemployment plus unemployment in Ethiopia's cities
 and villages is reportedly around 50 percent.
 
 
 112
 ETHIOPIA
 The Government has attempted to increase health and
 educational services to the peasantry and urban poor.
 Currently, the infant mortality rate is 167 per 1,000 live
 births, and life expectancy at birth is 48 years. The caloric
 supply as a percentage of requirements was 79 percent in 1977,
 the last year for which statistics are available, and may have
 dropped since then due to drought and civil strife. There is
 1 doctor per 75,000 persons and 1 nurse per 5,320 persons.
 Infectious disease is rampant, including leprosy,
 tuberculosis, and trachoma. Only 14.5 percent of the
 population had access to safe drinking water in 1980. Even in
 urban areas, where 82 percent have access to safe water, lines
 at water pumps are common, and open ditches are used as sewers.
 The World Bank cited a 12.8 percent literacy rate in 1974, and
 while recent Bank data are not available, the Government
 claims the literacy rate rose to 54 percent in 1985. This
 growth is related to the Government's efforts to expand access
 to educational facilities, especially for the rural and urban
 poor. The primary school enrollment ratio reportedly
 increased from 19 to 37 percent between 1973 and 1981, (male
 46 percent, female 27 percent in 1981). The Government has
 invested considerable effort in adult literacy campaigns and
 rewards those who volunteer to teach in them with travel
 permits and other highly prized privileges. University
 enrollment has expanded considerably, to approximately 12,000
 day students and over 8,000 extension students. Ethnic Oromo
 students have been given opportunities for advanced studies
 that were largely unavailable under the previous regime.
 While consumer prices have soared, wages have not risen in 10
 years. Wage earners at the bottom of the pay scale can no
 longer be said to earn a salary that provides a decent living
 for a worker and family.
 The minimum age for nonfarm labor is 14 and seems to be
 respected. The maximum legal work week in Ethiopia is 48
 hours, which is generally respected in practice. "Voluntary"
 work campaigns at places of employment are growing
 increasingly common. Workers "volunteer" to work extra hours
 and weekends, so that factory or office quotas can be
 achieved, but receive no pay for these hours. Although the
 right of workers to an annual vacation, is guaranteed by law,
 in practice government workers are usually not allowed such
 time off. Employers in private industry, however, are obliged
 by the Government to respect this law. Health and safety
 codes for the workplace are rudimentary and remain unenforced.
 Various U.N. studies indicate Ethiopian women are subject to
 many disadvantages, encountering inter alia cultural and
 traditional biases, marriages imposed at a very young age,
 hard and time-consuming labor in rural areas, and inadequate
 employment opportunities and decent wages in urban areas.
 Village leadership is invariably male, and all clergy are
 male. However, women in the central Ethiopian cultures
 (Oromo, Amhara, Tigre) enjoy economic rights equal to those of
 men. They may inherit, sell, or buy property and engage in
 business. Women have a subservient status within the home,
 and child marriages remain common in some rural areas despite
 opposition by the Government. Female circumcision is
 practiced in the northern parts of the country, although the
 Government has stated its opposition to this practice. The
 Revolutionary Ethiopian Women's Association, a "mass
 organization" created in 1980, has the proclaimed goal of
 improving the status of women.
