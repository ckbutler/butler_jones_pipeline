 AUSTRALIA
 Australia is a longstanding, multiparty, parliamentary
 democracy operating within a federal system of government.
 Federal elections were held in July 1987 and will be held
 again before November 21, 1990.
 Australia's developed economy, with important mining and
 agricultural sectors, provides most Australians with a high
 per capita income. Furthermore, the Government provides
 assistance for the minority of relatively disadvantaged
 citizens. Individuals are free to hold private property, to
 pursue their economic and personal interests, to associate
 with others, and to organize trade unions.
 Australia has been in the forefront of those countries
 promoting human rights both domestically and internationally.
 Fundamental human rights are assured by law and respected in
 practice. The Government makes a major effort to investigate
 reports of discrimination.
 Protection of the rights of Australia's approximdately 180,000
 Aboriginals is a demonstrated concern of the Government, which
 recognizes that they are the group in Australia most
 disadvantaged economically and by societal discrimination,
 historically and currently. As Australia approaches its 1988
 celebration of the bicentennial of European settlement, public
 attention to Aboriginal concerns has increased, and the
 Government is contemplating a more formal delineation of
 Aboriginal rights than currently exists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for political motives by the Government or by
 Australian political organizations does not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no instances of political disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Australian law prohibits all these practices, and this
 prohibition is respected. Prison conditions are good.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Australian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment.
 This prohibition is respected in practice. Australia has
 ratified and fully respects International Labor Organization
 (ILO) Convention 105 concerning forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Australian law provides for the right to both a fair hearing
 and a fair public trial with an unimpeded right of counsel.
 Free counsel is provided to indigents accused of crimes.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under Australian law and in practice, no search may be
 conducted without a judicially issued warrant. Australia is a
 nation of liberal political traditions and common law, and the
 Government does not interfere with the privacy of family,
 home, or correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a.. Freedom of Speech and Press
 A functioning democratic political system, an effective
 judiciary, and a large, diverse, and independent press combine
 to ensure freedom of speech and the-press.
 b.. Freedom of Peqceful Assembly and Association
 Although Australia,does not have a bill of rights, it is a
 signatory to, the U.N. International Covenant on Civil and
 Political;Rights, which provides for freedom of assembly and
 expression-
 Australian law and practice afford workers great freedom to
 establish and to join trade unions, to choose their union
 representatives, to formulate union programs, and to be
 represepted'in negotiating the prevention and settlement of
 disputes with employers. Unions are extremely active and
 powerful. Industrial disputes are arbitrated by a system of
 industrial courts.
 c, Freedom of Religion
 Australians have complete freedom of religion. A provision in
 the Cqnstitution precludes the adoption of an official state
 religion. Australians are free to maintain links with
 coreligionists abroad.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within or outside of
 Australia, including the right of emigration and repatriation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Australians participate in their government by electing a
 two-chamber Federal Parliament as well as numerous state and
 local bodies. Voting is compulsory in general elections for
 Australians 18 years of age and over.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 It is the Government's policy to respond to any communication
 from the United Nations alleging violations of human rights in
 Australia. The Government also allows unimpeded access to all
 international and nongovernmental groups investigating alleged
 human rights violations.
 
 
 AUSTRALIA
 Internationally, Australia has been active in promoting human
 rights as a member of the U.N. Human Rights Commission, the
 U.N. Working Group on Indigenous Populations, and in other
 forums.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 By law, Australia's people have equal access to government
 services without reference to race, sex, religion, language,
 or social status. Basic food, shelter, health care, education,
 and social security benefits are assured for all. The Racial
 Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimination on grounds
 of race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin.
 Aboriginal groups and others claim that the Aborigines suffer
 widespread discrimination. The Government acknowledges that
 the Aboriginal population is the most disadvantaged group in
 such areas as education, housing, health, and employment. In
 addition to the broad range of programs available to all
 Australians, the Government provides services specifically
 aimed at improving Aboriginal socioeconomic conditions. In
 1987 the Government created a Royal Commission to investigate
 Aboriginal cell deaths, some 53 of which have occurred since
 1980.
 Aboriginal land rights remain a controversial issue. The
 present Federal-Government is committed to some form of land
 rights legislation, preferably implemented by the states.
 However, prospects for such legislation at any level of
 government appear remote over the short term.
 The Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 prohibits discrimination on
 the basis of sex, marital status, or pregnancy. Women
 constitute 39.9 percent of the Australian work force.
 Although women are beginning to enter jobs previously occupied
 only by men, they remain concentrated in a narrow range of
 occupations predominantly occupied by females and characterized
 by relatively low pay and status. In 1986 the Government
 passed affirmative action legislation obliging employers to
 take corrective action where there is underrepresentation of
 women employees.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Australia has long had a tradition that workers should be
 guaranteed a decent standard of living. The minimum wqge is
 reviewed every 6 months by the Federal Arbitration and
 Conciliation Commission with this in mind. A complex body of
 regulations and commission decisions prescribes the 40-hour
 (often 38-hour) week, paid vacations, and health and safety
 standards in the workplace, as well as other benefits for the
 overwhelming majority of Australian workers. Australia is in
 the forefront of countries adopting regulations to protect
 children from dangerous or unsuitable employment.
