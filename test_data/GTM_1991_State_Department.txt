 GUATEMALA
 The Constitution calls for election by universal suffrage of a
 one-term president, a unicameral Congress, and municipal
 officers; it mandates an independent judiciary and a Human
 Rights Ombudsman, who reports to Congress. Jorge Serrano won
 the 1991 presidential elections with 68 percent of the vote,
 taking office on January 14. Several hundred foreign observers
 and journalists monitored the elections and found them to be
 free and fair.
 The armed forces operate with significant institutional and
 legal autonomy, particularly in security and military matters.
 The army, which has responsibility for national security, has
 been fighting a leftist insurgency for 31 years; it includes a,
 Mobile Military Police (PMA) that guards key facilities and has
 a limited anticrime role. The National Police and the Treasury
 Police report to the Interior Minister, a civilian. About
 500,000 men in Voluntary Civil Defense Committees (CVDC), more
 commonly called Civil Self-Defense Patrols (PAC), perform
 counterinsurgency operations in rural areas. Despite a
 constitutional prohibition, membership in the PAC's in conflict
 zones is often involuntary. The security forces and the PAC's
 committed numerous and serious human rights violations during
 1991.
 Agriculture and commerce dominate the largely private
 enterprise economy, with coffee, cotton, sugar, and bananas
 accounting for the bulk ofexport earnings. During its first
 months, the Serrano Government took steps to combat inflation.
 stabilize exchange rates, lower interest rates, and carry out
 other economic and fiscal reforms. The economy grew at a real
 rate of3.2 percent.
 In 1991 the military, civil patrols,, and the police continued
 to commit a majority of the major human rights abuses,
 including extrajudicial killings, tortUre, and disappearances
 of, among others, human rights activists, unionists, indigenous
 people, and street children. The motive behind many of the
 abuses appears to be the belief, whether factual or based on
 spurious information, that the victims were in some way
 supportive of or sympathetic to the guerrillas. Guerrillas
 also committed human rights violations, including killings of
 policemen and others, kidnapings, forced labor and recruitment,
 wide use of mines and other explosives, and the use of children-
 in combat.
 Many human rights cases in which the United 'States had
 officially expressed interest remained unsolved, such as: the
 1985 disappearances of U.S. citizens Blake and Davis, the 1989
 kidnapings of several Rununel Junam Council of Ethnic
 Communities (CERJ) members, the disappearance and murder of
 university students, the kidnaping and abuse of American nun
 Diana Ortiz, the knife attack on members of the Peace Brigades
 (PBI), the murders of Hector Oqueli, Gilda Flores, Gonzalez
 Gamarra, and Villanueva de Barrera in 1990, and the
 disappearances of Maria Tiu Tojin and her daughter from a
 relocation center in 1990. The Army High Command continued to
 impede a thorough investigation into the murder by army
 personnel of American citizen Michael Devine in 1990. Because
 of a lack of sufficient progress on human rights in Guatemala,
 the United States has not resumed its military aid program,
 suspended since December 1990.
 Despite continuing serious abuses-and lack of progress on many
 cases, the current Government has shown more political will
 
 
 614
 GUATEMALA
 than its predecessor in promoting respect for human rights and
 in pursuing violators. President Serrano has demonstrated a
 commitment to control the military and to end the impunity of
 human rights violators. Two army personnel, including an
 officer, were arrested for the 1990 Santiago Atitlan massacre
 and were convicted and sentenced to prison, and a suspect tied
 to the military staff of former President Cerezo was arrested
 in the 1990 Myrna Mack murder case (see Section l.a.). A few
 PAC members were arrested for the murders of some human rights
 activists. In August the President announced the creation of a
 cabinet-level Human Rights Commission to advise him and respond
 to reports of violations. The military agreed to participate
 in peace negotiations led by President Serrano with the
 Guatemala National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) guerrilla
 coalition. Overall, the human rights situation improved from
 1990, with the greatest improvement seen in the willingness of
 increasing numbers of Guatemalan organizations and individuals
 to address publicly and openly sensitive human rights issues.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from-
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Media and other reports indicated the 1991 murder toll to be
 higher than the official figures of 1,800 to 2,000. While
 common crime caused the vast majority of violent deaths, the
 number of politically motivated killings, though fewer than in
 1990, was very high. Preliminary reporting from the Human
 Rights Ombudsman listed 258 complaints of political killings
 (compared to 304"for all of 1990). The Archbishop's Human
 Rights Office reported 575 political executions for the same
 period; a local human rights group, the Mutual Support Group
 (GAM), reported 796 "political killings" but did not define the
 term.
 Most of these killings are credibly believed to have been
 committed by the armed forces and persons associated with or
 protected by the army, such as the civil defense patrols. Most
 of them took place in areas of military-guerrilla conflict,
 where the military often fails to distinguish between
 guerrillas and noncombatants. The security forces were
 probably involved in many vigilante killings of criminals or
 criminal suspects. The criminal backgrounds of many of these
 victims suggests that the killers had access to police, court,
 and prison data.
 The security forces are virtually never held accountable for
 human rights violations. With few exceptions, the Government
 failed properly to investigate, detain, and prosecute
 perpetrators of extrajudicial and politically motivated
 killings. Often the army fails to cooperate with police,
 courts, and prosecutors to bring to justice army personnel
 involved in abuses. This was particularly evident throughout
 1991 in the stalled investigation of the murder of American
 citizen Michael Devine in 1990. The Ombudsman, the Attorney
 General, and human rights groups have also found unambiguous
 eyewitness and physical evidence of killings by the PAC's;
 several clandestine cemeteries were found containing summarily
 executed victims, some showing signs of torture. PAC leaders
 enjoy army backing and virtual de facto immunity from
 prosecution, and they are feared in many rural communities.
 
 
 615
 GUATEMALA
 The armed forces and PAC's frequently threatened and sometimes
 killed human rights activists. CERJ is a rural-based human
 rights organization dedicated mainly to opposing involuntary
 service in the civil patrols. Juan Perebal and one son,
 members of CERJ, were shot dead near Chunima (Quiche
 Department) on February 17. Another son survived the shooting
 and identified the attackers as Manuel Perebal Ajtzalam and
 Manuel Xon Lares, former PAC leaders. The victims had
 previously implicated the two attackers in the 1990 kidnaping
 of Sebastian Velasuez Mejia, another CERJ member who was later
 found dead. The two ex-PAC leaders had more than 10
 outstanding arrest warrants, and efforts by police to arrest
 them failed when armed civil patrol members intervened.
 However, due to the intervention of President Serrano, in July
 both surrendered, and judicial proceedings were under way at
 year's end. Other such killings included CERJ members Miguel
 Tzoy Colel, who had received death threats for refusing to join
 a PAC; Toman Ventura Xon; Celestino Vicente Julay; and Camilo
 Ajqui Jimon who, according to one credible report, was attacked
 with knives and nearly decapitated by three men who also
 threatened his wife.
 There were several notable extrajudicial killings of political
 party members, an army general, and a police investigator. In
 April, two men in Guatemala City killed Dinora Perez, a young
 woman involved in forming a new leftist political party, the
 United Guatemala Party (PGU). In 1991 most PGU members,
 including 1985 Social Democratic Party vice-presidential
 candidate Luis Zurita, fled abroad. The killers clearly meant
 to abort the PGU. In January gunmen killed Escuintla Mayor
 Marco Tulio Collado, following a period during which he had
 received threats. Relatives blamed "right-wing extremists." A
 crime which might be linked to the 1990 murder case of Myrna
 Mack was the murder in August of Police Homicides Investigation
 Chief Jose Luis Merida, who handled--among other sensitive
 tasks--the investigation into Mack's death. 'In May two men
 killed active-duty general and former defense attache t6 the
 United States Anacleto Maza. Reports indicate Maza was about
 to reveal information concerning corruption in the army
 commissary and corrupt acts by government officers involved
 with the national airline.
 In June armed men killed Oscar Oswaldo Luna, a member of the
 San Carlos University (USAC) maintenance workers' union who had
 taken part in a bitter strike in which'USAC'officials were held
 hostage. Although President Serrano ordered that the killing
 be thoroughly investigated, there were no results by year's
 end. There continued to be credible reports that policemen and
 private security guards tortured and killed street children,
 although there were fewer such reports'in 1991. A court in
 March sentenced four policemen to long prison terms for the
 beating death of "street child" Nahamon Carmona Lopez in 1990.
 However, a higher court found errors in sentencing, and, as
 1991 ended, the case was remanded to the lower court. The case
 against two other policemen accused of involvement in the
 deaths of four other street children in 1990 continued in court.
 Guerrillas were also responsible for extrajudicial killings in
 1991. In June, Genaro Cabrera Gomez, a guerrilla who accepted
 amnesty, was tortured and killed; a note stated that guerrillas
 killed him for "treason." Relatives of Lorenzo Perebal and
 Andres Lopix, Solola military commissioners (civilian army
 employees whose main job is to ensure compliance with the
 draft), said guerrillas kidnaped and murdered both men in
 October.
 
 
 GUATEMALA
 In June police arrested five PAC members in Alta Verapaz for
 the death that month of Domingo Xe. Noel Beteta Alvarez,
 suspected of stabbing Myrna Mack, was arrested following
 deportation from the United States. At the time of Mack's
 death, Beteta was working for the presidential military staff
 of the prior administration. in December a court found
 sufficient prima facie evidence against Beteta to justify
 judicial proceedings. These were under way as 1991 ended. The
 discovery of eleven torture and murder victims in August led to
 the quick arrest of seven navy personnel, including the
 commander of the Pacific naval base. In March the Supreme
 Court dismissed the Government's appeal of the 1990 dismissal
 by an'appeals court of the convictions of six.Quetza]tenango
 policemen for the kidnaping and murder of two students in 1986.
 b. Disappearance
 The Ombudsman's office's preliminary report for 1991 indicated
 that he had received 182 complaints of disappearances (compared
 to 233 for. all 1990). The Archbishop's Human Rights Office
 reported 144 disappearances for the period, while the GAM
 reported 126 kidnapings. Most political disappearances were
 credibly believed to have been committed by persons linked to
 the armed forces; the Government did not identify and prosecute
 these persons.
 According to witnesses, a reported member of CERJ, Felipe Lopez
 Mendoza, was abducted in June by two men near Santa Cruz del
 Quiche; no record of his arrest or detention was ever found.
 In June Yolanda Figueroa, a leader in the Custom Workers Union,
 was the intended victim of a kidnaping. A Treasury Policeman
 foiled the crime, wounding two assailants. In April CERJ
 leader Amilcar Mendez reported a kidnaping attempt in Guatemala
 City in which men tried to drag him from his car into another
 vehicle, desisting only when a crowd gathered. In May CERJ
 member Miguel Sucuqui charged that he was the victim of an
 aborted kidnaping attempt by a local PAC.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 As in past years, many bodies found throughout Guatemala bore
 signs of torture or postmortem mutilation. Such treatment,
 however, is not necessarily evidence of security force
 involvement: gangs and other criminals, as well as guerrillas,
 all use torture. There were, nevertheless, many credible
 reports of torture and mistreatment by security forces. There
 were also credible reports of the use of excessive force by
 police at the time of arrest and of abusive treatment by army
 personnel, civil defense patrols, military commissioners, and
 police of persons in. rural areas.
 In April police in Chiquimula arrested the ex-secretary general
 of the electric workers' union, Otto Ivan Rodriguez, claiming
 that he. belonged to a car theft ring. They beat him, nearly
 blinding him in one eye. The abuse ended when a judge had
 Rodriguez taken from the local jail to one in Guatemala City
 where he received medical treatment. He was freed on April 25
 and left the country. Another reported case of abuse in
 official detention was that of Messrs. Rosales, Trujillo, and
 Castillo who were arrested in August. Representatives of the
 Archbishop's Human Rights Office visited the three prisoners
 and confirmed that they were abused by the National Police.
 The Human Rights Ombudsman, reporting on the case, denounced
 the police and demanded the resignation of the National Police
 
 
 617
 GUATEMALA
 Director, a retired Army'C61onel. He was replaced by a
 civilian, the first to head the police in many years. Judicial
 proceedings were begun against the police officers thought to
 be involved in the torture. Julio Chualcuben, who was kidnaped
 on December 16, 1990, was found near death on a rural highway
 10 days later and taken to a hospital,.where he remained
 semicomatose until June. After regaining consciousness, he did
 not have the use of his voice, legs, and right arm, but he
 described his ordeal by writing with his left hand. According
 to his account, military commissioners accused him of being a
 guerrilla and took him to Solola's army base, where he was
 interrogated, tortured, and left for dead. During his ordeal,
 base officers had ignored writs of habeas corpus presented on
 his behalf. The case has not been investigated. In March the
 Ombudsman charged abuse at an army base near Izabal where
 victims and other people in the area said that the base
 commander and military commissioners sought to push them off
 land wanted by a local firm. The Ombudsman asked the Defense
 Minister to investigate; the commander was put at the
 "disposal" of a military judge. Nothing further was heard
 about the incident by year's end.
 The Government undertook efforts to end police abuse of street
 children; the new police director on several occasions made
 clear he would not tolerate abuse of street children, and
 reports of such incidents declined in 1991. However, on
 October 23 two police cadets stopped and beat 17-year old
 Walter Federico Flores, leaving him in the street unconscious,
 when Flores objected to turning over his identification
 papers. The Minister of Interior promised to look into the
 matter but, as of the end of the year, no results had been
 announced. The Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor
 and a special investigator to look into the case of Sister
 Diana Ortiz, an American nun who reported being kidnaped,
 raped, and tortured in November 1989.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 A court-issued arrest warrant is required unless a person is
 caught committing a crime. Police may not keep a suspect for
 over 6 hours without bringing him to a judge. The .law provides
 for bail, access to lawyers, and limits to 20 days the time
 anyone may be held, after which he must be charged or freed.
 Authorities must produce detainees on request.
 Despite these safeguards, there are frequent credible reports
 of arbitrary arrest and incommunicado detention by security
 forces. Those engaged in such detentions routinely ignore
 writs of habeas corpus. A preliminary report by the Human
 Rights Ombudsman indicated that his office was investigating 10
 credible complaints of illegal arrest in tke capital. There
 was reliable evidence of detentions by gueTrillas. Guerrillas
 forced some rural residents to take part in patrols similar to
 PAC patrols. Guerrillas operating near the capital were also
 reported to have taken several civilian hostages in October.
 Exile is not used.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary
 comprised of a Court of Constitutionality, a Supreme Court,
 Appeals Courts, and several courts of special jurisdiction,
 such as labor courts. Military courts have jurisdiction over
 military personnel, including military commissioners but not
 
 
 618
 GUATEMALA
 members of the PAC, thereby limiting the ability of civilian
 courts to prosecute military personnel in human rights abuse
 cases. Civilian trials are public; defendants have the right
 to be present and to legal representation. An appeals court
 automatically reviews convictions.
 The judicial system is virtually ineffective in human rights
 cases. Most human rights violations are never investigated;
 security forces are reluctant to investigate cases in which
 their colleagues are implicated. Judges are susceptible to
 intimidation and corruption, suffer low pay, bad working
 conditions, and low morale. In October the Chief Justice of
 the Supreme Court denounced pressure on judges by army officers
 in rural areas, and U.N. Human Rights Expert Christian
 Tomuschat echoed those charges.
 There are no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home,
 correspondence, and private documents, provisions that are not
 always respected. Army intelligence units monitor private
 communications. In addition, officials enforcing the military
 draft frequently entered homes and places of business without
 the legally required court orders.
 The Constitution requires that PAC service be voluntary.
 However, army officers, military commissioners, and PAC leaders
 often pressure men in conflict zones to become PAC members.
 There are credible reports that those who refuse to serve have
 suffered serious abuse, including death.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Despite the efforts of President Serrano, the internal armed
 conflict entered its 31st year in 1991 and continued to be a
 cause of major human rights violations. There continued to be
 charges of indiscriminate army "carpet bombings" and artillery
 barrages; given the small, tightly controlled aerial and
 artillery assets of the army, these charges are not credible.
 In October the press reported an aerial attack on a
 guerrilla-controlled Popular Community in Resistance (CPR)
 named Caba just prior to the scheduled visit of U.N. Human
 Rights Expert Tomuschat. Subsequent information, however,
 showed the firing was not aimed at Caba, but was in response to
 guerrillas 3 kilometers away who had fired on an army
 helicopter. Little information exists on the fate of many
 captured guerrillas. Information from previous years, however,
 leads to the conclusion that such persons often faced torture
 and death at the hands of their military captors. There were
 some documented cases, however, of guerrillas who applied for
 and received amnesty and were well treated.
 In October the army charged that guerrillas summarily executed
 four wounded soldiers; the report was plausible but without
 independent confirmation. Guerrillas used children as young as
 12 years of age in combat and as young as 7 in such noncombat
 roles as lookouts and couriers. They also made wide use of
 landmines and other explosives, including "pamphlet bombs," one
 of which injured a girl at the capital's zoo. In February the
 Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP) in northern Quiche attacked a
 13-man PAC, killing 10 and wounding 3. Witnesses said the EGP
 
 
 619
 GUATEMALA
 had caught the lightly armed PAC in a well-laid ambush and
 summarily executed some of the wounded. The Human Rights
 Ombudsman, who barely escaped injury when his helicopter took
 guerrilla fire, found that the EGP violated international
 humanitarian law. In March guerrillas ambushed a police car
 escorting a bicycle race in Solola; two policemen died and the
 car was set afire. Guerrillas killed two more policemen in
 Nueva Vinas in July. This incident led to a public outcry, and
 in August guerrillas promised they would no longer target
 policemen.. Since then, no more attacks have taken place.
 In March police dislodged squatters on a Pacific coast estate,
 Finca Olga Maria. A woman was killed and several other
 persons, including police, were hurt. Three foreigners of the
 Peace Brigades were arrested and required to leave Guatemala.
 The Ombudsman charged that the police used premeditated lethal
 force and acted without a judicial order. A police official
 was removed from his post by the Interior Minister, and murder
 charges were filed against him.
 An army lieutenant and a sergeant were arrested, convicted, and
 sentenced to 4 years and 16 years respectively for the 1990
 Santiago de Atitlan massacre in which 14 people were killed,
 including two children, during a peaceful demonstration against
 army abuses. Armed army personnel on patrol approached the
 town of Santiago de Atitlan in mid-1991 but were confronted by
 local residents and turned away.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression, and
 critics of the Government, including guerrilla leaders, had
 access to the media--nearly all of which, including television,
 is privately owned. A range of organizations, many critical of
 the Government, have their own publications, including the
 Ombudsman, who began a monthly newsletter during the year.
 However, a series of attempts of undetermined origin to
 intimidate the media occurred in August.and September. These
 included anonymous telephone threats and the placing of a
 powerful bomb (deactivated by security forces) in a large
 office building where many foreign and domestic press agencies
 are located. Two men entered the offices of the press agency
 NOTIMEX, threatened the secretary, and rifled-through files.
 Two days later, the home of the NOTIMEX correspondent was
 entered and ransacked. The local International Press Service
 (IPS) correspondent had to leave Guatemala after receiving
 threats, but the office remained open. The Government did
 little to investigate these incidents.
 There were numerous warnings to journalists not to publish
 articles on the cases of Michael Devine, Myrna Mack, the
 attempted murder of journalist Byron Barrera (his wife died in
 the attack) in 1990, and on several U.S. narcotics-related
 extradition.requests. Many journalists complained that the
 Serrano Administration showed little sympathy or concern for
 threatened newsmen.   Media representatives openly denounced
 the threats and vowed to continue their work on human rights
 cases and other sensitive topics. Nevertheless, there
 continued to be self-censorship on certain topics, such as
 investigative reporting into corruption in the military or into
 illegal actions by powerful politicians.
 
 
 620
 GUAEAA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution recognizes the rights of peaceful assembly and
 association: parades, rallies, Marches, forums, debates, and
 seminars on various topics, including human rights, took place
 openly and freely. Organizations require legal association
 status, a cumbersome and expensive procedure which works
 against organizations without good funding or legal counsel.
 While legally organizations must have association status, not
 having it did not stop groups, including some with foreign
 ties, from operating openly. In October Guatemala played host
 to an international indigenous peoples' gathering entitled
 "500 Year Struggle Against Oppression" to mark the anniversary.
 of Christopher Columbus' arrival in America.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 No state religion exists. Religious freedom is
 constitutionally guaranteed and is generally respected in
 practice. Religious personnel are sometimes threatened,
 abused, or killed for political reasons. About 70 percent of
 Guatemala is nominally Catholic, but many other faiths openly
 exist.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government did not restrict foreign travel, nor did it
 revoke citizenship for political reasons. Movement inside
 Guatemala was unrestricted except in some conflict areas. The
 EGP continued to limit travel in areas under their control.
 The army, military commissioners, and the PAC also limited
 travel in some areas.
 Repatriation of refugees continued; 1,200 to 1,300 returned
 during 1991 and plans ware under way for repatriation of many
 of the 40,000 to 45,000 refugees in Mexico.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Guatemalans have the right to change their government by
 peaceful and democratic means; Universal suffrage by secret
 ballot exists for those 18 years of age or older; there are no
 property or literacy requirements. Voting is not mandatory.
 National elections were held on November 11, 1990, and,
 following a run-off on January 6, Jorge Serrano took office as
 President on January 14. International observers found the
 elections to be free and fair. Eight parties or groupings from
 center-left to far-right have seats in the Congress as do
 several independents.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government did not hinder international human rights
 groups. Local human rights groups and organizations are
 permitted to operate in Guatemala, but members of some of these
 groups continue to suffer threats and violence at the hands of
 the security forces or the PAC's (see Section l.a.).
 The office of the Human Rights Ombudsman expanded in size and
 activity. It issued many reports and criticized both the
 Government and guerrillas for abuses. The office remained the
 
 
 621
 GUATEMALA
 most reliable source of objective information on human rights
 practices. The Government's relations with the Human Rights
 Ombudsman were often tense; officials often imputed political
 motives to his criticisms. However, the Government responded
 to some criticism by naming special prosecutors to handle
 particularly notorious cases and creating a cabinet-level human
 rights advisory committee. When CERJ leader Amilcar Mendez
 reported threats, he quickly received a police escort.
 However, Mr. Mendez reported that President Serrano made
 statements that unfairly associated him with guerrilla
 activities.
 Senior officials met representatives of numerous foreign and
 international nongovernmental human rights organizations,
 several of which have local offices. The U.N. Human Rights
 Expert visited Guatemala and received wide press coverage'for
 his-often critical comments. Some foreign groups took part in
 the location and exhumation of clandestine cemeteries. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross operated openly and
 visited villages controlled by the guerrillas.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Over one half of the population is culturally indigenous and
 the rest culturally European. While having equal legal rights,
 many indigenous people still remained outside the country's
 predominant culture, language, and economy. Rural indigenous
 men were more likely than urban counterparts to be drafted by
 the army or forcibly recruited by guerrilla groups. Indigenous
 people suffered most of the serious human rights abuses
 (see Sections l.a. and l.b.). Although there are some
 indigenous.army officers, congressmen, and judges,'there is
 widespread- and pervasive discrimination against indigenous
 people, who have limited educatiqnal and employment
 opportunities. Illiteracy among indigenous people is
 prevalent. Over half of the population are not native Spanish
 speakers and face myriad difficulties in interactions with
 officials, few of whom speak indigenous languages, thereby
 limiting access to a variety of public services, including the
 judicial system.
 Women are active in the labor force, especially in the 'textile
 industry, agriculture, retail business, and in lower paying
 public sector jobs. Several women hold prominent political
 positions, including at the cabinet level. Despite legal
 protection, women face job discrimination and receive lower pay
 than men. There are no major organizations devoted to women's
 issues. Violence against women, including domestic violence,
 remains common but receives little attention. Criminal sexual
 violence often goes unreported by victims, and relatively few
 rape cases came to court. The Ombudsman named a woman as a
 deputy with particular responsibility for violations of women's
 rights.
 Aside from private clubs that bar membership to persons of
 certain religions, Guatemala is very tolerant of religious
 diversity. Government and business has senior personnel from
 many faiths.
 
 
 622
 GUATEMALA
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to join or form unions. About 8 percent
 of the work force is organized, including much of the public
 sector. Due to their complexity, provisions of the Labor Code
 serve to hinder both the ability to organize unions and to
 obtain the necessary legal recognition. During 1991 the
 Government used administrative powers to simplify rules for
 union recognition. Unions must have at least 20 members, but
 craft unions of skilled workers employed by several companies
 are permitted. Some employers, however, seek to avoid
 unionization by forming several entities of fewer than 20
 workers each. A court ruling in 1990 opened the possibility
 that unions could organize these separate entities into a
 single union. Workers have the right to strike, but procedures
 involved made legal strikes cumbersome; most occur without
 permission. In practice, the Government made no effort to
 determine their legality. The structural weakness of organized
 labor and the lack of funds limit the duration of most strikes.
 Union leaders may serve only one term in a union office, but by
 rotating offices the same persons stay on unions' boards of
 directors. The Constitution protects the right of political
 participation for individuals and drops previous prohibitions
 restricting participation by unions and their leaders. One
 prominent union leader was elected to Congress in 1990; two
 others are alternates. Unions may form federations and
 confederations, and join international organizations.
 A "solidarity" movement was active; critics charged it was
 promoted by management to rival genuine unions. Unions
 continued to operate in workplaces which have "solidarity"
 associations. The Government made clear these associations
 exist as civic organizations, and, as such, need not limit the
 ability of legal trade unions to function.
 A draft Labor Code, drawn up with help from the International
 Labor Organization (ILO), remained under consideration by the
 Labor Committee in Congress. The Committee gave a favorable
 recommendation on July 10 in the first of three required
 readings.
 Local and international labor and human rights groups,
 including the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions,
 charged that unionists were "particular targets of death
 squads." There have been threats and violence against
 unionists by members of the security forces (see Sections l.a.
 and l.c.). However, labor violence generally involved "thugs"
 used on an ad hoc basis by employers opposed to unions.
 Perpetrators of these criminal acts are seldom prosecuted.
 At its May-June 1991 session, the ILO's Committee on Freedom of
 Association (CFA) noted with deep regret that, other than
 indicating the possibility of adopting a policy of guaranteeing
 the protection, safety, and freedom of action of trade union
 leaders enabling them to carry out their functions, the
 Government failed to provide any specific information on
 measures taken either in this regard or on the outcome of
 judicial inquiries into the death and torture of a large number
 of trade union leaders. The CFA again urged the Government to
 set up independent judicial inquiries to ascertain the facts in
 these cases. In a related development, the ICFTU called for a
 full investigation of reports that former union leader Otto

 GUATEMALA
 Rodriguez was tortured following his arrest for alleged car
 theft. The National Ombudsman for Human Rights met with trade
 union leaders in early December to hear complaints related to
 threats against them or other union activists. Following this
 session, the Ombudsman committed his organization to establish
 a special office, headed by a union leader, to handle
 complaints related to trade union activities.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers have the legal right to organize and bargain
 collectively but often face discriminatory antiunion actions by
 employers. Labor Courts, responsible for enforcing laws
 prohibiting such discrimination, are ineffective. The Labor
 Ministry indicated its intention to concentrate on improving
 the administration of labor laws.
 Labor laws and regulations apply throughout Guatemala. The law
 authorizing establishment of export processing zones specifies
 that all Labor Code provisions be applied. However, in April
 the Ministry of labor and Social Welfare, with the assistance
 of the Human Rights Ombudsman, issued a report on the textile
 plants in the export zone sector. The report documented worker
 rights abuses in some plants, including mistreatment of
 workers, low wages, long hours, and poor working conditions.
 The report put forward proposals to protect workers, and the
 Government created a commission to propose reforms to the 1989
 export processing zone law.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution bars forced labor, and the practice generally
 does not exist. However, some groups charge that forced
 participation in the PAC violated prohibitions against forced
 labor. There have been credible reports of isolated instances
 of unpaid PAC members being used to provide free manual labor,
 but no systematic pattern of such abuse was established.
 d. Minimum Age for the Employment of Children
 The Constitution bars employment of minors under the age of
 14. In the industrial sector where the Labor Code is fairly
 easy to enforce, child labor is uncommon but not, however, in
 the informal and agricultural sectors. Children often help run
 family businesses, work as domestic help, engage in begging,
 and wash automobiles. A local organization, Casa Alianza,
 which promotes the rights of street children, estimated that
 over 5,000 children live in the capital city's streets; they
 are often involved in prostitution and other crimes.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The workday is legally 8 hours and the workweek 44 hours, but a
 tradition of much longer hours remains. As noted in the April
 report on the export processing zone industry, most owners of
 textile plants paid minimum wages for a 12-hour day, violating
 both the Constitution and the Labor Code. Several complaints
 of beatings and firings of textile workers accused of failing
 to meet work requirements were made to the Labor Ministry.
 Labor inspectors, who report to the Labor Courts, were accused
 of a lack of diligence in enforcing the 8-hour day, in part
 because the highly mobile third-country textile plants move
 when they find conditions more attractive elsewhere.

 GUATEMALA
 Little was done to educate workers and employers about the
 potential harmful effects of certain chemicals and procedures.
 Even simple precautions, such as the use of helmets and hearing
 protection on construction sites, were rarely taken. In
 November the-Government issued a decree requiring all employers
 to provide medical facilities on work sites, a decree to which
 employers have objected. A similar reaction was noted to an
 earlier decree that required payment of a bonus based on years
 of service to all workers who retire or who are no longer
 required by employers. Insufficient time has passed to judge
 if these decrees will be enforced.
 Mimimum wages are set by law and are the de facto wages for
 most rural and urban workers. A bilateral committee
 representing labor and management is named each year from each
 economic sector to review minimum wage levels and to make
 recommendations for increases. In the event agreement is not
 possible, the Government may decree such increases. In late
 1991 the Government decreed increase in the minimum wage for
 several industrial sectors. Rural workers had their minimum
 wage increased in 1990 at a slightly lower monthly rate. The
 Minister of Labor in late November publicly announced that many
 rural and urban workers are not receiving the minimum wage
 established for their sector. While some skilled workers
 earned wages higher than the minimum, most are paid below the
 legal minimum. Labor Ministry inspectors have been unable to
 enforce the minimum wage law. These wages do not provide a
 decent standard of living; over 75 per cent of the population
 lives below the Guatemalan poverty line.
