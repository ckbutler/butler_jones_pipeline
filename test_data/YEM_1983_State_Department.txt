 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 The military has played a preeminent role in national politics
 in the Yemen Arab Republic since it came into being in 1962. The
 current leader is Colonel Ali Abdullah Salih, President of the
 Republic, who assumed office in 1978 following the assassination
 of his two immediate predecessors, both of whom also came from
 the senior ranks of the military.
 Until the revolution of 1962, Yemen was a theocracy isolated
 from much of the outside world. The bloody and divisive civil
 war that followed the revolution did not end until 1970.
 Portrayed as the legitimate heir of the 1962 revolution, the
 present Government has at times relied heavily on military and
 security forces to bolster its position in the unstable Yemeni
 political environment. Civilians serving as cabinet ministers
 or members of the Constituent Assembly play a key role in
 advising the President. The central Government has not been
 able, however, to extend its authority into many regions still
 isolated by virtue of the rugged mountainous terrain. Tribal
 traditions, poorly developed public institutions, and widespread
 poverty also impede efforts to form a more cohesive society.
 The state of human rights in North Yemen is largely governed by
 tribal and Islamic tradition. In this still largely non-modern
 society, most males bear arms and will use them to defend the
 integrity of their person and families. Unlike the situation in
 most other societies, the state has a limited capability to
 govern, and does not have a monopoly on the use of force.
 No government official currently serving in office has been
 elected in a competitive process. Nationwide competitive
 elections were held on a non-partisan basis in 1982 to select
 members to the People's General Congress. This Congress was
 assembled to discuss and then endorse the "National Charter"
 which outlines the personal and democratic freedoms the Yemeni
 people should enjoy. (The Charter was drafted by a small circle
 of government officials and then circulated in the country for
 comment.) The Congress, however, has no policy making functions.
 Human rights practices were strongly affected in recent years by
 the activities of the National Democratic Front, a
 foreign-supported, Marxist-oriented rural insurgency movement
 operating in the central and southern regions of the country.
 Fighting between government forces and the insurgents was at
 times heavy. Basic human rights of the population living in the
 affected areas were often violated in the wake of Front
 terrorism and frequently repressive and indiscriminate
 anti-terrorist campaigns by government forces. The sharp
 reduction in the Front's military activity since the summer of
 1982 has led the central Government to reduce repressive
 practices previously adopted to confront the security threat.
 Thus, conditions in the affected areas have largely returned to
 those prevalent in other parts of Yemen; anti-terrorist
 campaigns by the Government have abated, and government travel
 restrictions have been lifted.
 The Yemen Arab Republic is a poor country with few natural
 resources and an extremely limited industrial infrastructure.
 It has a free-market economy in which freedom to hold private
 property and pursue private interests is virtually unlimited.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 The success of the Government in fighting the insurgents has
 resulted in a dramatic reduction of reported terrorist attacks
 against the civilian population or government forces. There
 have been unconfirmed reports of occasional executions of
 suspected members of the Front by villagers living in the areas
 where the insurgency was once active. Sporadic tribal warfare,.
 either between tribes or, occasionally, between tribes and the
 Government, has also claimed victims. There is no indication
 that government forces have been guilty of deliberate and
 arbitrary deprivation of life during the insurgency.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been credible reports that the National Security
 Organization occasionally resorts to secret arrest and
 clandestine detention. If the security forces suspect
 involvement in activity hostile to the Government, early release
 may be difficult to secure. However, family and friends are
 useally able to verifl the whereabouts of the detainee within a
 few days. In rural areas, both Government security forces and
 tribal militias occasionally take hostages to apply pressure on
 their adversaries.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The "National Charter" as well as several statutes proscribe the
 use of torture. There are a number of credible reports,
 however, that the police use force and intimidation to extract
 confessions from individuals suspected of both common and
 political crimes.
 The Yemeni legal code is based on Islamic Shari'a law which
 prescribes such forms of punishment as amputation and stoning.
 Official figures on the appliction of such punishments are
 lacking; according to press reports, these penalties were
 applied more frequently in 1983 than heretofore, although they
 are still not common.
 Some prisoners receive food, clothing, and medicine from their
 families to ameliorate the otherwise harsh conditions prevalent
 in most Yemeni jails. Without this support, prisoners must
 subsist on the limited diet and health care provided by the
 state. Those detained outside the major urban centers suffer
 more than others the consequences of substandard care. Such
 procedures reflect the poverty and poorly developed institutions
 prevailing throughout Yemen as well as the attitude that the
 well-being of prisoners is as much the responsibility of the
 family as that of the state.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Constitutional provisions limit the time police may hold
 
 
 1458
 suspects without explicit judicial authorization and established
 procedures through which the detainees may contact their
 families and lawyers. However, the legal safeguards have been
 ignored when special security forces have detained persons
 suspected of subversion. In February and March of 1983 a
 considerable number of people were arrested for suspected
 anti-Government activity. Although these detainees were neither
 publicly charged nor brought to trial, 105 were subsequently
 released under a general amnesty. A few are probably still
 being held.
 Although several mid-level government officials are known to
 have been detained in 1983, prominent political figures whose
 opposition to government policies falls short of outright
 subversion are rarely detained by the security police. Instead,
 they are sometimes forced to withdraw from public life and stay
 at home where their activities are closely monitored by
 government authorities. Usually, such figures are not subject
 to formal house arrest, but are simply told not to work for a
 time.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are several types of courts in the Yemen Arab Republic,
 including traditional Shari'a (Islamic) courts, commercial
 courts, and special security courts. The Shari'a courts have
 jurisdiction in all cases that do not fall into the latter two
 categories, although there is overlapping jurisdiction in some
 commercial law cases. The Shari'a courts appear to be fair and
 impartial within the context of the Islamic tradition. The
 judge plays an active role in questioning the witnesses, seeking
 to establish the guilt or innocence of the accused. Attorneys
 may counsel their clients, but do not address the court or
 examine witnesses. If the defendant is to be brought to trial,
 he is informed of the charges against him at the conclusion of
 the police investigation.
 There is some possibility of appeal to political authorities
 outside the traditional Shari'a system. Anyone who can will
 seek to bring the influence of prominent people or government
 officials to bear in a case; however, the ability to do this
 varies according to the status of the defendant involved. In
 the commercial court, litigants can also expect a fair and open
 trial with legal counsel. The Shari'a and commercial courts in
 Yemen remain largely independent of the executive, although all
 decisions are subject to review and confirmation by the
 President.
 Those formally charged with espionage or other anti-
 government activities are tried in special security courts.
 These courts are convened at the direction of the President to
 handle specific cases. Rights normally afforded the accused may
 be suspended in security cases. All decisions made by the
 security court are subject to review and confirmation by the
 President. It is generally acknowledged that some Yemenis are
 currently serving sentences for political offenses. Although
 there are no reliable figures as to the number, rough estimates
 indicate a probable figure of several hundred.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 National Security Forces operate under an open mandate to search
 
 
 1459
 homes, monitor telephone conversations, read personal
 correspondence, or otherwise intrude into private lives when
 they believe that the security of the state is jeopardized.
 There have been fewer reports of such intrusions in 1983 than in
 previous years due to the improved security climate prevailing
 throughout the country. The substantial amount of weaponry held
 by private citizens and the isolation of many villages from
 major urban centers mitigate against wanton invasion of privacy
 by the police in many areas of rural Yemen.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 A number of limits on free speech exist in Yemen, but their
 effect is limited to the urban, literate population by the
 government's incomplete control over the country. The Ministry
 of Information oversees the management of radio, television, and
 all newspapers and periodicals enjoying wide circulation. The
 limited number of privately-owned publications occasionally
 criticize malfeasance by public officials or address economic
 issues, but generally avoid expressing opinions at variance with
 those of the Government. The Government has on occasion removed
 articles from these publications before they can be made
 available to the general public. It has also suspended
 publishing rights for extended periods to punish attempts at
 printing material the censors find objectionable. Foreign
 magazines and newspapers are sold in the major cities, but are
 subject to periodic censorship.
 Persons holding politically sensitive or highly visible public
 positions must be prudent in expressing unconventional political
 opinions. Academic appointments, for example, are contingent in
 part on the political credentials of the teachers. At least one
 university professor lost his position in 1983 due to such
 political considerations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no legal political parties in Yemen. Since its
 establishment by the Government in August 1982, the People's
 General Congress has functioned as a single mechanism for
 popular political expression. Seventy percent of the delegates
 to the 1,000-member Congress were selected in elections.
 Standing committees of the Congress continue to meet at both the
 national and regional levels to give the "National Charter' a
 wide public audience, the principal task assigned to members of
 the Congress. It is not yet known whether delegates will play a
 broader poltical role in the future.
 Political demonstrations, although not illegal, are rare in
 Yemen, and did not occur last year. The Government occasionally
 organizes rallies in support of its own policies.
 Labor unions and professional organizations play a very limited
 role in the predominantly rural and pre-industrial Yemeni
 society. Legislation outlaws strikes and prohibits the
 establishment of independent labor unions.
 Alternative channels for political expression exist for Yemenis
 living outside the few urban centers. Large segments of the
 population in local communities play a role in selecting the
 leadership of so-called "local development associations" and
 
 
 1460
 influence their policies. These organizations use a mixture of
 local and government funding for economic and social
 infrastructure development. In many areas where the effective
 presence of the central government is minimal, tribal leaders
 make key decisions in consultation with other prominent members
 of their community.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the State religion and that of the vast majority of
 Yemenis. Members of the Zaydi (Shi'a) sect have historically
 enjoyed greater political influence than those of the Shafei
 (Sunni) sect, but these distinctions have often been as much
 based on geographic and tribal considerations as on purely
 religious grounds. For the most part, the two major Islamic
 communities co-exist without friction and seek to minimize the
 significance of doctrinal differences.
 Muslim associations with ties to foreign or pan-Islamic
 organizations enjoy some degree of freedom in Yemen, including
 the right to operate schools largely independent of the national
 education system. Although almost all of the once substantial
 Yemeni Jewish population has emigrated to Israel, the small
 number of Jews remaining in Yemen live in peace with the Muslim
 majority. These remaining Jews are able to practice their
 religion freely and have been able to bring in some religious
 books and materials. Foreign Christians are allowed to conduct
 private services, although there are no churches in Yemen.
 Foreign clergy are not permitted into the country if their
 purpose is to preach religion; however, there is at least one
 Catholic priest in Yemen working in a social-service field.
 Public celebration of non-Islamic religious holidays is
 discouraged. Proselytizing is forbidden by law. Christian
 missionaries have operated hospitals in Yemen for many years,
 but in 1983 experienced increasing harassment from local
 authorities who issued warnings against the distribution of
 Christian religious materials including Bibles.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Throughout history many Yemenis have sought temporary or
 permanent employment outside their country. The Government has
 not restricted this large-scale emigration in view of the
 importance remittances from Yemenis working abroad play in the
 national economy. Procedures for obtaining passports and
 compulsory exit permits are sometimes onerous, however,
 particularly for Yemeni males who have not fulfilled their
 military service requirements. Political dissidents have
 frequently chosen self-imposed foreign exile or have accepted
 Government appointments abroad rather than face possible
 difficulties at home stemming from their political views. There
 are no restrictions on travel within the country.
 Several refugee groups have sought asylum in Yemen. The country
 harbors approximately 2700 armed members of the Palestine
 Liberation Organization who came to Yemen in the fall of 1982
 and December 1983 following their evacuation from Beirut and
 Tripoli. Perhaps as many as 250,000 South Yemenis have
 integrated themselves into the economic life and society in the
 Yemen Arab Republic to escape political persecution by the
 authorities in Aden. Refugee groups from countries in the Horn
 of Africa have frequently sought residence in Yemen, though
 
 
 1461
 economic rather than political factors often lie behind their
 decision to leave their country of origin. The authorities have
 taken measures to restrict the flow of these national groups.
 For example, Somalis and Ethiopians, without claim to Yemeni
 citizenship or clear demonstration of being political refugees,
 find it difficult to obtain work permits and visa extensions.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights, The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The President makes the key political decisions in the areas
 controlled by the central Government. Colonel Ali Abdullah
 Salih began a second five-year presidential term in July 1983
 following an "election" in which he was the only candidate.
 There is no mechanism for the people to choose or elect an
 alternative chief executive through free, predictably scheduled,
 competitive elections. The military establishment plays a
 preeminent role in national politics, as evidenced by the
 selection of the last three presidents from its senior ranks.
 The People's Constituent Assembly reviews and ratifies
 legislation proposed by the President and the cabinet ministers
 he appoints. The Assembly has never disapproved Government
 policy. The members of this legislative body were appointed by
 Presidential decree in 1978. Once scheduled for 1983, popular
 parliamentary elections have not taken place and their timing is
 now uncertain.
 The People's General Congress, newly constituted in 1982, is the
 only national political organization whose members are selected
 in competitive elections. The one thousand delegates represent
 most segments of Yemeni society. Women, as a rule absent from
 most areas of public life, hold only a few seats in the People's
 General Copgress, although they do have the right to vote in
 general elections. There are no legal opposition parties in
 Yemen. Debate at times has reportedly been vigorous within the
 People's General Congress, but the President and his key
 advisors control the agenda closely. The Congress has played an
 active role in bringing the principles of the National Charter
 to public attention, primarily by organizing weekly political
 seminars for public employees. No effort has been made to date
 to expand the scope of popular political discussion outside the
 framework of the Charter.
 Outside the major urban centers, political activity is
 controlled more by tribal traditions than by the directives of
 the central Government. Although tribal leaders come from the
 traditional ruling families, male adult tribesmen have a voice
 in selecting their leadership. The central Government cannot
 easily disregard the concerns of the heavily-armed tribes which
 form a cohesive social unit when their vital interests are at
 stake.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The attitude of the Yemen Government toward investigations of
 alleged violations of human rights has not been tested. As far
 as is known, no major international or non-government
 organization has asked to conduct a survey in the Yemen Arab
 Republic. Amnesty International did not prepare a report on the
 Yemen Arab Republic in 1983. Freedom House rates Yemen "not
 
 
 1462
 free." There are no active human rights organizations in Yemen.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Yemen is among the poorest countries in the world. Standards of
 health and education are particularly low. Life expectancy at
 birth was estimated at 42 years in 1980. This figure reflects
 in part the high rate of infant mortality still prevailing in
 Yemen. The World Bank's "Health Sector Report" put Yemeni adult
 literacy at 21 percent in 1980. Educational opportunities have
 been expanded, but by 1979 only 34 percent of the school age
 population was enrolled in primary school. Boys attend school
 in greater number than do girls. The latest statistics for
 access to safe drinking water (1976) were 2 percent in rural
 areas and 30 percent in urban areas.
 The per capita gross national product of Yemen estimated at
 $459 in 1981, also gives evidence of widespread poverty.
 Statistics on national income provide a possibly misleading
 description of Yemeni society, however. As many as 1.5 million
 Yemenis work abroad, principally in the wealthier countries of
 the Arabian Peninsula. The hard currency remittances of these
 workers and the number of consumer goods they bring back to
 Yemen are key elements sustaining the national economy. Little
 of this wealth is available for investment in national
 development projects, however, as the Government has been unable
 to divert any significant proportion of these resources from
 private hands. Thus many families enjoy relatively comfortable
 financial status at the same time the country as a whole lacks
 sufficient funds to finance development of basic infrastructure
 needs.
 The Government has assigned the highest priority to the
 promotion of economic development. Particular emphasis was
 placed in 1983 on the reconstruction of villages devastated by a
 major earthquake in December 1982.
 Living in a conservative Islamic society which remained isolated
 to a large degree from the modern world prior to 1962, few
 Yemeni women are employed outside the home or play an active
 role in other aspects of public life. Additionally, education
 for women in significant numbers began only at the end of the
 civil war in 1970. The Government has done nothing to restrict
 women's access to employment, however, and has promoted the
 expansion of educational opportunities for girls and women.
 Women are now present in the middle levels of several
 ministries, such as the Central Planning Organization, and one
 woman is in the Constituent Assembly. Prevailing social norms
 frequently dictate, however, that women defer to the guidance of
 their male colleagues and accept close supervision of their
 activities by male relatives.
 Economic wealth is distributed on a relatively egalitarian basis
 throughout Yemeni society. Although often poor, many farmers
 own their land. Most citizens encounter no institutional
 barriers to pursuing their private economic interests in the
 free-market economy. Yemenis from non-Arab ethnic groups or
 children of ethnically mixed marriages frequently encounter
 discriminatory treatment from public officials and are less
 successful in finding good jobs than other Yemeni citizens.  For
 example, the "Akhdam" caste of former slaves of African origin
 are often relegated to menial jobs such as street sweeping and
 trash collecting. There are no statistics on how large a group
 the "Akhdam" represent. However, this situation has not
 resulted in social unrest given the many chances for
 out-migration available to Yemenis seeking more lucrative
 employment opportunities elsewhere.
