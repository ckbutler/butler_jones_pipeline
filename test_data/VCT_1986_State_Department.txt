 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines retains the multiparty
 parliamentary system of government which it inherited upon
 independence from the United Kingdom in 1979. Democratic
 traditions and respect for the rights of the individual have
 continued since independence. In July 1984, the New Democratic
 Party led by James F. Mitchell defeated the ruling St. Vincent
 Labour Party led by then Prime Minister Milton Cato in
 peaceful, democratic elections. By law, elections again must
 be held by October 1989.
 The Royal St. Vincent Police is the only security force in the
 country. A small Special Service Unit with some paramilitary
 training has been established within the police force, and a
 coast guard serves under police command. The St. Vincent
 police maintain traditions of professionalism which place a
 high value on respect for human rights.
 A poor country with a very young population, St. Vincent's most
 serious problem is unemployment. The nation's economy grew
 modestly in 1986, led by the vital banana industry-, but a
 tropical storm in September damaged the banana crop and sharply
 reduced export receipts.
 The country's human rights record remained good during 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports of torture or cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that persons detained for criminal
 offenses be provided legal representation and that their cases
 be reviewed periodically. The Government assiduously follows
 these provisions. A Dutch journalist was summarily deported
 from St. Vincent in September while doing research on an
 article about an off-shore bank that operated in St. Vincent.
 No charges were brought against the journalist, and no
 explanation was given for his deportation.
 There is no legal prohibition against forced or compulsory
 labor, but such practices are not known to take place in St.
 Vincent.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for public trials before an
 independent and impartial court. Criminal defendants have the

 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 right to legal counsel, are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty, and have the right of appeal, ultimately to the Privy
 Coundil in London.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, and
 seizure; this prohibition is honored in practice by law
 enforcement authorities. There were no reports of arbitrary
 search and seizure or other government intrusions into the
 private life of individual citizens in 1986.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and of the press,
 and the Government respects these rights. The Government
 neither censors nor interferes in the operation of newspapers,
 which openly and freely criticize it.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to assemble peaceably is respected in practice.
 The Government has adhered to the International Labor
 Organization's Convention on Freedom of Association. Unions
 enjoy the right of collective bargaining and the right to
 strike; they represent approximately 7,000 workers (slightly
 more than 10 percent of the labor force).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religions are free to practice and proselytize in St.
 Vincent and the Grenadines,
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are guaranteed by law and honored in practice.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 St. Vincent has a parliamentary system of government in which
 citizens have a genuine choice of parties. In the 1984 general
 election, the New Democratic Party won 9 of the 13 seats in
 Parliament and ousted the St. Vincent Labour Party.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international human rights organization maintains offices in
 St. Vincent. Although there is no local body which publicly
 monitors human rights violations, opposition political groups
 occasionally comment on human rights matters. The Government
 is responsive to public and private inquiries on its human
 rights practices.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The role of women in society is not restricted by law, but
 custom dictates that most Vincentian women center their lives

 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 around the home. As women take greater advantage of public
 education programs, health facilities, and family planning,
 they are expected to participate in larger numbers in the
 nation's economic, professional, andpolitical life.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum working age is 15. The work week is 40 hours in
 5 days, and workers are guaranteed a minimum annual vacation of
 2 weeks. The Government currently is endeavoring to convert
 loose arrangements covering occupational safety and health into
 statutes. Minimum wages are established by law.
