 ETHIOPIA
 
 Nine years after the revolution which ousted the feudal
 rule of Emperor Haile Selassie, Ethiopia remains a nation
 without civil or political freedom and lacking institutions or
 laws to protect its citizens against human rights abuses.
 Freedom of. expression is forbidden, and dissent is severely
 punished. While politically motivated killing and torture
 are no longer commonly practiced outside areas of insurgency,
 arbitrary arrest and detention of persons who have expressed
 opposition to the regime or are believed to be recalcitrant
 to it are common. There have been some reported killings in
 areas outside the major insurgencies as well; Ethiopians
 throughout the country have been known to disappear after
 being arrested by security police.
 Governance of the nation continues to reside solely in the
 person of Chairman Mengistu Haile-Mariam and a small group
 of former military officers (the Dergue). No institutional
 system of succession in government offices exists, and all
 policy decisions are made from the seat of the Chairman. An
 embryonic communist party, the Commission to Organize the
 Party of the Workers of Ethiopia (COPWE), does however play
 an increasing role. The present regime has inherited the
 ethnic conflicts of the former Ethiopian empire, in which
 the*Christian Amhara dominated a number of other groups
 differing in language or in religion. In February 1983, the
 Government began another "Red Star" military campaign against
 Eritrean and Tigrean insurgent groups. The insurgency and
 the Government's efforts to suppress it contribute substan-
 tially to the bad human rights situation prevailing in
 Ethiopia. Violence against the civilian populations in
 these regions has been practiced by both the armed forces
 and the troops of the insurgent groups. The Government has
 engaged in arrests, torture, and summary execution in Eritrea
 of those suspected of independence sympathies. Those
 suspected of aiding ethnic insurgent groups have also been
 arrested. The conflict in Eritrea, begun when Emperor Haile
 Selassie annexed the region in 1968, has continued unabated
 for 23 years. The Government's 1976 promise of greater
 regional autonomy has not been fulfilled. Fighting between
 the central government and the Tigrean People's Liberation
 Front which began shortly after the accession of the
 Dergue in 1974, has spread to most of Tigray as well
 as the neighboring regions of Welo and Gondar. Most of
 Eritrea and Tigray, and parts of Welo and Gondar regions are
 said to escape government control.
 Despite its proclaimed goal of bettering the lives of its
 citizens, the Government has been unable to deliver the
 economic and social benefits promised in its public pronounce-
 ments. One exception has been the campaign which has raised
 the literacy rate over the past several years from five
 percent to a theoretical 54 percent. Secondary and university
 education also has been made available to broader numbers of
 people, although the quality of education has fallen as
 facilities and teaching staff have not matched the increasing
 numbers of students.
 
 
 119
 Although the situation in the country during the reign of
 Emperor Haile Selassie was repressive, with little legal frame-
 work for the protection of individual citizens and all political
 and civil power resting with the Emperor, with opposition to the
 Emperor possibly leading to arrest, exile or death without
 benefit of trial, and with no sustained effort to promote the
 economic or social well being of the population, human rights
 abuses became far more widespread following the 1974 overthrow
 of Haile Selassie. The killings and imprisonments that occurred
 during the 1977-78 "Red Terror" campaign are well known and
 documented. Over the years a combination of war, drought,
 civil strife, and oppression have driven more than one million
 Ethiopians out of the country. The largest refugee populations
 are in Somalia and Sudan where most of the refugees have fled.
 Djibouti also hosts a significant number of Ethiopian refugees.
 Despite the Ethiopian Government's stated policy of welcoming
 returnees and the nascent, but thus far successful, voluntary
 repatriation program from Djibouti, tens of thousands of
 Ethiopians who fled the country for political reasons still
 fear reprisals and remain in refugee status outside their
 country. The past several years have seen a considerable
 improvement in the situation, and the September 1982 and 1983
 Revolution Days were the occasion for mass releases of political
 prisoners. Still, widespread government-sanctioned abuses of
 human rights occur, though most often without the use of physi-
 cal violence in non-insurgent areas. In addition, Ethiopia has
 supported terrorism and insurgency efforts directed against its
 neighbors.
 Human rights prospects in Ethiopia for the foreseeable future
 continue to be bleak. The regime exercises complete control of
 the press, education, labor activities, political processes,
 and the movement of its citizens. Surveillance and informing
 are widespread. The study of Marxism-Leninism is obligatory,
 especially for literate elements of the urban population, and
 coercion is applied to those who resist. The Orthodox Church,
 which lost its official state church status after the revolution
 (as well as its land holdings and rental properties), has
 government-appointed officials within its administration, and
 actions against certain foreign missionary-staffed churches has
 continued. Government-organized mass organizations control
 participation in the political process. The citizenry is
 frequently called out for forced official rallies (spontaneous
 peaceful assembly is forbidden by the Government). The curfew
 system continues to be enforced. Although a military service
 decree was issued in May 1983 and youth are being required to
 register, the authorities still frequently round up youth off
 the streets or seize them from their homes to press them into
 military service.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Politically motivated murders have, by and large, greatly
 diminished in non-insurgent areas. There was an unconfirmed but
 probably genuine report of a mass public execution of several
 hundred persons in Bale region (southern Ethiopia) early in 1983.
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 9
 
 
 120
 According to a variety of reports, the Bale regional adminis-
 trator had first promised the victims amnesty in return for
 their surrender of weapons and cessation of dissident activities
 in the region. Their subsequent execution was reportedly not
 countenanced by the Government. The administrator was report-
 edly arrested and taken to Addis Ababa where he was executed
 without trial.
 Though no figures are available, a substantial number of
 killings continue in the main areas of insurgency in northern
 Ethiopia (Eritrea and Tigray) and to a lesser extent in the
 Ogaden in the south. These killings are perpetuated by both
 sides in the conflict, with insurgents assassinating govern-
 ment officials and rival dissident group members, and govern-
 ment officials and troops executing dissidents and carrying out
 the bombing of civilian population centers.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearance continues to be used by the Government to
 remove actual or potential opposition to its rule. Ethiopians
 may be arrested and held without legal process or notice to
 their families. There are documented cases during the
 year of Ethiopian citizens being abducted by plainclothes
 security police without charges and held incommunicado for
 extended periods. In some cases, the person is eventually
 released; in others, the continued absence of the individual
 can mean execution and clandestine burial or exile to some
 distant location. Families are often not notified of their
 relatives' arrest and, in cases where they are, frequently not
 informed of their whereabouts. In many instances, families
 have heard no word of their relatives' situation for years.
 Prisoners also have been known to disappear from their jail
 cells, never to be seen again. Though not in the same category,
 induction into the army is sometimes tantamount to disappear-
 ance, especially the unemployed; young men are forcibly loaded
 into trucks and not heard from again. It is not unusual to
 find Ethiopians who last heard from their soldier son or hus-
 band five or six years before. With the expected implementa-
 tion of national military service and the continued fighting
 across wide areas in the north, the rounding up of young
 men by both government and insurgent forces can be expected
 to continue. Amnesty International in its 1983 report notes
 the "disappearance" of 15 political prisoners in 1979, includ-
 ing the head of the Ethiopia Evangelical Mekone Yesus Church.
 The Government has not responded to inquiries on this case.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no known law prohibiting torture, but it is believed
 now to be less widespread and practiced mostly against insurgent
 combatants. However, repeated interrogation of those suspected
 of political opposition to the Government is widespread, and
 torture may be practiced in some of these cases. Amnesty
 International, in its 1983 report, states that torture is
 reportedly often practiced on prisoners interrogated at the
 Central Revolutionary Investigation Department ("Third Police
 Station") in Addis Ababa. Interrogations also can involve the
 purposeful infliction of mental suffering, such as threats to
 the individual or his family.
 
 
 121
 Amnesty International, in its most recent report, states its
 concerns over prolonged detention without trial of prisoners of
 conscience, widespread arrests made on political grounds, and
 allegations of torture and harsh treatment of prisoners.
 Amnesty notes that prisoners sent to the Central Revolutionary
 Investigation Department often were reportedly tortured during
 interrogation and held incommunicado in overcrowded, dirty
 cells without medical treatment or toilet facilities.
 Cruel,'inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment is common
 in Ethiopia's jails and prisons. Political prisoners or those
 suspected of activities against the Government may be subjected
 to beatings.
 Prison conditions in Ethiopia continue to be, in the great
 majority of cases, seriously substandard. Cells are damp, over-
 crowded, and unheated. Prisoners must rely upon their families
 to provide food, and in many cases they are denied changes of
 clothing. Sanitary conditions are seriously inadequate. In the
 weeks preceding the 19th Organization of African Unity summit
 conference in June 1983, the Government began rounding up sev-
 eral thousand prostitutes for incarceration during the summit
 week. Reportedly, a number of the women were not prostitutes
 but happened to have been caught up in the police sweep. These
 detainees were placed in overcrowded rooms and in some cases had
 to sleep in shifts. Family visits were severely restricted, and
 reportedly some of the women have not yet been returned to their
 homes.
 Conditions in Ethiopia's main detention center, Carchelli
 prison, where members of the royal family and other political
 prisoners are held, are better than in other prisons. There,
 occupational and academic training is available and inmates
 are given considerable freedom in determining their activities.
 Families and friends are allowed to visit with reasonable
 frequency. Former prisoners at the Gebi Palace prison reported
 that they were relatively well treated, although their quarters
 were crowded and damp, and they were allowed brief visits from
 family members only once a year. Those held here were mostly
 high-ranking officials from the Emperor's Government.
 There is no evidence that political prisoners are subjected
 to living conditions worse than those of convicted criminals.
 International humanitarian organizations have been denied
 access to Ethiopian political prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Those suspected of anti-government activities or sentiments
 are subject to arrest or detention without charge at any
 time. Uncertain terms of imprisonment are another form of
 mental anguish used by the Government against its prisoners.
 Political prisoners arrested in 1974 and released in 1982 and
 1983 were given no information about their term of incarcera-
 tion; nor were they told of their impending release. Even in
 cases where a specific sentence was set by a court, the actual
 length of incarceration could be much longer. As noted in
 section lb in this report, the victims of arbitrary arrest or
 detention can often expect to be held incommunicado. There are
 
 
 122
 no legal provisions in these cases for the reading of charges to
 the prisoner. Rights to counsel and the opportunity to face
 one's accusers are non-existent. Because of the absence of a
 legal limit for holding a suspect without formal charges, length
 of confinement depends upon the whims of the incarcerators, who
 can be from any level of government, from the very top to the
 local neighborhood committee (kebele) official. Habeas corpus,
 existing in concept in Ethiopian law, has not been successfully
 invoked in any known case. Some officials of the former govern-
 ment, released in 1983, were held as long as nine years without
 charge or trial.
 Victims of arbitrary arrest can expect to be detained for a
 number of reasons, including comments critical or derisive of
 the Government, failure to attend mandatory rallies and neigh-
 borhood commitee meetings, suspicion of association with or
 membership in organizations opposed to the Government, and in
 the case of Ethiopian women, suspicion of sexual liaison with
 foreign visitors. During the 1983 May Day speech several
 members of the observing crowd were taken away for making
 comments that nearby policemen, security officers, or neighbor-
 hood committee guards considered critical of the regime. Such
 detention is usually brief.
 Suspected dissident group members are generally taken in
 secret. In August and September 1983, a number of suspecte4
 members or sympathizers of the Tigrean People's Liberation
 Front were reported to have been arrested in Addis Ababa.
 No public announcement was made by the Government. In Septem-
 ber 1983, on the occasion of the ninth anniversary of the
 revolution, 107 political prisoners were released, including
 all remaining senior officials of the former regime and eight
 female members of the royal family. (It is believed that 11
 members of the royal family remain in prison.) About 1,000
 common criminals also were released. (In 1982, 716 prisoners,
 mostly political, were released.) The wing of the Gebi Palace
 prison holding the former officials was closed, but the
 prison still remains in use, incarcerating at present Eritreans
 and imprisoned members of the Dergue. In past years, some
 political prisoners have been given government positions
 shortly after their release. There are conflicting reports
 about the total remaining number of political prisoners, which
 is virtually impossible to estimate. If the total includes
 those taken prisoner as suspected insurgents and insurgency
 supporters it could well number in the thousands.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Ethiopians arrested for political reasons do not in most
 instances receive trials. There is no guarantee of a public
 trial with counsel, nor is the accused guaranteed the right
 to present evidence in his own defense. The simple denuncia-
 tion of an individual by a neighbor or associate can be suffi-
 cient evidence for detention.
 In cases where trials are held, military, or civilian, they do
 not necessarily guarantee fair disposition of a case. There is
 no discernable separation between the executive branch of the
 Government and the judiciary. Courts continue to be subject to
 political control, and their actions are frequently arbitrary.
 Prisoners cleared of charges or whose terms have been completed
 
 
 123
 are not necessarily released from prison.
 Individuals accused of common crimes such as theft, corrup-
 tion, or murder can ordinarily expect a trial based upon
 evidence and public exposure. In these cases, the individual
 has a better opportunity to hear the charges against him or
 her and see the evidence. Petty offenses are tried in neigh-
 borhood committee tribunals while more serious crimes are tried
 in courts where court-appointed lawyers are available. The
 Government's push against corruption continues through a
 special anti-corruption court. Frequent announcements were
 made in the Ethiopian press in 1983 of harsh sentences of
 imprisonment and fines levied against officials and individuals
 found guilty of corruption.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government surveillance of individuals through visual or
 listening devices is reliably reported to continue in 1983
 with the assistance of advisers from the German Democratic
 Republic. The right of privacy is repeatedly subject to arbi-
 trary actions by the Government. Warrants are not required
 for entry into or search of homes or offices in Ethoipia.
 Forced entry is a common method of police and security forces,
 although the level of such activities continues at a much lower
 rate than during the period of the 'Red Terror." The interna-
 tional and domestic mail of Ethiopian citizens, as well as
 foreign residents, is subject to opening and inspection at any
 time. Foreign publications mailed to Ethiopian citizens are
 subject to censorship or seizure. Those known to be unsympa-
 thetic to the Government continue to be watched and frequently
 are barred from obtaining employment of their choice or collect-
 ing previously earned pensions. Informer systems operating
 through the neighborhood committees and worker control commit-
 tees continued to operate unabated in 1983. These neighbor-
 hood committees monitor the activities of residents of their
 areas and are empowered to arrest anyone who violates curfew or
 engages in any activity they deem illegal.
 Political indoctrination continues to be a standard feature
 of the school system. University students frequently are
 required to follow courses of study prescribed by the Govern-
 ment and are forced to take assigned jobs after graduation.
 Political cadres are assigned to schools, the university,
 government offices, businesses, and organizations to ensure
 ideological conformity. Weekly political indoctrination
 sessions are held in the neighborhood committees and all work
 places. Attendance is mandatory. Attendance at public rallies
 supporting government-sponsored programs (such as the National
 Military Service Implementation Proclamation in May, 1983) is
 also mandatory, with those refusing to go or unable to explain
 their absence subject to fines and arrest by neighborhood
 committee officials. Viewpoints opposing the government's
 policies are not tolerated.
 Foreign radio broadcasts, however, such as the VOA and BBC
 operate with no interference and are listened to by the major-
 ity of the Ethiopian population.
 
 
 124
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no freedom of speech or press in Ethiopia. The
 Government has complete ownership and operation of all infor-
 mation media and exercises censorship through editorial boards
 and the cultural ministry. Any independent expression of opin-
 ion by its citizens is firmly held in check by the Government.
 Academic freedom, especially in political and social sciences,
 is circumscribed. At the university, research papers not
 considered in line with government policy are subject to
 censorship and suppression, and no criticism of the Government
 is allowed. Both university and secondary school curricula
 continue to be strongly imbued with Marxist-Leninist dogma.
 This is not true of private schools where Ethiopians who can
 afford them send their children.
 Foreign and domestic publications are subject to censorship
 and restriction and some are banned. Books can be confiscated
 if they are deemed counter to the revolution. In September
 1983, a Ministry of Information official was dismissed from
 his position and placed under house arrest for publishing a
 novel said to be critical of the Government's 'Red Star
 campaign" as well as of several high government officials.
 The book was subsequently banned (a few thousand already
 published or subsequently reproduced copies continue to circu-
 late clandestinely at exorbitant prices). Artists also are
 restricted in expression and can be criticized for "bourgeois
 art." In early 1983, several artists who designed a calendar
 for Ethiopian Air Lines were arrested and their calendar
 withdrawn from circulation. The calendar, entitled "hair
 styles," was said to signify Haile Selassie and also to be
 condemnatory of the Government because swastikas were included
 on a dress design. Subsequently, the artists were released and
 the calendar allowed to circulate.
 The government-controlled media carry no criticism or complaint
 against government officials or policy. In May 1983, leaflets
 scattered on the street corners of Addis Ababa by individuals
 opposed to the national military service proclamation were
 quickly collected by police and security personnel.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There is no freedom of assembly and association. Independent
 organizations are forbidden, and all mass organizations
 such as trade unions, peasant, women's and youth organiza-
 tions remain under complete government control and supervision.
 Workers and peasants are required to join the All Ethiopia
 Trade Union and All Ethiopia Peasant Association respectively.
 Neighborhood committee officials exert pressure on women and
 youth to join the Revolutionary Ethiopian Youth Association
 and the Revolutionary Ethiopian Women's Association. These
 do not operate as vehicles for the expression of grievances
 or interests but are designed to increase political control
 over the population. Spontaneous public gatherings of
 
 
 125
 citizens are quickly dispersed by the Government, and the
 participants are subject to arrest and detention. Strikes
 rarely occur, but when they do, the authorities intervene
 immediately to break them up by force. In one such incident
 in September 1983, strike leaders were arrested, and the
 Government's promises of wage increases were not honored.
 Professional associations such as the Rotary and Lions clubs
 do continue to function freely and are able to maintain
 their international contacts as long as there is no suspicion
 of political activity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religion is officially permitted in Ethiopia although both the
 Orthodox Church and other religious denominations have been
 subject to varying degrees of restriction since the revolution.
 The Orthodox Church, stripped of its status as the official
 state religion and most of its properties after the 1974
 revolution, operates with a number of government-appointed
 officials in its administration and exists to a large degree on
 small government subsidies. It continues to be restricted to
 religious affairs, and its churches and facilities (schools,
 hospitals) are subject to nationalization. Both Islamic and
 Orthodox churches are free to proselytize. Reportedly,
 some members of the Dergue are Orthodox Church attendees.
 There were no known actions against the Orthodox Church
 or against Islam by the Government in 1983. Congregations
 are allowed free access to their churches and mosques, and
 the holidays of the religions are honored by the Government.
 The Orthodox Church and Islam are also allowed to exercise
 jurisdiction over certain civil matters such as marriage.
 The Islamic code of justice is recognized by the Government
 as having jurisdiction over the personal matters of its Muslim
 adherents, and Islamic courts are allowed to function in
 their own buildings. Governmental interference with the
 activities of the Orthodox church and Islam is mainly indirect,
 taking the form of anti-religious propaganda and the organiza-
 tion of seminars obligatory for youth on Sunday mornings.
 Other religious groups, for the most part Protestant evangeli-
 cal groups, continued during 1983 to be subjected to substan-
 tial official harassment. The Mehane Yesus church, which
 endured government suspicions of collusion with the Oromo
 Liberation Front (OLF) in 1982, reportedly had 400 of its
 churches still closed in the western regions of Ethiopia in
 1983. Foreign Protestant sects continue to suffer occasional
 harassment, although the Government does allow missionary
 activity, and permits are given to a few foreign missionaries
 to enter and work in Ethiopia. In 1983, the Government began
 to allow limited access to Ethiopian Jewish areas, with official
 guides, to several American and Israeli groups. In August 1983,
 the U.S. Charge d'Affaires accompanied a Congressional delega-
 tion headed by Congressman Howard Wolpe to visit the Ethiopian
 Jewish village of Ambober in Gondar. A February 1983 report
 issued by four World Jewish Congress delegates from Israel who
 toured the main concentrations of Ethiopian Jews in Gondar, Ambob-
 er and Waleka, declared that they "found no discrimination against
 the Ethiopian Jews worse than that directed against other parts of
 of the population." The report noted that 20 Jews were arrested
 around the time of their visit when they tried to leave the
 
 
 126
 country illegally in the hope of reaching Israel. The syna-
 gogue in Ambober was open and functioning. In another report,
 emanating from a different visit, Israeli Knesset member Dror
 Zeigerman confirmed the World Jewish Organization delegation's
 finding that the plight of the Ethiopian Jews had eased but
 reported that "Hebrew teachers are still barred from teaching
 the language, and the Ethiopian Jews are definitely discrimi-
 nated against."   During their August 1983 visit, to Ambober,
 Congressman Wolpe and his delegation were told that the teaching
 of Hebrew would be resumed soon. Despite the above-cited testi-
 mony, it is not possible to speak with assurance about the
 condition of the Ethiopian Jews because access to them is so
 restricted and carefully monitored by the authorities. At the
 same time stories of genocidal actions by Ethiopian authorities
 are almost certainly untrue. Friction between the Ethiopian
 Jewish community and the authorities continues owing to govern-
 ment efforts to prevent their emigration to Israel (emigration is
 forbidden to all citizens), the lack of Hebrew instruction and
 the evident resistance of the Ethiopian Jews to Marxist-Leninist
 indoctrination.
 Ethiopian Jews are situated in areas of insurgency and they are
 getting caught in the crossfire. No information is available
 on the Ethiopian Jews in Tigray Province; visits by foreigners
 in that area are not permitted owing to the insurgency. With
 the recent spread of fighting to Gondar province, additional
 members of the Jewish community may be affected by the fighting.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Permission is required for Ethiopian citizens to change
 their places of residence and is subject to the approval of
 neighborhood committee officials. This is usually granted,
 except for persons suspected of oppositionist sympathies.
 Foreign diplomats may not travel outside of Shewa (Addis Ababa)
 province without a permit; permits are ordinarily issued for some
 areas and routinely denied for others.
 Tourists need a permit to travel outside of Addis Ababa but
 usually receive them promptly, except to areas of insurgency
 (Tigray, Eritrea).
 The Government regards unauthorized flight from the country to
 be a serious offense punishable by five to 25 years' imprison-
 ment or, in grave circumstances, death. Emigration is for-
 bidden to all Ethiopians except in special and very limited
 circumstances.
 Private travel abroad has become more difficult for Ethiopians,
 both male and female, between the ages of 16 and 30, since
 the May, 1983, proclamation of national military service.
 Exit permits for Ethiopians in this age group have at times
 been almost impossible to obtain; when military conscription
 actually begins (it is expected to do so in late 1983), exit
 permits may cease to be issued. This has prompted large
 numbers of young Ethiopians and their parents to attempt a
 variety of means to leave the country. These have included
 clandestine treks across the border into neighboring countries
 and boat voyages (including stowaways) across the Red Sea.
 
 
 127
 Reports from Khartoum indicate that as many as 40 percent of
 recent Ethiopian refugees coming into Sudan are single, draft-
 age males. On at least one occasion shortly after the
 announcement of national military service, draft-age Ethiopian
 youngsters (female as well as male) with exit permits for study
 abroad were forcibly removed from commercial aircraft at Bale
 airport just prior to departure; one of the young women so
 treated reportedly committed suicide thereafter. The students
 were subsequently allowed to depart.
 More than one million Ethiopians have fled to surrounding
 countries as refugees or requested asylum in Western nations
 as a result of ethnic insurgencies, economic impoverishment
 or political repression. Twenty-five of the former regime
 officials, released in the 1982 amnesty, are reportedly
 forbidden to travel outside of the country.
 The Government recognizes the right of voluntary repatriation,
 and its proclamation of mass amnesty for those Ethiopians
 living abroad remains in effect. In September 1983, several
 hundred Ethiopians who had fled to Djibouti during the 1977
 Ethiopian-Somali war returned to resettlement areas in Ethiopia
 under a joint program of the United Nations High Commissioner
 on Refugees and the government Relief and Rehabilitation
 Commission. The site of the first return, Adigala, appeared
 well-prepared and sanitary considering the desolation of the
 area, and there was no sign among the first group of displaced
 persons of an unwillingness to return. If successful, the
 program for the return of Ethiopian refugees from Djibouti
 could encompass tens of thousands of persons. Small numbers of
 Ethiopian refugees have also returned voluntarily from Sudan
 and Somalia.
 No incidents of forcible repatriation of Ethiopian refugees
 were reported in 1983.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights, The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Ethiopia is ruled by Chairman Mengistu Haile Mariam and a small
 group of military associates. There is no effective popular
 participation in decisonmaking. All decisions come from the
 senior levels of government. Unlike apparently similar systems,
 the ruling group has not been part of a larger party. In the
 spring of 1983, however, the Government announced that the
 formal transition of the Commission to Organize the Party of the
 Workers of Ethiopia (COPWE) into a full-fledged Communist Party
 of Ethiopia will take place on or before September, 1984, the
 tenth anniversary of the Ethiopian revolution. There is'no
 framework in existence for peaceful and orderly transfer of
 power in the Government.
 The various government-controlled mass organizations, discussed
 in Section 2b above, remain the only allowed forum for citizen
 political involvement. Elections are controlled and candidates
 for positions approved prior to voting.
 The neighborhood committees and peasants' associations remain
 the primary government control mechanisms at the local level.
 These groups control people's movements, housing allocations,
 certain food rationing, and political indoctrination at the
 
 
 128
 household level. They are also charged with registering
 Ethiopian youth for national military service. All groups,
 whether neighborhood committees, women's groups, youth organ-
 izations, or peasants' associations, must echo the government
 line. No opposition is tolerated.
 The Government continues to refuse autonomy to Ethiopia's
 various ethnic groups. The insurgencies in Eritrea, Tigray,
 Gondar, Welo, and Sidamo continue to expand. Harsh treat-
 ment is meted out to those suspected of involvement in the
 insurgencies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There is no body within the Government to investigate human
 rights violations, and the Government opposes any international
 and non-governmental organizations' attempts to investigate
 such allegations.  (A display at U.N. headquarters in New York
 lists the names of six Ethiopian employees of the United Nations
 Economic Commission for Africa, headquartered in Addis Ababa,
 who were abducted several years ago by Ethiopian police and are
 yet to be accounted for; one is reported to have died in police
 custody.) There is no cooperation on the part of the Government
 with groups attempting to investigate possible human rights
 abuses. Representatives of the International Committee of the
 Red Cross in Addis Ababa are not allowed to visit political
 prisoners, only prisoner of war internment centers. An Inter-
 national Labor Organization report prepared late in 1982, which
 was critical of labor conditions in Ethiopia, was suppressed at
 Ethiopian insistence. At the U.N. Human Rights Commission in
 1982, Ethiopian representatives helped secure the removal of an
 annex on Eritrean and other ethnic groups in Ethiopia to the
 "Study on Human Rights and Massive Exoduses,' prepared by former
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadruddin Aga Khan.
 The Government does not allow the formation of governmental
 or private organizations that involve themselves with human
 rights.
 Ethiopia has not ratified the Organization of African Unity's
 charter on human rights.
 Amnesty International's concerns included the prolonged deten-
 tion without trial of prisoners of conscience, widespread
 arrests made on political grounds, the Government's continued
 failure to account for several prisoners who "disappeared" in
 custody in 1979 and allegations of torture and harsh treatment
 of prisoners. Freedom House describes Ethiopia as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Ethiopia is among the ten poorest countries in the world.
 In addition to widespread nationalization and land redistri-
 bution, the Government has invoked central planning, govern-
 ment control of production, and distribution, and the use of
 mass organizations to mobilize peasants and urban dwellers
 to achieve economic goals. While these programs have resulted
 in redistribution of land and an overall increase in food
 consumption in rural areas, they have not significantly
 
 
 129
 improved the economy. Overcentralization has strained the
 Government's managerial capabilities and resulted in consider-
 able inefficiency. Ideological constraints have inhibited
 economic initiatives and discouraged agricultural and indus-
 trial production.
 While the Government officially opposes discrimination on the
 basis of sex, religion, or ethnic affiliation, in some in-
 stances it appears to tolerate such discrimination. Although
 their dominance has somewhat lessened since the revolution, the
 Amhara continue to be the dominant group, receiving favoritism
 over other groups such as the Oromo (Galla), Somali, and Falasha.
 A "new class" appears to be developing of those connected to the
 Government and party structure who enjoy good housing and jobs
 and who can avoid the food shortages and the other difficulties
 of the general population.
 A United Nations study on "Law and The Status of Women in
 Ethiopia," published in 1980 (U.N. Economic Commission for
 Africa, African Training and Research Centre for Women),
 concluded that Ethiopian laws and legal practices "reveal
 that women are discriminated against under marriage laws, in
 their participation in political and civic affairs, and that
 they are victimized in terms of not having equal opportunity
 in joining educational institutions and receiving wages
 equal to those of men." The report notes that these inequities
 "are the result of archaic laws and interpretation of pre-1974
 revolutionary reforms." It recommends revision of laws as well
 as legal education for Ethiopian women on their newly acquired
 rights. A 1982 UNICEF study, "The Situation of the Children
 and Women in Ethiopia," also concludes that "The vast majority
 of Ethiopian women are still among the most disadvantaged
 sectors of the population." It cites the following problems:
 high maternal death rates, cultural and traditional biases,
 marriages imposed at a very young age, absence of a government
 policy of family planning, malnutrition of pregnant women, hard
 and time-consuming labor expected of rural women, low literacy
 rate, female circumcision and inadequate employment opportuni-
 ties and decent wages in urban areas.
 Women in Ethiopia have traditionally been limited to circum-
 scribed roles in political, modern commercial, and religious
 spheres of life. Village leadership is male, and all clergy
 are male. At the same time, women in the central Ethiopian
 cultures (Aromo, Amhara, Tigre) have enjoyed the same economic
 rights equally with men. They may inherit, sell or buy prop-
 erty and engage in business. Women have a subjugated status
 within the home, and child marriages remain common. Although
 opposed by the Government, female circumcision is practiced in
 the northern parts of the country.
 Since the revolution, a women's association, the Revolutionary
 Ethiopian Women's Association given legal status in 1980 and
 organized from the national to the local level, has the
 proclaimed goal of improving the status of women. Among its
 plans are included the organization of vocational training
 courses for women, increased employment and education for
 women, and programs to rehabilitate prostitutes. It claims
 that 3.2 million women have benefited from the literacy cam-
 paign and that many laws discriminatory against women are being
 eliminated. Since customs and practices are difficult to
 
 
 130
 overcome, the Association's main focus has been to educate,
 organize and encourage women to participate fully in authorized
 economic and political activities. At the same time, because
 the organization is controlled by the party apparatus, it also
 is heavily engaged in programs to indoctrinate women in the
 principles of Marxism-Leninism in order to establish a broader
 base of support for the regime.
 Women are very poorly represented at the top echelons of govern-
 ment. Only one woman holds a senior position. The education.
 of women sharply lags behind that of men.
 Health conditions are very poor. There has been no notice-
 able change from last year's statistics, which showed one
 physician for every 75,000 persons and one nurse per 5,320
 persons. In areas outside the major cities, health facili-
 ties are virtually non-existent, and even in the urban centers
 they are substandard. Infectious diseases are rampant, and
 leprosy and blindness are serious problems. Only six percent
 of the population has access to safe water: in urban areas,
 18.8 percent of the population has such access; in rural areas,
 only 4.3 percent. The infant mortality rate is high (144 out
 of every 1,000 births).
 Food production remains inadequate, and only massive ship-
 ments of donated food grain from the United States and other
 countries has averted widespread starvation in Eritrea,
 Welo, Gondar, and Tigray administrative regions and shortages
 in other areas. Caloric intake per capita in these regions
 remains inadequate. Only 76 percent of the daily minimum
 requirement is available nationwide (1980). Food shortages
 have resulted in rationing of basic foodstuffs in the cities.
 The Government's literacy program has increased the national
 literacy rate from approximately five percent in 1974 to the
 currently claimed level of 54 percent. World Bank figures
 indicate around 15 percent literacy in the late 1970's.
 Education is being actively pushed in both urban and rural
 areas. Hundreds of thousands of adults have learned to read,
 write, and do simple computations.
 BecaUse of the large percentage of youth in Ethiopia's popula-
 tion and the lack of funds to expand facilities and hire more
 teachers, children in urban areas often have to attend classes
 in morning, afternoon or evening shifts. The most recent
 available figures (1981) showed 1,385,548 males and 744,858
 females in grades 1-6, and 135,786 males and 25,013 females in
 grades 7-8. The percentage of children of primary school age
 enrolled in schools rose to about 47 percent. University
 enrollment was greatly expanded and is currently almost twelve
 thousand. A special effort to increase the number of medical
 school graduates in being made.
 The World Bank estimates that the gross national product
 (GNP) per capita in Ethiopia does not exceed $240 in 1981
 (total GNP for that year being estimated at $3.9 billion).
 The majority of the urban and rural population falls below
 poverty income levels. Government controls on property
 
 
 131
 ownership, foreign exchange, and most commercial transactions
 together with the general uncertain business climate, the
 diversion of resources from development to military needs
 and the inability of the system to provide adequate incentives
 to farmers, workers, and businessmen, have all combined to
 stultify economic growth. On the basis of government figures,
 growth of GNP averaged 2.2 percent since 1974. On the other
 hand, population growth appears to have accelerated, averaging
 2.9 percent per year. A census being conducted by the United
 Nations is expected to show a population of 40 million rather
 than the official current estimate of 33.6 million. Food
 production rates also are not keeping up with population
 growth. Inflation has eroded real income and consumption for
 all. Ethiopia, once a net exporter of food grains, is now a
 net importer.
 Overall, the lot of the rural population is thought to have
 improved since the revolution, except in drought-stricken
 areas. Since land reform eliminated tenant labor on farms,
 peasants keep most of their produce. The Government tries to
 buy surplus grain from the peasantry at low prices for sale in
 the cities. Price controls on agricultural products act as a
 disincentive to increased food production and farmers are given
 little other incentive to produce more than they need for their
 own use. As a result, there are extensive grain shortages in
 the cities and for urban workers the cost of living has in-
 creased more sharply than wage increases.
 Rights relating to ownership of private property have been
 significantly curtailed. Ethiopians whose properties were
 nationalized were neither paid nor promised compensation.
 The remains of the private sector play only a limited and
 fragile role in Ethiopia. Real personal property and business
 property remain subject to nationalization. The hostile
 climate to private investment has brought it nearly to a
 standstill.
