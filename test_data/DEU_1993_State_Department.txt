 GERMANY
 The Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) is a constitutional federal republic and
 a parliamentary democracy. The head of the Federal Government, the Chancellor,
 is elected by the Bundestag, the lower house of Parliament. The powers of the Chan-
 cellor and of the Parliament, which are substantial, are set down in the Basic Law
 Germany's Constitution. Governmental authority is also divided between national
 and state (Land) governments. The states enjoy significant autonomy, especially in
 matters relating to law enforcement and the courts, culture and education, the envi-
 ronment, and social assistance.
 The police system is organized essentially at the state level and operates under
 the direction of state governments. Police forces, in the vast majority of cases, are
 well-trained, disciplined and careful in respecting citizens' rights. Police in eastern
 states, almost exclusively holdovers from the former German Democratic Republic
 (GDR), are still under ing a difficult transition to a complex new legal system and
 different police methods. or example, a 6-month investigation of last year's Rostock
 riots resulted in the dismissal of the Land Interior Minister (who refused to accept
 any criticism of his conduct or police actions). A western German was appointed to
 replace him. The Mayor of Rostock announced his resignation in November 1993
 after the City Parliament produced a report critical of his actions during the dis-
 turbances. Police in the Hessian city of Fulda came under heavy criticism in August
 when they failed to prevent an illegal right-wing demonstration marking the suicide
 of Nazi war criminal Rudolf Hess while simultaneously detaining a group of left-
 wing counter-demonstrators outside the city. In contrast, police forces in the eastern
 states of Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, and Brandenburg, who had in previous years
 been criticized for their failure to deter right-wing extremists, received praise for
 their success in thwarting illegal right-wing demonstrations on the anniversaries of
 both Hess's suicide and 1992s Rostock asylum home attacks. Improved police train-
 ing and law enforcement methods, as well as new preemptive measures, contributed
 to the police's successes.
 Despite a decline in economic output and rising unemployment in 1993, Ger-
 many's industrial economy afforded its residents a high standard of living. In east-
 ern Germany, the number of registered jobless reached almost 1.2 million by the
 end of the year, a rate of over 15 percent, as adjustment to the market economy
 continued. These figures did not reflect the substantial number of underemployed
 
 
 888
 workers persons enrolled in temporary work or training programs, or those forced
 into early retirement, which would swell the proportion to perhaps one-third of the
 work force. Women continue to suffer disproportionately from unemployment in
 Eastern Germany. Unemployment also worsened in the west as the jobless rate
 there rose to 8.1 percent, with some 2.5 million without jobs. Most observers fore-
 cast a return to modest economic growth in 1994, but saw little hope for relief on
 the employment front in the near term. Germany's leadership began a discussion
 of some of the structural issues which were perceived to contribute to economic stag-
 nation and unemployment, such as inappropriate fiscal, regulatory, and social poli-
 cies.
 The Basic Law, adopted in 1949 rests firmly on the principles of liberty, equality,
 and the free exercise of individual rights. In practice, these human rights are pro-
 tected in almost all cases; further, protection against racial and ethnic intolerance
 is provided for under law. However, incidents of violence and harassment directed
 at foreigners, particularly non-Europeans, continued in 1993 and occurred through-
 out Germany. According to the German Federal Police, 5,681 anti-foreigner inci-
 dents (1,341 of which were violent) occurred during the first 11 months of 1993,
 compared to 5,306 during the first 11 months of 1992. The Federal Office for the
 Protection of the Constitution recorded 1,699 instances of violence committed by
 right-wing extremists (against foreigners and others) in the first 11 months of 1993,
 compared to 2,584 during all of 1992. Federal authorities recorded 267 antiforeigner
 motivated arson attacks through November 30, including the May 29 firebombing
 of a Turkish home in the town of Solingen which killed five persons. As of November
 30, right-wing violence had claimed a total of 19 lives. To a large degree, these at-
 tacks were perpetrated by alienated youths many of them "skinheads', and a small
 core of neo-Nazis. All the major parties and all of the leading representatives of the
 Federal Republic denounced the violence, and there was widespread acknowledg-
 ment that police willingness and ability to deal with such violence has notably im-
 proved.
 In the wake of criticism over lenient treatment of perpetrators of antiforeigner vi-
 olence judges began to levy heavier sentences in cases where defendants were moti-
 vated by right-wing hatred. Critics continued to maintain, however, that the judicial
 system failed to treat rightist perpetrators as severely as leftists had been treated
 during previous decades political violence. Government officials recommended new
 legislation designed to enhance law enforcement authorities' abilities to cope with
 right-wing violence. There was also extensive debate about changing citizenship and
 naturalization laws to enable second and third generation non-Germans to attain
 citizenship more easily. Some of the actions taken by the Government to address
 antiforeigner violence-such as the banning of certain neo-Nazi organizations, the
 investigation of extremist political parties, and the censoring of right-wing rock
 music, books, and symbols-raised legal and human rights concerns (see Section 2.).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Politically motivated killing by the
 Government or by mainstream political organizations is unknown. For the second
 year in a row, there were no assassinations by the left-wing terrorist Red Army Fac-
 tion (RAF). A bungled police action to arrest two suspected RAF terrorists, however,
 resulted in the death of a policeman as well as one of the suspects. The RAF suspect
 was killed by a point-blank shot to his head, and witnesses gave contradictory state-
 ments. The Government investigated allegations that this shooting was a deliberate,
 extrajudicial execution, and responsible senior officials, including the Interior Min-
 ister and the acting head of the Federal Police, resigned due to the mismanagement
 of the affair, while the Prosecutor-General was fired. Although questions continued
 to be raised in the press and elsewhere about who killed the RAF member, two of
 three independently commissioned reports concluded that the suspected terrorist
 used his own weapon to kill himself. Swiss police forensics investigators also con-
 cluded that the suspect was killed by his own weapon, and probably by his own
 hand. After reviewing these independent reports, the public prosecutor investigating
 the case concluded that the RAF terrorist, with the intent to commit suicide, shot
 himself in the head following the shootout with police authorities.
 In a few instances, police in Berlin and the eastern states were accused of mis-
 treating foreigners taken into custody. In one of the most egregious cases covered
 in the press, an officer in the Saxony-Anhalt town of Stassfurt fatally shot an un-
 armed Romanian asylum seeker in Janu ar     as the latter fled from guards inside
 a detention center. The victim was being he d because he was unable to provide po-
 lice with identity papers. The officer responsible was immediately suspended, but
 
 
 889
 no charges were filed against him as a result of the ensuing internal investigation.
 The fact that the State Prosecutor's Office did not publicly announce the incident
 until over 2 weeks later led to charges of a cover-up. The internal investigation con-
 cluded that no action needed to be taken against the officer and at years end the
 Saxony-Anhalt State Prosecutor's office was considering whether or not to press
 charges. Three murders also occurred in Germany among rival foreign political fac-
 tions (e.o., Iranians, Kurds and Turks, and Serbs and Croats). The FRG pressed
 charges in these cases.
 b. Dappearance.-Governmental or police authorities do not abduct, secretly ar-
 rest, or otherwise illegally detain persons.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There was no indication that police authorities engaged in these practices. However,
 as noted in Section l.a., there were a few reports of police abuse of foreigners taken
 into custody. As of September 30, 16 Berlin police officers had been charged with
 racially motivated phsical mistreatment of foreigners. Thus far, the Berlin Prsecu-
 tor's Office has investigated four cases, dismissing charges in each instance either
 because of clear evidence of innocence or because of insufficient proof of guilt. Inves-
 tigations of the remaining 12 cases were underway or pending at year's end. In Au-
 gust 700 Vietnamese demonstrated in eastern Berlin to protest alleged mistreat-
 ment of former GDR contract workers and alleged illegal search and seizure prac-
 tices by Berlin authorities. A lawsuit filed by a 14-year-old Turkish Kurd boy, who
 alleged he was injured during a 1992 arrest in Bremen, was dropped by the prosecu-
 tor. The plaintiff appealed the decision.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Unless caught in the act of committing
 a crime, no person may be arrested except on the basis of an arrest warrant issued
 by a competent judicial authority. Any per son detained by the police must be
 brought before a judge and charged no later tan the day following the day of appre-
 hension. The court must then issue an arrest warrant with stated reasons for deten-
 tion or order the person's release.
 There is no preventive detention. A suspect may be held in custody for up to 24
 hours while awaiting a formal charge if there is evidence that he might seek to flee
 the country to avoid prosecution. German law allows the right of free access to legal
 counsel to be restricted only if evidence exists that contact with a specific attorney
 is being used to promote unlawful activity. Only judges may decide on the validity
 of any deprivation of liberty. Bail bond exists but is seldom employed. There is no
 exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trias.-Trials are public. The Basic Law assures due proc-
 ess and prohibits double jeopardy. The judiciary is free of both government inter-
 ference and intimidation by terrorists. There are no political prsoners. The court
 system, largely specialized, has five components: "ordinary" (criminal and civil
 cases); labor (disputes between employers and unions); administrative (administra-
 tive law); "social'"(scial security); and fiscal (taxation). The Federal Constitutional
 Court is the supreme court.
 In the states formerly a part of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), there
 has been substantial progress in reforming the courts to meet western German
 standards. One rre    ninea of weakness onerns a shortage of qualified judges
 in the eastern states. Many experienced judges were disqualifed for reasons reat-
 ing to their political and judicial conduct under the GDR, and many judges had to
 be brought in from the west (see Section 2 b.). Virtually all significant Justice Min-
 istry officials and 70 percent of all judges and prosecutors in the eastern states are
 now from western Germany. Faced with severe personnel shortages, large case
 backlogs, and deep-reaching reorganization, eastern Germany's legal apparatus was
 slow to prosecute cases of extremist violence dating from the spate of right-wing at-
 tacks in late 1992 and continuing extremist activity in 1993. For example, of the
 roughly 200 arrests stemming from the Restock riots-the largest single incident of
 right-wing violence in 1992-only about 40 people had facd trial by year's end. Of
 these, all but three were found guilty, mostly of arson, disturbing the peace, and
 attempted assault. Several initial c arges of attempted manslaughter brought
 against participants in the Restock asylum home attacks were reducedto arson, dis-
 turbing the peace, and attempted assault. The most severe sentence meted out to
 an individual connected with the riots-3 years in prison-was handed down for
 arson and aggravated breach of the public peace. Six persons received prison sen-
 tences of up to 3 years. Other convictions resulted in sentences of probation or juve-
 nile detention.
 Sentences for acts of right-wing violence, such as those meted out in the Rstock
 trials, elicited widespread criticism that the legal system was too lenient with right-
 wing extremists. In part due to such criticism, as 1993 progressed, prosecutors in-
 creasingly sought convictions  or attempted murder or attempted manslaughter in
 
 
 890
 
 cases where right-wing arson attacks or individual assaults resulted, or could have
 resulted, in bodily injury to foreigners. When successful, convictions led to sentences
 of from 4 to 8 years. However, convictions and sentences varied greatly from state
 to state and from judge to judge.
 Germany's Juvenile Penal Code mandates more lenient sentencing and an empha-
 sis on rehabilitation for criminals 21years old or younger. The vast majority of per-
 petrators of right-wing crimes are adolescents who fall into this category, some as
 young as 12 to 14 years of age. German authorities are debating whether to lower
 the age for adult sentencing to 18, in part in an effort to stiffen punishments for
 right-wing offenders.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The in-
 violability of the home is ensured by the Basic Law and respected in practice. Prior
 to forcible entry by police into a home, a warrant must be issued by a judge or, in
 an emergency, by a public prosecutor. Electronic surveillance or monitoring of mail
 may be undertaken only after authorization by a court order. Membership in politi-
 cal parties is completely voluntary. Coercive population control and forced resettle-
 ment are unknown.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The provisions of the Basic Law, an independ-
 ent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system com-
 bine to ensure freedom of speech and press. Criticism of the Government is unre-
 stricted. The media are not censored. In an effort to combat right-wing violence, the
 Government conducted a sweeping crackdown on the right-wing rock music indus-
 try. This action included the raiding of homes and offices of industry personnel and
 the seizing of recordings. The Government outlawed the sale, manufacture, and dis-
 tribution of materials of at least five neo-Nazi rock bands whose songs advocate vio-
 lence and racism. There is no general censorship of foreign or domestic books, al-
 though Nazi propaganda is illegal. Certain Nazi and neo-Nazi insignia, slogans, and
 salutes are prohibited.
 Newspapers and magazines are privately owned. Radio and television networks
 and stations function, for the most part, as corporations under special public laws.
 They are governed by independent oards made up of representatives of churches,
 political parties, and other organizations.
 Academic freedom is effectively guaranteed.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Asembly and Association.-The rights of assembly and as-
 sociation are fully respected, as is the right to demonstrate. Organizers of street
 demonstrations are required to obtain police permits beforehand and may be asked
 to pay a deposit to cover the repair of any damage to public facilities. Such police
 permits are routinely granted. Wen demonstrators have not obtained the required
 permits, lice have exercised restraint, showing concern ultimately only for the
 continuedf functioning of public facilities and for the safety of the general public.
 Membership in nongovernmental organizations of all types, including political
 p arties, is generally open. Parties found to be 'fundamentaly antiemocratic" may,
 however, be outlawed. Under this constitutionally based provision, the Federal Con-
 stitutional Court in the 1950's declared bth a neo-Nazi and a Communist party to
 be illegal, a ban still in effect. In 1993 several extremist parties continued to be
 under observation, i.e., subject to telephone taps, infiltration by undercover agents,
 and document searches, by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BFV,
 the internal security service). In order to conduct such monitoring, law enforcement
 authorities must obtain authorization from a judge to install telephone taps, and
 search warrants are required for document searches. In September, the Government
 asked the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the far-right Free German Workers'
 Party on grounds of threatening the democratic order. Four far-right political orga-
 nizations, which did not enjoy legal status asplitical parties, were banned in No-
 vember and December 1992 on grounds of "endangering or attempting to overthrow
 the fe and democratic constitutional order" or "directing efforts damaging to the
 idea of international understanding (Voelkerverstaendigung)." The BFV reported
 that 43,000 people belonged to far-rIght organizations in 1993, of whom some 6,400
 were considered violence-prone.
 In accordance with the German Unification Treaty's prevision that previous col-
 labration with the former GDR secret plice is incompatible with state service,
 background checks of all up per-level civil servants from eastern Germany are con-
 ducted. Eastern German judges and prosecutors are now investigated to determine
 whether they collaborated with the Stasi secret police in the GDR or were respon-
 sible for pelitically motivated trials or sentences. Commissions within the state min-
 istries of justice then conduct hearings during which examinees are shown any dam-
 aging information and given the opportunity to respond. Decisions of the commis-
 
 
 891
 sions can be appealed in court. A federal law was passed after German unification
 providi   for similar background checks of eastern German lawyers and notaries.
 The checks are conducted by state ministries of justice as well as by lawyers cham-
 bers. Examinees receive a hearing, and can appeal a negative decision in court.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The full practice of religion is allowed. Almost 50 dif-
 ferent churches and religious denominations exist, but most of the population be-
 longs to the Catholic or Protestant churches. Together with the small Jewish com-
 munity, these churches hold a special legal status as corporate bodies under public
 law, giving them, for instance pthe right to participate in a state-administered
 churchtax system. The rest of the population either practics no religion or belongs
 to small independent Christian churches or other faiths, such as Islam. The Govern-
 ment subsidizes church-afliliated schools and provides religious instruction in
 schools and universities for those belonging to the Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish
 faiths.
 Members of the Church of Scientology have complained of harassment, including
 being fired fromjobs and being expele-d (or not permitted .to join) political parties
 solely because of their affiliation with Scientology. Scientologists have successfully
 taken such grievances to court.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--German citizens are free to move anywhere within the country and to
 leave and return at any time.
 The Basic Law guarantees ethnic Germans automatic German citizenship and the
 right to legal residence without restrictions. The number of such ethnic Germans
 comingfrom eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to settle in Germany in
 1993 showed a continued decrease from the all-time high 2 years before. Through
 November 1993, 1.91,845 ethnic Germans had registered to resettle in Germany.
 This total included 181 167 from the countries of the former Soviet Union, 5,228
 from Poland, and 5,190 from Romania.
 Immigrants who are not ethnic Germans can acquire citizenship if they meet cer-
 tain requirements: legal residence in Germany for at least 10 years (5 years for
 those married to Germans); renunciation of all other citizenships; and a basic
 knowledge of German (along with some other minor requirements). German citizen-
 ship is not granted automatically; application is necessary. Legal long-term resi-
 dents often opt not to apply. They receive the same social benefits as do German
 citizens and, after 10 years of legal residency, are automatically entitled to perma-
 nent residency. Representatives of the Turkish, and of the Sinti and Roma Gypsy
 communities, have criticized the citizenship policy as unjust and discriminatory. The
 Government at year's end was considering whether or not to liberalize the natu-
 ralization law.
 The right to asylum for foreigners who are politically persecuted is guaranteed
 under the Basic Law. A record 438,191 asylum seekers entered the FRG in 1992.
 During the first 6 months of 1993, before a new, more restrictive asylum law took
 effect, another 244,718 applications for asylum were filed. During the first 4 months
 following implementation of the new asylum law, applications dropped to 47,795.
 The Government provides food, clothing, and shelter to asylum seekers during proc-
 essing of their applications, often a matter of several months or more. As the influx
 of foreigners steadily increased, placing a heavy burden on an economy already se-
 verely strained by the financial costs of reunification, domestic political pressure to
 restrict the asylum law became overwhelming.
 On May 26, the Parliament approved a constitutional amendment reforming the
 asylum process; it went into effect on July 1. The new law greatly restricted the
 circumstances under which an individual could qualify for political asylum. Persons
 originating directly from countries presumed free of persecution ('safe third
 countries') would not normally be able to claim political asylum. Such applicants
 would, however, have the right to request an administrative review of their applica-
 tions while still in Germany. Persons entering Germany via European Union (EU)
 countries or through identified "safe third countries" also would not be eligible to
 apply for asylum while in Germany. The new law permits the Government to iden-
 tify "safe countries of origin" based on criteria such as human rights reports and
 German Embassy reporting. Adherence to the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to
 the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol is not a criterion for "safe country of
 origin" status. Countries designated as "safe third countries," however, must be sig-
 natories of the Geneva Convention and Protocol.
 Opponents of the new law argued that few third countries could be universally
 termed "safe," and that the law, in failing to allow applicants to rebut the "safe
 third country presumption, would prohibit legitimate asylum seekers from entering
 Germany. The UN. High Commissioner for Refugees has expressed concerns about
 the "safe country" concept, and the language is being reviewed by the Federal Con-
 
 
 892
 stitutional Court. Legal recourse against a negative decision by the authorities on
 an asylum application also was limited by the new law. Critics questioned too the
 quality of the hearings allowed for individuals appealing the "safe country of origin"
 presumption, given the short time (48 hours) allotted for review of these cases. im-
 mediately after the new law went into effect, 14 asylum applicants appealed their
 deportation orders to the Constitutional Court. Several were granted temporary
 stays of deportation pending further review of their cases.
 Two months after implementation of the new asylum law, the number of asylum
 applications had fallen by one-half. Processing had already been accelerated follow-
 ing the introduction of new, automated procedures in April. A second law passed
 in conjunction with the new asylum law, which reduced the share of welfare benefits
 provided to asylum seekers to 75 percent of that generally allotted to German citi-
 zens, was partially responsible for the drop in applications. Exceptions are made in
 such instances as large families with small children. Vouchers and hot meals re-
 placed the reduced cash payments made to asylum seekers, lessening the appeal of
 a stint as an asylum seeker in Germany.
 Short of the right to vote, those granted formal asylum status enjoy full civil
 rights. While approximately 5 percent of the asylum seekers succeed in their re-
 quests for political asylum, denial of political asylum does not automatically result
 in deportation. The majority of applicants who are rejected are typically allowed to
 remain in the country for other humanitarian reasons, especially those from the
 former Yugoslavia. Deportation of illegal immigrants has, however, became more
 common due to the new asylum law as well as an agreement signed with Romania
 in late 1992 arranging the return of Romanian asylum seekers, primarily Gypsies,
 whose applications had been turned down.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Under the Basic Law, the Government is chosen by the people through orderly
 elections based on universal suffrage. The lower house of Parliament, the Bundes-
 tag, which chooses the Chancellor, is elected through a mixture of direct constitu-
 ency candidates and party lists. The upper house, the Bundesrat, is composed of del-
 egations from state governments. New political parties are free to form and enter
 the political process, but the Basic Law and the state constitutions stipulate that
 parties must receive at least 5 percent of the national vote (or win at least three
 directly-elected seats in federal elections) in order to be represented in the federal
 and state parliaments. Although party discipline plays an important role, voting on
 issues in the Bundestag is ultimately a matter of individual decision.
 Women are entitled by law to full participation in political life, and all parties
 have expressed commitment to encourage their greater participation. The Greens re-
 quire that women comprise half of the party's elected officials. The Social Demo-
 cratic Party (SPD) reqMres that women comprise 40 percent of all party committees
 and governing bodies by the end of 1994. Presently,37.7 percent of the SPD's Exec-
 utive Committee members are women. The party has mandated that 33.3 percent
 of SPD candidates running for office in the 1994 Bundestag elections be women. The
 Hesse state government has passed laws requiring that 50 percent of all public sec-
 tor job openings be illed by women. Effective January 1994 the law applies to near-
 ly 400,000 positions. Within the German Government, the tederal Cabinet Minister
 or Women and Youth is responsible f    urthering women's interests in both the
 public and private spheres. Women comprise 21 percent of the current Bundestag
 membership, and its president is a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Private nongovernmental human rights organizations operated freely and without
 harassment in all of Germany, as did international organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Denying access to shelter, employment, health care, and education on the basis
 of race, religion, disability, sex, ethnic background, political opinion, or citizenship
 is illegal.
 Women.-Women generally enjoy full and equal protection under the law, includ-
 ing property and inheritance rights. Young women experience difficulties in gaining
 access to training in some traditionally male fields, but recent court rulings and gov-
 einernment pilot programs helped break down some of these attitudinal and institu-
 tional barriers. Women's rights groups are active in combatting pay inequities, sex-
 ual harassment, and violence against women.
 
 
 Salaries for women in the private sector tend to be lower than salaries for men
 in similar jobs. The Government, through its Labor Ministry, acknowledged the ex-
 istence of unequal, sex-differentiated pay scales in the private sector as a violation
 of the constitutional prohibition aginst discrimination on the basis of sex. Several
 decisions by the National Labor Court in recent years were in favor of women who
 initiated litigation to redress pay inequities.
 The issue of equal pay for equal work is addressed also in the private sector in
 collective bargaining between unions and firms.
 In May the Federal Constitutional Court declared abortion to be unconstitutional,
 ruling that abortion violated the constitutionally guaranteed right to life. The Court
 also declared, however, that first-trimester abortions would not be subject to pros-
 ecution, provided that the woman received counseling beforehand and a doctor per-
 formed the procedure. The Court also limited the types of abortions for which gov-
 ernment assistance could be provided to cases of rape, danger to the life of the
 mother, or rave deformation of the fetus. The ruling struck down a "compromise"
 abortion bill passed by the Parliament in 1992 in an attempt to reconcile the former
 GDR's liberal abortion laws with the strictly regulated abortion policies of the west.
 The 1992 law, which permitted abortions during the first trimester after mandatory
 counseling, did not go into effect owingto a temporary injunction issued by the Con
 stitutional Court at the request of the Christian Democrats and their Bavarian
 ounterpart, the Christian Social Union. Thus  the "divided" abortion law whereby
 eastern German women had a legal right to abortion without restriction during the
 first trimester, and abortion in the western part of Germany was permitted ony on
 medical grounds or in case of extreme economic difficulty, had remained in effect
 until the May 1993 court ruling.
 The unemployment rate for women in the eastern states continued to be high rel-
 ative to men, with women comprising nearly 65 percent of all unemployed workers.
 Prior to German unification, women in the then-GDR worked primarily in the
 health, social work, education and retail sectors, as well as in light industry. Firms
 in these sectors were among die first to go bankrupt or be dismantled in the transi-
 tion from a command to a market economy. As of August, women's unemployment
 in eastern Germany stood at 21.7 percent while the comparable figure for men was
 11 percent.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, is not condoned in law or in prac-
 tice. Interim statistics for reported incidents of rape for the first 6 months of 1993
 showed an increase of about 100 cases over last years figure of 2,406. The women's
 movement has urged public discussion of the problem and tougher penalties for
 crimes against women. In recent years, the Federal Ministr  or  omen and Youth
 commissioned a number of studies to investigate such topics as violence against
 women and sexual harassment. One study concluded that most women are unsure
 of their legal options in cases of sexual harrassment and often fal to come forward
 because of the taboo nature of the topic. The study recommended that legal counsel-
 ing for victims of sexual harassment should be widely publicized and more readily
 available. The study also advocated special training programs for those working in
 public employment offices.
 Children.-While thee In    prn wespread abuse of human orhts of children in
 Germany, the Government recognizes that violence against children is a problem.
 The Ministry for Women and Youth, releasing its 1992 child abuse statistics in Au-
 gust 1993, cited 16,442 reported incidents of sexual abuse and 1,732 reports of other
 physical abuse. Government officials believe that the number of unreported cases
 may be 10 to 20 times higher. Approximately 75 percent of sexual a use agsins
 children is committed by family members, one-third by the child's biological father.
 Based on these figures, the Ministry for Women and Youth pledg d to continue a
 public awareness campaign initiatedin 1992 which seeks to sensitize people to the
 problem, above all by making them more familiar with its dimensions and symp-
 toms, and by teaching them to recognize appeals for help. According to the Ministry,
 counseling and assistance in the area of child abuse have been expanded in recent
 years, in part reflecting the emphasis (as set forth in the Child and Youth Protec-
 tion Law) p laced on prevention.
 Nationl/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Incidents reflecting intolerance of foreign,
 religious, and ethnic minorities occurred in beth western and eastern Germany. for-
 eigers, particularly Romanians, Gypsies, Turks, Poles, and non-Europeans, contin-
 ued to be harassedor attacked mainly by right-wing extremists during 1993. Inci-
 dents of antiforeiger violence in the first 9 months of 1993 increased by 36 percent
 over 1992. The 1.9 million people of Turkish origin in Germany comprise the largest
 ethnic minority. They have been among the primary victims of right-wing violence
 and other acts directed against foreigners.
 
 
 894
 In May a 16-year-old boy firebombed the home of a Turkish family in Solingen,
 killing five of the inhabitants and wounding three. Following the arson attack, thou-
 sands demonstrated to protest xenophobia and right-wing extremism. Chancellor
 Kohl expressed outrage and dismay over the murders, calling for severe handling
 of the perpetrator. President von Weizsaecker was present at a memorial service in
 Cologne for the Solingen victims, although Chancellor Kohl did not attend.
 Noncitizen residents of Germany are prohibited from holding most civil service
 jobs, which include teaching and police posts. Their rights to own property are also
 limited and they are subject to restrictive quotas in universities. Turkish organiza-
 tions complain that such restrictions limit their members' economic opportunities
 and ability to integrate into German society.
 Some people of Turkish origin in Germany felt that government institutions, espe-
 cially the police were unresponsive to their needs, though most admitted that city
 and regional "F'oreigners' Commissioners" were concerned and helpful, if perhaps
 understaffed. Some Turks also alleged that not enough was done to prevent
 recurrences of violence in Solingen or elsewhere. Many Turks think that they and
 other Muslims are discriminated against on religious as well as ethnic grounds.
 Some also pointed out that after the attack at Solingen the p rss turned 1or com-
 ment, not to a spokesperson of from the Turkish community, but to a leader of the
 Jewish community. Turks also complained about a perceived lack of high-level polit-
 ical commitment to foreigners. They criticized Chancellor Kohl's refusal to take part
 in the Solingen memorial services, a refusal some saw as a politically motivated ef-
 fort to cultivate the right wing. President von Weizsaecker, on the other hand, was
 generally redited for hifran ness and onern about the integration of foreigners.
 The Solingen attack prompted a new wave of "copy-cat" violence, causing govern-
 ment authorities to review measures put into place after the Moeln incident. These
 measures included personnel reinforcement in certain law enforcement bodies; ban-
 ning of four neo-Nazi organizations (the Deutsche Alternative, the Deutscher
 Kameradschaftsbund, the Nationale Offensive, and the Nationalistische Front); in-
 creased electronic and open-source surveillance of other right-wing groups, aug-
 mented protection of asylum homes, and an outreach program to trou bled youth. On
 the federal level, no concrete changes have as yet been made as a result of the re-
 view. Individual local governmentshave however, taken some additional action. For
 example, the city of So ingen augmented police protection of homes belonging to for-
 eigners and developed after-school programs for troubled youth.
 In the eastern states, antiforeigner crimes attributable to right-wing extremists
 dropped below 1992 levels in incidence and severity, although on a per capita basis
 antiforeigner violence was more prevalent in the east than in the west. There still
 were incidents of arson attacks against asylum homes and assaults against individ-
 ual non-Germans. Protracted mob sieges of asylum facilities, however, did not recur
 in 1993. On the other hand, the incidence of desecration of Jewish and Russian
 cemeteries, as well as vandalism at concentration camp memorials, rose (see below).
 Although most acts of violence were, as in the past, committed independently by
 small groups with widely divergent ideologies, a new trend, evident in both eastern
 and western states, pointed toward greater coordination among small, previously
 more diffuse neo-Nazi groups. In western Germany, right-wing attacks also were
 more often violent than in previous years, as extremists sought to imitate the 1992
 Moeln firebombing.
 In addition to condemning the violence, the Government recommended tougher
 anticrime legislation and law-enforcement measures as well as measures aimed at
 the societal roots of extremist violence and growing crime rates. Although better
 trained, more experienced, and better versed in federal Germany's legal system than
 in previous years, eastern German police have not yet achieved western German
 standards of effectiveness and efficiency. However, police in eastern Germany
 showed greater success in combatting right-wing violence in 1993, in part due to the
 efforts of special law enforcement task forces created in many states to target right-
 wing crimes. Though there were no cases in 1993 of eastern police inaction in the
 face of mob violence against asylum homes (as occurred in 1992 in Rostock and
 Eisenhuettenstadt) the eastern police continued to face criticism for failing to pre-
 vent ongoing incidents of small-scale right-wing violence and illegal neo-Nazi public
 gatherings.
 In one widely reported incident, for example, police in Buetzee in Brandenburg
 did nothing to halt an illegal demonstration of approximately 200 organized neo-
 Nazis from all over Germany, some dressed in outfits closely resembling uniforms
 of the Schutzstaffel (SS), Hitler's elite guard. (It is illegal to wear SS uniforms in
 Germany. The question of when a uniform closely enough resembles an SS uniform
 to be considered one is a matter of individual court interpretation, although a uni-
 form which uses SS insignias or swastikas is clearly illegal.) That same day, police
 
 
 895
 
 in Prieros, in the same state, stood by as nearly 800 "skinheads" gathered at the
 deputy mayor's home yelling outlawed Nazi slogans.
 In response to accusations of inaction and ineptitude, eastern law enforcement
 and Interior Ministry officials argued that legal prohibitions against surveillance
 and covert intelligence gathering such as phone tapping, limited their ability to pre-
 empt extremist attacks. Police also contended that they could not guard every asy-
 lum home and cemetery and that there was little they could do to stop small-scale
 "hit and run" attacks against asylum homes or individual non-Germans. In the bat-
 tle against extremist violence, governments in the eastern states increasingly called
 on the Federal Government to ban right-wing organizations they considered guilty
 of anticonstitutional activities. State governments can legally outlaw only organiza-
 tions active solely within their state, but if the activities of a right-wing group cross
 state lines, the Federal Government assumes jurisdiction.
 In early November, in a verdict that aroused public criticism for perceived leni-
 ency, a judge in Dresden sentenced three defendants found guilty of killing
 Mozambican laborer Jorge Gomodai. Gomodai died from injuries sustained after
 being thrown from a tram by juvenile skinheads on March 31, 1991. One youth was
 sentenced to 2V2 years in prison, while the two others were given probation and
 fines. Although the court was criticized in the press for the perceived leniency of
 these sentences, they were in fact higher than the prosecutor had sought in light
 of the fact that all three were juveniles at the time of the assault and no "intent
 to kill" could be proven. The court decided on higher penalties than usual after
 hearing that the main defendant had beaten up a passer-by the night before the
 Mozambican was killed.
 The two neo-Nazis charged with the firebombing in Moelln in November 1992-
 which killed three Turkish citizens-were found guilty and given maximum sen-
 tences on December 8, 1993. One attacker received a life sentence, with parole pos-
 sible after 15 years, while the other, who was a minor at the time of the attack,
 got 10 years. Many saw the verdict as a signal that courts will move vigorously
 against right-wing attacks. The defense said that it would appeal to the Constitu-
 tional Court.
 Extremists continued to target the Sinti and Roma Gypsy populations. (In addi-
 tion to asylum-seekers, there are 70,000 Sinti and Roma resident in Germany). Sinti
 and Roma leaders accused the Government of discriminatory behavior in failing to
 recognize Gypsies as a national minority. Some human rights groups and journalists
 also argued tat   e November 1992 German-Romanian agreement allowing for rel-
 atively simple deportation of unq alified Romanian asylum applicants (of whom 60
 percent are Gypsies) singled out Gypsies.
 The Government of Brandenburg was accused of violating the constitutionally pro-
 tected ri hts of the state's SlavicSorb minority population because of its Aprildeci-
 sion to alow the eventual demolition and relocaton of the small village of Homo
 in order to make way for brown coal mining. Sorb activists accused the Government
 of ignoring a prvision in the state constitution guaranteeing the protection and con-
 tinuation of ethnic Sorb settlements. The Government held that Horno was not a
 Sorb settlement (but rather a village of 360 residents in which some Sorbs lived)
 and that the policy affected the entire region, not only the Sorbs.
 State governments in eastern Germany introduced several model social and edu-
 cational programs designed to counteract the root causes of xenophobia and intoler-
 ance, in addition to their efforts to reinvigorate law enforcement measures to crack
 down on violent manifestations of extremism. Thus far, however, financially
 strapped eastern governments have made available only limited funds for suchl
 projects.
 Religous Minorities.-A total of 482 anti-Jewish incidents were recorded during
 the first 10 months of 1993, including 5 cases of assault. Jewish monuments were
 vandalized and at least 45 Jewish cemeteries were desecrated. There were several
 incidents of politically motivated vandalism of the memorial at the former
 Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp. In Soptember over two dozen g~ravestones
 were painted with anti-Semitic and Nai graffiti in the Jewish cemetery i Wriezen.
 Although the Government condemned such anti-Semitic attacks, Jewish leaders and
 others felt that theresponse was inadequate and criticized what they perceived to
 be the Government's slow reaction to xenophobic violence and insensitivity to the
 Jewish community.
 People with Disobilities.-Accrding to German law, anyone who is physically or
 mentally disabled is entitled to seek help in order to avert, eliminate, or improve
 the disability, prevent a deterioration of the condition, or alleviate its consequences
 and to secure a place in society, particularly in the work place, accrding to his or
 her abilities. Laws providing for the disabldar respectedin practice. The German
 social system provides for medical treatment and therapy for the disabled, as well
 
 
 896
 as sickness, maintenance, and disability allowances equal to 80 percent of lost nor-
 mal income. The Government offers vocational training programs for the disabled
 as well as integration grants for employers who hire disabled individuals. Severely
 disabled persons may be granted special benefits, including tax breaks, free public
 transport, special parking facilities, and exemption from radio and television license
 fees.
 The Federal Government has provided guidelines for "barrier-free" construction of
 public buildings, recommending the installation of wheelchair ramps, automatic and
 extra-wide doorways, suitable restroom areas, and the like. Federal authorities have
 also provided guidelines for city streets and sidewalks, suggesting that states man-
 date handicapped parking spaces in public lots, low curbs at crosswalks, and audio
 signals at crosswalk lights. While it is up to the individual states to incorporate
 these guidelines into state building codes, handicapped-access facilities are standard
 throughout Germany.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of workers to associate freely, choose rep-
 resentatives, determine programs and policies to represent members' interests, and
 publicize views is recognized and freely exercised. Thirty-nine percent of the total
 eligible labor force belongs to unions. The German Trade Union Federation (DOB)
 represents 85 percent of organized workers in both eastern and western Germany
 and actively participates in various international and European trade union organi-
 zations. The unions are independent of government and the political parties, al-
 though most union leaders are politically active and some serve as Members of Par-
 liament representing either the principal opposition party or the largest party in the
 governing coalition. There is no restriction on the number of unions, and small par-
 allel unions operate alongside the dominant DGB federation.
 The right to strike is guaranteed by law, except for civil servants (including teach-
 ers) and personnel in sensitive positions, such as members of the armed forces, and
 in 1993 was most notably exercised by eastern German metal workers. International
 Labor Organization (ILO) bodies in 1993 remained critical of the Government's
 broad definition of "essential services" which prevents teachers from legally striking.
 Sanctions imposed on teachers who struck in Hesse in 1989 and the replacement
 of striking postal workers by civil servants in an earlier incident were the specific
 cases that provoked complaints to the ILO. In the case of the postal workers, the
 Federal Labor Court in July 1993 agreed with the ILO, stating the Government may
 not require civil servants to do the work of those engaged in a legal strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is guaranteed by the Basic Law and is widely practiced. No gov-
 ernment mechanism to promote voluntary worker-employer negotiations is required
 because of a well-developed system of autonomous contract negotiations, now ex-
 tended to the eastern states. There is a two-tiered bargaining system whereby basic
 wages and working conditions are established at the industry level and then adapt-
 ed to the circumstances prevailing in particular enterprises through local negotia-
 tions. In 1993 there continued to be reports that some firms in eastern Germany
 either refused to join or withdrew from employers' associations and then bargained
 independently with workers. Some large firms in the west also withdrew at least
 a portion of their workers from the jurisdiction of the employers' associations, com-
 plaining of a lack of flexibility in the system of centralized negotiations. A char-
 acteristic of German industrial relations is the legally mandated system of works
 councils that provides a permanent forum for continuing selective worker participa-
 tion in the management of the enterprise. Workers are fully protected against
 antiunion discrimination and can be reinstated if they can prove they were fired for
 union activity.
 Germany has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is
 barred by the Basic Law and is nonexistent in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Federal law generally prohibits
 the employment of children under age 15, with a few exceptions: children aged 13
 and 14 may do farm work for up to 3 hours per day or may deliver newspapers for
 up to 2 hours per day; children aged 3 through 14 may take part in cultural per-
 formances under stringent conditions with regard to number of hours, time of day,
 and form of activity. The Federal Labor Ministry effectively enforces the law
 through its Factory Inspection Bureau.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated or administratively de-
 termined minimum wage rate. Wages and salaries are set either by collective bar-
 gaining agreements between industrial unions and employer federations or by indi-
 vidual contract. These agreements, which cover about 90 percent of all wage and
 
 
 salary earners, set minimum pay rates and are legally enforceable. These minimum
 wage levels provide an adequate standard of living for workers and their families.
 The number of hours of work per week is regulated by contracts which directly or
 indirectly affect 80 percent of the working population. The average workweek for in-
 dustrial workers in the western part of Germany is 37.6 hours, and in the eastern
 states, about 40 hours.
 Germany has an extensive system of laws and regulations on occupational safety
 and health and incorporates a growing body of European Union-wide standards into
 its own legislation. This system includes the right to refuse to perform dangerous
 or unhealthy work without jeopardizing employment. For each occupation, there is
 a comprehensive system of worker insurance carriers that enforce requirements for
 safety in the workplace. This system has been extended into the eastern states,
 where lax occupational health and safety standards and conditions under the Com-
 munist regime created serious long-term problems. The Federal Labor Ministry and
 its counterparts in the states effectively enfore occupational safety and health
 standards through a comprehensive network of government structures, including
 the Federal Institute for Work Safety. At the local level professional and trade asso-
 ciations-self governing public law corporations with delegates from the employers
 and from the unions-oversee the prevention of workplace accidents as well as
 worker safety.
