 DOMINICA
 Dominica is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. A Prime Minister, a Cabinet and a unicameral Legislative
 Assembl compose the Government. A President, nominated by the Prime Minister
 in consultation with the leader of the opposition party, elected for a 5-year term by
 the Parliament, is head of state. The United Workers Party (UWP), led by Prime
 Minister Edison James, won 11 of 21 seats in Parliament in free and fair elections
 in June 1995 and gained an additional seat in 1996. The Constitution calls for elec-
 tions at least every 5 years. The judiciary is independent.
 The Dominica Police is the only security force. It is controlled by and responsive
 to the democratically elected Government.
 Dominica's primarily agrarian economy depends on earnings from banana exports.
 The Government is also developing the tourist industry, diversifying agricultural
 production, and promoting the export of fresh fruits, vegetables, and coconut prod-
 ucts, both within and outside the region. Per capita gross domestic product was
 about $2,900 in 1996.
 Human rights are generally well respected. The principal human rights problems
 continued to be occasional instances of use of excessive force by police, poor prison
 conditions, societal violence against women and children, and instances of discrimi-
 nation against indigenous Carib Indians.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices. There were again allegations of occasional
 use of excessive force by the police. In one case, a prisoner on remand claimed to
 have been beaten repeatedly over the course of 2 weeks, a charge supported by sub-
 sequent medical examination. The police and the Director of Public Prosecutions
 have been criticized for failing to investigate fully and prosecute these cases.
 Prison conditions are poor. Overcrowding and unsanitary conditions continue to
 be problems in Dominica's only prison facility. The prison provides work therapy,
 sports programs, educational opportunities, and counseling for inmates.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law requires that police chargeper-
 sons with a crime within 24 hours after arrest or detention or release them rom
 custody. This is generally honored in practice, although ofte-i those arrested on Fri-
 days remain the weekend in jail and are not charged until the following Monday.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and it is independent in practice.
 The judicial system is composed of three magistrate's courts and a high court. Ap-
 peals can be made to the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court and to the Privy Coun-
 cil in the United Kingdom.
 The law provides or public trial before an independent, impartial court. Criminal
 defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty, are allowed legal counsel,
 and have the right to appeal. Courts provide free legal counsel to the indigent only
 in capital cases.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the right of free
 expression, and the Government respects this in practice. The political opposition
 openly criticizes the Government.
 The principal main radio station is state-owned and has a government-appointed
 board. There is also an independent radio station owned by the Catholic Church.
 The print media consist of two private newspapers andplitical party journals; all
 publish without censorship or government interference. Citizens a so enjoy good ac-
 cess to independent news sources through cable television and radio reception from
 neighboring islands.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the authorities respect them in
 practice. The Government may revoke passports if subversion is suspected but has
 not done so in recent times.
 The Government has not formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first
 asylum. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no re-
 ports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status; however,
 government practice remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 In the last national elections in June 1995, the United Workers Party defeated
 the incumbent Dominica Freedom Party, taking 11 of 21 seats in Parliament. In a
 by-election in August 1996, the UWP gained an additional seat when it won a seat
 vacated by a member of the Dominica Freedom Party, giving the UWP a total of
 12 seats. The Dominica Freedom Party currently holds four seats, and the Dominica
 Labour Party holds five seats.
 There are no impediments in law or in fact to the participation of women in lead-
 ership roles in government or political parties. Voters elected two women to Par-
 liament in the June 1995 elections. Indigenous Carib Indians participate in national
 political life.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 . vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no government restrictions on the formation of local human rights orga-
 nizations, although no such groups exist. Several advocacy groups, such as the Asso-
 ciation of Disabled People and a women's and children's self-help organization, oper-
 ate freely and without government interference. There were no requests for inves-
 tigations of human rights abuses from international or regional human rights
 groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution includes provisions against racial, sexual, and religious discrimi-
 nation, which the authorities respect in practice.
 Women.-Beyond the general protection of the Constitution, women do not benefit
 from any specific civil rights legislation. There is little open discrimination against
 women, yet sexual harassment and domestic violence cases are common, and there
 is no family court to deal specifically with domestic violence issues. Women can
 bring charges against husbands for battery, and both the police and the courts pros-
 ecute cases of rape and sexual assault, but there are no specific spousal abuse laws.
 The Department of Labor recruited a permanent counselor and established a crisis
 response mechanism to assist women who are victims of domestic violence. The Wel-
 fare Department assists victims of abuse by finding temporary shelter, providing
 counseling to both parties, or recommending police action. The Welfare Department
 reports all cases of abuse to the police. The courts may issue protective orders, but
 the police do not consistently enforce them.

 Property ownership continues to be deeded to "heads of households," who are usu-
 ally males. When the husband head of household dies without a will, the wife can-
 not inherit the property or sell it, although she can live in it and pass it to her chil-
 dren. In the civil service, the law establishes fixed pay rates for specific jobs, what-
 ever the gender of the incumbent. There is no law requiring equal pay for equal
 work for private sector workers.
 The Dominica National Council of Women, a nongovernmental organization
 (NGO), has developed local adult education and small business training programs
 for women. According to the Labor Department, many women in rural areas find
 it difficult to meet basic needs, at least in part owing to the decline in the banana
 export industry.
 Children.-The law stipulates that the Government should protect the rights of
 children to education and health care. Education is compulsory through age 16, and
 primary health care is available islandwide.
 Various laws enumerate children's rights, but their enforcement is hampered by
 lack of staffing in government agencies. Known cases of child abuse have more than
 doubled since 1993, when 253 were recorded. According to the Welfare Department,
 reports of sexual abuse tripled since 1993, with over 350 cases in 1996. The Govern-
 ment has not responded with any increase in the number of social workers assigned
 to handle such cases. The social welfare office, which has only six staff members
 to deal with all welfare problems, handles complaints of child abuse. In one particu-
 larly disturbing case that highlighted the acute need for organized care for un-
 wanted or disabled children, a 15-year-old epileptic was caged and tied in a cellar
 by her mother for extended periods without food or care.
 Although the maximum sentence for sexual molestation (rape, incest) is life im-
 prisonment, the normal sentence given is 15 years except in the case of murder. The
 age of consent to sexual relations is 16 years.
 People With Disabilities.-Beyond the general protection of the Constitution, there
 is no specific legislation dealing with the disabled. However, the labor laws permit
 authorization of employment of a disabled person for less than the minimum wage,
 in order to increase opportunities for employment of the disabled (see Section 6.e.).
 There is no requirement mandating access for those with disabilities.
 Indigenous People.-There is a significant Carib Indian population, estimated at
 3,000, of a total population of 72,000. Most live on a 3,700-acre reservation created
 in 1903. School, water, and health facilities available on the Carib reservation are
 rudimentary but similar to those available to other rural Dominicans. Indigenous
 Carib Indians enjoy the same civil rights accorded other Dominican nationals.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers have the legal right to organize, to
 choose their representatives, and to strike, but unions represent less than 10 per-
 cent of the work force. All unions are independent of the Government. While there
 are no direct ties, members of certain political parties dominate some unions. There
 is no restriction on forming labor federations, and unions are affiliated with various
 international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have legally defined
 rights to organize workers and to bargain with employers. Collective bargaining is
 widespread in the nonagricultural sectors of the economy, including the government
 service, and there is also recourse to mediation and arbitration by the Government.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers, and judicial and police au-
 thorities enforce union rights. In addition, employers must reinstate workers fired
 for union activities. It is compulsory by law or employers to recognize unions as
 bargaining agents once both parties have followed appropriate procedures. Depart-
 ment of Labor inspectors under the supervision of the Labor Commissioner enforce
 labor legislation, but the small Labor Inspection Office lacks qualified personnel to
 carry out its duties.
 Labor regulations and practices governing Dominica's industrial areas and export
 firms do not differ from those prevailing in the rest of the economy.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and such labor is not known to exist.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits forced or bonded child labor, and the Government enforces this prohibition
 effectively. The minimum legal age for employment is 15 years. Employers generally
 observe this law without government enforcement.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets minimum wages for various cat-
 egories of workers. These were last revised in November 1989. The minimum wage
 rate for most categories of workers is $0.56 (EC$1.50) per hour, but for domestic
 servants it is $0.37 (EC$1.00) per hour if meals are included, and $0.46 (EC$1.25)

 per hour if meals are not included. The minimum wage is not sufficient to provide
 a decent standard of living for a worker and family. However, most workers (includ-
 ing domestics) earn more than the legislated minimum wage.
 The labor standard laws state that no employer shall establish or maintain dif-
 ferences in wages between male and female employees performing the same or simi-
 lar work with parallel responsibilities under similar conditions. The law further
 states that no employer may reduce the wages of an employee to comply with equal
 wage standards. The labor laws also provide that the Labor Commissioner may au-
 thorize the employment of a handicapped person at a wage lower than the minimum
 rate in order to enable a handicapped person to be gainfully employed.
 The standard legal workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. The law provides for a mini-
 mum of 2 weeks' paid vacation per year. The Employment Safety Act provides occu-
 pational health and safety regulation. Local NGO's and one major union consider
 it to be consistent with international standards. The Advisory Committee on Safety
 and Health is an established body but has never met. The rarely used enforcement
 mechanism consists of inspections by the Department of Labor, which can and does
 prescribe specific compliance measures, impose fines, and prosecute offenders. Work-
 ers have the right to remove themselves from unsafe work environments without
 jeopardy to continued employment.
