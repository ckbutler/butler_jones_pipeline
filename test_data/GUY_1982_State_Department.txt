 GUYANA
 The 1980 Constitution defined the Cooperative Republic of
 Guyana as a democratic sovereign state in the course of transi-
 tion from capitalism to socialism. Guyana maintains the
 structure of a multi-party parliamentary republic within the
 Commonwealth, but the ruling People's National Congress and its
 leader, President Forbes Burnham, have imposed a racially
 oriented, minority government on the nation. The 1982 report
 by Freedom House, a US organization, classifies Guyana as
 "partly free."
 The predominantly Afro-Guyanese party and President Burnham
 have consolidated power, to a great extent, through such
 nondemocratic means as electoral fraud, access to unaudited
 public funds, harassment of the opposition, and interference
 with the judiciary. Officially, the party operates on
 Marxist-Leninist principles with the goal of making Guyana a
 non-aligned cooperative socialist state. It came to power in
 1964 in British-supervised elections which, although flawed,
 were the last relatively free national elections held in
 Guyana. The 1980 Constitution, which established an executive
 presidency dominating the legislative branch, was a practical
 acknowledgement of Burnham's long-time political dominance and
 personal power.
 The only major opposition group is the People's Progressive
 Party, an orthodox Moscow-aligned communist party which holds
 10 of the 65 parliamentary seats. Led by the Caribbean's
 pioneer leftist, Dr. Cheddi Jagan, it has traditionally
 appealed to the East Indian majority in Guyana, more from
 ethnic loyalty than political persuasion. The party's strident
 ideological orthodoxy has diminished its appeal to the basi-
 cally entrepreneurial and conservative East Indians.
 The only other opposition party of consequence in the recent
 past was the small, multi-ethnic, and leftist Working People's
 Alliance. Its momentum diminished, however, with the violent
 death in 1980 of its leader, Dr. Walter Rodney. Despite offi-
 cial denials, available information has linked government
 agents to Rodney's death. There is also evidence that Working
 People's Alliance members or sympathizers have engaged in
 para-military training, illegal gun importation, and other such
 illicit activities. The remaining opposition groups, mostly
 moderate in nature, have been unsuccessful in generating mass
 support.
 Guyana is a developing country with a tri-sectoral economy
 comprising public, private, and cooperative sectors. The
 public sector dominates the economy, however, by controlling
 approximately 80 percent of total productive assets. The
 state-owned bauxite and sugar industries, along with the
 partially state controlled rice sector, account for more than
 90 percent of total official exports. Believing that economic
 control is a key to political survival, the Government has been
 reluctant to give the local private sector a greater role in
 the economy. The cooperative sector's contribution to the
 economy is miniscule. Re-emphasizing its commitment to
 socialism, the People's National Congress declared in April
 that it would tolerate no "ideological acrobatics."
 By tradition and historical circumstance, the Guyanese are a
 friendly, peaceful people with strong cultural and family ties
 to Great Britain and North America. Overt antagonism between
 Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese has decreased since the vicious
 
 
 race riots of the early sixties. The two principal political
 parties, however, continue to exploit racial differences for
 political gain. Though the parties' political leaders court
 the favor of leading socialist states, the majority of Guyanese
 perceive these nations as basically alien and unappealing.
 The human rights environment has significantly deteriorated
 over the years from the traditions once respected in Guyana
 prior to independence and from what is currently observed in
 most of the English-speaking Caribbean. It has become increas-
 ingly clear, moreover, that traditional conceptions of haman
 rights--the integrity of the person and civil and political
 liberties--are being subordinated to the Government's efforts
 to remain in power.
 In 1982 there was no major deterioration in the human rights
 climate from that in 1981. On the positive side, judicial
 independence was asserted in several cases of a political
 nature in which the Government was defeated. Also, the
 state-run media exhibited during the year some balance, partic-
 ularly in addressing government shortcomings and covering the
 principal opposition party. Negatively, there was strong
 evidence that torture by members of the government security
 forces led to the deaths of several prisoners. The economic
 crisis brought about a decline in essential services, education
 facilities, and health care.
 The human rights prognosis is not favorable as the Government
 is becoming less and less accountable to the electorate, the
 constitution, the courts, and other checks and balances associ-
 ated with democratic traditions.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 According to the Guyana Human Rights Association, 14 individ-
 uals reportedly died from police shootings in the 12-month
 period ending August 31, 1982. The state owned "Guyana
 Chronicle" reported that several of these victims were shot
 while committing felonies or while trying to escape capture and
 detention. However, by other accounts, two of these individ-
 uals were shot shortly after being taken into custody.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no clandestine detentions, abductions, or reported
 disappearances of a political nature in 1982.
 c. Torture
 Despite a constitutional injunction against torture, there were
 several reported incidents of individuals being tortured to
 death while in police custody. None of these reported killings
 appeared to have been politically motivated, however.
 Ramkisson Saymar, held on suspicion of robbery, died on January
 18, 1982, from injuries sustained during detention.
 Chatterpaul Kisson, a-convict, complained of a severe beating
 at the hands of the police prior to his death on July 28.
 Public hospital doctors reportedly confirmed that beating had
 been the cause of death. Balkissoon Singh, a prison escapee,
 was recaptured and died in custody April 1. His body was
 allegedly found with cigarette burns and other marks of
 torture. Fellow escapee, Ramhaj Seepersaud, was said to have
 
 
 534
 died under similar circumstances. In the cases of Singh and
 Seepersaud, the prison director reportedly was transferred, but
 murder charges against four prison officials were changed to
 manslaughter, and they were released on bail.
 Guyanese authorities have generally not responded publicly to
 charges of torture and mistreatment. On several occasions, the
 Minister of Home Affairs or the Police Commissioner indicated
 that investigations would ensue, but no information on the
 results of these investigations has been made public. The
 freqtfency and detail of these reports and the Government's
 refusal to follow them up has given credence to the allegations
 of torture. At the very least the evidence indicates there has
 been a slippage of discipline among the police ranks and an
 absence of accountability to civilian authority.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Guyanese prison sentences for major crimes are often light.
 Corporal punishment is occasionally meted out as part of a
 sentence. Conditions of detention have deteriorated as a
 result of the economic crisis in Guyana. The Government
 admitted in its 1980 report on the Guyana Prison Service
 (published in 1982) that prison structures were rapidly deteri-
 orating, adding that prison buildings present "grave hazards to
 health and security of staff and inmates alike." There have
 also been complaints of juveniles being incarcerated with adult
 prisoners, leading to sexual abuse of the younger prisoners.
 There is evidently no unequal treatment of prisoners based on
 race, religion, or sex.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary searches and short detentions, particulary of opposi-
 tion political figures, are relatively common in Guyana.
 However, lengthy imprisonment in disregard of generally
 accepted legal norms is not a practice of the Burnham Govern-
 ment. The right of habeas corpus exists and is generally
 respected. Searches without a warrant and preventive detention
 for up to three months are authorized under the National
 Security Act. According to the Constitution, persons arrested
 or detained must be informed as soon as "reasonably practi-
 cable" of the reasons for such arrest and detention. Illegal
 detentions of several days for interrogation purposes, without
 formal charges, reportedly occurred in several instances.
 Searches in homes and public places and short detentions of
 political figures on specious charges appear to be related more
 to harassment than to security reasons.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As a member of the British Commonwealth, Guyana still maintains
 most of the procedures associated with British jurisprudence.
 Defendants in ordinary civil and criminal cases are generally
 accorded fair, public trials. Defendants exercise their right
 to be represented by counsel and are usually presented with
 charges in a timely fashion. Jury trials have decreased in
 Guyana since the enactment of the Administration of Justice Act
 in 1978 and the Criminal Law Act of 1980 which allow a trial
 without jury for a wide range of offenses. Cases may be
 appealed to higher courts. Military personnel are tried in
 military courts. Verdicts in military courts have been
 successfully appealed in civilian courts. There are no special
 courts for political or security cases. Judges have complained
 
 
 535
 in 1982 of a decline in court standards which included incon-
 sistent sentencing, poorly written judicial opinions, unpre-
 pared attorneys, and absent witnesses and jurors. This sloppi-
 ness, criticized in both the government and opposition press,
 has often led to lengthy delays in the resolution of cases.
 There is a perception within Guyana that judicial practice has
 led and will-continue to lead to politically biased decisions
 by judges and lawyers sympathetic to the ruling party. Some
 judges maintained their independence as shown by several polit-
 ically sensitive cases in 1982 which went against the Govern-
 ment. In one, the leader of a small, moderate opposition party
 was awarded $366 in damages and costs because the Government-
 owned "Guyana Chronicle" had refused in 1978 to print a paid
 political advertisement for the party. The court ruled that
 the plantiff's constitutional right to freedom of expression
 had been violated.
 Other cases, however, raised serious questions about the inde-
 pendence of both bar and bench. Members of several opposition
 parties were involved in often delayed trials on charges of
 causing public terror. Nine members of one party were found
 guilty and fined $66 or sentenced to two months in jail. The
 Government, however, has not attempted to collect the fines or
 imprison those found guilty.
 One publicizeA trial in 1982 was that of Bilal Ato, a member of
 the House of Israel, a pseudo-religious organization run by
 American citizen David Hill and widely perceived as a private
 army of the ruling party. Ato was on trial for murdering a
 Jesuit priest who was photographing a political rally in 1979.
 Defended by two pro-government lawyers, Ato's charge were
 reduced to manslaughter, and he received an eight-year
 sentence. One of the lawyers who defended Ato also acted as
 state prosecutor in the case of the brother of the late polit-
 ical activist, Walter Rodney. Donald Rodney was found guilty
 in 1982 of the illegal possession of the explosives used to
 kill his brother. Rodney was sentenced to eighteen months in
 prison, but he is free on bail pending appeal.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Search warrants are ordinarily issued by magistrates on reason-
 able belief that a crime may be detected or prevented. The
 National Security Act allows the police to search for and seize
 illegal weapons without a warrant "pursuant to any reasonable
 requirements of public safety and order." In fact, authorities
 ostensibly searching for weapons have used the act as an excuse
 to enter and search premises of opposition figures. The
 People's Progressive Party reported in early February that
 authorities conducted some fifty searches and arrests of its
 activists, seizing party membership cards and publications.
 The Guyana Human Rights Association reported that 115 searches
 of homes of members of the Working People's Alliance occurred
 in the period from August 1981 to May 1982.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press, in modified form, exist in Guyana,
 but the overwhelming preponderance of information, political
 and otherwise, is disseminated by the Government. Little
 criticism of government policy or of ruling political figures
 is printed or broadcast by the state media, although some radio
 
 
 536
 phone-in and interview programs allow some criticism. A
 government and party campaign was launched earlier this year to
 explain Guyana's economic crisis. Citizens had the opportunity
 to question government policy, and, for a while, a perceptible
 increase in self-criticism occurred in the Government's "Guyana
 Chronicle."
 The Government adheres to the "new world information order" and
 believes that the state-owned media should, above all, serve
 developmental needs, a concept which has led to suppression and
 distortion of news, self-censorship, and, at times, direct
 interference in the news gathering and reporting efforts of
 official media representatives. For example, government media
 editors were chastised for printing stories and photos of food
 lines. Also government reporters were not allowed access to
 information about government economic programs.
 Opposition political groups were allowed to express publicly
 their viewpoints through press, other publications, and at
 their rallies, albeit with some hardships. The Government,.
 which centralized the importation of newsprint some time ago,
 has been frugal in its allocation. Because of a lack of
 newsprint due to foreign exchange shortages, the Government
 daily has been reduced to an eight-page edition, six days a
 week. The opposition "Mirror" continued to challenge in the
 courts the Trade Ministry's "unconstitutional and discrimina-
 tory" refusal to grant it newsprint import licenses. The
 Government refused four times in 1981 and 1982 to allow the
 opposition "Catholic Standard' to import donated newsprint, an
 action in conflict with the Government's assertion-that foreign
 exchange shortages alone have required newsprint restrictions
 on the opposition press.
 At the end of August 1982, government officials, including the
 President, brought a series of libel suits against the
 "Catholic Standard," the opposition "Open Word" of the Working
 People's Alliance, and others for various publications
 criticizing government officials and policies. The content of
 the articles in question and the number of lawsuits led many to
 the conclusion thatthe suits were intended less to recover
 damages than to embroil the small staffs of these opposition
 entities in lengthy litigations.
 Opposition pamphlets and articles are produced in Guyana, but
 all such reproduction efforts must contend with a national
 shortage of paper and other imported materials. The Govern-
 ment's information policy as well as foreign exchange restric-
 tions have led to a curtailment of a free flow of information
 from the outside. Films are generally of a non-controversial
 type and a government censorship board reviews them for moral
 and political acceptability. Though Guyanese are free to
 receive printed materials from abroad, the Government normally
 does not allocate scarce foreign exchange for their import.
 The anti-government "Caribbean Contact" is sold on the streets,
 limited quantities of "Time" and "Newsweek" may be found in
 several locations, and the Voice of America, British Broad-
 casting Corporation, Radio Moscow, Radio Antilles, and various
 other shortwave and longwave broadcasts can be heard in
 Guyana. The British Broadcasting Corporation World Service
 News is broadcast twice daily over one of the government radio
 stations.
 Publications from socialist states are found in abundance in
 retail, government, and the People's National Congress and
 People's Progressive Party bookstores. The Government retains
 
 
 537
 wire service contracts with Associated Press and International
 Press Service, but these facilities are under the control of
 the Government's Guyana News Agency, which selectively edits
 items for distribution to the Government-owned radio and
 newspapers.
 Academic freedom in Guyana does not flourish, although several
 Working People's Alliance leaders do teach at the University of
 Guyana, and opposition parties have organized student groups at
 the university itself. The university's governing council is
 predominantly comprised of members of the ruling party. In
 1982 the council fired a newly appointed instructor primarily
 because the individual had expressed critical views of the
 'Government.
 No media organ was closed in 1982. One opposition newssheet
 began weekly publication. However, harassment in the form of
 libel suits, airport searches of journalists, personal attacks
 in the government-controlled press, and newsprint restrictions
 have all contributed to the circumscription of press freedom in
 Guyana.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government controls freedom of assembly and association.
 Government permission was extended in 1982 for dozens of polit-
 ical gatherings held by opposition groups. The opposition
 claimed at times, however, that permission was given at the
 last minute, and meetings or rallies were allowed only at
 inconvenient hours. Individuals attempting to march after a
 June memorial service for Walter Rodney were dispersed by
 police. Marches by the Government, the People's National
 Congress, or the latter's affiliates were routinely permitted.
 The right of trade unions to organize, negotiate, and strike
 exists, but with some government limitations. Delegates to the
 Trades Union Congress annual delegates conference in September
 1982 passed a resolution noting the erosion of trade union
 rights over the last year. Several unions have come out in
 open protest against the neutralization of the trade union
 movement by the ruling party. The Congress' Executive
 Committee is composed primarily of party supporters including
 members of the President Burnham's cabinet. Several of the 23
 unions under the Congress' umbrella are formally affiliated
 with the ruling party.
 While the Congress often appears to be a standard-bearer for
 trade union rights, its actions belie the image. Collective
 bargaining for wages, taken out of the hands of individual
 unions since 1977, has become an exercise of the Government
 dictating the terms of wage increases to the Congress. While
 maintaining that workers have the right to strike, the Govern-
 ment has claimed the authority to deem strikes political and to
 take action to suppress them. No major strikes took place in
 1982, but short work stoppages by People's Progressive Party
 unionists were a regular occurence.
 Party and government influence on the trade union movement is
 widespread, particularly given the Government's control of jobs
 and the unions' lack of financial resources to support indus-
 trial action. At times the Government has interfered directly
 in union elections or recognition disputes. Dissident union
 leaders have experienced searches by police as well as personal
 attacks in the state-run media.
 
 
 538
 Professional groups by and large do not experience persecution
 or intimidation. The Guyana Bar Association has maintained its
 independence from the Government, releasing several times this
 year press statements protesting government violations of civil
 rights. Both unions and professional groups maintain relations
 with recognized international bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government respects the free exercise of religion in what
 is fundamentally a religious society. There is no state
 religion nor restrictions on religious ceremonies or the
 teaching of religion. There is no discrimination against or
 persecution of adherents of any religion nor is favor conferred
 on individuals by virtue of their membership in a religion.
 Conversion from one religion to another is freely permitted.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement and residence within Guyana are unre-
 stricted except in certain designated Amerindian areas where
 travelers have to obtain prior government permission to enter.
 The Government at times has barred opposition members and
 Catholic missionaries from entering the Amerindian areas.
 Opposition political figures have occasionally been stopped and
 searched at police roadblocks.
 The Government does not restrict emigration. Observers have
 characterized the emigration process in Guyana as a government
 safety valve which allows the dissatisfied to leave rather than
 to remain behind and press for change. There was no overt
 persecution or discrimination of intended emigrants even when
 they were high-level employees of the Government.
 Guyanese are free to travel abroad and do travel extensively in
 North America and the Caribbean. However, the Guyanese
 economic decline has hampered foreign travel, particularly
 since the Government was forced to curtail foreign exchange
 allocations for travelers.
 The courts have defended citizens' rights to travel abroad as
 reflected in the November 1981 decision upholding the right of
 Rupert Roopnarine, a Working People's Allance leader, to leave
 the country. Nonetheless, the Government has subjected its
 opponents to unreasonable searches and delays at the airport.
 Political opponents have not been denied reentry into Guyana.
 The Government encourages repatriation in the hope that
 returning Guyanese will strengthen the economy, but economic
 and political conditions have discouraged many Guyanese from
 returning. There were no reports of Guyanese citizenship being
 revoked in 1982. No refugees were accepted.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 For the majority of Guyanese, the opportunity for meaningful
 participation in the political process has been quite limited.
 Although people have the right to form political parties, those
 parties, other than the ruling one, have minimal influence
 largely because of the tight control over the political
 environ- ment exercised by President Burnham and a small inner
 circle of government officials and ruling party members. The
 concept of paramountcy of the ruling party, the People's
 National
 
 
 539
 Congress, has been detrimental to general public participation
 in the political system.
 Under the doctrine of party paramountcy, the Government has
 become an appendage of the party, and the party employs the
 apparatus and power of the state to advance its aims. The party
 has assumed the right to assert its influence and control over
 many activities of the society, thereby discouraging political
 dynamics in Guyana. Claiming a mandate from national
 elections, widely considered fraudulent, the ruling party has
 subverted and ignored institutional mechanisms ultimately
 accountable to the governed. The near-eradication of the
 distinction between government and party has led to an exten-
 sive system of patronage in the public sector with the party
 rewarding its supporters with jobs.
 Members of the government security services have also been
 subjected to party influence, and the services' institutional
 independence has decreased significantly over the years. With
 a large percentage of the work force dependent upon the party
 and government for employment, Guyanese have become reluctant
 to oppose the state, fearing dismissal, transfer, loss of
 benefits, or harassment. Political change through the ballot
 box has proven futile. Though elections for national office
 have taken place three times since independence, fraudulent
 overseas and proxy voting, along with government misuse of its
 control over registration and vote counting, have guaranteed
 the People's National Congress victories each time.
 The ability of the Guyanese to participate politically has also
 been adversely affected by the Government's strict control of
 information. Many policies and decisions of national import,
 decided in cabinet or closed party meetings, if announced, were
 done so with little or no warning or opportunity for public
 debate. The safeguards of parliamentary democracy have been
 also absent with the National Assembly having become essen-
 tially a rubber-stamp parliament. The 1980 Constitution sets
 out a structure for local democratic bodies, but the placement
 of party loyalists who have been required to take direction
 from the party in all important matters has further fettered
 popular involvement. The bombing death of Walter Rodney and
 instances where force was used to thwart opposition political
 initiatives have led many Guyanese to assume that the
 Government will go to any lengths to preserve its power.
 The belief that the state security forces have become the
 private protectors of the ruling party has done more to
 undermine political activism than any other single factor.
 Disenchantment, fear, despair, and apathy characterize the
 attitudes of the majority of Gjyanese toward politics. The
 East Indian majority often complains of having no stake in the
 political life of the nation. However, these attitudes have
 not manifested themselves in subversive activities against the
 government.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Guyana is a signatory to the U.N. International Agreement on
 Civil and Political Rights, but it has shown little interest in
 cooperating with international or regional human rights
 bodies. Guyana's report to the U.N. Human Rights Commission on
 human rights practices within Guyana, an obligation acquired
 under the agreement, was submitted in 1982, four years late.
 
 
 540
 The Commission deemed the report inadequate and incomplete and
 requested the Guyanese representative to address the Commis-
 sion's specific inquiries for additional information.
 In 1980 the Government permitted an international observer team
 and other foreign observers to witness the December 1980 elec-
 tions. Police detained several of the observers for a short
 time and warned against taking photographs. Amnesty Inter-
 national observers attended the 1980 trials of several opposi-
 tion members accused of arson and the 1982 trial of Donald
 Rodney. Amnesty International's liaison officer for Latin
 America and the Caribbean also visited Guyana in January 1982.
 Following the death of Walter Rodney in 1980, Amnesty
 International requested an independent inquiry into the
 slaying, but the Government has yet to respond. On the whole,
 the Government is sensitive to its human rights record and
 reluctant to admit to reported violations or accommodate inves-
 tigations. Human rights issues receive little attention in the
 state-run media, with the principal exception of discussions on
 South Africa's policy of aparthied and the issue of Palestinian
 rights.
 The Guyana Human Rights Association, founded in 1979, is the
 foremost Guyanese organization which attempts to protect and
 promote human rights. It does so primarily through the publi-
 cation of an annual report and periodic press releases describ-
 ing alleged violations. Its reporting is gleaned mostly from
 media sources. The Guyana Bar Association also regularly
 releases statements condemning alleged violations of human
 rights. In addition, the opposition media actively covers
 reported violations.
 There has been no physical harassment of human rights activists
 in Guyana, although government leaders and the state media have
 attacked them verbally. In a December 1981 speech to police
 officers, the Minister of Home Affairs labeled members of the
 Guyana Human Rights Association as "hypocrites" and "sheep in
 wolves' clothing."
 The Association and other human rights activists play an impor-
 tant monitoring role. Their efforts have successfully drawn
 the attention of such external bodies as Amnesty International,
 Human Rights Internet, and the World Council of Churches Human
 Rights Office for Latin America to the human rights climate in
 Guyana.
 4.   Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 In recent years Guyana, like many developing, non-oil exporting
 nations, has suffered negative annual real growth rates. Lower
 prices for Guyana's principal exports, high prices for imported
 oil and other essentials, heavy migration, and the management
 problems associated with a centrally-planned economy have led
 to both declining productivity and quality of life. In the
 end, however, the Government bears final responsibility for the
 state of the economy.
 The economic decline of the last several years continued in
 1982, with Guyanese suffering from acute shortages or unavail-
 ability of imported staples, failing essential services, and
 rising unemployment--9,000 public sector employees lost their
 jobs in a general retrenchment. Crime in the form of robberies
 of food and valuables increased greatly. Prices escalated,
 too, as consumer goods became scarce. The private sector's
 viability has become severely impaired by government-mandated
 
 
 541
 import and foreign exchange controls and other restrictive
 policies.
 Guyana's 1980 per capita GNP of $693 was among the lowest in
 the hemisphere. Low productivity and prices for its principal
 exports (sugar, rice, and bauxite) caused Guyana's longstanding
 foreign reserve shortage to worsen noticeably in 1982. This
 has forced the government to further curtail already reduced
 levels of imports and investment. According to President
 Burnham, the economy must be placed on a "war footing" to
 survive, and, under the circumstances, he said the Government
 can only attempt to provide the essentials--basic food, basic
 housing, clothes, water, electricity, transportation, and some
 entertainment. Though the Government's performance in several
 of these areas has been poor, the healthful climate and
 Guyana's own food resources, combined with a low population
 (793,000 according to the World Bank) and population growth
 rate (0.5 percent in 1981), have averted epidemic disease and
 widespread starvation.
 Guyana is self-sufficient in tropical vegetables, rice, and
 many other basic foods, but seasonal crop shortages, inflation,
 and severe limitations on imported essentials (e.g., wheat,
 milk) have reduced the variety and quantity of the typical
 Guyanese diet. Safe water is available to at least 84 percent
 of the population. Power outages occur three to four times
 weekly because of poor maintenance and spare part shortages.
 Shortages of imported food, paper, and other foreign produced
 goods have resulted in the formation of a thriving black
 market. Virtually all Guyanese trade in this parallel economy,
 but its exorbitant prices are a drain on the disposable income
 of the Guyanese worker who, nonetheless, is most reluctant to
 abandon the traditional imported food segment of his diet.
 Despite a domestic-based calorie supply above minimal nutri-
 tional requirements, there were persistent reports of malnutri-
 tion in low income families, particularly among children.
 The quality of health care declined considerably in 1982.
 Hospitals and clinics ran critically, at times fatally, low on
 drugs and other essential supplies. World Bank statistics put
 life expectancy at 70 years and infant mortality at 45.9 per
 1,000 live births. Malaria was generally under control
 although there were reports of the disease in the interior.
 Although education is free through the university and though
 statistics showed a 99 percent primary school enrollment,
 standards continued to decline. Many school buildings were in
 poor condition and textbook shortages were acute. Hundreds of
 teachers left the profession, emigrated, or were laid off.
 Standardized test scores were reported to be significantly
 below those of other Caribbean medium developed countries.
 The Government conducted its social services, for the most
 part, in a nondiscriminatory fashion. However, reports
 suggested that People's National Congress-run food distribution
 outlets at times gave preferential service to Afro-Guyanese
 supporters. There were also indications that discrimination
 favoring Afro-Guyanese occurred in the allotment of government
 housing and in the disbursement of loans from state-owned banks.
 The right to own private property alone or with others was
 generally protected. The results of the announced intention by
 the Government's "Land to the Tiller" Committee to take over
 land unused by its absentee landlords remain to be seen.
 
 
 542
 Many observers have noted that social and cultural standards
 have declined in Guyana since independence. The Government
 itself has launched a "Revival of Standards Committee" with the
 intention of encouraging courtesy and social decorum. The
 Commissioner of Police even appealed to firearm owners to
 assist the police in stopping crimes.
