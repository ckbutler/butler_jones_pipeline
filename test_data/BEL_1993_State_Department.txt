 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a longstanding parliamentary democracy under a constitutional mon-
 arch whose role is largely ceremonial. King Albert II acceded to the throne in Au-
 gust, following the death of his brother, King Baudouin I. The Council of Ministers
 (Cabinet), led by the Prime Minister, is responsible for government decisions. The
 Cabinet holds office as long as it retains the confidence of the bicameral Parliament.
 Constitutional reforms passed by Parliament in July transformed Belgium into a
 federal state. Directly elected legislatures will replace regional councils in Dutch-
 speaking Flanders, French-speaking Wallonia, and the Brussels capital region. In
 addition to further decentralizing government authority, the July reforms will re-
 duce the size of the national Parliament.
 National, municipal, and judicial police forces bear the primary responsibility for
 domestic security. The armed forces play no role in domestic law enforcement.
 Belgium is a highly industrialized state with a vigorous private sector and govern-
 ment participation in certain industries. An extensive social welfare system sup-
 ports a high standard of living for most Belgians.
 The Constitution and laws contain provisions for respect for human rights, which
 are observed in practice. The Government is sensitive to allegations of domestic
 human rights violations.
 Controversy over immigration continued as the backlog of asylum requests nearly
 doubled in the first half of 1993. In response, several local governments announced
 that they would refuse legal residence and usual social services to asylum seekers.
 The Government termed such actions illegal. At the end of the year, a number of
 municipalities and communes, including Liege, continued to refuse to register asy-
 lum seekers, thereby denying them federally mandated social benefits. Many local
 governments reportedly did not follow a consistent policy, registering some, but not
 all, asylum seekers.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detentions are not
 known to occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of such treatment or punishment being employed in Belgium.
 See Somalia report for allegations of human rights abuses by Belgian forces serving
 with the United Nations Operations in Somalia. A Belgian Ministry of Defense in-
 quiry was launched in August and, separately, the Military Prosecutor's Office con-
 tinued to examine certain allegations of mistreatment by Belgian military person-
 nel.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Freedom from arbitrary arrest and im-
 prisonment is provided for by law and respected in practice. Arrested persons must
 be brought before a judge within 24 hours. Pretrial confinement is allowed only
 under certain legally specified circumstances. The premise for such confinement is
 subject to monthly review by a panel of judges, who may extend pretrial detention
 based on carefully circumscribed criteria (e.g., whether, in the court's view the ar-
 rested person would be likely to commit further crimes or attempt to flee the juris-
 diction if released). Arrested persons are allowed prompt access to a lawyer of their
 choosing or, if they cannot afford one, an attorney appointed by the State. Bail ex-
 
 
 802
 ists in principle under Belgian law but is rarely granted. Exile is not permitted by
 law and does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-A fair public trial is assured by law and honored
 in practice. A suspect is formally charged, if the evidence so warrants, once a pre-
 liminary judicial investigatory phase is completed. Charges are clearly and formally
 stated, and there is a presumption of innocence.
 Defendants have the right to be present, the right to counsel (provided at public
 expense if needed), the right to confront witnesses and present evidence, and the
 right of appeal. The judiciary's independence is provided for by the Constitution and
 observed in practice. Belgium has a system of military tribunals, before which mili-
 tary personnel are tried for both military and common law crimes. All Belgian mili-
 tary tribunals, including those at the appellate level, are composed of four officers
 and one civilian judge. The superior officer presides at the level of first instance;
 the civilian judge presides at the appeals tribunal. The accused has the right of ap-
 peal to a higher military court. The military tribunal system continued to be under
 review in 1993; the Government is considering the abolishment of tribunal authority
 over all but strictly military offenses.
 Beginning in October, all new judges were required to demonstrate legal knowl-
 edge and their qualifications for the position through an examination process di-
 rected by eminent jurists and legal scholars. The first competency examinations
 were iven to judges in 1992. In October 1993, the Government began dismissing
 those judges who fared poorly on the tests.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Free-
 dom from arbitrary state interference with privacy is guaranteed by law and re-
 spected in practice. Search warrants issued by a judge are required unless the in-
 habitants of a domicile agree to a search. Access to information from wiretaps is re-
 stricted under law, but their use remained illegal pending parliamentary action.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These freedoms are assured by law and re-
 spected in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning
 democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press. Aca-
 demic freedom is respected.
 The Government operates several radio and television networks but does not con-
 trol program content. Programs are supervised by boards of directors which rep-
 resent the main political, linguistic, and opinion groups. A government representa-
 tive sits on each board but has no veto power. Private radio and television stations
 operate with government licenses. Almost all homes have access by cable to tele-
 vision from other Western European countries.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Public assembly is subject to
 regulations concerning public order but is otherwise unrestricted. Groups protesting
 government policies or actions are free from harassment and persecution. Permits
 are required for open-air assemblies but are granted routinely; there are restrictions
 on blocking major arteries to and from downtown Brussels and on entering a small
 zone near the Royal Palace and Parliament. Belgians are free to form organizations
 and establish ties to international bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Belgium has a long tradition of religious tolerance. The
 Roman Catholic, Protestant, Anglican, Jewish, and Muslim religions are accorded a
 "recognized" status in law and granted a government subsidy. Government subsidies
 to recognized religions are drawn from general government revenues. Objecting tax-
 payers have no recourse against contributing to religious subsidies. Minority 'unrec-
 ognized" religions enjoy full freedom to practice and are not subject to harassment
 or persecution. Organized religions may establish places of worship and train num-
 bers of clergy adequate to serve believers. Links may be maintained with coreligion-
 ists in other countries or a supranational hierarchy, and foreign missionaries may
 proselytize. By law, all officially "recognized" religions have the right to provide
 teachers to give religious instruction in the schools, but not all avail themselves of
 this right.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Belgians are free to travel both within the country and abroad and may
 return to Belgium at any time. Emigration is not restricted, nor is citizenship re-
 voked for political reasons. Citizens are free to choose their places of work and resi-
 dence. The Government does not force asylum seekers to return to countries where
 they face persecution.
 Increasing applications for political asylum had created a large backlog by August.
 In response, the Parliament authorized the hiring of 100 additional government law-
 yers to adjudicate asylum cases. Six Brussels-area municipalities with large foreign-
 born populations have permission from the Government to refuse until 1995 legal
 
 
 803
 residence to any foreigners from outside the European Community. The city of
 Liege, which has Belgium's largest refugee population, and certain other municipali-
 ties announced that they would deny legal residence and nationally mandated social
 services to asylum seekers. Other communes reportedly registered some but not all
 asylum seekers who applied. If refused in one locale, asylum seekers have the option
 of seeking registration as legal residents in another, thus gaining entitlement to so-
 cial services.
 Calling the actions of recalcitrant local governments illegal, the national Govern-
 ment has favored a political rather than a legal or administrative approach to re-
 solving the problem. In Belgian law, only the individual applicant has legal standing
 to litigate against an authority refusing to register him or her. Administrative pro-
 cedures to compel local government compliance with national law are cumbersome.
 At year's end, the Interior Ministry was seeking to establish a centralized national
 asylum seekers' register by which it hoped to receive better cooperation from local
 governments by ensuringa more equitable distribution of the human and financial
 burden of hosting asylum seekers.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Participation in the democratic political system is open to all citizens 18 years of
 age and over. Direct popular elections for parliamentary seats (excluding some sen-
 ators elected by provincial councils and others elected by senate members) are held
 at least every 4 years under a system of universal, secret, and compulsory (under
 penalty of fine) suffrage for all adults.
 In law and practice, opposition parties are free to operate without constraints or
 repression. Of the 24 parties competing in the last national elections in November
 1991, 14 gained seats in Parliament. A 4-party coalition Government, the members
 of which secured 52 percent of the popular vote, has been in power since March
 1992. There are no restrictions, in law or in practice, on the participation of women
 or minorities in government or politics. Two of 16 federal ministers, 2 of 8 Flemish
 regional ministers, and 1 of 4 Francophone community ministers are women. There
 are no women ministers in the Walloon or Brussels regional, or Germanophone com-
 munity, governments. In the federal Parliament, 19 of 212 house members (9 per-
 cent) and 20 of 184 senators (11 percent) are women. About 12 percent of provincial
 council members are women, as are about 14 percent of municipal council members.
 The Government sent to Parliament at the end of 1993 a draft law that would
 require at least 33 percent representation of each sex on electoral tickets beginning
 in 1999. Until then, the law would require, beginning in 1994, a 25 percent gender
 minimum for communal and municipal elections only.
 The presidents of Belgium's main political parties are males. The two Green par-
 ties (Flemish Agalev and Francophone Ecolo) do not have party presidents. Some
 of Agalev's most prominent members are women.
 The existence of communities speaking Dutch, French, and German engenders
 significant complexities for the State. All major institutions, including political par-
 ties, are divided along linguistic lines. There are specific provisions for Dutch-,
 French-, and German-speaking councils at the regional level. Regional and linguistic
 needs are taken into account in national political and economic decisions.
 A package of constitutional reforms passed in July will transform the regional
 councils into directly elected assemblies. These in turn will elect from among their
 members the regional governments. The reforms further decentralized authority by
 adding trade and agriculture to the responsibilities of the regional governments.
 Under the new laws, the next federal Parliament will have the reduced membership
 stipulated by the constitutional reforms. It will be formed at the next parliamentary
 elections, to take place at the latest by December 1995. The federal House of Rep-
 resentatives will be reduced from 212 to 150 directly elected members. The new
 Senate will shrink from 183 to 71 members, 40 of whom will be directly elected, 21
 designated by regional assemblies, and 10 selected by the Senate.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several active independent human rights groups operate freely without govern-
 ment interference. No requests have been made for outside investigation of the
 human rights situation in Belgium.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So.
 cial Status
 Women.-The Government actively promotes women's rights. The 1994 budget
 stipulates that a director, to be hired in mid-1994, will begin work on a national
 women's center; this work is expected to be completed by the end of 1994. A number
 
 
 of commissicns have been established to ensure that women's rights are protected
 and to oversee women's education and working conditions. A 1992 royal decree pro-
 hibited sexual harassment in the workplace in both the public and private sectors,
 where sexual harassment ombudsmen must be designated in all workplaces with at
 least 50 employees.
 Credible reports of organized rings smuggling foreign women into Belgium for the
 purpose of prostitution received wide publicity. A parliamentary commission was
 created in December, 1992 to investigate. In 1993 it released three public state-
 ments but not its final conclusions. Belgian law prohibits organizing prostitution,
 assisting illegal immigration into Belgium, and providing illegal employment. No
 leaders of rings trafficking in women had been arrested by the end of 1993, al-
 though disciplinary action had been taken against police officers in Ghent for assist-
 ing the rings.
 Physical abuse of women is punishable by law, and the law is enforced. In reac-
 tion to a 1988 government study that concluded that 25 percent of Belgian women
 had encountered some form of physical abuse, legislation on sexual abuse was en-
 acted in 1989, broadening the scope of the previous legislation to allow for prosecu-
 tion of conjugal sexual abuse and rendering penalties more severe. Certain sexual
 abuse cases may be tried before a court of assizes, a higher instance than the usual
 district court.
 Children.-Belgium has comprehensive child protection laws. Administration of
 youth welfare programs is handled at the linguistic community level. Human rights
 groups have criticized the law that allows the imprisonment of children for up to
 15 days when there is no space in juvenile detention centers. There are occasional
 re  r  of Judges sending juvenile offenders to prison in Wallonia.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Belgium is a pluralistic society in which in-
 dividual differences in general are respected and linguistic rights in particular are
 protected. Some 60 percent of Belgians are native Dutch speakers living primarily
 in the northern provinces that constitute Flanders. The approximately 40 percent
 of the population who are French speakers live mostly in Brussels and the southern
 rvinces of Wallonia. A small minority of German speakers lives along the eastern
 order. The 1993 laws that federalized Belgium were the latest of hundreds passed
 over the past century to protect each language group from cultural, economic, or po-
 litical dominance by the others.
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are supposed to be available to all resi-
 dents regardless of race, sex, religion, language, social status, or ethnic background.
 Some communes, however, contined to refuse to register new asylum seekers, there-
 by denying then mandated social services in those specific localities. (See Section
 2.d. regarding an effort to ease this problem by the establishment of a national asy-
 lum seekers' register.) Some 27 percent of the residents of Brussels, the largest city,
 are foreigners. Many of these are North African and Turkish immigrants. Encourag-
 ing the further integration of the immigrant population and coping with the rising
 number of asylum seekers and Eastern European immigrants continues to be a
 focus of strong public debate. The national Center for Equal Opportunity and
 Against Racism, charged by Parliament with promoting integration and interethnic
 dialog, began work in 1993. Its director, as chairman o the  terministerial Council
 on Minority Affairs, reports directly to the Prime Minister. The Center spent much
 of its first year organizing and hiring. Priority projects include helping to establish
 a representative council for the Mus~im community of Belgium (through which the
 Government could distribute funds for the Muslim clergy). By year's end, the Center
 had opened a mediation center to handle complaints about racism and xenophobia,
 and its legal section was studying ways to propose strengthening Belgium s 1981
 law against racist and xenophobic acts.
 According to polls, support for the extreme rightist, openly anti-immigrant Flem-
 ish party, Vlaams Blok, increased slightly since it won 12 parliamentary seats in
 the 1991 elections. Mainstream parties generally treat the Vlaams Blok as a pariah
 or ignore it. The party continues to call for repatriation of immigrants to their na-
 tive lands. Belgium has not experienced concerted, overt campaigns of violence di-
 rected at immigrants, asylum centers, or hostels. The one series of incidents of vio-
 lence against foreigners in 1993 occurred in the town of Sint-Truiden, where Sikh
 migrant agricultural workers were repeatedly harassed and intimidated by some of
 the local residents. In early August a Sikh was shot in the arm and the following
 week a firebomb slightly damaged a house where 10 Sikhs lived but caused no inju-
 ries. Two men were arrested shortly after the attack and were awaiting trial at
 iear's end. The size and scope of future immigration continues to be a sensitive po-
 litical topic, and many underlying issues regarding integration of existing immi-
 grant groups have yet to be addressed.

 People with Disabilties.-Each of the three linguistic community councils admin-
 isters a fund for the social integration of the disabled. The funds support placement
 of the disabled in jobs and schools, and include payment for necessary accommoda-
 tions. Dedicated public housing for the disabled is available and government facili-
 ties built since 1970 must be accessible to the handicapped. There are, however, no
 laws prohibiting discrimination against the disabled in semipublic accommodations
 such as restaurants or private schools.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-With an estimated 76 percent of its labor force orga-
 nized, Belgium is one of the most unionized countries in the world. It has a long
 tradition of democratic trade union elections. Workers have the right to associate
 freely and to strike. Unions striking or protesting government policies or actions are
 free from harrasment and persecution. Significant strikes occurred in 1993 in the
 education, shipbuilding, and social welfare sectors. In certain narrowly defined cir-
 cumstances, however, such as in the provision of essential public services, public
 employees' right to strike is not explicitly recognized. Public employees may and
 often do strike (e.g., education personnel in 1993). Laws and regulations prohibit
 retribution against strikers and union leaders. The Government effectively enforces
 these laws and regulations.
 Labor unions are independent of the Government but have important informal
 links with and influence on several of the major political parties. Belgian unions are
 affiliated with the major international bodies representing labor, such as the Inter-
 national Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the World Confederation of Labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is recognized and exercised freely. Management and unions ne-
 gotiate every other year a nationwide collective bargaining agreement covering the
 2.4 million private sector workers, which establishes the framework for negotiations
 at plant and branch level.
 The right to due process and judicial review are guaranteed for all protected activ-
 ity. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination against union members and organiz-
 ers and provides special protection against termination of contracts of shop stewards
 and members of workers' councils and of health and safety committees. Employers
 found guilty of antiunion discrimination are forced to reinstate workers fired for
 union activities. Effective mechanisms exist for adjudicating disputes between labor
 and management. Belgium maintains a system of labor tribunals and regular courts
 which hear disputes arising from labor contracts, collective bargaining agreements,
 and other matters.
 Belgium has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of children is 15, but schooling is compulsory until the age of 18. Some categories
 of youth between the ages of 15 and 18 are on a part-time work/part-time study pro-
 gram. Students can also sign summer labor contracts limited to 30 days. The labor
 courts effectively monitor compliance with national laws and standards. Legislation
 tightening conditions of child labor in entertainment and related occupations was
 adopted in 1992.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A maximum 40-hour workweek is mandated
 by law, although many collective bargaining agreements call for workweeks between
 36 and 39 hours.
 The minimum wage rates in the private sector are set in biennial nationwide ne-
 gotiations between the leading trade unions and the Belgian Business Federation.
 After agreement is reached, a formal collective bargaining agreement is signed by
 the National Labor Council and is made mandatory for the entire private sector by
 royal decree. In the public sector, the minimum wage is determined in negotiations
 between the Government and the public service unions.
 Comprehensive health and safety legislation is supplemented by collective bar-
 gaining agreements on safety issues. The Labor Ministry implements this legislation
 through a team of inspectors and determines whether workers qualify for disability
 and medical benefits. Health and safety committees are mandated by law in compa-
 nies with more than 50 employees and by works councils in companies with more
 than 100 employees. Labor courts effectively monitor compliance with national laws
 and standards.
