 SPAIN
 Spain is a democracy with a constitutional monarch. The Parliament consists of
 two chambers, the Congress of Deputies and the Senate. Jose Maria Aznar of the
 Popular Party was elected President in 1996. The Government respects the constitu-
 tional provisions for an independent judiciary in practice.
 Spain has three levels of security forces. The National Police are responsible for
 nationwide investigations, security in urban areas, traffic control, and hostage res-
 cue. The Civil Guard polices rural areas and controls borders and highways. Autono-
 mous police forces have taken over many of the duties of the Civil Guard in Galicia,
 Catalonia, and the Basque Country. The security forces are under the effective con-
 trol of the Government. The security forces also maintain anticorruption units.
 Some members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is market based, with primary reliance on private initiative, al-
 though a number of public sector enterprises remain in key areas. The economy
 grew at a 3.9 percent annual rate in the second quarter, and overall growth for the
 year was expected to be around 3.8 percent. The unemployment rate dropped from
 21 percent in 1997 to just under 19 percent at the end of the second quarter.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there were problems in some areas, including cases of police brutality and lengthy
 pretrial detention. The Government investigates allegations of human rights abuses
 by the security forces and punishes those found guilty of such abuses, although in-
 vestigations are often lengthy and punishments can be light. Societal violence
 against women, instances of trafficking in women and forced prostitution, discrimi-
 nation against women, Muslims, and Roma, and incidents of racism and rightwing
 youth violence were also problems.
 Throughout the year there were significant judicial proceedings relating to the in-
 volvement of the former Gonzalez Administration in the Antiterrorist Liberation
 
 
 1508
 Groups (GAL), which killed 27 persons between 1983 and 1987, including 10 per-
 sons with no connection to the Basque Fatherland and Freedom (ETA) terrorist
 group, the ostensible target of the GAL. In July former Interior Minister Jose
 Barrionuevo and former Secretary of State for Security Raphael Vera were convicted
 of the December 1983 abduction of French citizen Segundo Marey, the first action
 claimed by the GAL. They were sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment each, but were
 released in December pending appeal. In October, in response to a Spanish warrant,
 the United Kingdom arrested former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet on charges
 of genocide, terrorism, and torture.
 The principal source of abuses continued to be the protracted campaign of terror.
 ism waged by ETA, which committed killings and other abuses before it declared
 a unilateral cease-fire in September.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government forces.
 However, there was one questionable death in custody during the year, and an
 investigation was opened into a number of prison inmate deaths under suspicious
 circumstances in 1997 and 1996 (see Section 1.c.).
 In July national policemen Manuel and Andres Pavon were acquitted of homicide
 charges stemming from the June 1997 shooting of a 16-year-old boy. The jury deter-
 mined that an "imminent danger" existed and that therefore the officers acted in
 self-defense. There were no developments in the case of a Moroccan boy who alleg-
 edly was shot in the back by a Civil Guard officer in March 1997.
 In April national police officer Antonio Barrionuevo was found guilty of the 1996
 killing of Manuel Abreu Silva, a Portuguese citizen. Barrionuevo was sentenced to
 10 years' imprisonment, but the sentence was suspended pending his appeal. Abreu
 had reproached an inebriated Barrionuevo for pointing his firearm at two passersby
 who criticized him for urinating in the street, and confiscated his weapon. After he
 returned it to Barrionuevo, the policeman fired a shot, mortally wounding Abreu in
 the back of the head.
 Courts continue to investigate the "dirty war" against terrorism, during which
 death squads known as the Antiterrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, allegedly car-
 ried out bombings, extrajudicial killings, and kidnapings during the 1980's. The first
 GAL case concluded in July with the conviction by the Supreme Court of all 12 de-
 fendants in the 1983 abduction of French citizen Segundo Marey. Former Interior
 Minister Jose Barrionuevo, former Secretary of State for Security Rafael Vera, and
 former civil governor of Vizcaya province (one of three provinces in the Basque
 Country) Julian Sancristobal were sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment each for ille-
 gal detention and misappropriation of public funds. They were not convicted of
 membership in an armed band as the prosecution requested. Former high-ranking
 officials given lesser sentences included a former secretary general of the Socialist
 Party (PSE-EE) in Vizcaya, a former chief of National Intelligence Agency (CESID)
 squad in Bilbao, and the former police chief of Bilbao. The Government commuted
 Barrionuevo's and Vera's sentences in December. Shortly before Christmas,
 Barrionuevo and Vera were accorded conditional release, a form of detention under
 which the prisoner only has to report to the prison Monday through Thursday and
 is free to go home on the weekends. Shortiy after Christmas, the Supreme Court
 suspended the sentences pending Barrionuevo's and Vera's appeals. They are out of
 prison but still are banned from access to any'government job for 5 years. At year's
 end, none of those convicted in the Segundo Marey case was in jail. Many of the
 peding GAL cases, unlike the Segundo Marey case, involve alleged killings by the
 Virtually no progress was made in resolving the mid-1980's cases of alleged
 killings by the security forces of Roman Onaederra, Mikel Zabaltza, Robert
 Caplanne, and a tramp and two drug addicts.
 A Morrocan immigrant was killed in November by unknown persons, presumably
 for racist reasons (see Section 5).
 ETA continued to commit abuses, including deliberate and arbitrary killings. At
 the tmeit declared a unilateral cease-fire in September, ETA had killed si persons
 since the beginning of the year. ETA's primary targets continued to be  opular
 Partyo(PP) town councilmen. According to the Ministry of Interior, ETA has killed
 807 persons since 1960.
 On January 9, an ETA car bomb killed Jose Igacio Iruretagoyuena, a PP council-
 man in Zarauz, Gupuzcoa. On January 30, two ETA gunmen shot and killed at
 close range Alberto Jimenez Becerril, Seville city councilman and second deputy
 
 
 1509
 mayor (PP) and his wife, Ascencion Garcia Ortiz, as they were returning home after
 dining at a nearby restaurant. On May 6, ETA killed Tomas Caballero, a member
 of the Pamnplona City Council and the Union of the Navarrese People political party,
 which has close ties to the PP. The killing was thought to be motivated by his harsh
 comments accusing Herri Batsuna, ETA's political wing, of murder and inciting
 murder in the wake of Iruretagoyuena's killing. On May 8, in Vitoria, the Basque
 regional capital, ETA shot and killed Alfonso Parada Ulloa, a retired Civil Guard
 sub-lieutenant. His death provoked a demonstration of an estimated 35,000 persons,
 the largest demonstration in memory in the Basque administrative capital. On June
 25, ETA killed Manuel Zamarreno, a Renteria (Guipuzcoa) councilman (PP), with
 a bomb placed on a motorcycle parked in front of his home. ETA was also respon-
 sible for nonlethal violence that caused extensive property damage (see Section 1.c.).
 The Government intensified efforts to dismantle ETA and its related organiza-
 tions and bring perpetrators of terrorism to justice. Foreign policy efforts centered
 on continuing coordination with French authorities and strengthening extradition
 agreements with Latin American countries, particularly Mexico.
 Internal efforts to combat ETA focused on intense police activity and the closure
 of the pro-ETA newspaper Egin in July pending a judicial investigation into alleged
 subordination of the newspaper's editorial line and hiring practices to ETA's com-
 mand and the use of coded classified ads to coordinate ETA strategy. Judge Baltazar
 Garzon of the National High Court noted a pattern of ETA victims having been de-
 monized by Egin prior to their killings. He identified 11 such cases. Egin's editor,
 Xavier Salutregi, subsequently was charged with violation of the ban on collabora-
 tion with an armed band: the investigation continued at year's end. Following police
 raids in February and March, Interior Minister Mayor Oreja expressed his con-
 fidence that both the Araba and the Vizcaya ETA commands had been completely
 dismantled. The Ministry of the Interior, the PP leadership, and the Ertzainza
 (Basque police) coordinated the implementation of a plan to improve police protec-
 tion of PP officials in the Basque region.
 In April suspected ETA member Fernando Elejalde Tapia was sentenced by the
 National High Court to 37 years' imprisonment for the 1997 murder of Francisco
 Javier Gomez Elosegui, a prison official in San Sebastian.
 In May ETA member Valentin Lasarte was sentenced to 82 years' imprisonment
 for his participation in the 1996 murder of Fernando Mugica Herzog, an attorney
 and the brother of former Justice Minister Enrique Mugica. However, the sentence
 does not prolong Lasarte's incarceration since his previous convictions already con-
 demned him to more than 25 years' imprisonment, the maximum permitted by law.
 In June two former ETA leaders, Ignacio Arakama Mendia and Jesus Arkautz
 Arana, were sentenced for their participation in killings carried out in the 1980's.
 Extradited by the Dominican Republic in the summer of 1997, Arakama was sen-
 tenced to 26 years and 8 months' imprisonment for the 1985 murder of Ricardo
 Tejero Magro, then director of the Central Bank. Arkautz was found guilty of sup-
 plying the grenades used in an attack on the Civil Guard Barracks in Mungia,
 asque Autonomous Region, which caused the deaths of five persons.
 On September 16, ETA announced an indefinite cease-fire and issued a lengthy
 statement of political objectives. Among thes6 was an independent Basque state.
 The Government announced in November that it would seek direct negotiations
 with ETA to make the cease-fire permanent. These negotiations had not yet begun
 by year's end. The Governmenes agenda for these talks includes relief for ETA pris-
 oners and exiles but not political issues such as self-determination and sovereignty.
 The pro-ETA Herri Batasuna/Euskal Herritarrok (HB/EH) Party stated on No-
 vember 14 that ETA would not enter into talks until the Government issued a Span-
 ish version of the "Downing Street Declaration" in which it recognized that the fu-
 ture of the Basque country should be decided solely by Basques. The Government
 responded that it would not issue such a statement. Since ETA's cease-fire declara-
 tion, the Basques held regional elections, and the parties that represent Basque na-
 tionalism (the Basque Nationalist Party, or PNV, Euskal Alkartasuna, or EA, and
 HB/EH) retained their majority. Among those gaining seats were the Popular Party,
 which went from 11 seats to 16, making it the second largest party in the legisla-
 ture, and HB/EH, which went from 11 seats to 14.
 Several organizations are dedicated to the needs and concerns of victims of terror-
 ism, among them the Association of Terrorism Victims (AVT). This organization was
 founded in 1981 and currently serves 1,300 families by providing legal and psycho-
 logical counseling, publishing a monthly magazine, and carrying out various other
 activities. Government funding is limited to $39,000 (Ptas 6 million) provided annu-
 ally by the Ministry of Defense. In 1997 the Association donated $640,000 (Ptas 97
 million) to aid victims of terrorism and their families.
 
 
 1510
 Following intense AVT advocacy for the victims of ETA's 1987 attack on a Bar-
 celona shopping center, which resulted in 21 deaths, 12 victims were awarded a
 total of $700,000 (Ptas 106 million). Another 29 claimants awaited a decision on
 whether their claims were filed after the deadline and are therefore inadmissible.
 The damages were awarded in accordance-with the Supreme Court's 1997 ruling
 which found the police negligent for not evacuating shoppers despite a warning from
 ETA an hour before the explosion.
 Despite the Attorney General's publicly expressed doubts regarding Spanish
 courts jurisdiction in cases involving the disappearance of 600 Spaniards under
 Chilean and Argentinian dicatorships in the 1970's and 1980's, the investigation
 continues. Following the arrest of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in the
 United Kingdom in October in response to a Spanish warrant, the Spanish National
 High Court requested General Pinochets extradition to answer charges that he vio-
 lated international covenants on genocide, terrorism, and torture. Initially, the Brit-
 ish High Court ruled that General Pinochet enjoyed sovereign immunity from pros-
 ecution. However, on appeal the British Law Lords overturned the ruling on
 Pinochet's immunity in a 3 to 2 decision in November. Extradition proceedings
 began in December. However, the Law Lords set aside their decision in December
 when Pinochet's lawyers contended that one of the judges who ruled against
 Pinochet failed to disclose his substantial links to Amnesty International, which was
 represented in the case. A rehearing of the appeal was to begin in January 1999.
 b. Disappearance.-Twelve former government officials, including the former Inte-
 rior Minister, were convicted in July of the 1983 kidnaping of French citizen
 Segundo Marey, mistaken for a terrorist (see Section L.a.).
 There were no reports of ETA kidnapings during the year.
 Four ETA members were convicted in June of the kidnaping of Jose Antonio Or-
 tega Lara, a prison official from Burgos. Ortega was abducted on January 17, 1996,
 and spent a total of 532 days in captivity, making him the longest held ETA hos-
 tage. His kidnaping was designed to pressure the Government into rescinding its
 policy of dispersing ETA prisoners throughout the country.
 Since 1970 ETA has kidnaped 76 persons. It is estimated that ETA obtained more
 than $33 million from the kidnapings. Since 1982 only five hostages were set free
 due to successful police intervention, and nine were killed in the process of negotia-
 tion.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such acts; however, suspects charged with terrorism routinely as-
 sert that they have been abused during detention, and other detainees sometimes
 make similar charges. The Government investigates these allegations and also per-
 mits outside parties to investigate them.
 Amnesty International (A) expressed concerns during the year about continuing
 reports of illegal detention, torture, and mistreatment by law enforcement officers.
 A particularly stressed its longstanding concern at the way in which detainees may
 be detained incommunicado for up to 5 days, with accompanying restrictions on the
 right of access to lawyers of their choice, a system which, in Al's view as well as
 that of organizations such as the U.N. Human Rights Committee, and the U.N.
 Committee Against Torture, facilitates mistreatment and torture.
 Amnesty International expressed concern during the year over the growing tend-
 ency toward assaults on persons of non-European ethnic origin by different police
 forces, including the local or municipal police. Al made a formal inquiry to the na-
 tional and local authorities on the initiatives that were being undertaken, or
 planned, to incorporate human rights into the training programs of magistrates, po-
 lice, and other law enforcement officers (also see Section 5).
 Press reports on November 24 stated that two members of the local police in
 Melilla were charged with raping a Moroccan girl. One of the police officers was de-
 tained in jail and the other posted bail. The press reports that the officer who re-
 mained in prison has a well-established record of civilian abuse, but that this is the
 first time that he actually has served any time in jail.
 In July a Barcelona court sentenced national policeman Luis Rubio Mazon to 9
 years' imprisonment and payment of $13,000 in damages for the 1997 rape of a de-
 tainee in his custody. The court-also established the liability of the State.
 There was no apparent progress in the complaint filed against police officers for
 allegedly beating motorist Ivan Gonzalez in September 1997 or in the case of four
 policemen charged with the rape of a Brazilian tourist in March 1996. Nor did police
 make any arrests in connection with the beating of a protected GAL witness in No-
 vember 1996.
 In June 10 Civil Guards were convicted of torturing 2 detainees in the Colmenar
 Viejo barracks in 1994, given sentences ranging from 2 to 8 months, and banned
 from public sector employment for a 6-year period. Since sentences of a year or less
 
 
 1511
 normally are not served, none of the officers was incarcerated. The officers were
 found guilty of threatening, punching, and kicking two of the plaintiffs and subject-
 ing them to humiliating unclothed body searches. The vagueness of a third plain-
 tiffs testimony prevented the jury from determining the veracity of his accusations.
 The prosecutor announced his intention to seek stiffer sentences on appeal to the
 Supreme Court.
 The press reported that on November 23, six members of the Civil Guard were
 brought to trial for allegedly having tortured in 1992 three persons suspected of
 being members of ETA. The defense in this case argued that the wounds the defend-
 ants exhibited actually were inflicted simply because they resisted arrest and not
 for any other reasons.
 Amnesty International received reports that a sergeant of the Civil Guard con-
 victed in 1997 for the illegal detention and torture of ETA member Kepa Urra 6
 years earlier and sentenced to 4 years in prison and a 6-year ban on serving again
 in the police force was selected for a promotional course, despite one of the condi-
 tions for acceptance being that a candidate should not have been convicted of a de-
 liberate criminal act. Civil Guard officials argued that because the conviction was
 not yet definitive, pending appeal to the Supreme Court, a presumption of innocence
 should apply until that time. In a parliamentary answer in March, the Government
 reportedly recognized the "gravity and reprehensibility" of the crime committed and
 stated that, if the conviction were confirmed, appropriate action stil could be taken
 against the sergeant. However, AI is concerned that such haste to reward an officer
 immediately after conviction (without awaiting the outcome of the appeal) may re-
 flect the authorities' lack of seriousness in seeking justice in Kepa Urra's torture
 case.
 In February three national policemen were convicted of torturing two detainees
 at Bilbao police headquarters in 1984. The jury determined that following their ar-
 rest for placing an explosive device in a bank, the two men were subjected through-
 out the interrogation to repeated blows to the back, neck, testicles, legs, and ears,
 threats of castrationand the application of electrodes.
 Amnesty International raised with national and local authorities the issue of
 whether lengthy delays in torture-related trials and the effective impunity of law
 enforcement officers is being addressed as a component of the professional training
 of magistrates, police, and other law enforcement officers. The Amnesty Inter-
 national delegation was assured that national and local government ministers and
 representatives believe human rights are an essential component of professional
 training and as such would seek to address such issues.
 The Police and the press continue to report significant ETA youth criminal activ-
 ity, including the use of Molotov cocktails to set fire to homes, businesses, cars, and
 political party offices in a continuing campaign of intimidation. During the year,
 damage by Jarrai, the youth wing of ETA  was expected to amount to millions of
 dollars. In the year's most dramatic incident, a July scuffle betweenSan Sebastian
 police and hooded vandals resulted in over 20 persons being injured, including a se-
 curity guard who suffered first and second degree burns. In August 50 hooded van-
 dals firebombed the apartment building in which the family of a Gtxo (Vizcaya
 province) PP town counsellor resided, leaving S families homeless. Police were oniy
 able to find and arrest one of the arsonists.
 A 1998 report by the Attorney General states that the number of individuals who
 suffered personal property damage as a result of attacks by ETA sympathizers de-
 creased from a total of 125 in 1997 to 69 as of August 1998. Among the civilian
 population, 47 persons were injured in these attacks during the year.
 Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards. In May the
 European Committee for the Prevention of Torture released a report on its April
 1997 inspection of facilities in which illegal aliens are detained. The delegation ex-
 pressed its concern over instances of severe overcrowding, inadequate supervisory
 control over low-level officials accused of abusing prisoners, inadequate record-
 keeping and recourse to appeal for inmates detained in solitary confinement, and
 insufficient food for some detainees. Of particular concern to the Committee was the
 use of excessive force by officials during expulsion procedures, including the fre-
 quent practice of binding and gagging deportees with adhesive tape.
 In response to the Committee's report, the Government took steps to reduce over-
 crowding and improve the food supply in the cited facilities. However, the Govern-
 ment's official response did not address the Committee's concerns regarding the spe-
 cific practice of binding and gagging deportees with adhesive tape or announce any
 modifications in its solitary confinement policy or procedures, which the Ministry of
 the Interior deemed sufficiently transparent. The Government maintains that the
 mandatory notification of a supervisory judge of a detainee's solitary confinement
 
 
 1512
 
 prevents the arbitrary imposition of this security measure. The report denies that
 a detainee's opportunity to appeal is limited.
 The Public Defender initiated 10 new investigations into allegations of mistreat-
 ment and torture in prisons in 1997. In his 1998 report, he noted the rise of drug
 addiction and AIDS in the prison population and the need for implementing better
 rehabilitation programs. He also expressed concern over overcrowding.
 On December 4, the press reported that the opposition requested the parliamen-
 tary appearance of Minister of the Interior, Jaime Mayor Oreja, to explain the death
 in detention of a 24-year-old Nigerian woman, Julienne Danielle, who was 7 months'
 pregnant and killed herself in a dungeon-like prison cell of the Civil Guard in the
 Spanish enclave of Ceuta. The woman apparently had been detained for having ille-
 gally crossed the border into Spanish territory and was being held until her legal
 situation was investigated. When the woman was picked up by the Civil Guard, s e
 had lacerations on her feet and apparently was treated for her wounds in a hospital
 that later released her to be taken to the camping grounds for immigrants located
 in the area where she was found. However, due to bad weather the Civil Guard ar-
 gues that it was not able to take the woman there and instead had to commit her
 to the Civil Guard prison quarters. The woman was found dead in her cell the next
 day. She apparently hung herself.
 In March the General Council of Judicial Power announced the opening of an in-
 vestigation into 31 cases of alleged abuse and-negligence by prison officials in 1996
 and 1997. The investigating committee promised to scrutinize in particular eight in-
 mate deaths ostensibly caused by mismanagement and negligence, including the
 failure by prison officials to give prompt medical attention to a prisoner who suf-
 fered from chronic heart problems and- the suicide of an inmate whose treatment
 for drug addiction was interrupted by his transfer to a prison lacking drug counsel-
 ing facilities. Another death under investigation is that of a San Sebastian inmate
 whose official cause of death is listed as a barbiturate overdose despite the presence
 of lesions on the back, neck, and thighs of his body and the refusal of the doctors
 who conducted the autopsy to certify a drug overdose as the cause of death.
 Basque activists continued to demand that all imprisoned ETA members be held
 in prisons in the Basque region or the adjacent autonomous region, Navarre. A legal
 brief criticizing the dispersion of ETA prisoners, presented by Basque nationalist
 party member and president of the Basque Parliament's Human Rights Commission
 Jose Antonio Rubalcaba, was declared inadmissible by the European Commission of
 Human Rights. Basque nationalists claimed that political pressures motivated the
 court's decision. Following ETA's declaration of a cease-fire in September, the Gov-
 ernment announced in December that it would move 21 ETA prisoners to prisons
 in or near the Basque Country.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors, including the
 European Committee for the Prevention of Torture.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and the authorities respect these provisions in practice.
 A suspect may not be held more than 72 hours without a hearing except in cases
 involving terrorism. The Penal Code permits holding a suspected terrorist an addi-
 tional 2 days without a hearing and the possibility of incommunicado detention for
 such persons, provided that a judge authorizes such action.
 The law on aliens permits detention of a person forup to 40 days prior to deporta-
 tion but specifies that it must not take place in a prison-like setting.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and the Government respects this provision in
 practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 a          the judiciary is independent in practice.
 The judicial structure consists of territorial, provincial, regional, and municipal
 courts with the Supreme Court at its apex. The Constitutional Court has the au-
 thority to return a case to the court in which it was adjudicated if it can be deter-
 mined that constitutional rights were violated during the course of the trial. How-
 ever, it, cannot issue a new ruling. A National High Court handles cases involving
 crimes such as terrorism and drug trafficking. The European Court of Human
 Rights is the final arbiter in cases concerning human rights.
 The entire Penal Code was revised in 1996. Changes included the restructuring
 of the criminal justice system, the introduction of modern offenses and white-collar
 crimes, an increase in the penalties for fraud offenses, a rise in the legal age at
 which an individual may be tried for a criminal offense from 16 to 18 years of age,
 the establishment of other new offenses (including domestic violence and sexual har-
 assment), and an authorization for judges to fine individuals with reference to their
 wealth. The new code also allows judges more flexibility in sentencing. It eliminates
 the long-standing tradition of granting credit toward early release for time served
 
 
 1513
 
 for good behavior. The maximum penalty for any one offense under the new code
 is 25 years, and the maximum time that a person can serve continuously is 30
 years, regardless of the cumulative total of sentences. Judges may now deport for-
 eigners whose sentences are 6 years or less.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair public trial, and the authorities
 respect this right in practice. Defendants have the right to be represented by an at-
 torney (at state expense for the indigent). They are released on bail unless the court
 believes that they may flee or be a threat to public safety. The law calls for an expe-
 ditious judicial hearing following arrest. However, the AVT and others have pro-
 tested delays in the judicial process. By law, suspects may not be confined for more
 than 2 years before being brought to trial, unless a further delay is authorized by
 a judge, who may extend pretrial custody to 4 years. A nine-person jury system was
 established in 1995, and the first jury cases were tried in 1996.
 In practice pretrial custody is usually less than I year; however, criticism is heard
 in legal circles that some judges use "preventive custody" as a form of anticipatory
 sentencing. In cases of petty crime, suspects released on bail sometimes wait up to
 5 years for trial. At present, some 24 percent of the prison population is awaiting
 trial.
 Following conviction, defendants may appeal to the next higher court. Human
 rights groups such as the Association Against Torture and members of the press
 complain that many persons convicted of offenses constituting violations of human
 rights avoided sentencing by prolonging the appeals process and that sentences for
 persons convicted of such offenses are unduly light. According to Amnesty Inter-
 national, custodial sentences of less than 1 year and a day customarily are not
 served in such cases. In January the European Court of Human Rights issued its
 judgment in the December 1997 trial of Tejedor Garcia vs. Spain. The plaintiff, a
 National Police officer at the time of the incident, was detained in 1989 after he
 struck and arrested two foreign nationals while off-duty and drunk. He later was
 suspended from duty for 6 months and ordered to pay a fine and compensation to
 the victims. Tejedor brought the case to the Court claiming that Article 6.1 of the
 European Convention on Human Rights (right to a fair trial) was violated since he
 was prosecuted after the expiration of the provisional discharge order made by the
 investigating judge. The Court was unable to determine the date that the Public
 Prosecutor's office received the judge's order and therefore dismissed the charges
 against the Government.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the privacy of the home and correspondence. Under the
 Criminal Code, government authorities must obtain court approval before searching
 private property, wiretapping, or interfering with private correspondence. The
 antiterrorist law gives discretionary authority to the Minister of the Interior to act
 prior to obtaining court approval in "cases of emergency.",
 In March National Intelligence Agency (CESID) wiretaps were discovered at the
 Vitoria headquarters of the political party Herr Batsuna (HB), which, although a
 legal political party, generally is regarded as the political arm of the Basque terror-
 ist group ETA. The scandal forced the provincial CESID directors in Vizcaya, Alava,
 and Pamplona to resign and compelled the Minister of Defense to develop a plan
 to establish greater judicial oversight of CESID operations. The investigation contin-
 ues.
 There were no developments in the case of a judicial investigation into allegations
 of wiretapping by CESID of private telephone conversations of the King, various
 ministers, and other prominent figures between 1980 and 1991.
 There were also no developments in the investigations of linkages of the CESID
 to GAL crimes, although the investigations of GAL crimes in general proceeded
 unabated (see Section l.a.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these provisions in practice. Opposi-
 tion viewpoints, both from political parties and nonpartisan organizations, are aired
 freely and widely reflected in the media.
 Throughout the year, the pro-ETA political party Herdi Batsuna repeatedly de-
 nounced the December 1997 conviction of 23 members of its National Committee for
 collaboration in an aedebans a violation of its members' freedom of speech.
 Each of the convicted HR officials was sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment and a
 $3,500 fine (Ptas 500,000) in connection with their decision to distribute a videotape
 made by ETA during HB's 1996 election campaign.
 
 
 1514
 
 The Government closed the Basque daily newspaper Egin and a radio station af-
 filiated with Egin in July for terrorist-related activities (see Section L.a.). Charges
 of aiding terrorists were brought against the editor, Xabier Salutrigi; the investiga-
 tion continued at year's end (see Section l.a.).
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom ofReligion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. The Government treats various religions
 in different ways. Catholicism is the predominant religion and enjoys the closest of-
 ficial relationship as well as the most benefits. Jews, Muslims, and Protestants (the
 latter a confederation of many faiths) also have official status but enjoy fewer privi-
 leges. These religions have bilateral agreements with the Government. Other recog-
 nized religions, such as Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons, are covered by constitu-
 tional protections but have no special agreements with the Government. Religions
 not officially recognized, such as the Church of Scientology, are treated as cultural
 associations. There are over 15,000 Jews and 300,000 Muslims in the country, al-
 though most of the latter are transient and dispersed. Religion courses are offered
 in public schools but are not mandatory.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to travel within and outside the country, to emigrate,
 and to repatriate. The Government respects these rights in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations, including the Spanish Committee
 for Assistance to Refugees (CEAR) in assisting refugees and asylum seekers. Under
 a 1994 law, asylum requests are adjudicated in a two-stage process with the Office
 of Asylum and Refugees (OAR) making an initial decision on the admissibility of the
 application for processing. The Minister of the Interior-makes the final decision. The
 applications admitted for processing are examined by an interagency committee
 called the Interministerial Committee for Asylum and Refuge (CIAR). The CLAR in-
 cludes representatives from the Ministries of Interior, Justice, Labor, Foreign Af-
 fairs, and-a nonvoting member of the UNHCR. The decision of the CIAR in each
 case must be approved by the Minister of the Interior.
 The UNHCR advises the authorities throughout the process. In addition, appli-
 cants for asylum have the right to have their applications sent immediately to the
 local office of the UNHCR. The authorities are not bound by the judgment of the
 UNHCR in individual cases. Appeals of rejection at either stage may be made to
 the National High Court, and appeals of the National High Court decisions may be
 made to the Supreme Court.
 Asylum requests may be made from outside as well as the country. From outside,
 anyone can request asylum from a Spanish diplomatic or consular representative.
 Illegal immigrants are permitted to apply for asylum. Those who lack visas or per-
 mission to enter may apply at the frontier or port of entry. The applicant in such
 cases may be detained until a decision is made regarding the admissibility for proc-
 essing of the' application. In cases of persons who apply from within the country,
 this normally takes 2 months, but in the case of persons who apply at a port of
 entry, the period is reduced to 72 hours. The period for filing an appeal in such
 cases is 24 hours. The Public Defender has challenged the legality of this form of
 detention before the Constitutional Court and a decision is pending. Applicants have
 the right under law to free legal assistance regardless of where they are when they
 apply for asylum. This assistance is available for applicants from the first step in
 the process through any appeals of negative decisions. The applicant also has the
 right to the assistance of translators and interpreters, and the OAR admits docu-
 ments in any language without requiring an official translation.
 According to the OAR, a total of 4,975 persons requested asylum in 1997. Of 4,938
 cases processed for first screening, 1,554 pers6ns were admitted in 1997. Of 1,587
 cases reviewed for second screening by the CIAR in 1997, 156, or 9.83 percent, were
 granted asylum. There has been a steady drop in the number granted asylum in
 the past 5 years, since 1,287 were granted asylum in 1993. In the category of tem-
 porary admission for humanitarian reasons, 218 persons were admitted in 1997.
 The Public Defender expressed his concern over the high percentage of applica-
 tions not admitted for processing (68.5 percent in 1997). There also has been criti-
 cism of the practice of substituting temporary admittance for humanitarian reasons
 for granting asylum. The former status includes restrictions on access to both the
 labor market and welfare payments. Another concern is that in some cases individ-
 uals whose asylum requests were turned down may have been expelled while their
 appeals were still in progress, although no statistics are available. There were no
 reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.

 Spain continues to face a wave of illegal immigrants coming across the Strait of
 Gibraltar. In September 1997 the Ombudsman called for the urgent creation of a
 committee to address immigration issues. According to police data, 12,132 immi-
 grants were detained in 1997, over three-quarters of whom were Moroccan or Alge-
 rian. Authorities say that under "normal" circumstances they intercept no more
 than 30 percent of those who enter Spain through that zone. In response the Gov-
 ernment is resorting to a mix of tighter border controls, liberalized treatment for
 those who already have established themselves in society, and increased inter-
 national coordination. In the first 7 months of the year, police dismantled 81 immi-
 grant trafficking networks and made 206 related arrests.
 In August opposition parties and human rights groups called for an investigation
 into the Government's response to the shipwreck of a raft carrying Moroccans at-
 tempting to enter Spain illegally. Of the 43 passengers, 38 died, and government
 critics voiced suspicions that officials may have ignored requests for help from the
 Moroccan Government. Human rights activists also accused the Government of cov-
 eringup the incident and not doing enough to crack down on organized crime rings
 involved in the trafficking of immigrants. The would-be immigrants reportedly paid
 $1,000 each for passage to Spain. Authorities in the Spanish enclave of Mela de-
 nied the charges, pointing out that the shipwreck occurred in Moroccan territorial
 waters and claiming that Moroccan officials rejected their offer to provide rescue
 boats and medical assistance. A total of 61 persons drowned while attempting to
 enter Spain in 1997, twice the number of victims in 1996.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Spain is a multiparty democracy with open elections in which all citizens 18 years
 of age and over have the right to vote by secret ballot for Parliament. At all levels
 of government elections are held at least every 4 years. In the 1996 national elec-
 tions, the Popular Party ended 13 years of Socialist government, and Jose Maria
 Aznar became Prime Minister.
 Governmental power is shared between the central government and 17 regional
 "autonomous communities." Local nationalist parties give political expression to re-
 gional linguistic and cultural identities.
 Women are increasing their participation in the political process. The number of
 female candidates increased in the 1996 national elections, but under the electoral
 system the percentage of votes won determines the number of candidates elected
 from the party list. Many women were placed in the lower half of the list As a con-
 sequence of this electoral system, the number of women elected has never reached
 25 percent. Women hold 19 percent of parliamentary seats. The 350-member Con-
 gress of Deputies has 72 female representatives (22 percent of the total) and the
 256-member Senate has 27 (10.4 percent of the total). The Ministers of Justice, Ag-
 riculture, Education and Culture, and Environment are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of nongovernmental human rights groups, including the Human Ri hts
 Association of Spain in Madrid and the Human Rights Institute of Catalonia in Bar-
 celona, operate freely without government interference. The Government cooperates
 readily with international organizations, international nongovernmental human
 rights groups, and independent national groups investigating allegations of human
 rights abuses.
 The Constitution provides for an Ombudsman, called the "People's Defender," who
 as part of his duties actively investigates complaints of human rights abuses by the
 authorities. The Omsbudsman operates independently from any party or govern-
 ment ministry, must be elected every 5 years by a three-fifths majority of the Con-
 gress of Deputies, and is immune from prosecution. He has complete access to gov-
 ernment institutions and to documents not classified secret for national security rea-
 sons.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for all citizens. In 1995 Congress modi-
 fied the Penal Code to make it a crime to "incite, publicize, or otherwise promote
 the abuse or discrimination of people or groups because of race, ethnicity, national-
 ity, ideology, or religious beliefs." The Office of the People's Defender received ap-
 proximately 18,000 complaints in 1997. The majority of the complaints pertained to
 education and social services, although a significant number pertained to racism, do-
 mestic violence, and mistreatment by law enforcement agencies. There was a signifi-
 cant decline in the number of complaints about discrimination against groups.
 
 
 1516
 Women.-Sexual abuse, violence, and harassment of women in the workplace con-
 tinued to be problems. The Women's Institute, which is part of the Ministry of
 Labor and Social Affairs, reported that at least 60 women were killed by their hus-
 bands or boyfriends in 1997. (The Federation of Separated and Divorced Women
 claims that there were 91 such victims in 1997, including women killed in the home
 by family members other than husbands or boyfriends.) Of these victims, 95 percent
 were in the process of obtaining a legal separation. According to the Ministry of the
 Interior, 14,734 complaints of mistreatment of women were reported in 1998, com-
 pared with 18,080 in 1997. However, experts believe that only 10 percent of violent
 acts against women are reported to authorities. Some nongovernmental organiza-
 tions (NGO's) estimate that from 600,000 to 800,000 cases of abuse occur each year.
 The press continued to report gruesome incidents of domestic violence. On Janu-
 ary 13, a man detonated an explosive device on a Seville bus following a heated ar-
 gument with his former girlfriend and her current husband regarding the paternity
 of the woman's child. Both the attacker and the woman's husband were inured seri-
 ously, and the incident left the bus driver deaf. On February 24, a dadiz man
 stabbed his wife to death by severing the arteries in her neck; he subsequently suf-
 fered a fatal heart attack. On July 11, an Almeria woman fell 6 stories to her death
 after her boyfriend pushed her off their apartment's balcony.
 Jose Bono, president of the autonomous region of Castille-La Mancha, published
 a series of editorials in El Pas critizing the judiciary's treatment of domestic vio-
 lence. He focused on the case of Perfecto Andres Ibanez, a judge in Castilla-La
 Mancha who beat his wife to death in 1989 and was given a suspended sentence
 for "negligence resulting in death" by the same court on which he sits. Despite the
 judge's conviction, he continues to adjudicate cases, some involving domestic vio-
 lence.
 The Government adopted in April a new 3-year, $60 million initiative designed
 to assist victims of domestic violence. The "Plan Against Domestic Violence" crim-
 inalizes the violation of restraining orders and the infliction of psychological violence
 and calls for a quadrupling of the number of offices that assist victims and an ex-
 pansion of medical and legal services. Other provisions of the plan include: The de-
 velopment of public awareness campaigns in the media and in the schools; the es-
 tablishment of a domestic abuse database to streamline judicial investigations; in-
 creased access of victims to public housin g; and greater linkage between medical,
 police, legal, and counseling services in order to promote an integrated approach to
 treating victims. Women's rights' advocates, while acknowledging that the plan in-
 corporated many of their demands, expressed disappointment with several of its
 omissions. The Federation of Separated and Divorced Women criticized the plan as
 lacking in specifics, particularly its public sensitization campaigns. According to the
 Federation, the plan s key shortcoming is that it fails to make the issuance of a re-
 straining order automatic upon filing a complaint. Currently, a restraining order is
 issued only after a guilty verdict.
 Several levels of government provide assistance to battered women. A toll-free hot
 line advises women where to go for government shelter or other aid if mistreated.
 There are 54 official centers for mistreated women. The Women's Institute charged
 that some judges are reluctant to get involved in cases of violence against women
 by members of their family. Similarly, in smaller towns some police officers are re-
 luctant to accept complaints from battered women. Recognizing the latter problem,
 the Ministry of the Interior initiated a program in 1986 that created special sections
 within the police department to deal with violence against women, staffed by
 trained female officers.
 Trafficking in women for prostitution, primarily from Latin America, is a growing
 problem. In March police dismantled a Russian-Azerbaijani organized crime syn-
 dicate responsible for smuggling Eastern European women into the country. The
 men are accused of kidnaping, blackmailing, coercing, and raping the women, who
 came to Spain with the understanding that they would be given decent jobs but in-
 stead were forced into prostitution. The crime ring also is charged with coercing "al-
 ternative" nightclub employees who were illegal immigrants into prostitution. In
 August police arrested four Nigerians for allegedly trafficking in women of sub-Sa-
 haran African origin. Members of the smuggling operation promised the women de-
 cent jobs and provided them with false passports, money, and plane tickets. How-
 ever, when the women arrived, the smuggling- rings confiscated their passports,
 forced the women into prostitution, and threatened to harm family members if the
 women sought police protection.
 A 1989 law prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace, but very few cases have
 been brought to trial under this law. In recent-years, women moved towards equal-
 ity under the law, and there are larger numbers of women in the educational system
 and work force. According to the NGO Active Population, women received 57 percent
 
 
 1517
 
 of university degrees in 1996 (latest statistics available). The Minister of Social Af-
 fairs reports that women constitute 43 percent of the work force. However, according
 to the Taxation Agency (Agenda Tributaria) and its 1997 report "Employment, Sala-
 ries and Pensions' completed by the Institution of Fiscal Studies, women hold only
 18 percent of better paying positions. The female unemployment rate, at about 30
 percent, is roughly double the male unemployment rate. Women outnumber men in
 the legal, journalistic, and health care professions but still play minor roles in many
 other fields.
 Discrimination in the workplace and in hiring practices persists. A 1998 study of
 100 labor union contracts revealed that 38 contracts failed to use gender-neutral
 language, 22 employed gender-specific job titles resulting in the imposition of dis-
 criminatory wage differentials (i.e., the salary of a male secretary, "secretario," is
 13 percent higher than that of a "secretaria' in one food processing industry con-
 tract), and only 17 addressed the problem of sexual harassment. While the law man-
 dates equal pay for equal work, a 1997 report by the Economic and Social Affairs
 Council shows that women's salaries still remain 27 percent lower than those of
 their male counterparts. The Council states that women are more apt to have tem-
 porary contracts and part-time employment than men. The National Association of
 Rural Women and Families (AI'FAR) reported in 1995 that 80 percent of rural
 women are not employed formally but instead aid their husbands in farming or fish-
 ing. ANFAR reported that these women lack titles to family enterprises and do not
 receive the same social security benefits as the male head of household.
 In March the Parliament unanimously approved a nonbinding resolution urging
 the Government to calculate the value of nonrenumerated work performed each year
 and include this value in an adjunct Gross Domestic Product account. This would
 include domestic and volunteer work as well as unpaid work in family businesses
 and farming operations, the majority of it done by women.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its commitment to children's welfare
 through well-funded and easily accessed programs of education and health care.
 Education is compulsory until age 16 and free until age 18. The Constitution obli-
 gates both the state and parents to protect children, whether or not born in wedlock.
 The Ministries of Health and Social Affairs are responsible for the welfare of chil-
 dren and have created numerous programs to aid needy children. Numerous NGO's
 exist to further children's rights. For example, the school help program for the pro-
 tection of children has a team of experts who work with educators to help identify
 abused or abandoned children in the classroom.
 The 1995 Law of the Child gives legal rights of testimony to minors in child abuse
 cases; it also obliges all citizens to act on cases of suspected child abuse and, for
 the first time, sets out rules regarding foreign adoptions. Under the new Penal
 Code, children under the age of 18 are not considered responsible for their actions
 and cannot be sent to prison.
 A 1996 penitentiary law lowered the maximum age that a child can remain with
 an incarcerated mother from 6 to 3 years. When the children reach their third birth-
 day, they are sent to live with relatives or are placed in an institution. Some prisons
 have special units for mothers with children under age 3. They usually include a
 kindergarten, psychological support, and ways for children to get out of prison regu-
 larly. About 143 children live in jail with their mothers. Family groups with chil-
 dren under the age of 3 can now stay together in cases where.both parents are con-
 victs. Officials estimate that there are currently around 50 couples who meet the
 program's requirements.
 In August the United Nations Children's Fund called for an investigation into the
 use of child labor on tomato farms in Badajoz (see Section 6.d.).
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution calls for the state to provide for the
 adequate treatment and care of the disabled, ensuring that they are not deprived
 of the basic rights that apply to all citizens. The law aims to ensure fair access to
 public employment, prevent disability, and facilitate access to public facilities and
 transportation. The national law serves as a guide for regional laws; however, levels
 of assistance and accessibility differ from region to region and have not improved
 in many areas.
 The 1996 Penal Code continues to allow parents or legal representatives of a men-
 tally disabled person to petition a judge to obtain permission for the sterilization
 of that person. In 1994 the Constitutional Court held that sterilization of the men-
 tally infirm does not constitute a violation of the Constitution. In practice many
 courts have authorized such surgery. Religious groups continue to protest this rul
 in g. "'1~c.l~hi
 inational/Racial/EthnicMinorities.-Public opinion surveys indicate the contin-
 ued presence of racism and xenophobia. A February poll of teenagers published in
 the daily El Mundo found that while 86 percent of those surveyed denied being rac-
 
 
 1518
 
 ist, 38 percent subscribed to the belief of white racial supremacy. Of these surveyed,
 27 percent would expel Roma if given the opportunity, 24 percent are in favor of
 ejecting Arabs, and 15 percent advocate the same fate for Jews. Over 50 percent
 would be uncomfortable marrying a Roma or an Arab.
 Roma, who make up 2.5 percent of the population, continue to suffer discrimina-
 tion in jobs, schools, and housing. Romani activists attribute the high incidence of
 Romani informal sector employment in agriculture and peddling (an estimated 75
 to 80 percent) to discrimination and historical marginalization. Although the Madrid
 High Court of Justice struck down a city ordinance prohibiting peddling, the NGO
 Gypsy Presence reports that local authorities continue to enforce the ban. According
 to the organization, the largest Roma-rights NGO, several other municipalities have
 enacted similar statutes, and this has been detrimental to the economic welfare of
 many Roma. Romani women suffer even more acute difficulties when seeking em-
 ployment, since employers are reluctant to hire women from ethnic groups with high
 birth rates.
 A 1998 study found that only 35 percent of Romani children are fully integrated
 into the educational system. Truancy and dropout rates are very high, and Romani
 parents, over 80 percent of whom are functionally illiterate, often do not see the
 value of an education or are unaware of the educational opportunities for their chil-
 dren.
 An unofficial government tendency to prioritize non-Roma squatter resettlement
 over Roma resettlement has led to an increasing proportion of Roma in shanty-
 towns: Roma went from constituting 55 percent of the shantytown population in
 1975 to constituting 95 of the squatter population in 1990. The Consortium for the
 Marginal Population, which receives funding from the Madrid municipality and au-
 tonomous community, rehoused 211 families in 1997 at a cost of $15 million.
 The Office of the People's Defender, Gypsy Presence, SOS Racismo, and
 Greenpeace continued to criticize the Romani squatter settlement in Canada Real's
 substandard environmental and sanitary conditions. The squatters were relocated to
 Canada Real in 1994, when Madrid officials sold the public land on which they were
 settled to developers. The non-Romani families displaced were transferred to public
 housing, while the dislodged Roma were moved to Canada Real with the promise
 that prefabricated housing would soon be built for them on the site. Legal docu-
 ments show that the land was not zoned for residential construction, and the plans
 soon were abandoned. Sanitary conditions are poor due to the lack of a sewage hook-
 up, the lack of running water to individual homes, and the presence of many rats
 and insects. Residents are said to suffer from a high incidence of respiratory ail-
 ments, chronic diarrhea, and skin infections. A 1997 Council of Europe fact-finding
 mission expressed concern over the proximity of Canada Real to a garbage inciner-
 ator and a pig farm shut down by public health authorities in 1995. The Council's
 report cited controversial reports documenting the incinerator's emission of carcino-
 genic chemicals such as dioxides and sodium cyanide and the dumping of medical
 waste products and the remains of dead animals into nearby rivers. However, the
 Madrid High Court's findings in a 1997 case contradicted these reports, however.
 The Court declared that the incinerator did not pose a threat to public health. The
 Public Prosecutor announced that he would appeal. The People's Defender an-
 nounced that he would solicit Parliament's help in solving the problem, since the
 Madrid city government had failed to act on his recommendations. Gypsy Presence
 intends to ask the World Health Organization to commission a study of the site's
 sanitary conditions.
 A language or dialect other than Castillian Spanish is used in 6 of the 17 autono-
 mous communities. The Constitution stipulates that citizens have "the duty to
 know" Castillian, which is the "official language of the state," but it adds that other
 languages also can be official under regional statutes and that the "different lan-
 guage variations of Spain are a cultural heritage which shall. . . be protected."
 The Law of the Catalan Language, approved by the Catalan regional legislature
 (Generalitat) in January, stipulates the use of Catalan as the official language in
 local government and administrative offices, regional courts, publicly-owned corpora-
 tions, and private companies subsidized by the Catalan regional government. Span-
 ish-speaking citizens are provided with the right to be dealt with by public officials
 in Spanish. The legislation also establishes minimum quotas for Catalan-language
 radio and television programming. Many activists in Catalonia's Spanish-speaking
 community criticized the law for discriminating against Spanish-speaking citizens
 and imposing "linguistic hegemony" on a diverse population. Lawsuits regarding
 specific applications of this law are pending in various courts. Both Galicia and Va-
 lencia have laws stating the duty of the Government to "promote" their regional lan-
 guages in schools and at official functions.
 
 
 1519
 
 The debate continued over the extent to which the Basque langage (Euskera)
 should be promoted. The Union of Basque-Speaking Lawyers, aflated with the
 pro-ETA HB political party, intensified its campaign against the use of translation
 services in trials of Basque-speaking citizens, and students demanding exclusively
 Basque language instruction disrupted an April meeting of the staff of the Univer-
 sity of the Basque Country. In July a Vizcaya judge suspended a trial because a
 non-Basque-speaking attorney requested a translator.
 The case of the neo-Nazi, Pedro Varela Geiss, is the first to be tried under a provi-
 sion of the Penal Code modified in 1995 that criminalizes discrimination. A Bar-
 celona court in November convicted Varela and sentenced the bookshop owner to 5
 years in prison for denying the Holocaust and for promoting racism and anti-Semi-
 tism. Varela was arrested in 1996 when the police confiscated thousands of pro-Nazi
 books and videotapes as well as hundreds of swastikas and other Nazi propaganda
 material in a raid on his bookshop in Barcelona.
 Human rights groups and the media continued to give increasing attention to dis-
 crimination against the growing numbers of illegal immigrants from northern and
 sub-Saharan Africa. According to a 1996 study by the Youth Institute in the Min-
 istry of Labor and Social Affairs, 91 percent of persons under the age of 29 would
 like to see immigration further restricted. Although only 1.3 percent of the popu-
 lation is foreign born, and the Government reduced the number of work permits
 issued to foreigners by 10 percent in 1995, 60 percent of the respondents in the sur-
 vey said that they believed that immigrants caused employment problems for them.
 The Association of Moroccan Immigrant Laborers has offices in Madrid, Barcelona,
 and Seville to combat anti-Moroccan racism, and Madrid has a special administra-
 tive office to deal with immigrant complaints.
 In November in Almeria, a group of about 2,000 persons took to the streets to
 protest the killing of Abdel Khalek Al Ammary, a Moroccan immigrant who was
 shot and killed by 2 hooded men. They asked for justice and the prompt investiga-
 tion of the killing by the local authorities. In addition to protesting the killing, the
 protesters sought to call attention to their substandard living and working condi-
 tions. The immigrants called for higher salaries and improved housing facilities.
 They claimed that immigrant workers represent 80 percent of the agricultural work
 force and as such have contributed to the social development of the area. Only
 Izquieda Unida (IU), a leftist coalition whose largest member is the Spanish Com-
 munist Party, backed the protest.
 According to press reports in November, Muslim immigrants complained about
 discriminatory treatment because they reside in the enclave of Melilla. According to
 the reports, several hundred Muslim residents of Melilia have experienced some sort
 of discrimination because of their unclear legal status in the area. The National Is-
 lamic Commission of Melilla (CIM) charges that the government of Melilla hindered
 legal immigrants from renewing or applying for their documentation. Starting in
 1985, members of the Muslim population of Meilila who resided legally in the coun-
 try were given special identification cards that serves as a form of national identi-
 fication document but does not entitle the bearer to permanent residency in Spain.
 However, these documents represented a first step to a more permanent legal sta-
 tus. Mohamed Ahmed Moh, the Secretary General of CIM, said that the Govern-
 ment utilizes any and all possible excuses for either denying or delaying the
 issuance of residency documents in the hopes of interfering with the legal deadlines
 during which the immigrants would be entitled to apply for permanent residency.
 Since 1985 6,000 Muslim residents of Melilla have applied for documentation and
 still are waiting for a response.
 In May the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of two police officers for coercing
 and extorting illegal immigrants. Some of their activities included robbing and brief-
 ly kidnaping a Turkish citizen and ordering an Iranian to handle a gun and a pack-
 et of drugs so that they could implicate him later in a crime. The officers were given
 13-year sentences, and a third police officer was given a 7-year sentence for collabo-
 rating with them.
 International human rights groups continued to criticize poor conditions in deten-
 tion centers holding illegal immigrants (see Section 1.c.). Amnesty International ex-
 pressed concern over increased police assaults on persons of non-European ethnic
 origin (see Section 1.c.).
 Quasi-organized rightwing youth groups (called "skinheads" by the press) contin-
 ued to commit violent acts throughout the year, terrorizing minorities. National po-
 lice estimate the total number of skinheads to be several thousand; however, they
 say that the skinheads are not organized to plan specific actions. The NGO SOS
 Racismo reported a significant increase in complaints of discrimination, racism, and
 racially motivated attacks in 1997. SOS Racismo attributed the increase to height-
 ened societal awareness. The organization noted an increase in incidents reported
 
 
 1520
 
 in rural areas and regions with large immigrant populations and a decrease in inci-
 dents, reported in urban areas. At a football match in Madrid in December, a skin-
 head stabbed and killed a fan of the visiting team.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, except those in the military services,
 judges, magistrates, and prosecutors, are entitled to form or join unions of their own
 choosing. All that is required to organize a trade union is for more than two workers
 to register with the Minister of Labor and Social Security. Over 200 trade unions
 are registered; 1 is not registered legally (because the Constitutional Court ruled
 that it was ineligible, since it represents military personnel).
 Under the Constitution, trade unions are free to choose their representatives, de-
 termine their policies, represent their members' interests, and strike. They are not
 restricted or harassed by the Government and are independent of political parties.
 A strike in nonessential services is legal if its sponsors give 5 days' notice. Any
 striking union must respect minimum service requirements negotiated with the re-
 spective employer. The right to strike was interpreted by the Constitutional Court
 to include general strikes called to protest government policy. From January to Sep-
 tember, 388 strikes took place in which 4,276,000 workers participated. The number
 of strikes declined steadily since the early part of the decade.
 Unions are free to form or join federations and affiliate with international bodies
 and do so without hindrance.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-A 1980 statute provides for
 the right to organize and bargain collectively. Trade union and collective bargaining
 rights were extended in 1986 to all workers in the public sector except military per-
 sonnel. Public sector collective bargaining in 1990 was broadened to include salaries
 and employment levels, but the Government retained the right to set these if nego-
 tiations failed. Collective bargaining agreements are widespread in both the public
 and private sectors; in the latter they cover 60 percent of workers, notwithstanding
 that only about 15 percent of workers are actually union members.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against trade union members and
 organizers. Discrimination cases have priority in the labor courts. The law gives
 unions a role in controlling temporary work contracts to prevent the abuse of such
 contracts and of termination actions. Nonetheless, unions contend that employers
 discriminate in many cases by refusing to renew the temporary contracts of workers
 engaging in union organizing. More than one-third of all employees are under tem-
 porary contracts, and the number is growing.
 Labor regulations and practices in free trade zones and export processing zones
 are the same as in the rest of the country. Union membership in these zones is re-
 portedly higher than the average throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor, in-
 cluding that performed by children, is outlawed and generally is not practiced; the
 law is enforced effectively. However, there were instances of trafficking in women
 who were forced into prostitution (see Section 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The stat-
 utory minimum age for the employment of children is 16 years. The Ministry of
 Labor and Social Afalrs is primarily responsible for enforcement. The minimum age
 is enforced effectively in major industries and in the service sector. It is more dif-
 ficult to enforce on small farms and in family-owned businesses. Legislation prohib-
 iting child labor is enforced effectively in the special economic zones. The law also
 prohibits the employment of persons under the age of 18 at night, for overtime
 work, or in sectors considered hazardous. The law prohibits forced or compulsory
 labor by children, and it is enforced effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 In August the United Nation's Children's Fund called for an investigation into
 child labor on tomato farms in Badajoz. According to Red Cross personnel providing
 assistance to migrant farm workers there, over 200 children under the age of 16,
 the majority Portuguese citizens, worked 10-hour days and earned less than $14
 (Ptas 2,000) per day. Many of the children were less than 10 years old. At a labor
 union's urging, the People's Defender opened an investigation.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage was set in December 1997
 for 1998 and is $15.12 (Ptas 2,268) per day or $453.60 (Ptas 68,040) per month. This
 represents a 2.1 percent increase compared with 1997. The legal minimum wage for
 workers over 18 years of age is considered sufficient to provide a decent standard
 of living for a worker and family. The rate is revised every year in line with the
 consumer price index and is enforced effectively by the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Affairs. The law sets a 40-hour workweek with an unbroken rest period of 36 hours
 after each 40 hours worked. Workers enjoy 12 paid holidays a year and a month's
 paid vacation.

 Government mechanisms exist for enforcing working conditions and occupational
 health and safety rules, but bureaucratic procedures are cumbersome and ineffi-
 cient. Safety and health legislation is being revised to conform to European Union
 (EU) directives. The Law to Prevent Labor Risks was passed in 1995 as the founda-
 tion for the completion of the rest of the EU directives. The National Institute of
 Safety and Health in the Ministry of Labor and Social Security has technical re-
 sponsibility for developing labor standards, but the Inspectorate of Labor has re-
 sponsibility for enforcing the legislation through judicial action when infractions are
 found. Workers have firm legal protection for filing complaints about hazardous con-
 ditions, but easily replaced temporary workers may be reluctant to use this protec-
 tion for fear of losing their jobs.
