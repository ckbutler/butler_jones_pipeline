 EGYPT
 Egypt is a republic in which effective political power is
 exercised by a president and a ruling party, but with
 significant limitations on the use of that power. The Cabinet
 is headed by a prime minister and is responsible to the
 President. The parliamentary institutions are the People's
 Assembly and the Shura (Consultative) Council. Shura Council
 elections took place in October and elections for the People's
 Assembly will be held in 1984. Several political parties are
 represented in the People's Assembly, but the ruling National
 Democratic Party has an overwhelming majority of seats and
 controls the Assembly, as well as most other representative
 institutions throughout the country. Hosni Mubarak, who became
 President following President Sadat's assassination in October
 1981, is also the chairman and dominant personality of the
 National Democratic Party. There is an independent judiciary.
 Egypt's governmental institutions and laws are based on Islam
 and the country's Arab heritage, as well as principles deriving
 from the nation's political development (especially the
 Revolution of 1952). The country's historical association with
 the West finds expression in its Napoleonic legal code.
 Since President Sadat's assassination in 1981, Egypt has been
 under a state of emergency extended by the People's Assembly for
 one year in October 1982 and again in October 1983. Under the
 emergency law, certain constitutional and legal safeguards
 normally associated with the protection of civil and political
 liberties are suspended. Government assertions that the special
 powers granted to it by the emergency law are used only to
 combat terrorism appear to be credible.
 Throughout 1983, the trial continued of persons associated with
 the "al-Jihad" ("Holy War") organization, a loose association of
 Islamic extremist groups allegedly dedicated to the overthrow of
 the secular Egyptian state and to the establishment of a
 Khomeini-style "Islamic republic." The main charges against the
 279 defendants center on their responsibility for the violent
 uprisings that broke out in October 1981 in the Assiut region.
 Another ongoing court case is that of Pope Shenouda III, the
 head of the Coptic Orthodox Church, who was deprived of
 government recognition of his status as Church patriarch by a
 presidential decree in September 1981. An April 1983 court
 ruling upheld the validity of this decree, but the decision was
 under appeal as of late 1983 and the Pope remained confined to
 remote monasteries.
 The number of legally-authorized political parties increased
 from four to six in 1983. The opposition parties boycotted the
 October Shura Council elections, and only the tiny Umma Party
 challenged National Democratic Party candidates in the November
 local council elections, winning one district contest. In both
 cases, opposition figures cited the winner-take-all nature of
 these elections, which they charged would ensure a unanimous
 sweep by the ruling National Democratic Party. During 1983,
 some opposition leaders threatened to boycott the 1984 People's
 Assembly elections because of a provision in the law which
 requires that a party receive at least eight percent of the vote
 to obtain any Assembly representation. The opposition also
 demanded guarantees that the elections will be conducted fairly.
 While the scope of overt opposition to the Government is
 limited, there is considerable expression of political dissent
 in the opposition media and elsewhere. Representatives of
 opposition parties and independents in the People's Assembly
 regularly criticize government foreign and domestic policies.

 1228
 Al-Shaab and al-Ahali, two secular opposition papers banned by
 President Sadat, were permitted to resume publication by the
 Mubarak Government and conduct a lively debate of national
 issues, frequently, often harshly, criticizing government
 figures. A third opposition paper, al-Ahrar, and some
 officially-supported publications also challenge government
 policies and officials. President Mubarak continued throughout
 1983 the periodic discussions with opposition party leaders he
 began upon taking office.
 Egypt's security apparatus is centered in the Ministry of the
 Interior. The Ministry's General Department for State Security,
 an arm of the National Police, is charged with the investigation
 of individuals and groups that espouse the violent overthrow of
 the Government.
 The Mubarak Government has demonstrated a continuing commitment
 to the "Open Door" policy of economic liberalization begun by
 President Sadat in 1974. The public sector historically has
 played the predominant role in such areas as industry,
 transportation, and communication, but the private sector is an
 important force for economic growth. Despite tight government
 budgets, the poorest people have been assisted by the
 Government's heavy subsidization of basic foods, as well as its
 efforts to guarantee affordable basic services.
 In sum, Egypt is a developing country moving gradually toward
 political liberalization and increased freedom of expression.
 Scope for initiative has been expanded by government economic
 development and social policies. While the Government
 discourages and in some cases actively opposes political
 activity outside certain bounds, its human rights record in 1983
 continued a trend of progressive improvement of the situation
 which President Mubarak inherited in October 1981. The rights
 of minorities, both to lead their lives without majority or
 government interference and to express views at variance with
 official policy without fear of retribution, have improved
 substantially, though some members of the Christian minority
 worry about the potential for greater Islamic influence in the
 country's life. The increasing independence of the judiciary
 and the substantial evidence of greater freedom accorded the
 media are also encouraging for human rights in Egypt. While
 potential for official abuse of human rights exists, mechanisms
 for redress are available.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were no confirmed reports of -government-instigated,
 politically-motivated killings in Egypt in 1983. Investigating
 the May 1983 death in prison of an al-Jihad detainee, the
 Interior Ministry reported the cause of death as a sudden
 asthmatic attack. The opposition newspaper that originally had
 publicized the death reported its acceptance of the Ministry's
 findings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of abduction of individuals for
 political or security reasons in Egypt in 1983. Nor did any
 
 
 1229
 instances of abductions or hostage-taking by opposition elements
 come to light over the past year. Names of persons detained by
 authorities under the state of emergency are generally made
 public, and the detainees are entitled under the emergency law
 to inform whomever they wish of their detention.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by the Constitution and by law. Persons
 claiming to have been tortured have the right to redress in the
 courts. Information'gained through torture is not admissible as
 evidence in court. Detainees and prisoners have on occasion
 claimed torture and have sometimes submitted appeals for redress
 to the courts or the public prosecutor. These appeals usually
 lead to investigations by appropriate legal and medical
 authorities, and frequently end in the Government's denial of
 the alleged torture. The Government seldom reveals the results
 of its investigations into torture allegations, but in November,
 an opposition paper, al-Shaab, reported that the authorities had
 ordered the arrest of a police captain on the charge of torturing
 a prisoner to death.
 Allegations, some of which may be credible, that torture of
 detainees has been committed by security officials, have
 appeared in the opposition press. For example, in September
 1983, al-Shaab claimed that "official documents" exist which
 confirm the torture of leftist detainees. The alleged documents
 have not yet been made public.  In October, al-Shaab reported
 that a 28 year-old man detained by the authorities died while in
 custody because of "brutal torture he received at the hands of
 police officers." Al-Shaab also published the Interior
 Ministry's response that it would take appropriate measures
 against any policemen shown in the report of the prosecutor to
 be guilty of the alleged torture and death of the detainee.
 At least some of these allegations may be based on fact. While
 these papers sometimes lack objectivity and often opt for
 sensationalism rather than accuracy in their reporting, the
 occasional failure of the Government to respond to allegations
 of torture and mistreatment, and the reported arrest of a police
 officer after an alleged torture incident, suggest that some
 abuses have occurred. In its 1983 report, Amnesty International
 expressed concern about a lack of safeguards accorded to
 political detainees which it felt increased the likelihood of
 torture and ill-treatment, but added it could not conclude that
 torture of political detainees has become routine.
 The Egyptian Constitution and laws prohibit cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading punishment or treatment. Reports have appeared in the
 opposition press of strikes by the al-Jihad defendants to
 protest prison conditions, including solitary confinement,
 flogging, and other forms of physical abuse. There is some
 evidence that prisoners are at times struck with rifle butts and
 similarly mistreated. The Government has usually, if not
 always, denied allegations of mistreatment in its prisons or not
 responded to these complaints. There have been reports of
 upper-level security officials acting to rectify abuses
 committed against persons detained for investigations.
 Prisons often appear crowded and lacking adequate medical
 facilities. Some prisons, however, have been observed that
 appear to provide reasonable living conditions and opportunities
 for vocational training and recreation.
 
 
 1230
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In general, arbitrary arrest, detention, and exile are forbidden
 by law. Arrests follow investigations, and arrested persons are
 charged with violations of specific, existing laws. Preventive
 detention is not normally practiced. Arrested persons have the
 right of habeas corpus and there is an established system of
 bail. Existing law, however, does permit detention of an
 individual suspected of a crime for up to 90 days while
 investigations continue. In one case, a person was arrested in
 January 1983 and remained in custody for three months before
 charges were filed against him. Bail was not granted and the
 trial began in May 1983. By and large, there is careful
 observance of constitutional and legal safeguards designed to
 ensure due process in the arrest and pre-trial custody stages.
 Arrests occur openly and with warrants, and the accused are
 brought before an independent judiciary.
 The provisions of the state of emergency create exceptions to
 the normal legal procedures described above. Under these
 provisions, the Prime Minister and Interior Minister have been
 delegated authority to order the arrest or detention of persons
 suspected of being dangerous to state security without regard
 for normal legal procedures. The state of emergency provisions
 have been used to arrest persons accused of threatening state
 security. Amendments to the emergency law in 1982 accorded
 detainees and prisoners greater rights of counsel and appeal, as
 well as prompt redress, including judicial review, against
 improper treatment by the authorities. No further changes in
 the state of emergency provisions were made in 1983, but several
 related laws granting the Government additional authority to
 arrest and detain suspects were repealed or liberalized
 concurrent with the October 1983 extension of the state of
 emergency. Egyptian Minister of State for People's Assembly and
 Shura Council Affairs Moktar Hani announced in September that
 the Government plans to submit to the People's Assembly a draft
 anti-terrorism bill to replace the state of emergency currently
 in effect. In an interview in November, President Mubarak
 confirmed this.
 Most of those arrested or detained under the state of emergency
 following President Sadat's assassination were tried and
 convicted or released by the end of 1982. In 1983, the number
 of arrests and detentions under state of emergency provisions
 was much lower than in 1982. In an October 1, 1983 address to
 the People's Assembly, the Interior Minister said that 391
 persons were arrested in the previous year under the emergency
 law, of which all but 25 were either released or remanded for
 prosecution. The Egyptian press reported in late November that
 the Government, presumably acting under emergency powers, raided
 apartments, seized illegally-printed material, and arrested for
 interrogation 35 members of the Islamic extremist group
 al-Takfir wal-Hijra. Possibly as many as 100 non-Egyptians
 (including Libyans, Palestinians, Pakistanis, and Iranians) were
 deported in 1983 for "hostile political activities."
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Egyptian law provides for public trial and equal treatment
 before the law, and the regular court system is independent.
 Persons accused of espionage or crimes against state security,
 however, are tried in special courts whose proceedings are often
 
 
 1231
 closed to the public. Certain sessions of the ongoing al-Jihad
 trial have also been closed, as were some sessions of the
 earlier trials against President Sadat's assassins. However,
 all of the al-Jihad defendants have been present at the
 proceedings and have been represented by lawyers conducting an
 active defense.
 The courts demonstrated increasing independence from the
 Government in 1983. Prominent cases (detailed in other sections
 of this report) include those involving the New Wafd Party's
 efforts to regain legitimacy, Coptic Pope Shenouda's attempts to
 challenge the Government's withdrawal of recognition of his
 legal status, and the Bar Association's efforts to challenge
 alleged government interference in the election of its Executive
 Council.
 Traditional Islamic courts play a limited role in the judicial
 realm and are restricted to certain family matters, such as
 divorce and inheritance. There have been occasional calls from
 the Muslim religious community for an expansion of the influence
 of Islamic law in national institutions and a bill has been
 before the People's Assembly for several years which would make
 the Islamic Shari'a the basis for Egypt's legal code.
 Nonetheless, a Western-style judiciary and legal code continue
 to characterize the nation's court system.
 There is no definitive information on the exact number of
 persons serving prison sentences (as opposed to detainees on
 trial or awaiting prosecution) for acts of violent protest or
 membership in proscribed organizations that espouse terrorism or
 the violent overthrow of the state. However, piecing together
 government and media reports of arrests, detentions,
 prosecutions, and releases, their number may reach about 100.
 The conviction and sentencing for specific crimes of "prisoners
 of conscience" or other non-violent dissenters appear to occur
 rarely, if at all, in Egypt. However, the state of emergency
 decree provides the Government ample powers to detain people it
 believes or fears may be planning or attempting violent acts
 against the Government, irrespective of whether such acts are
 indeed committed. Thus, the potential for abuse clearly exists.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Freedom from arbitrary interference by the state or by political
 organizations in the private life of the individual is
 guaranteed by the Constitution. The Government does not appear
 to interfere in the private lives of its citizens, except when
 actual crimes are involved or where the state believes there is
 evidence that persons may be engaging in potentially violent
 political activity.
 Under normal circumstances, police must obtain from the State
 Security Prosecutor a warrant before undertaking arrests,
 searches, or seizures. The warrant, however, need not specify
 the material being sought in a search and material seized under
 a warrant can be presented as evidence during trials. On
 occasion, the courts have dismissed cases when they considered
 that warrants were issued without sufficient cause. Under the
 law, officials who conduct searches without a proper warrant can
 be subjected to criminal penalties. Monitoring of
 correspondence or telephones does not appear to take place
 except with the legally-required prior authorization of the
 State Security Prosecutor.
 
 
 1232
 The emergency law empowers the Prime Minister and Interior
 Minister to authorize searches of individuals or premises
 without regard for existing legal procedures. There have been
 no reports of such actions being taken in 1983 or at any time
 since the sweeps carried out in the wake of President Sadat's
 assassination.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and of the press.
 The Government's increasing respect for these freedoms is
 .reflected in the spirited debate of national issues and frequent
 criticisms of government officials (including the Prime Minister
 and the President) in the media. Such debate appears
 occasionally in the government-owned press, but criticism is
 found especially in the weekly newspapers of the legal
 opposition parties. These opposition papers serve as channels
 for the expression of viewpoints at odds with those of the
 Government. It is said in opposition circles that since the
 national revolution of 1952, the press has never been freer than
 it is today. The London-based International Press Institute
 echoed this in a late 1983 report. Nonetheless, the Government
 can, but rarely does, exercise influence on government-owned
 publications, including the major daily newspapers, whose
 editors are appointed and can be dismissed by the.Government.
 There is no government machinery for direct control of the print
 media (as there is for radio and television), but under the law
 the Shura Council has responsibility for press supervision. The
 Council theoretically exercises its supervision through
 ownership of 51 percent of all non-party newspapers and
 magazines, but in fact there is very little reported contact
 between the Shura Council and the press. Overt censorship does
 not exist, though journalists working for both government-owned
 and opposition newspapers may occasionally impose constraints
 upon themselves. Sanctions against press critics are rarely
 applied. Since Mubarak assumed the presidency, no opposition
 papers have been seized, nor any journalists arrested.
 President Mubarak, in his November 6 address to the People's
 Assembly, noted the importance of opposition criticism, calling
 it "a medal with which we decorate our political system." In
 this speech and in others, he has sometimes "criticized the
 critics," including those published in the government-owned
 press, for failing to offer constructive alternatives or for
 neglecting Egypt's "national interests."
 In 1982, Egyptian courts abolished President Sadat's decrees of
 September 1981 that had suspended the publishing licenses of
 several Islamic and Coptic religious journals, but these papers
 did not reappear in 1982 or 1983. Charges have been made in the
 opposition press that the Government continues to prevent these
 papers from resuming publication. Although the facts are
 unclear, it is likely that the authorities, relying on special
 powers granted under the emergency law, have not restored the
 publishing licenses of these journals. A number of other
 religious journals of various faiths were not subject to the
 1981 ban and have continued publishing unhindered.
 A wide variety of foreign reading matter in both Arabic and
 numerous other languages is readily available. On occasion, the
 authorities have temporarily banned ce;tain foreign
 publications. Examples of banned publications include the
 
 
 1233
 Saudi-owned daily ash-Sharq al-Awsat published in London and
 Jidda, and the Paris-based newsmagazine al-Watan al-Arabi.
 These instances appear to be relatively isolated.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Under the provisions of the state of emergency, the Government
 can place limitations on the constitutionally-guaranteed right
 of assembly. In practice, permission is required from the
 Interior Ministry to hold a public meeting. Despite the
 authority under the emergency law to restrict gatherings of
 opponents of the Government, opposition parties have been
 allowed recently to hold numerous meetings, demonstrations, and
 rallies. In August 1983 the New Wafd Party was allowed to stage
 a large rally, despite the fact that it was not then recognized
 as a legitimate party by the Government. On other occasions,
 public gatherings of legal and especially proscribed political
 organizations have been actively frustrated or even banned. For
 example, complaints have appeared in the opposition press of
 attempts by the ruling National Democratic Party to harass
 opposition party leaders and to disrupt their meetings and
 rallies.
 About 20-25 percent of Egypt's workforce is unionized. Every 50
 workers in a given activity can form a committee which operates
 as a local union. These unions are affiliated with a national
 union, of which there are 23. Workers at firms employing less
 than 50 persons can directly join a national union.
 The principal function of trade unions is to defend the rights
 of their membership in dealing with management on such issues as
 wages, worker welfare, and working conditions. On these issues
 labor defines its interests and pursues them with few
 restrictions. It is entirely self-financed and spends its funds
 as it wishes. Unions do not have the right to strike. There
 is, however, an intricate system of arbitration to resolve wage
 and working conditions issues. Unions are represented on the
 boards of public sector companies and actively work to improve
 wages and working conditions. Unions also are guaranteed
 representation in the People's Assembly.
 Union leaders are elected at almost every level, but controversy
 exists over the legitimacy of these elections. The ruling
 National Democratic Party tends to dominate these technically
 non-partisan elections, but opposition figures do hold union
 office, and union officials at various levels often hold views
 sharply at variance with those of the Government. In connection
 with union elections held in November, opposition media charged
 the trade union establishment with overly close ties to the
 Government and the National Democratic Party, corrupt practices,
 and lack of responsiveness to the rank and file. The union
 newspaper, al-Umaal, rebutted these charges and highlighted the
 gains made on bread-and-butter issues in recent years. There
 have also been allegations in the opposition press that the
 elections were rigged in favor of National Democratic Party
 candidates, and reports that election losers have gone to court
 to have the results invalidated. Though some of the allegations
 may be exaggerated, improprieties may have occurred in some
 areas.
 The Egyptian General Trade Union Federation is the only legal
 national labor federation. Since 1977, its head has also served
 as Minister of Manpower and Training. This arrangement has
 
 
 1234
 enhanced government control, but has to some extent
 institutionalized dialogue between the unions and the
 Government. Government influence over trade unions varies
 significantly from union to union. Some are heavily influenced
 by the Government, but others are controlled by unionists who
 strongly oppose aspects of government policy.
 A 1983 court decision illustrates the ability of the unions
 successfully to challenge the Government on matters of critical
 importance to their rank-and-file. This case arose when the
 authorities decreed that a Cairo bank had to vacate its office
 building so that the premises might be used by the National
 Democratic Party. Objecting to the hardships that the forced
 relocation would cause bank employees, the union representing
 bank and insurance workers went to court and obtained a
 permanent injunction that struck down the Government's order to
 vacate the building.
 Professional associations have experienced government
 intimidation in the past, but under President Mubarak their
 autonomy has increased. In a lengthy trial that ended in June
 1983, the Higher Constitutional Court ruled unconstitutional
 President Sadat's dissolution two years earlier of the
 duly-elected Executive Council of Egypt's Bar Association and
 replacement of it with a Government-appointed Council. In a
 related decision concerning the Bar Association, another court
 suspended a Government-sponsored law that would have set up a
 new system of elections for the Bar Association Council. The
 Bar Association had challenged this law in order to obtain
 reinstatement of the council members ousted by President Sadat.
 Observers expect the suspended law will eventually be ruled upon
 by the Higher Constitutional Court.
 The General Trade Union Federation adheres to principles of
 neutrality and non-membership in international workers'
 organizations, except for the Arab Labor Organization and the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity. Similarly, formal
 ties are discouraged between Egyptian professional associations
 and international organizations, though at least one
 international cooperation agreement (between the General Trade
 Union Federation and the AFL-CIO) does exist.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 According to the Constitution, Egypt is an Islamic state which
 guarantees freedom of religious expression. The Constitution
 also guarantees all persons equality before the law regardless
 of religion. Egypt has a substantial tradition of religious
 toleration, and persecution or discrimination on religious
 grounds is neither practiced nor sanctioned by the Government.
 Islam and Coptic Christianity are Egypt's two major religions.
 Most Egyptian Jews emigrated many years ago and those who remain
 appear to practice their faith without restriction or harassment
 from government or nongovernment sources. Various Protestant
 sects operate, though they have a small following confined
 largely to the expatriate community. All faiths are openly
 practiced without restriction. Although zoning and other types
 of regulations apply, all faiths can, in practice, establish
 places of worship, run schools, and train numbers of clergy
 adequate to serve believers. All organized religions may
 maintain links with coreligionists in other countries and with
 their international hierarchy (e.g., Roman Catholic ties to the
 Vatican), if one exists. Religious conversion is not restricted
 or penalized by the Government. Proposals that would implement
 
 
 1235
 such sanctions have been rejected on various occasions. Foreign
 missionaries are not authorized to enter Egypt in order to
 proselytize. There are, however, no indications that foreign
 clergy have been denied entry into the country to serve
 expatriate congregations.
 Coptic Christians are Egypt's most significant indigenous
 religious minority and constitute about eight percent of the
 population. Copts work in all walks of life and participate
 fully in the life of the country. They are represented in the
 Cabinet, the People's Assembly, the ministries, and the armed
 forces. Though many Copts face prejudice and individual acts of.
 discrimination from the Islamic majority, there is no evidence
 these acts are officially inspired or sanctioned. The
 Government has sought with success to defuse sectarian tension
 which had reached a peak in the period preceding President
 Sadat's assassination. Reports of persecution and physical
 attacks on Copts by Islamic extremists have become increasingly
 rare in the last two years. The Government continues to take
 substantial measures to protect Egypt's Coptic minority from
 violence at the hands of Islamic militants.
 Some Copts, both in Egypt and abroad, have expressed concern
 that the resurgence of Islam may undermine minority rights,
 eventually reducing non-Muslims to the status of "second-class
 citizens." They cite the introduction several years ago in the
 People's Assembly of a bill which would replace the existing
 legal code with the Islamic Shari'a, court rulings which are
 alleged to reduce the legal standing of religious minorities,
 and the emphasis both Presidents Sadat and Mubarak have given to
 Egypt's Islamic heritage. These fears derive in part from the
 Islamic extremist-initiated violence of 1980-81, and also
 reflect concern with trends throughout the Islamic world and, to
 a lesser extent, in Egypt, which, if played out, would be
 threatening to Copts and other minorities. The Government has
 made clear that Egypt remains a secular state governed by a
 civil law based on the Napoleonic civil code. Courts have
 upheld the supremacy of Islamic law only with respect to those
 few areas (inheritance and family matters) to which it is
 applied in the Muslim community, but have left untouched the
 constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of Copts and other
 minorities, either in their own religious communities or in
 Egyptian society generally.
 Successive Egyptian Governments have required that politics be
 kept separate from religion. Religious extremism, whether
 Islamic or Christian, has been dealt with severely, and
 religious personalities of both faiths accused of fomenting
 sectarian strife were detained in 1981. The vast majority of
 these individuals were released in 1982, but some, including
 scores of Islamic prayer leaders and about 30 Coptic bishops and
 priests, are still restricted from resuming their former
 positions. Political activity along religious lines is
 forbidden, and various Coptic and Islamic societies are legally
 proscribed. This includes the Muslim Brotherhood, although its
 activities appear to be tolerated by the Government on an
 informal basis. Western observers have reported that most
 Coptic clergy not allowed to return home are able to function
 from nearby churches. Sermons by Islamic and Coptic religious
 figures are not censored, though the Government has made clear
 that clergy and prayer leaders should steer clear of political
 activism.
 
 
 1236
 Pope Shenouda III, whose recognition as Coptic Orthodox Church
 patriarch was revoked by the Government in 1981, has remained in
 government-enforced seclusion at a Wadi Natrun monastery for
 over two years. The Coptic Church brought suit on Pope
 Shenouda's behalf challenging the legality of President Sadat's
 September 1981 decree which withdrew government recognition of
 the Pope with respect to his official functions vis-a-vis the
 state. This decree annulled a 1971 presidential decree granting
 Pope Shenouda official recognition following his election as
 Church patriarch. In April 1983, the Administrative Court of
 the Council of State sustained President Sadat's 1981 action
 annulling his previous decree. In addition, the Court divested
 the Pope of his ecclesiastical powers and cancelled President
 Sadat's appointment of a papal committee which had performed
 many of the Pope's functions during his enforced seclusion.
 This decision is under appeal. In two late 1983 interviews,
 President Mubarak spoke of the eventual return of Pope Shenouda
 to his papal duties and the Government eased restrictions on the
 Pope, allowing him to travel to nearby monasteries and providing
 greater latitude for visitors. A delegation from the U.S.
 National Council of Churches which visited Egypt in October
 reported that restrictions on Pope Shenouda are easing and that
 he has begun to recover some of his authority. In its press
 release, the delegation said that President Mubarak reaffirmed
 to them that Pope Shenouda is the head of the Coptic Church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Egypt is guaranteed, except for
 travel in well-defined military districts and, for foreigners
 only, in certain other areas. Except for limitations affecting
 male Egyptians who have not completed compulsory military
 service, freedom of travel and emigration is guaranteed.
 However, a married woman must have her husband's permission to
 obtain her initial passport. Citizens who leave the country
 have the right to return. Some individuals who left Egypt for
 political reasons have returned since President Mubarak assumed
 office. There are no known cases of citizenship being revoked
 for political reasons. Egypt has a liberal policy on political
 asylum, and the extradition of political refugees is prohibited
 by law.
 Under the current state of emergency, the Prime Minister has
 authority to restrict foreign or domestic travel. A few reports
 have appeared in the opposition press that the Government has
 used its emergency powers to prevent or otherwise hinder
 suspected Islamic militants from travelling abroad. In June
 1983, however, the newspaper al-Ahram reported a court ruling
 that the Government could not deny the right of a well-known
 figure in the Muslim Brotherhood to travel to the U.S. to attend
 a conference.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Egypt's political system is dominated by a strong president who
 rules through control of the People's Assembly and the majority
 National Democratic Party. Though power is relatively
 concentrated, opposition parties organize, publish their views,
 and represent their followers in the People's Assembly and on
 the local level. President Mubarak has maintained the dialogue
 with opposition party leaders he began upon assuming office in
 1981. The legislation which concerns political parties and
 
 
 1237
 organizations prohibits the formation of parties on religious or
 class lines, thereby making it illegal for Islamic or Communist
 groups to organize themselves as political parties. The Muslim
 Brotherhood, which was proscribed years ago following its
 involvement in acts of terrorism, is an example of one
 quasi-political religious organization legally banned under the
 provisions of this legislation.
 In addition to the National Democratic Party, there are five
 legally-constituted opposition parties: the Socialist Labor
 Party, the Socialist Liberal Party, the Nationalist Progressive
 Unionist Grouping Party, the New Wafd Party, and the Umma
 Party. The legality of the last two was officially recognized
 in 1983, one after a lengthy court battle. With the possible
 exception of the New Wafd, which has not been tested at the
 polls, these opposition parties are small and have little real
 influence in decision-making. Through their newspapers,
 however, they voice substantial criticism of government
 policies. In addition, there are currently about 11
 independents in the People's Assembly and they are often noted
 as the Government's harshest critics.
 The New Wafd is a revival of the old Wafd, Egypt's major
 political party before the 1952 revolution. It was reborn in
 1977, but suspended itself in 1978 when several leaders were
 banned by government action. When the New Wafd tried to resume
 activity in 1983, the Parties Committee ruled that the party had
 no legal existence, a ruling the New Wafd challenged in court.
 In October 1983, the Administrative Court of the Council of
 State issued a decision recognizing the legitimacy of the New
 Wafd Party, suspending the Parties Committee finding. The Court
 held that "... the legal existence of the (New Wafd) Party does
 not rest essentially on a permission which the authorities grant
 or withdraw when or as they wish. Rather, it is a right which
 originates directly from the Constitution." As of late 1983, it
 is expected that the New Wafd will participate in the 1984
 People's Assembly elections.
 The Umma Party, a small party about which little is known,
 received court approval to undertake political activityin
 1983. Although this party apparently did not participate in the
 October Shura Council elections, it did win one of four district
 elections in which it fielded candidates during the November
 local council balloting.
 The People's Assembly has 392 members, of whom 10 are
 appointed. Of the elected seats, 30 are reserved for women.
 President Mubarak's National Democratic Party controls the
 People's Assembly with over 300 seats. Among the opposition,
 the Socialist Liberal and Socialist Labor parties currently hold
 one and 10 seats, respectively. Elections for a new People's
 Assembly are scheduled for 1984. The Shura (Consultative)
 Council is a largely advisory body without legislative powers.
 It has 210 members, 140 of whom are elected under a system in
 which the party winning an electoral majority takes all elected
 seats. The remaining 70 are appointed by the President and
 current appointees include both National Democratic Party and
 Socialist Liberal Party members. In the October 1983 elections
 for the Shura Council, the National Democratic Party claimed all
 the 70 seats (half are elected every three years) at stake. The
 three major opposition parties (the Socialist Liberal Party, the
 Socialist Labor Party, and the Nationalist Progressive Unionist
 Grouping Party) boycotted the Shura contest, claiming the
 electoral law guaranteed a unanimous sweep by the National
 
 
 1238
 
 Democratic Party. Likewise, these three opposition parties
 chose not to field candidates in the November 1983 elections for
 local councils. As with the Shura Council, the electoral system
 for the local councils is based on a winner-take-all system.
 In July 1983, the People's Assembly approved a new electoral law
 which introduced major changes in the way Assembly members are
 elected. The previous system of single-member constituencies
 was superseded by a party list system in which parties may
 submit a list of candidates for each of the 48 electoral
 districts. In each district, assembly seats are awarded in
 proportion to the number of votes for each party's list.
 However, to win any seats in the Assembly, a party must receive
 at least eight percent of the total vote nationwide. This poses
 a formidable hurdle for several of the small opposition
 parties. The new law also stipulates that all candidates must
 run on party lists. This provision would seem to spell the end
 of independent candidates, of which there were over 900 in
 1979. There was some discussion that independents might run for
 election on a party list and then reassert independent status
 upon becoming Assembly deputies. Finally, the new law expands
 the People's Assembly from 392 members to 448. Of the
 additional members, 10 are to be appointed by the President. As
 a result of concern that the new law may freeze them out of the
 People's Assembly, the three major opposition parties have
 repeatedly demanded that the "eight percent minimum" requirement
 be deleted from thd new electoral law, threatening to boycott
 the 1984 election unless this change is made. Reports have also
 surfaced that several opposition parties might band together and
 field combined lists of candidates. The Government's position
 is that the requirement is not excessive and that any serious
 party should be able to meet it.
 Considering the overwhelming majority that the National
 Democratic Party enjoys in the People's Assembly, a government
 defeat on a key issue of importance to it is unlikely. At the
 same time, it is far from accurate to picture the Assembly as a
 rubber stamp. Individual members can and do strongly criticize
 the Government. Parliamentary investigations into government
 actions or policies, requiring testimony of government
 officials, are not uncommon. National Demdcratic Party deputies
 often vote against the Government on controversial issues,
 although to date not in significant numbers. In parliamentary
 debates of proposed legislation, opposition members criticize
 government policies, present alternative ideas, and challenge
 government-sponsored legislation.
 An electoral commission drawn from the judiciary is designed to
 insure that voting is conducted fairly and legally. It
 supervises parliamentary elections and is present in each
 district on voting day. Election voting can be invalidated if
 it is concluded that ballot-stuffing or other irregularities
 have taken place. In addition, each political party running in
 the election is entitled to have observers present at the
 polling places. Police are present to keep order. However the
 opposition press has made allegations of election fraud. It was
 widely reported in the press that following the recent Shura
 Council elections, numerous local officials were charged by
 higher authorities with manipulating the elections results.
 Reports indicated that these officials faced administrative
 fines and/or prosecution. However, in an Alexandria governorate
 People's Assembly by-election in December, an opposition
 candidate outpolled his National Democratic Party opponent to
 force a runoff in January, 1984 in what observers agree was a
 
 
 1239
 clean, hard-fought electoral campaign, free of government or
 National Democratic Party meddling.
 Three major opposition parties, but not the New Wafd Party, have
 declared that they will boycott the People's Assembly elections
 scheduled for 1984 unless guarantees are provided that these
 elections will be conducted in a fair manner. The President,
 the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior have all
 given repeated assurances that the elections will be conducted
 honestly. As of late 1983, it was widely expected that most or
 all of the opposition parties would participate in the People's
 Assembly elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Egypt has signed the Organization of African Unity's African
 Human Rights Charter and has publicly reaffirmed its commitment
 to the U.N. Human Rights Declaration and respect for related
 international conventions. The Government is responsive to
 queries from international groups about human rights concerns,
 including requests for visits in that regard. Within the
 Government, primary responsibility for international human
 rights matters rests with the Foreign Ministry's Legal office
 and the Ministry's Department of International Organization
 Affairs. Specific human rights issues may be referred to the
 relevant Ministry (Justice, Interior, Health, etc.), but the
 Foreign Ministry plays the coordinating role. Official and
 nonofficial delegations participate in international meetings on
 human rights, and human rights groups exist in Cairo and in
 other large urban areas. Their activities are essentially
 nonpolitical, being related mainly to the welfare of prisoners
 and to women's rights, although at least one organization is
 trying to mobilize public support on certain political issues.
 Thus far, the Government apparently has not interfered with
 their operations.
 The Egyptian media gave prominent coverage to the U.S.
 Government's 1982 human rights report on Egypt. Much of the
 press, noting human rights violations recorded worldwide,
 focused on the positive aspects of Egypt's human rights
 performance and paid less attention to the negative side. On
 the other hand, in its treatment of the U.S. and Amnesty
 International reports, the opposition press detailed Egypt's
 shortcomings in the human rights area and sharply criticized the
 Government on this score.
 In its 1983 report on Egypt, Amnesty International expressed
 concern about the detention of political prisoners, the use of
 military and state security courts to try political prisoners,
 long pre-trial detention periods, allegations of torture and
 mistreatment of prisoners, and use of capital punishment.
 Freedom House rates Egypt "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 President Mubarak has given major emphasis to economic issues,
 and has spoken forthrightly to the Egyptian public on the
 economic problems facing the country. While stressing the
 continuity of Egyptian economic policy, the President has placed
 new emphasis on productive investments to benefit the majority
 of Egyptians. He has strongly reaffirmed his commitment to the
 "Open Door" policy of his predecessor which encourages economic
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 79
 
 
 1?40
 liberalization. He has specifically reaffirmed a role for the
 private sector. At the same time, the Government has continued
 a policy of insulating the majority of consumers from the
 pressures of world inflation. The primary vehicle for this
 policy has been a subsidy system costing about $2 billion per
 year, 14 percent of total budgetary expenditures for fiscal year
 1983. Most of this amount goes to subsidize bread, rice, tea,
 edible oil, butane gas, meat, and corn. As one result of this
 policy, caloric intake for the average Egyptian exceeds minimal
 nutritional requirements. While the subsidy system has
 accomplished its objective of assuring ample supplies at fixed
 and affordable prices for consumers, especially lower income
 groups, the system has produced significant and increasing
 strain on the budget.
 With a population of close to 46 million, growing at an annual
 rate of about 2.7 percent, Egypt's shortage of housing is one of
 its most acute problems. The construction industry is one of
 the fastest growing segments of the economy, and in 1982 Egypt
 imported about $1.2 billion in building materials and services.
 Education and health services are free and available to the
 majority of Egyptians. The World Bank estimated infant
 mortality at about 69 per 1,000 in 1983, and life expectancy at
 nearly 57 years as of 1980. About 44 percent of adults are
 literate; 88 percent of male youth attend primary school, but
 only 61 percent of female students are enrolled. Similarly,
 university education is available free to anyone who passes the
 secondary school completion exam, although assignment to
 faculties or schools is based on score rather than a prospective
 student's own choice (except for those who rate top scores).
 Public sector and government employment policies aim at
 providing jobs for everyone, although population growth has made
 this goal increasingly difficult to attain. Egypt enforces
 strict laws limiting the size of landholdings to attempt to
 guarantee that both income and production opportunities are
 equitable in rural areas. The limit in "settled lands" (the
 Delta and Nile valley) is 100 feddans (one feddan equals 1.04
 acres). Larger holdings are permitted and encouraged in "new
 lands", the desert areas being brought under cultivation through
 new irrigation. Despite these policies, an expending population
 living on a limited natural resource base has contributed to
 keeping per capita income at an estimated $705 per year.
 By law and, in many respects, in practice, equality of the sexes
 is the norm in Egypt. Women enjoy significant opportunities in
 Egyptian society. They vote, can serve in the armed forces, and
 work outside the home. Women are represented in medicine, law,
 and education, and serve in the People's Assembly and the
 Cabinet. They are generally free to travel both internally and
 abroad, though a married woman must have her husband's
 permission to obtain her initial passport. A husband may
 subsequently rescind his permission and request his wife's
 passport be cancelled, though cases of this are rare. Under
 Islamic law, female heirs are entitled to one-half the
 inheritance amount that male heirs can receive. In rural areas
 and within more traditional communities, prevailing cultural
 values sometimes make it more difficult for women to pursue
 careers outside the home. Other appearances of differential
 treatment between the sexes derive from ingrained cultural
 patterns which persist, despite government efforts to foster
 change.
