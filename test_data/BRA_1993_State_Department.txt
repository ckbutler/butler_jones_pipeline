 BRAZIL
 Brazil, with a population of over 150 million is a constitutional federal republic
 comprised of 26 states and the federal district. in an April 1993 plebiscite, Brazilian
 voters endorsed the presidential system and rejected a proposal to adopt a par-
 liamentary form of government. Elections have been free and fair since the transi-
 tion from military to civilian government was completed during the 1980's. Thepre.
 vious president,Fernando Color, was impeached and removed from office by Con-
 gress in 1992 on charges of corruption, 3 years after his election. His Vice President,
 Itamar Franco, is serving out the last 2 years of Collor's term. The next elections,
 to be held in late 1994, will choose a president, two-thirds of the Senate, 503 federal
 deputies, 27 governors, and members of state legislatures.
 Security forces in Brazil fall under federal or state control. The state police, the
 focus of many human rights complaints, are divided into two forces: the civil police,
 with a largely investigative role, and the uniformed, so-called military police (actu-
 ally civilians employed by state governments), who are responsible for maintaining
 public order. Crimes committed on duty by military police come under the jurisdic-
 tion of special military police courts, set up by the states, not by the armed forces.
 Legislation is now before the Senate to change the jurisdiction to civilian courts
 when military policemen are charged with murder and other capital crimes. Brazil's
 federal police is a small, specialized force dealing with violations of federal law, tax
 evasion, narcotics, and transboundary issues. The police, particularly those under
 state control, were responsible for numerous human rights abuses, including
 extrajudicial killings and serious physical abuse of detainees. These abuses are sel-
 dom punished.
 Brazil's economy was plagued by one of the highest inflation rates in the world,
 with an annual rate of over 2,400 percent. Government plans to cut spending and
 borrowing and to increase tax collections had made little impact by the end of 1993.
 Large disparities in income distribution characterize Brazilian society, with the
 oorest 20 percent of the population sharing only 2 percent of the national income.
 The richest 20 percent have 26 times the income of the bottom fifth, and an esti-
 mated 32 million Brazilians every day received a less than adequate diet.
 Extrajudicial killings continue to be the principal human rights problem in Brazil.
 Killings of criminal suspects and minors by vigilante groups, often including mem-
 bers of police forces, usually go unpunished. There is also widespread violence
 against women and the poor, who are predominantly from racial minorities or of
 mixed race. In rural areas, landowners and their agents frequently resorted to
 threats and violence, including killings, against activists. A confrontation between
 invading gold miners and Yanomami Indians, along the Venezuelan-Brazilian bor-
 der, resulted in 16 deaths. Charges of genocide have been brought against 23 min-
 
 
 375
 ers. Only 2 were taken into custody; they were released on December 29 when their
 trial was delayed owing to difficulty in locating witnesses.
 A special investigating committee of the Congress estimated that as many as
 500,000 minors work as prostitutes. Some 16,000 rural workers were rescued from
 forced labor without pay, but the Labor Ministry says it cannot investigate all re-
 ports of forced labor due to lack of resources. Cases of egregious human rights viola-
 tions were generally not effectively investigated or prosecuted, and a widespread cli-
 mate of impunity remains the greatest obstacle to improving human rights in
 Brazil. In two notorious Rio de Janeiro cases in 1993, however, police accused of
 articipating in killin  are under arrest, awaiting trial. This represents progress,
 ut the key will be whether the investigations result in credible prosecutions with
 appropriate punishment of the perpetrators.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Extrajudicial killings remained an
 extremely serious human rights problem in Brazil in 1993. At least several hundred
 Brazilians die annually as a result of extrajudicial killings committed by various ele-
 ments, including police, vigilante groups, landowners and their agents, and invaders
 of indigenous territories. In urban areas, police and vigilante groups, often composed
 of members of the police force, were responsible for numerous killings of criminal
 suspects, street children, and slum dwellers. Domestic and international attention
 paid to some of these killings provoked a public reaction which led to the arrest of
 several police officers and others suspected of involvement in the killings. However,
 in most killings of criminal suspects, street children, rural labor leaders, and indige-
 nous peoples, those responsible are not brought to trial or convicted.
 Obstruction of justice by local elites and widespread public apathy contributes to
 Brazil's climate of impunity. Rural landowners intimidate local populations and law
 enforcement authorities in order to impede investigations into killings of rural labor-
 ers and landless people's advocates. The high crime rate, the failure to apprehend
 most criminals, the slowness and alleged corruption of the criminal justice system,
 and the legal requirement to release those charged pending trial contribute to public
 acquiescence in police brutality and killings of criminal suspects. Investigations into
 these incidents are hampered because witnesses hesitate to cooperate with authori-
 ties for fear of retribution or because they and the general public often sympathize
 with the actions of the vigilantes.
 In Rio de Janeir, 31 military policemen were accused of murdering 21 residents
 in the Vigario Geral slum on Au st 31, in revenge for the earlier killing of 4 police-
 men in the neighborhood. All but three of those indicted in the Vigario Geral
 killings are in custody. One of the accused, a former police officer, is serving as a
 member of the Rio de Janeiro state legislature and can be arrested only if the legis-
 lature revokes his parliamentary immunity. Five military policemen were indicted
 for killing eight street children in Rio's Candelaria Square on July 23. Police statis-
 tics released after the Candelaria killings showed 328 minors had been killed be-
 tween January and June in Rio alone.
 In recent years, human rights groups credibly claimed that police in Brazil's larg-
 est city, Sao Paulo, appear to follow a policy of killing criminal suspects rather than
 arresting them. Police killed 1,470 individuals in "confrontations" in 1992, compared
 with 585 deaths in police actions in 1990. The number of killings dropped sharply
 following the firing of the state Secretary of Security for his role in the 1992
 Carandiro Prison massacre and the negative publicity it generated. This strongly
 suggested that police killings are controllable; and the number of such killings
 dropped to 409 in 1993.
 Broad press coverage, both domestic and international, generated by the
 Candelaria and Vigario Geral killings brought swift investigations and identification
 of the accused murderers in those cases. However, in most similar killings, no one
 is charged, and the police fail to carry out effective investigations. The victims in
 Candelaria and similar cases are por and mostly black. Human rights organiza-
 tions credibly charge that most are led by extermination squads, who employ cur-
 rent or former police officers.
 Investigation of charges of police abuse is often slow and uncertain, with many
 witnesses afraid  o testify against  lice for fear of retaliation. For example, Edmeia
 da Silva Euzebio was shot and kile on  anuary 15, 8 days after testifying against
 police accused in the disappearance her son and nine other youths in 1990. The ac-
 cused murderer of Da Silva was acquitted for lack of evidence. It has been estimated
 that less than 20 percent of the cases against the police brought to trial in police
 
 
 courts ever result in conviction. (Police courts are special courts with jurisdiction
 over the state police; see Section i.e.)
 Human rights groups credibly claimed the police used unnecessarylethal force in
 storming the Carandiru Prison in 1992. The police involved in the incident are being
 tried in police court. Only 57 of the 120 accused had been questioned as of the end
 of 1993. There are only four plice court judges to handle 14,000 cases pending
 against police in Sao Paulo. Given this backlog, state legislators estimate that it
 may be 10 years before verdicts are reached in the Carandiru case.
 There continue to be reports of murders of homosexuals. Sao Paulo newspapers
 reported that 3 transvestites were murdered on March 14; other reports claimed 17
 transvestites were killed in the first three months of 1993. One military policeman
 was charged in the March 14 killings and was awaiting trial at year's end. Homo-
 sexual rights groups claim, however, that the vast majority of perpetrators of crimes
 against homosexuals go unpunished.
 Police violence also occurred in rural areas. In the northeastern state of Alagoas,
 police were suspected in 80 percent of the 600 murders committed during 1992. The
 public demanded federal action after three particularly egregious police crimes: the
 military police killing of the civil police chief; the assassination of a small town
 mayor by police working for his rivals; and the murder and dismemberment of a
 crusading city councilman, also known to be homosexual.
 Most rural killings involved land disputes. The pastoral land commission of the
 Catholic Church reported that 46 persons were murdered in 1993 as a result of land
 disputes, compared to 35 in 1992. The increase in killings was accompanied by fami-
 lies being forced off farms by threats, violent intimidation, and physical expulsion.
 The body of the vice president of the rural workers' union of Araguaina was found
 floating in a river a week after he disappeared in March. Two landowners were
 killed in ambushes in September near Rio Maria, leading to abusive police tactics
 against squatters and secret arrests without cause, according to the local priest, Fa-
 ther Ricardo Rezende. On September 19, a band of men using military-like uniforms
 wiped out a squatter settlement near Tucuman, killing at least four persons, with
 three others reported missing.
 In the state of Para, where more rural workers and their leaders have been killed
 than in any other state, only one gunman was convicted of murder in 1993, and no
 landowner has ever been convicted for paying for the killings. The 1990 case of the
 murder of rural workers' union leaders Jose and Paulo Canuto was still pending in
 the courts; the investigative stage in the case of their father, Joao Canuto, who was
 murdered in 1986, has finally been concluded. The case of the landowner accused
 of hiring a gunman in 1991 to kill Expedito Ribeiro de Souza, head of Rio Maria's
 rural union, remained unresolved at year's end after a June 30 trial was postponed.
 In a rare case where a landowner was convicted and jailed for murder, Darli Alves
 and his son Darci, the killers of rubber-tapper leader Chico Mendes, escaped from
 the Acre state prison February 15. Human rights groups charge the escape was
 aided by state authorities. A federal manhunt failed to find them, and they re-
 mained at large. On March 23, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Darli
 Alves, which had been overturned by a state appeals court.
 Another environmental activist and union organizer, Paulo Vinha, was shot in the
 state of Espirito Santo on April 28 while investigating a sand mining operation in-
 side an ecological reserve. Two brothers who own the mining company were arrested
 on charges of murdering Vinha.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated abductions. The
 disappearance of street children or persons believed to be criminals is often attrib-
 uted to police or vigilante groups.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution, which contains severe legal penalties for
 torture or acquiescence in torture. Although an Americas Watch report found that
 the use of torture had declined among Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo police, there
 continued to be frequent credible reports that police beat and torture criminal sus-
 pects to extract information, confessions, or money. In the state of Ceara, a bar asso-
 ciation team in a surprise visit to a local police station found Antonio Braga bound
 with instruments of torture around him. He said he had confessed to stealing a tele-
 vision set only after beatings, shock, and near asphyxiation. Ceara's governor fired
 the Secretary of Public Security, and ordered the suspension, pending an investiga-
 tion, of a police official and four officers found torturing the suspected thief. The po-
 lice Inspector General in charge of investigating the torture allegations resigned 3
 months later after receiving death threats. A spokeman for the Ceara bar associa-
 tion reported that 17 other cases of torture had been documented through testimony
 and physical exams.

 Brazil's overcrowded prisons held 126,152 inmates in space designed for 51,368.
 A May declaration signed by 39 human rights organizations stated that "abuses,
 both physical and psychological and corruption represent the routine reality of the
 Brazilian prison system." A federal investigation into charges of abuse in Recife's
 prisons found that prisoners reported electric shocks, near drownings beatings,
 withholding of food, and extended solitary confinement. The inspector found pris-
 oners held beyond their sentences, untreated AIDS and tuberculosis, and guards
 selling their uniforms to prisoners planning to escape. A followup visit by a federal
 commission was canceled, and human rights monitors have been denied access to
 the Recife prison since this inspection.
 Conditions in juvenile detention centers continue in violation of Brazil's statutes
 regarding juvenile offenders, due to overcrowding and lack of resources. Sao Paulo's
 main juvenile facility, where rioting broke out twice in 1992, was the scene of an-
 other riot in March 1993. Human rights organizations said at least 75 of the 117
 inmates in the wing where the revolt took place were beaten by authorities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution limits arrests to those
 caught in the act of committing a crime or those arrested by order of a judicial au-
 thority. The constitutional provision for a judicial determination of the legality of
 detention is usually respected, although some convicted inmates are held beyond
 their sentences due to poor record keeping. The law permits provisional detention
 for up to 5 days under specified conditions during a police investigation. This period
 may be extended by ju       order. Illegal and incommunicado detention without a
 judicial order, particularly of street youths and children, remained a problem. A ju-
 venile court judge in Porto Alegre complained that pretrial detention of minors often
 exceeded the legal limit. A legislative report in Rio Grande do Sul also criticized a
 judge who ordered an AIDS patient confined to a mental asylum without any legal
 foundation.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is an independent branch of govern-
 ment. The judicial system, with the Federal Supreme Court at its apex, includes
 courts of first instance and appeals courts. States organize their own judicial sys-
 tems but must adhere to the basic principles in the Federal Constitution. Brazil also
 has a system of specialized courts dealing with police, labor, electoral, juvenile, and
 family matters. Special police courts have jurisdiction over state police; the record
 of these courts shows a clear reluctance to punish colleagues or human rights
 abuses. This has created a climate of impunity that encourages further abuses. Po-
 lice courts do not have jurisdiction over civilians. Elected officials are immune from
 arrest and trial until the end of their term in office unless impeached; thus the im-
 punity of the governor of Paraiba, Ronaldo Cunha Lima who shot his precedessor
 and political rival at point blank range in a restaurant November 5 and continues
 to govern. His party controls the statelegislature and refuses to impeach him.
 The right to a fair public trial, as provided for by law, is generally respected in
 practice, although local judges often demonstrated bias in favor of landowners in
 cases related to squatters' claims and to the murder of rural activists. The accused
 in the shooting case of Mariano Domingo Freire, the leader of the Small Farmers'
 Association in Pernambuco, is still at large because the court in the accused's home-
 town failed to respond to another court's request that he be turned over for trial.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel and must be made fully aware of the charges
 against them. In cases in which a defendant cannot afford an attorney, one must
 be provided at public expense; private attorneys are appointed to represent poor de-
 fendants when public defenders are unavailable. Defendants and their attorneys
 have the right to be informed of the evidence on which charges are based. Only
 cases of willful crimes against life are tried by jury; all others are tried by a judge.
 The judicial system is highly inefficient; many cases continue for years. The need
 for court reform is widely recognized in the legal and judicial community. In Per-
 nambuco state, 16 judges were under investigation for corruption, and 3 were sus-
 pended. Charges against the judges included partiality, nepotism, and extortion. In
 one case, a military police court judge was charged with deliberately misfiling and
 thus stopping 1,450 cases against police officers. The Inspector General and human
 rights lawyers have received death threats as a result of their investigations of the
 Pernambuco courts. On the other hand, a single ud in Rio de Janeiro, Denise
 Frossard, was hailed by the press and the pubic for daring to convict 14 notorious
 racketeers who control the lucrative numbers games in that city. The racketeers
 were well known, but had operated with impunity until Judge Frossard sentenced
 them to 6 years' imprisonment. Appeals were pending at year's end; Judge
 Frossard's life has been threatened.
 The high level of crime and the perceived failure of the judicial system to deal
 with criminals contributed to public tolerance of most police killings and vigilante
 killings of suspected criminals by irate citizens. Cases were reported in all regions
 
 
 378
 
 of the country. In Recife, a mob of 100 beat 3 men to death after the men killed
 a retired nurse. Police have not located any witnesses to testify against anyone in
 the mob. In Rio de Janeiro, three men were beaten, doused with gasoline, and
 burned to death after being mistaken for thieves. Drug gangs are known to main-
 tain their own system of order in Rio's slums; in the Borel slum in December 1992,
 drug lords rounded up and shot through the hand 17 youths who had been mugging
 the gang's customers, scaring away business. The youths who sought medical treat-
 ment were afraid to talk about who wounded them, and the slum residents ex-
 pressed satisfaction at the gang's action.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary intrusion into the home. There
 were no reports of illegal entry for political reasons, but illegal entry into homes
 without a warrant occurred in searches for criminal suspects. A report by the state
 legislature of Rio Grande do Sul found that searches without warrants, theft of
 property, and threats against the victims were often a police practice. A bar associa-
 tion leader in Rio de Janeiro said police routinely enter slum dwellings on the
 grounds that such structures do not meet the legal definition of domiciles. Wiretaps
 are unconstitutional except when authorized by a judicial authority for purposes of
 criminal investigation and prosecution. The inviolability of private correspondence
 is respected.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The right to free speech and to a free press as
 provided by the Constitution is widely exercised although government officials are
 sometimes successful in imposing restraints (see below). The 1988 Constitution abol-
 ished all forms of censorship. Foreign publications are widely distributed in Brazil;
 prior review of films, plays, and radio and television programming is practiced only
 to determine a suitable viewing age. The press and broadcast media routinely dis-
 cuss controversial social and political issues and engage in investigative reporting.
 Most radio and television stations are privately owned; the Government, throu
 Congress, controls licensing authority. Newspapers, which are privately owned, vig-
 orously report and comment on government performance.
 Government officials frequently use libel regulations and other laws to respond to
 critics in the press. In a small town in the state of Santa Catarina, a newspaper
 ublisher was jailed for 3 weeks by a judge on charges of "offending public morals"
 ~ecause his paper criticized local officials. A local judge in the state of Tocantins
 attempted to censr newspapers and television by prohibiting news of misuse of
 funds by an ex-governor. By bringing libel charges, former President Collor kept off
 the air a television drama series based on the events leading up to his impeach-
 ment.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assemble peacefully, and this right is respected in practice. Permits are
 not required for outdoor political or labor meetings, and such meetings occur fre-
 quently.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no favored or state religion. The majority of Bra-
 zilians belong to the Roman Catholic church, but Protestant churches have been ex-
 panding, and spiritism is widely practiced. All faiths are free to establish places of
 worship, train clergy, and proselytize, although the Government controls entry into
 Indian lands.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on movement within Brazil, except for the
 protected Indian areas, nor are there any restrictions on emigration or return. Some
 towns in the south, however, were reported to be trying to block the entry of poor
 migrants from the north. Brazil admits few immigrants, does not formal y accept
 refugees for resettlement, and is selective in granting asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their government
 through free elections. Executive and legislative offices throughout the country at
 local, state, and national levels are filled through democratic direct elections among
 candidates representing many political parties. Voting is secret and mandatory for
 all literate Brazilian citizens aged 18 to 70, except military conscripts who may not
 vote. It is voluntary for minors aged 16 to 18, for the illiterate, and for those aged
 70 and over.
 Women have full political rights under the Constitution, and they are becoming
 active in politics and government, but few are in leadership positions. Only 5 per-
 cent of the seats in the Federal Congress are held by women. Indians were given
 
 
 379
 
 the franchise under the 1988 Constitution, but they are essentially marginalized
 from the political process.
 A plebiscite on whether to change from the precidential form of government to a
 parliamentary system, with the possibility of a constitutional monarchy, was held
 in April 1993. A majority of those voting chose to keep the presidential system; 25
 percent favored a parliamentary system; and only 10 percent, a monarchy. Over 40
 percent of the electorate, however, declined to make a choice either by casting null
 or blank votes or by staying away from the polls.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Brazilian nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) actively investigate allegations
 of human rights violations and often initiate legal proceedings. Several international
 NGO's either maintain offices in Brazil or visit periodically.
 The Foreign Ministry barred two diplomats from visiting the Yanomami reserve
 after a massacre (see section 5). By subsequently requiring diplomats to obtain prior
 ermission for visits to Indian reserves through the Foreign Ministry, the Federal
 Government has significantly increased the possibility of delayed or restricted ac-
 cess. The Foreign Ministry accepts human rights questions from     international
 groups and transmits human rights inquiries to relevant federal r.nd local authori-
 ties.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, and nationality is unconstitu-
 tional but continued to be a problem.
 Women.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex in employment
 or salaries and provides for 120 days of paid maternity leave. The provision against
 wage discrimination is rarely enforced, however, and, as a reaction against the ma-
 ternity leave law, some employers seek sterilization certificates from prospective
 employees or try to fire or avoid hiring women of childbearing age.
 There is a high incidence of physical abuse against women, and 125 cities have
 established special police offices to deal with crimes against women. A special study
 by an international human rights group found that over 70 percent of all reported
 cases of violence against women take place in the home. A Sao Paulo state study
 concluded that more than 50 percent of rapes are committed by a family member
 and that investigation and prosecution are rare.
 In the city of Porto Alegre, police registered 1,500 domestic violence complaints
 per month, but were not aware of any convictions of husbands for wife beating.
 omen's rights leaders explain that police prefer to mediate family disputes rather
 than bring charges, and that women are too often dependent upon men for their
 livelihood to consider demanding punishment. Although the archaic concept of "de-
 fense of honor" as a justification for wife murder was struck down by the Supreme
 Court in 1991, courts are still reluctant to prosecute and convict men who attack
 their wives. In one case, a woman from the state of Rondonia was badly burned by
 a jealous boyfriend; her attacker was acquitted by a state court, even though he had
 been charged with the lesser charge of committing bodily harm rather than at-
 tempted murder.
 Children.-Many children suffer physical abuse and deprivation. Of 60 million
 children and adolescents, an estimated 53 percent are part of families whose per
 capita income is under half the monthly minimum wage. Consequently many chil-
 dren under 18 are found working on the streets of cities or in the fields beside their
 parents (see Section 6.d.). There are no reliable figures on the number of street chil-
 dren, some of whom are homeless but most of whom return home at night with
 whatever money they can contribute to the family. Although Brazil has relatively
 advanced laws to protect children and adolescents, and federal, state, and local
 councils have been formed to address their problems, the reality for children is still
 grim. In addition to the killings of street children (see Section 1.a), an estimated
 500,000 minors-some only 9 years of age-are involved in prostitution, according
 to a Congressional investigation. Although prostitution is widely tolerated, two po-
 lice raids were organized against houses of prostitution in gold mining camps, where
 young girls were held forcibly. In November police freed 92 adolescent girls and 30
 pris, aged from 8 to 12, from three dozen mining camps in Rondonia state. Ten
 brothel owners were arrested. Illegal abortions are common in Brazil, and one-fifth
 of the deaths of adolescent girls are attributed to botched abortions.
 Indigenous People.-Brazil's approximately 250,000 Indians, who speak 170 dif-
 ferent languages, have a constitutional right to their traditional lands. In practice.
 however, many indigenous peoples have only a very limited ability to participate in
 
 
 380
 
 decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the allocation of natural re-
 sources. The Federal Government was charged with demarcating 519 indigenous
 areas within 5 years after the 1988 Constitution was enacted. However, legal de-
 marcation and issuance of titles for only half those areas were accomplished by the
 October 1993 deadline. Congress has not yet passed laws to implement constitu-
 tional provisions with respect to Indian rights, and indigenous groups are
 marginalized from the political process.
 The Constitution gives Indians the exclusive use of the soil, rivers, and lakes lo-
 cated on their lands, while the Federal Government holds the authority to develop
 mineral resources found under Indian lands, as long as the Indians receive a share
 of the proceeds. Legal regulations for development have not been enacted, but illegal
 mining and timber cutting are a constant problem on Indian lands. In one small
 victory for Indian rights, a federal judg ordered a timber merchant to compensate
 the Nhambiquara Indians for wood valued at $40,000 which had been taken from
 an Indian reserve in the state of Mato Grosso. This sum is dwarfed by the amount
 of money being taken from economic exploitation of these lands by nonindigenous
 people.
 Brazilian gold miners, working illegall on Yanomami Indian lands, killed 16 In-
 dians-including women and children-from the Haximu village on the Brazil-Ven-
 ezuela border and burned down their village in August 1993. Brazil and Venezuela
 launched investigations into the massacre, arrested 2 miners, and issued warrants
 for 21 more. The two taken into custody were released on December 29 when their
 trial was delayed owing to difficulty in locating witnesses. There have been no con-
 victions, however, in any previous case involving the murder of Indians. Federal po-
 lice investigations into the killings of 10 other Yanomami since 1987 yielded no re-
 sults. Ten years after the murder of Guarani leader Marcal Tupa-y, who had rep-
 resented Brazil's indigenous people in a 1980 meeting with Pope John Paul II, the
 two accused landowners were acquitted by a jury in Mato Grosso do Sul on March
 29 1993. Two years after two Atikum Indian leaders were gunned down in the state
 of Pernambuco, their killers are still at large despite warrants for the arrest of four
 suspects.
 The Catholic Church's Indigenist Council reported in mid-December that 42 Bra-
 zilian Indians had been murdered so far in 1993. Twenty-four Indians were mur-
 dered in 1992. Other problems are the high number of suicides among Indians and
 deaths from diseases such as malaria, measles, and cholera, introduced into Indian
 areas by outsiders. The Federal Government failed to provide enough funding for
 adequate health care for Indians.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Although racial discrimination has been ille-
 gal since 1951, darker-skinned Brazilians frequently encounter de facto discrimina-
 tion. Most black Brazilians are found among the poorest sectors of society. Even
 though nearly half of Brazil's population has some African ancestry, very few senior
 officials in government or the armed forces are black. There are few blacks in senior
 private sector management positions. Black consciousness organizations challenge
 the view that Brazil is a racial democracy with equal treatment regardless of skin
 color. Racial discrimination becomes most evident when blacks see employment,
 housing, or educational opportunities. Blacks are more likely to be stopped by police
 and to bear the brunt of police brutality. Data on the murders of street children in
 major cities show that the victims are disproportionately black.
 I March the state of Sao Paulo created a commission on racism and a special
 police office to handle racially motivated crimes, in response to violent, racist at-
 tacks by "skinhead" gangs. The first complaints to the antiracist police office, how-
 ever, involved racial slurs made by police and employers. In the state of Espirito
 Santo in June, charges of racism were brought against a businesswoman and her
 son who told a young black woman she had no right to use the front elevator in
 their luxury apartment building. The case gained unusual prominence because the
 young woman was the daughter of the state's governor, and it illustrates a curious
 ambivalence about race in Brazilian society in which many blacks suffer indignities
 while a few exceptions are elected to high office.
 People with Disabilities.-The 1988 Constitution contains several provisions for
 the disabled, guaranteeing a minimum salary, educational opportunities, and access
 to public buildings as well as public transportation. As is the case with many other
 provisions of the Constitution, no legislation has been enacted to implement these
 objectives.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Code has long provided for union rep-
 resentation of all Brazilian workers (excepting military, military police, and fire-
 men), but imposed a hierarchical, unitary system, funded by a mandatory "union
 
 
 tax" on workers and employers. Under a restriction known as "unicidade" (one per
 city), the Code prohibits multiple unions of the same professional category in a
 given geographical area. It also stipulates that no union's geographic base can be
 smaller than a municipality. Workers in a union whose numbers increased (as when
 an industry grew) could petition the State to split a preexisting union into two or
 more unions. The 1988 Constitution frees workers to organize new unions out of old
 ones without prior authorization from the Government but retains other provisions
 of the old Code. The retention of unicidade and of the union tax continues to draw
 criticism both from elements of Brazil's labor movement and from the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).
 In practice, however, unicidade has proven less restrictive in recent years, as
 more liberal interpretations of its restrictions permitted new unions to form and-
 in many cases-to compete with unions and federations that had already enjoyed
 official recognition. The sole bureaucratic requirement for new unions is to register
 with the Ministry of Labor which, by judicial decision, is bound to receive and record
 their registration. The primary source of continuing restriction is the system of
 labor courts, which retain the right to review the registration of new unions and
 to adjudicate conflicts over their formation. Otherwise, unions are independent of
 the Government and of political parties.
 Approximately 20 to 30 percent of the Brazilian workforce is organized, with just
 over half of this number affiliated with an independent labor central. (Mandatory
 labor organization under the 1943 Labor Code encompassed a larger percentage of
 the workforce, but many workers are believed to have minimal if any contact with
 these unions.) Attacks on rural labor organizers continued (see Section L.a.). The
 Constitution iprovides for the right to strike (excepting, again, military, police, and
 firemen, but including other civil servants). Enabling legislation passed in 1989 stip-
 ulates that essential services remain in operation during a strike and that workers
 notify employers at least 48 hours before beginning a walkout.
 The Constitution prohibits government interference in labor unions but provides
 that "abuse" of the right to strike (such as not maintaining essential services, or
 failure to end a strike after a labor court decision) is punishable by law. Federal
 and civil police, federal customs inspectors port crane operators, public and private
 bus drivers and fare collectors, train and ferry operators, public and private teach-
 ers, and federal and state government employees went on strike in 1993. Formerly,
 the courts ruled virtually automatically that strikes were abusive; over the last sev-
 eral years, however, the courts have applied the law with more discretion. The 1989
 strike law prohibits firings or the hiring of substitute workers during a strike, with
 certain exceptions and provided the strike is not ruled abusive. Nonetheless, some
 strikers were fired, wit relief available only through a usually lengthy court proc-
 ess. The president and a number of diretors of the National Aeronautical Workers'
 Union were fired by Varig and Vasp airlines after a February 1988 strike. Some
 were subsequently rehired, but the then president and five directors have remained
 without wrand teir labor court cases are still pending.
 Although Brazilian laws make no provision for a central labor organization, three
 major groups have emerged: the Sole Workers Central (CUT), the General Workers
 ion (CGT), and Forca Sindical. Although the centrals do not have legal
 standing to represent professional categories of workers, all three centrals can effec-
 tively acquire such standing by affiliating existing statewide federations or nation-
 wide confederations, or by forming new federations and confederations, challenging
 the old structure. However, the status of the federations and confederations created
 since 1991 remains in doubt as a result of a challenge in the labor courts b- the
 old organizations.
 Unions and centrals are free to affiliate internationally. CUT, Forca Sindical, and
 CGT are affiliated with the ICFTU. A small splinter organization, the General
 Workers Central, affiliated with the formerly Soviet-controlled World Federation of
 Trade Unions in March 1993.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize is pro-
 vided for by the Constitution. With some government assistance, businesses and
 unions are working to expand and improve mechanisms of collective bargaining.
 Nevertheless, under current Brazilian law, the scope of issues susceptible to collec-
 tive bargaining is narrow. Further, the labor court system exercises normative pow-
 ers with regard to the settlement of labor disputes, thereby discouraging direct ne-
 gotiation. Existing law charges these same courts, as wel as the Labor Ministry,
 with mediation responsibility in the preliminary stages of dispute settlement. Wages
 are set by free negotiation in many cases, and in others by labor court decision. Be-
 ginning in 1990, the Federal Government attempted to control salary increases in
 order to limit inflation, but the attempts appeared to have little effect on wage set-
 tlements in the private sector.
 
 
 The Constitution incorporates a provision from the Labor Code which prohibits
 the dismissal of employees who are candidates for or holders of union leadership po-
 sitions. Nonetheless, dismissals take place with those dismissed required to resort
 to a usually lengthy court process for relief. For example, in the case of 12 directors
 of the Metalworkers' Union of Limeira (Sao Paulo state) removed from their jobs by
 employers in 1989, judicial actions were still under way against the companies. In
 general, enforcement of laws protecting union members from discrimination lacks ef-
 fectiveness. Union officials estimate that some 5 percent of such cases reaching the
 labor court system are resolved within days through a preliminary judicial order.
 The other 95 percent generally take 5 to 10 years (and sometimes more) to resolve.
 Labor law applies uniformly throughout Brazil, including the free trade zones.
 However, the unions in the Manaus free trade zone, like rural unions and many
 unions in smaller cities, are relatively weaker vis-a-vis industry as compared to
 unions in the major industrial cities in the southeast.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although the Constitution pro-
 hibits forced labor, there were repeated credible citations of cases of forced labor in
 Brazil. The Federal Government asserted it was taking steps to halt the practice
 and prosecute perpetrators but admitted that existing enforcement resources are in-
 adequaite. Reports of forced labor and debt bondage were common in rural areas in
 particular. In 1993 the Catholic Church's Pastoral Land Commission denounced a
 notable increase from 1991 to 1992 of persons confined to farms and forced to work
 without pay (from 4,883 persons to 16,442 persons), and projected a continuation of
 the problem into 1994. Of these persons, 8,000 were forced to work in a single char-
 coal production operation in Mato Grosso do Sul.
 During 1993 cases of forced labor also were reported in the following states:
 Bahia Maranhao, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso, Para, Parana, Rio de Janeiro, Rio
 Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Sao Paulo. Forced labor was reportedly in-
 volved in another case in charcoal for use in producing exported steel and (along
 with child labor-see below) in production of sugar for export. A provision in the
 1993 Agricultural Reform Law provides for the confiscation of property in cases of
 slave labor, but this law is unlikely to have significant impact without extensive en-
 forcement.
 State and federal authorities often did not investigate reports of compulsory labor,
 claiming lack of resources. Local police admitted that overseers or owners of many
 farms withheld pay from mgrant laborers, using force to retain and intimidate
 them. Jurisdiction for such violations falls to the Ministry of Labor, which has allo-
 cated insufficient resources for enforcement. In 1993 the International Labor Orga-
 nization (ILO), while appreciating "the cooperative attitude now shown by the Gov-
 ernment," noted continuing reprts of "ye   serious violations of basic provisions"
 of ILO Convention No. 29 on forced labor. The ILO recommended that the Govern-
 ment strengthen its system of labor inspection, particularly in rural areas. The ILO
 cited reports of a decrease in the number of labor inspections, and that successive
 changes in the Ministry of Labor had resulted it the discontinuation of programs,
 including the rural labor inspection program.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum working age under
 the Constitution is 14, except for apprentices. Legal restrictions intended to protect
 working minors under age 18 are often not enforced, however, and the problem is
 widespread. Judges can authorize employment for children under 14 when they feel
 it appropriate. (The ILO noted in 1992 that the Constitutional provision for appren-
 ticeships under age 14 is not in accordance with ILO Convention No. 5 on minimum
 age in industry.) By law, the permission of the parents or guardians is required for
 minors to work, and provision must be made for them to attend school through the
 primary grades. All minors are barred from night work and from work that con-
 stitutes a physical strain. Minors are also prohibited from employment in
 unhealthful, dangerous, or morally harmful conditions.
 Despite these legal restrictions, however, official figures state that nearly 3 mil-
 lion children, 10 to 14 years of age (or 4.6 percent of the work force), were employed.
 Of these, 46.4 percent worked 8 hours or more per da , while 96.3 percent of this
 group received not more than the minimum salary. Te ILO has received reports
 alleging that millions of children arc subjected to forced labor.
 In late 1992, the ILO began the "IPEC" project to move children out of the Brazil-
 ian workforce. A draft report prepared under this project in 1993 indicated that
 some 40 percent of the employees of independent shoe manufacturers in Franca (Sao
 Paulo state) were children under 14, employed in violation of the law. The approxi-
 mately 1,000 independent contractors employ up to 20 percent of the 35,000 workers
 in the Franca shoe industry. Among this 20 percent, researchers found some 2,000
 children under 14 years of age. Most are exposed at work to poisonous and addictive
 fumes from shoe glue. From January 1992 through January 1993, a further 397
 
 
 children from 13 to 14 years of age were authorized by courts to work in Franca
 shoe factories. According to figures cited in the report, 45 percent of Franca's 1992
 cottage industry shoe production was exported to the United States and elsewhere.
 A June 1993 agreement by manufacturers to eliminate these child workers did not
 prove effective.
 A 3-year study of sugar cane production in Pernambuco state found that 30 per-
 cent of the work frce was made u p of children and adolescents from 7 to 17 years
 of age, many cutting cane with machetes. About 10 percent of the sugar is exported.
 Specific reports of minors working illegally were also noted frmRio de Janeiro
 and Sao Paulo (street vendors), Rio de Janeiro (nightclubs), Bahia and Sao Paulo
 (sugar cane harvesting) and Rio Grande do Sul (tree resin extraction and logging).
 Although defenders of tie current situation assrted that economic conditions often
 compel children to contribute income to their families, research undertaken for the
 ILO indicated that the subminimum wages of such children have little if any effect
 on their economic condition. Further, the employment largely or completely elimi-
 nates any chance for education and for subsequent economic improvement.
 Enforcement of child labor laws is severely limited because the Ministry of Labor,
 the responsible agency, deploys too few inspctors and is influenced by a widely held
 view that it is better for minors to work than to be involved in street crime.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-As of July 1993, the national minimum wage
 was adjusted every month. Based on exchange rates at the end of month, when most
 workers are paid, the minimum wage was $63.66 in November 1993, and $58.46 in
 December. The Interunion Department for Socioeconomic Studies and Statistics esti-
 mated that the minimum wage is less than one-fifth of the minimum necessary
 (based on a standard set by the 1988 Constitution) to support a family of four. The
 most recently available national survey (for 1990) showed that 35 percent of eco-
 nomically active individuals, including minors from 10 to 14 years of age, earned
 no more than the minimum wage. Many workers particularly outside the regulated
 economy and in the northeast, reportedly earned less than the minimum wage.
 The 1988 Constitution limits the workweek to 44 hours and specifies a weekly
 rest period, "preferably on Sundays." This rest period is for 24 consecutive hours.
 The Constitution expanded pay and fringe benefits and established new protections
 for agricutural and domestic workers; however, not all of its provisions have been
 enforced.
 Many Brazilian workers suffer from unsafe working conditions. Occupational
 health and safety standards are set by the Fundacentro, which is under the Min-
 istry of Labor. Enforcement of these standards is inconsistent because the Ministry
 deploys insufficient resources for adequate inspection and enforcement.
 There were also credible allegations of corruption within the enforcement system.
 If a worker has a problem in the workplace and has trouble getting relief directly
 from his employer, he or his union can file a claim with the regional labor court,
 although in practice this is frequently a cumbersome, protracted process.
 Brazilian law requires the establishment in work places of Internal Commissions
 for Accident Prevention. Employee members of these commissions are protected
 under law from being fired for commission activities. Such firings, however, do
 occur, and legal recourse usually requires years for resolution. Incomplete figures
 for workplace accidents and fatalities in 1992 (authorities estimate they have 92
 percent of the data) showed 512,292 reported accidents, of which 3,390 were fatal
 and 16,706 caused permanent disabilities. These data undoubtedly understate the
 problem, because they only measure about one-half the workers in a work force of
 approximately 64.5 million.
