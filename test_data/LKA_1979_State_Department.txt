 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka is a multi-party democracy with a strong commit-
 ment to political liberties and social and economic justice.
 There have been nine national elections since independence in
 1948 and the government has changed hands six times. It pres-
 ently has an executive presidential system with a parliament
 and an independent judiciary. The resources of this predomi-
 nantly agricultural country have been largely devoted to wel-
 fare, education, land reclamation and redistribution efforts
 with the result that many of the social and economic needs of
 the people are met to a surprising degree for a country with
 its limited resources.
 Nevertheless with population doubling since the end of WWII to
 14.5 million, there are strains and tensions. Chief among
 these is the rivalry between the majority Sinhalese community
 and the minority Ceylon Tamils which dates back centuries and
 has led to several serious communal outbreaks since independ-
 ence. This has been characterized by charges and counter
 charges of unfair advantage of one community over the other
 and has led to a Tamil demand for an independent state in the
 northern and eastern portions of the country. The government
 seeks programs and policies to meet the needs of all communi-
 ties on the island. Communalism has also led to a number of
 terrorist activities that prompted the establishment of a
 state of emergency and attendant regulations in a northern
 district and to a stringent nationwide anti-terrorism bill.
 There have been recent allegations of human rights abuses.
 These charges are under investigation by the Government.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Free-
 dom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is specifically prohibited by the Constitution of Sri
 Lanka. The Government declared a state of emergency in the
 northern district of Jaffna in July 1979 following a series
 of murders of policemen and other crimes of violence imputed
 to a Tamil terrorist group seeking to promote an independent
 Tamil state. The Emergency was withdrawn in December 1979.
 Shortly thereafter, the mutilated bodies of two young men
 were found and the Tamil United Liberation Fï¿½ont (TULF) poli-
 tical party charged-the police with these killings as well as
 with the death of another man in a prison hospital and the pre-
 sumed death of three others who are missing. These charges
 are under investigation by the authorities and by a select
 committee of Parliament. Subsequently in a letter to the
 President and several times in Parliament, the TULF charged
 that police and army security forces in Jaffna are torturing
 citizens picked up for questioning and harassing and detain-
 ing relatives of wanted persons. The Government states that
 it does not condone violence and ill treatment by anyone, that
 security forces have been ordered to maintain exemplary conduct
 and that the allegations would be investigated. No results
 of any investigation have yet been released or charges
 brought.

 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 In addition to charges made in regard to the emerqency in Jaffna,
 there are periodic complaints of police brutality in other
 instdnces. There have been no known flagrant cases proved
 recently. Attorneys have informed the Department of State
 that in proven cases, disciplinary action is taken.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Constitution specifically provides that no person shall be
 arrested, held in custody, imprisoned or detained except in
 accordance with the law. The code of criminal procedure re-
 quires that an arrested person be brought before a magistrate
 within 24 hours and permits the magistrate to authorize deten-
 tion. For certain crimes, an accused person can be detained
 up to three months without bail and longer if the high court
 so rules. In additioh to the state of emergency in Jaffna,
 the Government also enacted a stringent nationwide anti-terror-
 ism bill. The emergency regulations provided and anti-terror-
 ism law providesfor preventive detention. This is not appeal-
 able to the courts but may be reviewed by a presidentially
 appointed advisory board. For certain offenses under the
 emergency regulations suspects could be detained 14 days be-
 fore a court appearance. The regulations also provided for
 unlimited detention after committal by a magistrate. Under
 the anti-terrorism law, the police may detain a person for 72
 hours before court appearance. A magistrate must remand a per-
 son if police so request and the attorney general's consent is
 needed for release.
 Such preventive detention may be authorized for three months
 and can be renewed incrementally up to 18 months. The Govern-
 ment stated in Parliament in early November that 59 persons
 were under detention in Jaffna, both Tamil and Sinhalese.
 Under the Sri Lankan Constitution and the ordinary law, per-
 sons arrested have the right of access to legal counsel. The
 TULF charges, however, that under the emergency in Jaffna coun-
 sel is not allowed to see detainees.
 According to Amnesty International, eight Tamils remain impris-
 oned, awaiting trial, who were arrested in September, 1978 for
 distributing leaflets.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Both the Constitution and the law provide that persons are en-
 titled to a fair trial in a competent court, to be represented
 by counsel, and to be informed of the charges against them and
 to have access to the evidence against them. Trial by jury is
 customary in Sri Lanka although anti-terrorism legislation pro-
 vides for trial by justices on grounds that juries in such
 cases can be intimidated.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Search or arrest warrants are required to enter premises in
 ordinary circumstances. Under the anti-terrorism act and emer-
 gency regulations, search warrants are not required. The TULF
 has charged in Parliament that some homes have been ransacked
 during searches. Information available from various
 sources, however, indicates that abuses have not been common.

 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Since independence in 1948, the government has consistently
 implemented policies aimed at meeting the vital needs of
 food, shelter, health care and education. It has done this
 through a variety of direct subsidies to the people, support
 programs for producers, control of prices and free education
 through the university level. As a result, literacy approxi-
 mates 80 percent, average life expectancy is 68 years, there
 is relatively low maternal and infant mortality for a develop-
 ing country and a fairly equitable distribution of the land.
 The economy is predominantly rural and agricultural, with
 per capita income around $200. Roughly 60 percent of industry
 is owned by the government, but the trend is to release more
 of this to the private sector. Economic liberalization in
 the last two years has significantly increased business acti-
 vity and has added approximately 200,000 jobs. Heavy emigra-
 tion to the Mideast and Nigeria has also reduced unemployment
 which up till 1975 affected up to 25 percent of the labor
 force and up to 50 percent of those in the -15-19 year old age
 group. These rates are now considerably lower, but there is
 still severe underemployment or disguised unemployment.
 Liberalized economic policy is also widening the income
 gap between the moneyed and the needy. Overall, however,
 income distribution is relatively even; the poorest 40 percent
 of spending units, adjusted for family size, reportedly re-
 ceived 25 percent of total income in 1975. The Government
 has just moved to help lower-income earners by arbitrarily
 decreeing a 55 rupee per month wage increase to all those
 receiving less than 1500 rupees. The tax system is largely
 regressive; progressive income tax accounts for only a mini-
 scule part of government revenue. Property is privately owned
 and is protected.
 Health care is widely distributed but suffers from shortages
 of paramedical personnel. This and other human needs provi-
 sions are especially short in underdeveloped "bush" regions
 and in tea estates where Indian Tamils live and work (see
 Section 3c). Symptoms of acute poverty are evident there.
 Education is free but is skimpy in many rural areas. In gene-
 ral, vital human needs are not seriously hindered by corrup-
 tion. News media are relatively active in denouncing abuses.
 The demands on services in a number of areas are greater than
 the system can meet. In this context, the Tamil minority com-
 munity alleges discrimination in university placement, employ-
 ment and land settlement schemes. The majority Sinhalese com-
 munity argues in turn that the Tamils traditionally enjoyed a
 disproportionate share of these. The Government has acknow-
 ledged a decline in Tamil hiring in the public sector but
 states its determination to correct the situation. The Govern-
 ment also seeks to devise equitable educational and land dis-
 tribution policies to meet the needs of all communities of
 Sri Lanka.

 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 A. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, publication, religion and assembly are
 guaranteed by the Constitution. The Constitution gives
 Buddhism a preferred position as the official religion but
 there is no indication that this inhibits free practice of
 other religions.
 The Government controls two of four major newspaper groups
 and owns the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. Such con-
 trol constrains the degree of criticism against the Govern-
 ment. There are a wide range of smaller publications --
 daily, weekly and monthly -- which often are organs of poli-
 tical parties. While these independent publications complain
 of government pressures to curtail criticism, there is never-
 theless an active expression of differing views in the press.
 Direct censorship exists under anti-terrorism legislation and,
 earlier, under emergency regulations in Jaffna, and may be in-
 voked regarding anti-terrorism investigations, security re-
 lated matters and incitements to violence or communal or
 other group disharmony. Distribution of publications can also
 be banned when emergency regulations are in effect. Direct
 censorship and banning of distribution have been invoked in
 several instances. A Parliamentary Privileges Act also exists
 which can be invoked if Parliament considers it has been im-
 pugned in the press.
 Freedom of assembly is not restricted; political and other
 rallies may be held in public places, subject to permits, but
 no political party is allowed to hold political processions
 or street demonstrations. The anti-terrorism legislation per-
 mits authorities to restrict employment or business or associa-
 tion and communication of a person for the purposes of prevent-
 ing any action deemed prejudicial under the law.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement within the country and the right to choose
 one's place of residence are guaranteed by the Constitution
 and permitted in practice. Regulations in Jaffna permitted
 competent authorities to restrict travel of suspected persons.
 Ordinarily foreign travel and travel within country are not
 restricted.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Sri Lanka is a multi-party democracy with an executive presi-
 dency and a parliament. Universal adult suffrage was initi-
 ated in 1931 and power has changed hands six times since inde-
 pendence in open and peaceful political elections. Opposition
 parties function freely and have access to the media although
 they complain in their own publications of the degree of cov-
 erage given them in government-controlled press. No political
 parties are banned, although all must meet certain qualifica-
 tions to appear on the ballot as acknowledged parties.
 The major group without citizenship in Sri Lanka is Indian
 Tamils, who constitute about 9% of the population and were
 tea estate workers who originally came from South India in the
 nineteenth and early 20th centuries. The Indian Tamils were
 
 
 827
 largely disenfranchised in 1948 and 1949 through stringent
 citizenship acts. A bilateral agreement between India and
 Sri Lanka in 1964 provided for a gradual, simultaneous proc-
 ess of repatriation to India for some and the granting of
 Sri Lankan citizenship for others. By mid-1979, 306,000
 had been repatriated and 145,000 had become Sri Lanka citi-
 zens. The Constitution of 1978 extended basic freedoms to
 this group for the first time.
 Women have equal suffrage, equality before the law and equal
 property and inheritance rights. Women are involved in
 most walks of economic, social, cultural, and educational life,
 but the majority, particularly in rural areas, tend to follow
 traditional roles. Women have a higher school
 dropout rate, lower wages for equal work, and a hiqher unemplov-
 ment rate among the educated. Although sex discrimination
 is banned by the Constitution, it exists in Sri Lanka in
 various forms, as in the 25 percent ceiling on employment of
 women in the public administration.
 There are more than 1500 registered trade unions in Sri Lanka.
 Unions under the law have the right to organize, strike, bar-
 gain collectively and lobby. In 1979, however, the Govern-
 ment passed an essential public services law which forbids
 strikes or other actions impeding the work of certain govern-
 ment departments, public corporations, local authorities and
 cooperative societies which the government may designate as
 providing essential public services. The law provides stiff
 penalties for employees or others convicted in court of
 impeding or delaying such services or encouraging others to
 do so. Opposition trade unions and political parties strong-
 ly opposed the law. The legislation was challenged in court
 and the Supreme Court ruled that certain punishments mandated
 were in violation of the Constitution. The Government then
 revised the legislation to leave the imposition of these
 punishments to the discretion of the court.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 An Amnesty International foreign representative investigated
 allegations of human rights violations in the Jaffna district
 under the emergency; met with appropriate government offi-
 cials; and apparently received their cooperation;
