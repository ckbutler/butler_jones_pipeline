 UZBEKISTAN
 The Republic of Uzbekistan became independent in September 1991 after the
 breakup of the Soviet Union. Little progress has been made in the transition from
 Uzbekistan's authoritarian Soviet legacy toward a more pluralistic democracy. Polit-
 ical life is dominated by President Islam Karimov and the highly centralized execu-
 tive branch which serves him.
 The National Democratic Party of Uzbekistan (NDPU) is the dominant party, in
 many respects the successor to the former Communist party, and it is controlled by
 the President. Only one other party, the Fatherland Progress Party, is legally reg-
 istered. It was created by a presidential advisor, apparently to give the semblance
 of a multiparty system. The Government continued severely to repress genuine op-
 position parties and movements, despite its frequently stated commitment to
 multiparty democracy. It justifies its repressive policy by invoking the specter of Is-
 lamic fundamentalism and the civil strife that has plagued neighboring Tajikistan.
 The National Security Service (formerly the Committee for State Security, or
 KGB) deals with a broad range of national security questions and is no longer the
 dominant instrument of domestic control that it was during the years of Soviet
 domination. The Ministry of the Interior prosecutes domestic crimes and plays the
 lead role in pursuing political cases against opposition figures. It has primary re-
 sponsibility for maintaining the Government's control over society and, in this role,
 was responsible for various human rights abuses.
 The economy is based primarily on agriculture and agricultural processing;
 Uzbekistan is the world's fourth largest producer of cotton. It also has large deposits
 of gold, strategic minerals, gas, and oil. The Government has proclaimed its commit-
 ment to a gradual transition to a free market eonomy. By the end of 1993, most
 state-owned apartments and a number of small enterprises had been privatized, but
 the majority of enterprises remained in state hands. Government subsidies on most
 basic consumer goods were ended in 1993, except for those on bread, flour, and some
 energy products. Most other prices were freed. Spiraling inflation throughout the
 ruble zone, including Uzbekistan, contributed to a serious decline in the population's
 ability to make ends meet. Unwilling to agree to Russian requirements on the fu-
 ture operations of the ruble zone, Uzbekistan left the zone in November, necessitat-
 ing the introduction of a transition currency, the som-coupon.
 Introduction of a new national currency, the som, is expected some time in 1994.
 Government observance of human rights moved backward compared to 1992. Sup-
 pression of opposition political parties and movements increased. Beatings of several
 prominent opposition leaders, similar to beatings in 1992, occurred in ways that
 suggested government involvement. Security forces frequently detained or arrested
 
 
 1138
 opposition activists on trumped-up charges. The Government tried two political dis-
 sidents on charges of insulting the President's honor. Both trials ended in guilty ver-
 dicts, although the defendants were released under presidential amnesty.
 To control the political arena, the Government used a requirement that political
 parties, like all other social gups, be officially registered. It denied registration to
 some political groups and other associations. It required groups that were already
 registered to reregister in what appeared to be an effort to close down the most seri-
 ous opposition groups. Unsanctioned public meetings and demonstrations were
 banned. Although expressly prohibited by the Constitution, press censorship was
 pervasive, and freedom of expression was also further reduced by an atmosphere of
 repression which made it increasingly difficult to criticize the Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known instances of politi-
 cally motivated killings nor any reports of deaths in official custody from unnatural
 causes.
 Former Vice President Shukrullo Mirsaidov, a political rival of President
 Karimov, survived an apparent assassination attempt when his car was exploded by
 a bomb on August 24. As was the case in most other attacks and beatings of opposi-
 tion activists no one was ever arrested or prosecuted for the bombing. The Govern-
 ment claimed that its investigation of the bombing revealed that the car did not be-
 long to Mirsaidov. While this was technically true, the car was being used by
 Mirsaidov as his own personal vehicle had been confiscated by the Government.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed abductions or politically motivated
 disappearances. However, the whereabouts of Abdulla Uttaev, Chairman of the
 banned Islamic Renaissance Party, are still unknown. Unidentified gunmen forced
 him into a car on December 15, 1992. Although it is widely believed that he is in
 official custody, the Government denies holding him.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were credible reports that police often beat political detainees and criminal
 suspects while taking them into custody or in the period between arrest and trial.
 Continuing a pattern from 1992, several opposition figures were beaten in the
 streets in 1993 by persons who were never caught or prosecuted. The circumstances
 suggested a calculated effort by government officials to intimidate the opposition.
 The most serious of these incidents occurred on September 18 when unknown as-
 sailants severely beat former Vice President Shukrullo Mirsaidov. He suffered a bro-
 ken rib, internal injuries, and open head wounds. The May 5 beating of Shukrat
 Ismatullaev, Cochairman of the Birlik (Unity) movement, closely resembled the as-
 sault in June 1992 on Birlik's other Cochairman, Abdurahim Pulatov; Ismatullaev,
 too, was attacked in the street and beaten, sustaining skull fractures. On October
 4, four unidentified men attacked Samat Murad, chief secretary of the Erk (Free-
 dom) Party, near the train station in Karshi, beating him unconscious. When he re-
 gained consciousness after several hours, theyagain beat him unconscious. On De-
 cember 7, in an apparent attempt to prevent Mamura Usmanova, head of the Birlik
 women's organization, Tumaris, from traveling to a human rights conference in
 Bishkek, assailants broke into her apartment. They held her and her daughter at
 knifepoint while they beat her husband seriously with brass knuckles.
 Prison conditions are inadequate and worse for male than for female prisoners.
 Due to limited resources prison overcrowding is a problem.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, etention, or Exile.-Laws on detention have not changed
 since independence. According to the law, police may hold a person suspected of
 committing a crime for up to 3 days. At the end of this period, the suspect must
 be either officially charged or released. A procurator's order is required for arrests
 but not for detentions.A court case must be scheduled within 15 days of the arrest,
 and the defendant may be detained during this period. A defendant may not have
 access to counsel while in detention but only after formal arrest.
 The legal provision permitting detention without the filing of charges led to doz-
 ens of cases in which opposition figures were detained for questioning and then re-
 leased without prosecution. The Government used this provision to harass and re-
 strict the actions of opposition figures. For example, government authorities on April
 29 detained several opposition activists, putting them under house arrest to prevent
 them from attending an April 30 conference in Almaty the capital of Kazakhstan.
 During the April 21-22 visit to Uzbekistan of Swedish Foreign Minister and Chair-
 man-in-office of the Conference on Securit and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) Af
 Ugglas, several opposition activists were detained to prevent them from attending
 a meeting scheduled at her request. They were released following the delegation's
 
 
 1139
 departure. Similarly, when American Ambassador at Large Strobe Talbott visited
 Tashkent on September 13-14, law enforcement officials prevented participation of
 two opposition activists, although several others were allowed to attend.
 In addition to the beating of Mamura Usmanova's family to prevent her participa-
 tion in the December 8-9 human rights conference in Bishkek, several other activ-
 ists planning to attend the Bishkek conference were detained in Tashkent by the
 militia on December 7. Similarly, during a private visit of Zbigniew Brzezinski, sev-
 eral opposition activists were detained to prevent their participation in a scheduled
 December 13 roundtable discussion.
 In some cases, opposition figures were charged with offenses unrelated to their
 criticism of government policy, such as drunkenness, drug possession, or disorderli-
 ness. Punishment for political activities was the likely motive behind the arrests of
 Inamjan Tursonov and Pulat Akhunov. Tursonov, regional chairman of the Erk
 Party in the Fergana district and a former deputy in the Uzbekistan Parliament,
 was sentenced in February to 2 years in prison on trumped-up charges of
 hooliganism. After what appears to have been a manipulated street fight, Akhunov,
 regional chairman of Birlik in the Andijan region was found guilty of hooliganism
 in 1992 and sentenced to a year and a half in jail. In July 1993, while still in jail,
 he was accused of having narcotics in his prison cell and sentenced to an additional
 3 years in prison.
 e. Denialof Fair Public Trial.-Under the Constitution, the President appoints all
 judges for 10-year terms. They may be removed for crimes or failure to fulfill their
 obligations. Power to remove judges for failure to fulfill their obligations rests with
 the President, except for Supreme Court judges, whose removal must also be con-
 firmed by Parliament. No judges are known to have been removed for political rea-
 sons. In political cases, government direction influences the judiciary.
 Uzbekistan still uses the Soviet judiciary system which features trial by a panel
 of three judges: one professional judge andtwo "people's assessors" who are chosen
 by the workers' collectives for a period of 2Y2 years. The professional judge presides
 and directs the proceedings.
 There is a three-tiered court system: the people's court on the district level, the
 regional courts, and the Supreme Court. District court decisions may be appealed
 to the next higher level within 10 days of the ruling. The new draft criminal code
 reduces the list of crimes punishable by death to murder, espionage, and treason,
 eliminating the economic crimes punishable by death in the former Soviet code.
 Officially, most trials are open to the public but may be closed in exceptional
 cases, such as those involving state secrets, rape, or young defendants. During 1993,
 however, the militia frequently prevented interested persons, such as human rights
 monitors, journalists, and diplomats, from observing court proceedings in political
 cases. On January 19, a U.S. Embassy officer sent as an observer was ejected from
 the courtroom of the Supreme Court while proceedings examining the legality of the
 opposition movement Birlik were under way. This happened again on May 27 dur-
 ing the trial of former Vice President Mirsaidov, who was convicted of having mis-
 used his former office. Although granted amnesty, his conviction disqualified him
 from ever running for President.
 Defendants have the right to attend the proceedings, confront witnesses, and
 present evidence. The State will provide a lawyer without charge, but by law the
 accused has the right to hire an attorney. In some political cases, lawyers were de-
 nied access to their clients. For example, Babur Shakirov, accused of treason in con-
 nection with the alleged plan to create an alternative Parliament, the Melli Majlis,
 rejected the lawyer appointed by the authorities and chose Sergei Kotov, a lawyer
 from Russia. However, the procurator refused to meet with Kotov, and thus he was
 never recognized as the defendant's lawyer. When Kotov tried to file a formal pro-
 test, police detained and expelled him.
 In the trial of Abdumannob Pulatov, charged in January with insulting the honor
 of the President, the lawyer he chose, Yuri Schmidt, also from Russia, was initially
 refused permission to defend Pulatov. Because permission was finally granted only
 on the day the case opened, he did not have the opportunity to review the docu-
 ments in the case.
 Detainees deemed not to be violent may be released on their own recognizance
 pending trial. No money need be posted as bond, but in such cases the accused must
 usually sign a pledge not to leave the city.
 The Government denies that there are any political prisoners in Uzbekistan. How-
 ever, by all evidence, the Government does hold political prisoners. The defendants
 detained during 1993 for the Melli Majiis trial were political prisoners, although fol-
 lowing the trial all were granted amnesty and released. .n the cases of Pulat
 Akhunov and Inamjan Tursonov, circumstances suggest they are political prisoners
 
 
 1140
 (see Section 1.d.). There is not enough information available to determine whether
 other prisoners are jailed for political offenses.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-By law,
 search warrants issued by a procurator are required. There does not appear to be
 a legal mechanism for authorizing telephone tapping or monitoring. There is no di-
 rect relationship between the procurator's office and the security services. However,
 it is very likely that they cooperate to the extent that the procurator would issue
 search warrants at the request of the security services. There is no provision for ju-
 dicial review of search warrants. Security agencies nonetheless monitor telephone
 calls, and there is evidence that they employ surveillance and wiretap telephones
 in the cases of persons involved in opposition political activities. Certain high-profile
 opposition activists were the subject of very visible surveillance, including round-
 the-clock police monitoring of all movements. In several cases this intense surveil-
 lance was the prelude either to arrest or a street-beating incident.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech, already severely limited,
 was further restricted in 1993. The fear of expressing views critical of the President
 and Government increased as the Government widened its general crackdown on all
 forms of opposition. A February 15, 1991 law (before independence) against "offend-
 ing the honor and dignity of the President" limits the ability to criticize the Presi-
 dent. In 1993 the Government tried two cases under this law in the Supreme Court.
 A poetess, Vasilya Inayatova, was foun- guilty in February of insulting the Presi-
 dent's honor through publication of a poem, "A last letter to the President," which
 expressed her anguish about political violence and her desire for democracy. She
 was sentenced to 2 years in prison but then granted amnesty under a presidential
 decree. Abdumannob Pulatov, chairman of the Human Rights Association, was tried
 in January on the same charge, based on his purported involvement in making a
 poster insulting to the President, which was used in a student demonstration in
 January 1992. In clearly manipulated proceedings, Pulatov was found guilty and
 sentenced to 3 years in prison but freed on amnesty.
 Although the Constitution prohibits censorship, it is widely practiced, and the
 Government tolerates little, if any, criticism of its actions. Newspapers may not be
 printed without the censor's approval. Journalists and writers who want to ensure
 that their work is published report that they practice self-censorship.
 The majority of Uzbekistan's newspapers are government owned and controlled;
 the key papers are organs of government ministries. State enterprises control the
 printing presses. Newspapers must be registered with the Government to receive
 permission to publish. The opposition movement Birlik was never granted permis-
 sion to register its newspapers. During 1992, issues it published in Russia and
 "smuggled into Uzbekistan were confiscated as contraband. By 1993 Birlik had
 ceased attempting to publish a newspaper.
 The last opposition newspaper to be published was the paper of the Erk Party.
 Although censors often deleted entire articles, it continued to publish in 1992. In
 January 1993, however, the newspaper was banned altogether and has not been
 published since then. In November the editors and the key bookkeeers of the erk
 newspaper were put on trial for "misappropriating government funds in connection
 with an investigation on charges that they had not properly paid honoraria to all
 contributors. Erk activists claim that the charges were totally trumped up as the
 Government had never provided economic assistance to the newspaper, and so only
 private party funds were involved.
 The Government also censored material in locally printed editions of newspapers
 originating in the Russian Federation and forbade the distribution of foreign news-
 papers and publications critical of Uzbekistan. The publication of the local editions
 of Izvestia and Pravda and the sale of the Moscow edition remained suspended
 throughout 1993. In June all newspapers, magazines, and weeklies had to undergo
 reregistration, which includes providing information about the source of funding,
 means of distribution, founders, and sponsors. Simultaneously, by resolution of the
 Cabinet of Ministers, private persons and journalists' collectives were banned from
 founding newspapers or magazines.
 Television broadcasting is state controlled. Although there are local stations in
 various regions, nationwide programming is on two state-run channels that fully
 support the Government and its policies. Through an agreement with Russia, two
 Moscow channels are broadcast as well. The Russian channels are Ostankino and
 Russian Television (Rossiskaya Televideniya). It appears that Ostankino's programs
 play uncensored. The more liberal Rossiskaya Televideniya sometimes abruptly and
 without advance notice has its programming replaced by Turkish television in what
 many interpret to be censorship of its programming. Radio Liberty and the Voice
 
 
 1141
 of America are among the few sources of uncontrolled news, although there is evi-
 dence that these broadcasts are jammed by the Government.
 There are no private publishing houses, and government approval is required for
 all publications. In an attempt to circumvent the requirements of state-controlled
 publishi   Erk party supporters had a booklet by party Chairman Mohammed
 Solikh pu lished in Almaty. After border authorities discovered copies of the book,
 those involved were questioned, and 15,000 copies already in Tashkent were con-
 fiscated.
 Political repression enveloped academia as well. During 1992 and 1993, various
 figures from Birlik and Erk were fired from their academic positions because of
 their political activities or beliefs. Leaders of the Erk Party estimate that some 100
 party members were forced from their jobs for political reasons. Among Birlik activ-
 ists, Shukhrat Ismatullaev and Marat Zakhidov were both dismissed from their jobs
 at Tashkent State University, Talib Yakubov was fired from the Tashkent State
 Pedagogical Institute, and Yadgr Obid and Gulchekhra Nurallaeva from the Writ-
 ers' Union. While at one time it appeared that the Government might permit inde-
 pendent academic institutions, it refused to register the independent, private
 Tashkent International Business University, and in September attempted to shut
 it down on the grounds that it was functioning without a license. Students were no-
 tifedh   tathey should go to other universities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assodiation.-Freedom of assembly is not
 guaranteed. The Government must sanction demonstrations and does not routinely
 grant this permission. The 1992 Constitution states that the authorities have the
 right to suspend or ban rallies, meetings, and demonstrations on security grounds.
 Aer cordons of militia prevented attempts to hold unsanctioned demonstrations in
 1992, the opposition made no attempt to hold ublic meetings during 1993.
 The Government also limited the exercise of freedom of association by refusing to
 register opposition political parties and movements. The Constitution provides no
 general guarantees of freedom of association; it places broad limitations on the types
 of  Iups that may form and requires that all organizations be formally registered
 with the Government. The Government frequently and seemingly without legal
 basis denies such registration to groups in any way opposed to the established
 order. To be considered a public association, organizations must be registered in ac-
 cordance with the procedure prescribed by law.
 To register, a party must submit a list of at least 3,000 members and meet other
 requirements, such as providing an official address. Government control over build-
 ings and office space limits the ability of unofficial groups to get an official address.
 The Government has repeatedly denied the Birlik movement permission to register
 as a party, first claiming irreularities on its membership list, then complaining
 about the group's name, and ally noting its lack of an official address. The Su-
 preme Court on January 19 suspended all activities of Birlik for 3 months on
 charges that the movement's leaders failed to observe its charter, that they had in-
 tended to hold officially forbidden demonstrations, and that 166 members of the
 group had been detained and 20 had criminal charges lodged against them. Birlik
 was accused of holding 29 meetings and rallies during 1992, 14 without obtaining
 permission.
 A Cabinet of Miedcef March 12, 1993, required all public organizations
 and political parties officially registered in Uzbekistan to reregister b October 1,
 1993, or be suspended. This decree provided a quasi-legal mechanism for the elimi-
 nation of various organizations that were already registered. The mainstream
 NDPU and Fatherland Progress Party applied for and quickly received their rereg-
 istration. The Erk Party did not submit papers, holding that the decree was uncon-
 stitutional as only the Supreme Court has the right to withdraw registration. Al-
 though the Birlik movement attempted to submit reregistration papers, the Min-
 istry of Justice did not accept their papers. The Government considers bth the Erk
 Party and the Birlik movement to have officially lost their registration.
 Nonpolitical associations and social organizations usually do not encounter com-
 parable difficulties in registering, although an independent ecological organization
 and several foreign humanitarian assistance groups found it difficult to obtain reg-
 istration.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution,
 as is the principle of separation of religion and state. After the enforced atheism
 of the Soviet period, relgious communties are experiencing a significant revival.
 Mosques long closed during Soviet role are reopening, and many new ones are being
 built. While before independence there were less than 100 working mosques in
 Uzbekistan, by the le of 1993 there were approximately 5,000. Religious edu-
 cation is becoming more widespread, although it is not included in state schools.
 
 
 1142
 
 While Islam is the religion of the majority, ethnic minorities may also practice
 their religion in relative freedom. Synagogues for the Jewish community are openly
 functioning; Hebrew education, long banned under the Soviets, Jewish cultural
 events and the publication of a community newspaper take place undisturbed. In
 1993 the German Lutheran Church, built in 1899 and closed by Stalin in 1937, was
 returned to the German community. Permission was granted to the Roman Catholic
 Church for the reconstruction of the Polish cathedral built during World War I and
 subsequently destroyed, and a reconsecration ceremony took place in 1993.
 A December 1991 amendment to the law on political parties bans those of a reli-
 gious nature. This principle is cited for denying registration to religious parties, in-
 cludin the Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP).
 Fearing the destabilizing influence of extremist Islamic forces, the Government
 has tried to temper the extent of this spiritual renaissance by controlling the Is-
 lamic hierarchy, the content of the Imam's sermons, and the extent and substance
 of Islamic materials published in Uzbekistan. In March Mufti Mohammad-Sadiq
 Mohammad-Yusuf was ousted from his position as leader of Uzbekistan's Islamic
 community in a government effort to place a more compliant and less political lead-
 er in the position of Mufti. Mufti Mohammad-Yusuf, fearing that he would be tried
 on trumped-up criminal charges, fled the country to Saudi Arabia in July. The new
 Mufti, Mukhtar Abdullaev, was the leader of the Naqshibandi Sufi sect's shrine out-
 side of Bukhara.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for free movement within the country and
 across its borders. However, foreign travel is still restricted by difficulties in obtain-
 ing an overseas passport and by a law that requires all citizens to have an exit visa.
 Local authorities frequently withhold passports for political and administrative rea-
 sons to prevent persons from making short trips abroad, including some individuals
 selected to participate in official exchange programs. Others allegedly received their
 passports or exit visas only after paying bribes. Government authorities frequently
 withhold exit visas when they do not approve of the travel purposes. Those who
 leave without an exit visa may be subject to severe penalties upon return.
 Most barriers to emigration were lifted before the Soviet breakup. Although in
 some instances emigrants are delayed by long waits for passports and exit visas, po-
 tential emigrants who can find a host country willing to accept them are able to
 leave the country. Since independence, a significant number of non-Uzbeks, includ-
 irg Russians, Jews, Ukrainians and others have emigrated, although no exact fig-
 ures are available. These people have not left because of any systematic human
 rights abuses but rather because of what they fear will be limited future economic
 and social prospects for non-Uzbeks. This emigration appears to have slowed consid-
 erably in 1993, compared to 1992.
 The travel of local citizens within Uzbekistan is not controlled, unlike travel by
 foreigners, including journalists. Visitors must have each city they wish to visit
 noted in their visa. Travel to some sensitive areas of the country, particularly the
 environmentally degraded Aral Sea region and the Fergana valley, is controlled
 even more carefully; requests for travel to these areas are turned down in some
 cases. Even travel to nonsensitive tourist areas is unnecessarily complicated by in-
 ternal visa requirements, and tourists seeking to check into hotels without the ap-
 propriate internal visa often find themselves having to pay fines or bribes to the
 visa police first.
 The law on citizenship adopted in 1992 stipulates that citizens do not lose their
 citizenship if they reside overseas. However, as Uzbekistan does not provide for dual
 citizenship, those acquiring other citizenships will lose their citizenship in
 Uzbekistan. If they return to Uzbekistan as foreign citizens, they are subject to for-
 eign visa regulations. There is no evidence that anyone was denied permission to
 return.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens cannot exercise their right to change their government through peaceful
 and democratic means. Government measures severely repress opposition groups
 and individuals and apply harsh limits on freedom of expression.
 The Government's professed desire to create a multiparty democracy is belied by
 its actions against other parties since independence. The year 1993 was marked by
 an across-the-board crackdown by the Government on actual and potential opposi-
 tion groups and individuals. By the end of the year, there remained few individuals
 willing to challenge the Government's grip on power or even criticize it. The Govern-
 ment has sought to control the political process through widespread repression as
 well as legal requirements that all political parties and movements reregister. Re-
 
 
 1143
 
 strictions on public meetings and government control of information reinforced this
 central political control. Parliamentary elections have been announced for 1994, but
 the Government shows no intention of allowing truly free and fair multiparty elec-
 tions.
 Uzbekistan is ruled by a highly centralized presidency, comprising the President
 and a small inner circle of advisers and senior government officials. President
 Karimov, formerly the First Secretary of the Communist Party in Uzbekistan under
 Soviet rule, was elected in a limited multicandidate election in 1991. The election
 was marred by government control of the media and the Government's successful
 efforts to eliminate the candidacies of Karimov's rivals.
 The President is the Chairman of the National Democratic Party of Uzbekistan
 (NDPU), the country's largest party. Most government officials are also members of
 the NDPU, although it does not play the leading role in governance or cadre selec-
 tion that was played by the Communist party during the Soviet period. There are
 two other legally registered parties, the Fatherland Progress Party and the Erk
 Party. Other political groups such as Birlik, the People's Movement of Turkestan,
 and the Islamic Renaissance Party have been denied permission to register as par-
 ties. The Fatherland Progress Party was created as a loyal "constructive opposition"
 rarty in June 1992. Its existence provides the appearance of a multiparty system.
 It is headed by a presidential adviser, Usman Azimov, and supports the President
 politically. The party claims a platform that differs from that of the NDPU in that
 it seeks more rapid economic reform and development of conditions favorable to
 businessmen, but in fact it is of no real significance.
 Although it was formally registered from September 1991, the Erk Party came
 under significant pressure from the Government, and lost its registration in October
 1993. On April 13, law enforcement officials evicted the Erk Party from its head-
 quarters, forcing it to move to much smaller quarters on the outskirts of the city.
 On November 4, those new headquarters were formally shut down. Its leader, Mo-
 hammed Solikh, was accused of treason for his alleged involvement with the alter-
 native Parliament, the Melli Majlis. Solikh fled the country before his case could
 be brought to trial.
 Pressure on the Erk Party has included removing a number of Erk deputies (elect-
 ed to the Supreme Soviet in the February 1990 elections) from their parliamentary
 positions in 1993. While party chairman Solikh resigned in protest from the Su-
 preme Soviet in July 1992, Erk deputies Jahangir Mamedov, Murat Djuraev,
 Inamijan Tursunov, and Atajan Palvanov were removed from Parliament in 1993
 through means of questionable legality. Some were recalled by meetings of their
 constituents summoned for that purpose, and others gave in to threats that, if they
 did not resign, they would be expelled.
 The Supreme Soviet on September 3 approved the draft election law on its first
 reading. me law will provide the mechanism for electing the new 150-member Par-
 liament. The draft law in its present form is deficient in some respects, particularly
 in that it provides that, if a party wins less than 8 percent of the vote nationwide,
 all deputies elected from such a party will be excluded from Parliament, even if they
 are elected in their own single-member districts.
 Although women participate much less than men in government and politics,
 there are several female parliamentary deputies.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government disapproves of independent nongovernmental local human rights
 organizations and has restricted their operations. The Uzbekistan Human Rights
 Society, a local group organized in 1992, was denied permission to register. The
 Government regards international criticism of its human rights record as inter-
 ference in its internal affairs. Despite the fact that Uzbekistan is a signatory to the
 Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris, it refused entry to or expelled several
 international human rights monitoring delegations during 1993.
 On January 12, officials refused to permit a visit by a fact-finding team from the
 Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the CSCE, which
 was to investigate allegations of human rights violations, claiming the visit would
 be "interference in Uzbekistan's internal affairs." Under the requirements of CSCE
 membership, the Government is obliged to receive such visits.
 On several occasions, human rights activists or journalists who attempted to cover
 political trials were deported. Alexander Petrov, deputy head of Helsinki Watch's
 Moscow bureau, wits deported from Uzbekistan in January when he attempted to
 monitor the political trial of Abdumannob Pulatov. Helsinki Watch executive direc-
 tor Jeri Laber planned a May 4-5 visit to Tashkent as part of the group's efforts
 
 
 1144
 
 to monitor human rights in countries signatory to the Helsinki accords. Her request
 for a visa was turne[ down.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status.
 The 1992 law on citizenship and the Constitution prohibit discrimination on the
 basis of sex, religion, language, or social status, and officially sanctioned discrimina-
 tion does not occur.
 Women.-There is no de jure discrimination against women; women enjoy the
 same legal rights as men. Despite nominal equality under the law, however, women
 are severely underrepresented in high-level positions. Due to traditional roles,
 women usually marry young, bear many children, and confine their activities within
 the family. However, women are not ormally impeded from seeking a role in the
 workplace. In rural areas women often find themselves confined to backbreaking
 labor in the cotton fields. however, the barriers to equality for women are cultura,
 not legal, and women who open businesses or seek careers are not hindered. Spouse
 abuse certainly takes place in Uzbkistan, although it is less common among the
 more educated urban population. There is a perception that wife beating is consid-
 ered a personal, family affair rather than a criminal act, and thus such cases rarely
 come to court. A female journalist who has written on women's problems estimates
 that some 50 percent of the self-immolation suicides (of which there are several hun-
 dred each year in Uzbekistan) are related to seeking an escape from chronic beat-
 n                                            s.
 nhildren.-Uzbekistan has one of the highest birth rates in the former Soviet
 Union. Over half the Republics population is under the age of 15. Children's rights
 are explicitly protected by the Constitution (Article 64) which states that parents
 ito support and care for their children until they are of ae. The State
 and society will care for and educate orphaned children as well as children deprived
 of parental guardianship. According to the Constitution, able-bodied children are
 ob ied to care for their parents once they come of age.
 Nat ional Racial/ Ethnic Minorities.-In a population of about 22 million, official
 d~res indicate that 71 percent are Uzbeks, 8 percent Russian, 5 percent Tajik, 4
 p ercent Tatar, and 3 percent Kazakh. The real number of Tajiks is significantly
 higher, as many Tajiks have Uzbek written in their passports.
 Uzbekistan's citizenship law, passed in July 1992, does not impose language re-
 uirements for citizenship. Nonetheless, the language issue remains very sensitive.
 Uzbek has be en declared the state language, and the Constitution requires that the
 President must speak Uzbk. The Government decided in 1993 to introduce a Latin
 script to replace Cyrillic but has set no date for the change. Non-Uzbek speakers
 increasingly feel themselves threatened. Many report unpleasant experiences with
 their neighbors or in stores. When government organizations and academic institu-
 tions have been forced to cut back, it is frequently the Russian speakers who have
 lost their jobs. However, there is no clear evidence of a government effort to promote
 emigration by minority groups.
 People with Disabiitpes.-One of Uzbekistan's first laws, adopted only 2 months
 after independence in November 1991, was one guaranteeing sup     or invalids.
 This law was aimed at insuring the disabled the same rights as other people. How-
 ever, little effort is made to bring the disabled into the mainstream. Society does
 not accept them, and for the most part the disabled are kept out of sight, either
 at home or in institutions. The State cares for the mentally retarded in special
 homes. The Government has not mandated access for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Acording to the Constitution, trade unions express
 and protect the socioeconomic rights andinterests of the working people. The Con-
 stitution also promises citizens the right to work, the right to choose their occupa-
 tion, fair ondi'tions of labor, paid vacations, and protection against unemployment.
 The 1992 law on unions specifically proclaims that all workers have the right vol-
 untarily to form and join unions of their choice, that trade unions themselves may
 voluntarily associate territorially or sectoeraly, and that they may choose their own
 international affiliations. Membership in trade unionis s optional The law also de-
 claes all unions indenddent of the State's administrative and economic bodies (ex-
 cept where provided by law), and states that trade unions develop their own char-
 ters, structure and executive bodies and organize their own work.
 In practice, however, the overall structure of trade unions has not changed signifi-
 cantly since the Soviet period. Uzbokistan's independence has eliminated subordina-
 tion to Moscow but has not altered the centralized trade union hierarchy which re-
 mains dependent on the Government. No "alternative" central union structures

 exist. A few new professional associations and interest groups have been organized,
 such as a Union of Entrepreneurs, a Union of Renters, an Association of Private
 Physicians and Pharmacists, and one of lawyers. Their role and strength is as yet
 uncertain. Some of these groups hope to play a significant role in licensing and oth-
 erwise regulating the economic activity of their members.
 According to the law, the Council of the Federation of Trade Unions (CFTU) has
 a consultative voice in the preparation of all legislation affecting workers and is en-
 titled to draft laws on labor and social issues. Trade unions are legally described
 as organizations that defend the right to work and protect jobs. They have lost their
 previous role in state planning and in the management of enterprises. The emphasis
 now is on the unions responsibility for "social protection" and social justice-espe-
 cially unemployment compensation, pensions, and worker retraining.
 The trade union law does not cite a right to strike. In fact, strikes are not men-
 tioned in the law. However, the law does give the unions oversight over both indi-
 vidual and collective labor disputes, which are defined as those involving alleged
 violations of labor laws, worker rights, or collective agreements.
 There were no reports of strikes in 1993. Union and government officials alike as-
 sert that this reflects general support for the Government's policies and common in-
 terest in social stability. More cikely it reflects the absence of truly independent,
 representative trade unions ai. the standard of living fell, and growing unemploy-
 ment raised social tensions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Trade unions may conclude
 agreements with enterprises. Privatization is in its very early phases, so there is
 no experience yet with negotiations that could be described as adversarial between
 unions and private employers. With very few exceptions, the State is still the major
 employer, and the unions do not view themselves as having conflicts of interest with
 the State.
 The wages of state employees in various categories are set by the Ministry of
 Labor and the Ministry of Finance, in consultation with the CFTU. In the small pri-
 vate sector, management establishes wages or negotiates them with those who con-
 tract for employment.
 Discrimination against union members and their officers is forbidden by law, and
 no complaints arc known to have been registered.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, except as legal punishment or as may be specified by law. Large-
 scale compulsory mobilization of youth and students (by the closing of schools) to
 help with the cotton harvest has officially ceased, although in some cases it contin-
 ues. Young people in rural areas are expected to participate "voluntarily" in harvest-
 ing activities of all kinds, and at least in some cases universities still shut down
 temporarily to send both students and faculty into the fields.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum working age is 16;
 15-year-olds may work with permission but have a shorter workday. In rural areas,
 younger children and the elderly often turn out to help harvest cotton and other
 crops. The Labor Ministry has an inspection service responsible for enforcing compli-
 ance with these and other regulations governing employment conditions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Labor, in consultation with the
 CFTU, sets the minimum wage. The minimum wage was raised several times in
 1993 as the value of the ruble fell. As of September, it was about $8 per month at
 the official exchange rate (or 13,500 rubles, almost five times the nominal level of
 January 1, 1993). Most agree that the minimum wage is not sufficient to feed a fam-
 ily.
 The workweek is set at 41 hours per week and includes a 24-hour rest period.
 Some factories have apparently reduced work hours in order to avoid layoffs. Over-
 time pay exists in theory but is not always paid.
 Occupational health and safety standards are established by the Labor Ministry
 in consultation with the unions. There is a health and safety inspectorate within
 the Ministry. Workers do leave jobs that are hazardous without apparent jeopardy
 to continued employment; but the local press occasionally pubished ompl aints
 about the failure of unions and government authorities to do enough to promote
 worker safety.
