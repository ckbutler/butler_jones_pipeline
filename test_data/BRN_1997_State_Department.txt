 BRUNEI
 Brunei Darussalam, a small, wealthy monarchy located on the north coast of Bor-
 neo is a sultanate ruled by the same family for 600 years.
 The 1959 Constitution provided for the first delegation of political power by the
 late Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin to an appointed council of state, but in 1962 the
 then Sultan invoked an article of the Constitution that allowed him to assume emer-
 ency powers for 2 years. These powers have been regularly renewed, most recently
 by the current Sultan in July 1996. Although not all of the articles of the Constitu-
 tion are suspended, the state of emergency places few limits on the Sultan's power.
 He also serves as Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, Minister of Finance, chan-
 cellor of the national university, superintendent general of the Royal Brunei Police
 Force, and leader of the Islamic faith.
 The police force, which has responsibility for internal security, reports to the
 Prime Minister's office, which includes an Internal Security Department, and is
 firmly under the control of civil authorities.
 Brunei's large oil and natural gas reserves, coupled with its small population, give
 it one of the world's highest per capita gross national products.
 Human rights remain broadly circumscribed. In practice citizens do not have the
 right to change their government, and they generally eschew political activity of any
 kind. Nor, constitutional provisions notwithstanding, do they genuinely exercise the
 freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association. Other human rights problems,
 including discrimination against women and restriction of religious freedom, contin-
 ued.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of police mistreatment of prisoners. Any report of police mis-
 treatment of prisoners would be investigated as a violation of the law. In 1988
 caning became mandatory punishment for 42 drug-related and other criminal of-
 fenses and for vandalism. Since then, sentences of caning have been handed down
 and carried out in the presence of a doctor who monitors implementation and has
 the authority to interrupt and postpone the punishment for medical reasons. Caning
 is generally included as part of the sentencing in 80 percent of the criminal convic-
 tions. Many convicted persons reportedly prefer caning rather than lengthy incarcer-
 ation.
 In October 1996, the authorities arrested two policemen for the rape of a waitress
 from the Philippines. In November the policemen were convicted of the kidnap and
 rape of the waitress. They were sentenced to 14 years in prison and given 12 strokes
 of the cane.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards. There is no overcrowd-
 ing, however, there is a growing prison population and a new facility to replace the
 60-year-old prison is under construction. Prisoners receive regular medical check-
 ups. Remand cells at police stations are Spartan.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for a prompt judicial
 determination of the validity of an arrest. However, those provisions, like the Con-
 stitution itself, may be superseded, either partially or wholly, through invocation of
 the emergency powers. The Internal Security Act (ISA) permits the Government to
 detain suspects without trial for renewable 2-year periods. The Government occa-
 sionally has used the ISA to detain persons suspected of antigovernment activity;
 
 
 685
 however, information on the detainees is only published after they are released. Two
 former rebel leaders were pardoned and released, after undergoing "religious indoc-
 trination" and swearing loyalty to the Sultan (see Section i.e.). As far as is known,
 all former rebel leaders are out of prison; there may, however, be a few political de-
 tainees arrested subsequent to the 1962 rebellion who are still in detention.
 Police officers have broad powers to make arrests without warrants of persons
 caught in the act of committing a crime. However, under normal circumstances, a
 magistrate must endorse a warrant for arrest. Warrants are issued without this en-
 dorsement on rare occasions, such as when police are unable to obtain the endorse-
 ment in time to prevent the flight of a suspect.
 Under the colonial-era Banishment Act of 1918, any person deemed to be a threat
 to the safety, peace, or welfare of Brunei, may be forcibly exiled either permanently
 or temporarily by the Sultan. Since independence, there have been no cases of ban-
 ishment of citizens.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution does not specifically provide for
 an independent judiciary. In September 1996, in a landmark legal decision, how-
 ever, the appellate-level, High Court ruled that the Court has powers independent
 of the prosecution, and ordered a discharge in a car theft case under review, which
 amounted to an acquittal under the Criminal Procedure Code. So far the Govern-
 ment has not challenged the court's finding that magistrates have the legal power
 to discharge and acquit a defendant, even when the discharge is not requested by
 the prosecution.
 The judicial system consists of five levels of courts, with final recourse in civil
 cases available through the Privy Council in London. In January 1995, Brunei ter-
 minated appeal to the Privy Council in criminal cases. Procedural safeguards in-
 clude the right to defense counsel, the right to an interpreter, the right to a speedy
 trial, and the right to confront accusers.There were no known instances of govern-
 ment interference with the judiciary and no trials of political opponents.
 The civil law, based on English common law, provides citizens with a fair and effi-
 cient judicial process. Shari'a (Islamic law) supersedes civil law in some areas, in-
 cluding divorce, inheritance, and some sexual crimes. Shari'a law is not applied to
 non-Muslims.
 Two "returnees" (individuals accused or convicted of participating in the 1962 re-
 bellion, who fled or escaped the country, and subsequently returned) were released
 after going through "religious indoctrination," and swearing loyalty to the Sultan.
 As far as is known, all former rebel leaders are out of prison; there may, however,
 be a few political detainees arrested subsequent to the 1962 rebellion who are still
 in detention (see Section 1.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though the law permits government intrusion into the privacy of individual persons,
 families, or homes, this rarely happens. There were no reports of mail having been
 opened prior to delivery during the year. The Government at times prevents the im-
 portation of foreign newspapers and magazines (see Section 2.a.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While there are no laws restricting freedom of
 speech and freedom of the press, the Government has used its authority to protect
 public safety, morals, health, and domestic security to restrict these freedoms. Edi-
 tions of overseas newspapers or magazines with articles that are found objection-
 able, embarrassing, or critical of the Sultan, royal family, or government are not al-
 lowed into the country. Magazine articles with a Christian theme are reportedly in-
 variably censored. However, the growing use of fax machines, the Internet, and ac-
 cess to satellite transmissions make it increasingly difficult to keep such material
 from entering. The independently owned local newspaper appears to practice self-
 censorship in its choice of topics so as not to anger the Government but it has insti-
 tuted a new feature of letters to the editor by which citizens-some by name and
 some anonymously-criticize the Government's handling of certain social, economic,
 and environmental issues. The Government's reactions to the letters have been
 mixed. On the one hand, it has clearly been responsive to public opinion on some
 issues such as dealing with social or environmental problems. On the other hand,
 the Internal Security Department allegedly has been unsuccessfully attempting to
 obtain the names of people who have written to the newspapr to complain about
 government services. In 1997 the newspaper expanded its letters column to reflect
 the increase in letters.
 Although the only Brunei-based television station is government-owned, three Ma-
 laysian television channels are also received locally. A 10-channel cable network of
 television stations is widely available. This network includes the Cable News Net-
 
 
 686
 work, the British Broadcasting Corporation World News, and several entertainment
 channels.
 The Government's tolerance of political criticism has not been tested recently be-
 cause there is no organized opposition. Moreover, citizens generally make almost no
 criticism of their government. In the past, the Government has not hesitated to ar-
 rest those who attempted to propagate unwelcome political views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom to assemble for politi-
 cal purposes has not been seriously tested in recent years.
 Following a 1967 ban on political parties, the Government allowed two parties to
 form in 1985 and 1986. It disbanded one of the parties in 1988. Political parties are
 allowed but they are not to engage in activities that endanger people. Membership
 is open to all citizens, except civil servants and security forces, who make up 60 per-
 cent of all employed citizens.
 The remaining party, the Brunei Solidarity National Party, which had been inac-
 tive for several years, held an assembly in Feb y 1995, reportedly with the con-
 sent of the Government. About 50 people attended. In May 1995, the party presi-
 dent resigned. In a September 1995 interview in a local newspaper, he said that he
 had resigned after the Home Affairs Ministry warned him not to involve himself in
 political activity because he is a former political detainee. He told the interviewer
 that he was seeking authorization from the Government to resume political activity.
 There has been no public party activity since the February 1995 assembly.
 The activities of international service organizations such as Rotary, Kiwanis, and
 the Lions, continued to be constrained by the Government, which in 1995 reminded
 local leaders of these organizations that Muslims may not be members.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution states that, 'The religion of Brunei
 Darussalam shall be the Muslim religion according to the Shafeite sect of that reli-
 gion: Provided that all other religions may be practiced in peace and harmony by
 the person professing them in any part of Brunei Darussalam." The Government
 sporadically voiced alarm about "outsiders" preaching radical Islamic fundamental-
 ist or unorthodox beliefs. Citizens deemed to have been influenced by such preach-
 ing (usually students returning from overseas study) have been "shown the error of
 their ways" in study seminars organized by mainstream Islamic religous leaders.
 The Government seems more concerned about these so-called Islamic opportunists"
 than unwelcome political views. Moreover, the Government does not hesitate to in-
 vestigate and to use its internal security apparatus against these purveyors of radi-
 cal Islam.
 In 1991 the Government began to reinforce the legitimacy of the hereditary mon-
 archy and the observance of traditional and Muslim values by reasserting a national
 ideology known as the Malayhu Islam Beraja (MIB) or "Malay Muslim monarchy,"
 the genesis of which reportedly dates back to the 15th century. The Government in
 1993 participated in issuing the Kuala Lumpur Declaration, which confirms the
 right of all persons to a wide range of human rights, includingfreedom of religion.
 Despite this and constitutional provisions providing for the full and unconstrained
 exercise of religious freedom, the Government routinely restricts the practice of non-
 Muslim religions by: Prohibiting proselytizing; occasionally denying entry to foreign
 clergy or particular priests, bishops, or ministers; banning the importation of reli-
 gious teaching materials or scriptures such as the Bible; and refusing permission
 to expand, repair, or build new churches, temples, and shrines.
 The Ministry of Education has also restricted the teaching of the history of reli-
 gion or other courses in religion in non-Islamic schools while  Wuiring courses on
 Islam or the MB in all schools. Currently only the Bandar Seri Begawan and
 Jerudong International Schools are exempted frm these restrictions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government restricts the movement of former political prisoners
 during the first year of their release. Otherwise, generally, the Government does not
 restrict freedom of movement of its citizens, visitors, and permanent residents. Gov-
 ernment employees, both citizens and foreigners working on a contractual basis,
 must apply for approval to go abroad; it is routinely granted.
 Brunei has no legal provision for granting temporary refuge, firnst asylum, or refu-
 gee status to those see ing such refuge or asylum. Under the law, persons arriving
 without valid entry documents and means of support are considered illegal inmni-
 grants and are deported. There were no reported cases of individuals seekig tem-
 porary refuge in 1997.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are unable to change their government; Bruni is a monarchy and there
 are no established democratic processes. Under the continuing state of emergeny,
 
 
 there is no parliament, and political authority and control rests in the hands of the
 ruling monarch. Individuals may seek to express their views or to influence govern-
 ment decisions and policies by writing letters to the local newspaper or by petition-
 ing the Sultan or handing him letters when he appears in public.
 A form of popular representation lies in a traditional system of village chiefs who,
 since 1992, are elected by secret ballot by all adults. These leaders communicate
 constituents' wishes through a variety of channels, including periodic meetings
 chaired by the Home Affairs Minister, with several officials appointed by the Sultan.
 In May 1996, the Sultan officiated at the first General Assembly of the "mukim"
 (a group of villages) and village consultative council. Over 1,000 village chiefs from
 150 villages and 35 mukim participated as delegates. The delegates were elected
 from among individual villagers, and the Government described the Assembly as "a
 grass roots level political system." The councirs advisers, however, are all appointed
 by the Sultan. The Government insists that ordinary citizens actually use these
 councils to present their grievances and to obtain redress.
 The lack of representative democratic government seriously limits the role of men
 and women in government and politics; however, women are making progress. In
 1997 the Sultan's sister, Princess Masna, was confirmed as the number two official
 in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and for the first time two women were appointed
 as permanent secretaries in the Ministries of Education, and Culture, Youth and
 Sports.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no government or private organizations that deal specifically with the
 protection of human rights. However, in 1997, for the first time, the Government
 entered into a human rights dialog with a foreign embassy. There were no known
 allegations of abuses or requests to visit by international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Except for religion (see Section 2.c.), the Constitution does not contain specific
 provisions prohibiting discrimination based on the factors listed above.
 Women.-The extent to which spousal abuse may occur and go unreported is not
 known. However, in response to a perception that domestic violence is a serious
 problem, the police established a special unit to investigate allegations of spousal
 abuse in October 1994. Approximately 16 cases of domestic abuse were reported to
 police in the first half of 1995. The Government has established a shelter for abused
 women, and reportedly there were four residents there in 1995. In general Islamic
 religious authorities oppose divorce and encourage spouses to return even to fla-
 grantly abusive husbands. However, they recognize wife beating as grounds for di-
 vorce. In 1995 the Government initiated a well-publicized telephone hot line tore-
 port abusers.
 The criminal penalty for a minor domestic assault is 1ito 2 weeks in jail and a
 fne. An assault resting in serious injury would be punished by caning and a
 longer jail sentence. One area of apparent abuse involves female domestic servants.
 Whle the level of violence in society is low, beating of servants--or refusing them
 the right to leave the house on days off, sometimes on grounds that they "might
 encounter the wrong companyb-is less socially unacceptable behavior. Since most
 female domestics are foreign workers who are highly dependent on their employers,
 those subject to abuse may be unwilling or unable to brIng cmplaints, either to the
 authorities or to their governments' embassies. When such complaints are brought,
 however, the Government is generally quick to investigate allegations of abuse and
 ofines and punishment as warranted.
 acorce with Koranic precepts, women are denied equal status with men
 in a number of important areas, such as divorce, inheritance, and custody of chil-
 dren. Under the Brunei Nationality Act, citizenship is transmitted through males
 ony. Female citizens who are married to foreigners or bear children by foreign fa-
 thers cannot transmit citizenship to their children, even when such children are
 born in Brunei. This has resulted in creation of a sizable population of stateless chil-
 dren, estimated at more than 5,000 residents, who are entitled to live in the country
 and be documented for travel by the Government, but who cannot enjoy the full
 privileges of citizenship, including the right to own land.
 Although men are eligible for permanent positions in government service whether
 or not they hold university degrees, women who do nothave university degrees are
 eligible to hold government positions only on a month-to-month basis. While recent
 changes eliminated some previous inequities, women in month-to-month positions
 
 
 688
 continue to receive slightly less annual leave and fewer allowances than their male
 and female counterparts in permanent positions.
 Religious authorities strongly encourage Muslim women to wear the tudong, a tra-
 ditional head covering, and many women do so. Some Muslim women do not, how-
 ever, and there is no official pressure on non-Muslim women to do so. All female
 students in government-operated schools are required to wear the tudong; students
 in nongovernment schools are encouraged to wear it. All public schools are secular.
 There are no separate pay scales for men and women, and in recent years there
 has been a major influx of women into the work force. Women serve in a wide vari-
 ety of capacities in the armed forces, although they may not serve in combat. The
 number of female university graduates is increasing, and nearly two-thirds of
 Brunei University's entering class is female.
 Children.-There are no published statistics regarding the welfare of children.
 The strong commitment to family values within society, the high standard of living,
 and government funding for children's welfare provides most children a healthy and
 nurturing environment. With a few exceptions involving small villages in extremely
 remote areas, nutritional standards are high, and poverty is almost unknown. There
 were 18 reported cases of child abuse in the first half of 1995. In 1997 Brunei rati-
 fied and acceded to the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. In October
 1996, the Brunei High Court convicted a father of 11 of child abuse. The Chief Jus-
 tice sentenced him to 20 years in prison and ordered him caned with 20 strokes of
 the rattan for causing the death of his 3-year-old daughter and grievous hurt to an-
 other 2 of his children.
 People With Disabilities.-No legislation mandating accessibility or other assist-
 ance for disabled persons has been passed. The Government is attempting to provide
 educational services for children with disabilities, although these efforts are not yet
 adequate to address the situation. Teachers are still being trained to deal with dis-
 abled children and some children have no educational opportunities. A special facil-
 ity with trained educators is needed to accommodate the disabled children who can-
 not be assimilated into normal classrooms, and the Ministry of Education is study-
 ing the problem
 Indigenous People.-The 6 percent of the population that is composed of indige-
 nous peoples has long been integrated into society, and enjoys the same rights as
 other citizens.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Some members of non-Malay minorities,
 such as ethnic Chinese, including those born and raised in Brnnei, are not automati-
 cally accorded citizenship and must travel abroad as stateless persons. Brunei's colo-
 nial-era naturalization laws are widely viewed as out of date and in need of reform.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unions are legal in Brnnei but must be reg-
 istered with the Government. There are three registered trade unions, one passive
 and two generally inactive, all of them in the oil sector, and with a total member-
 ship amounting to less than 5 percent of that industry's work force. All workers,
 including civil servants other than those serving in the military and police, may
 form or join trade unions. Unions are independent of the Government. The Trade
 Unions Act of 1962 permits the formation of trade union federations, but forbids af-
 filiation with labor organizations outside Brunei. An individual contract is required
 between an employer and each employee, but legal trade union activities cannot be
 deemed to violate employee contracts. Local legal experts interpret this provision as
 conferring the right to strike, but there have been no strikes. Brunei is not a mem-
 ber of the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Government has not pre-
 vented the legal registration of trade unions, nor has it dissolved any. The Govern-
 ment did not interfere with lawful union activity. It is illegal to refuse employment
 or discriminate against an employee on the basis of membership or nonmembership
 in a trade union. While unions are legal and easy to register, conditions are not con-
 ducive to the development of trade unions. There is little interest on the part of
 workers in forming trade unions, and existing unions are not very active. The law
 is silent on collective bargaining, and it occurs in only a few industries. There are
 few industries of the kind in which unions have traditionally developed. Also, cul-
 tural tradition favors consensus over confrontation. Wage and benefit packages are
 based on market conditions and tend to be generous.
 There is a free trade zone in Muara Port, known as the Muara Export Zone
 (MEZ), established in May 1994.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor in-
 cluding forced and bonded labor by children, and it is not practiced.
 
 
 689
 During the year, a foreign beauty contest winner brought suit in a foreign court
 against members of the Bnei royal family allegng that she and others were
 brought to Brunei and subsequently held against their will for purposes of sexual
 exploitation. A statement by the royal family called the case "frivolous and ground-
 less." At year's end, the case had not been resolved.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Enactment Laws of 1954 prohibits employment of children below the age of
 16. Parental consent and approval by the La or Commission is required for those
 below the age of 18. Female minors under age 18 may not work at night or on off-
 shore oil platforms. The Department of Labor (DOL), which is a part of the-Ministry
 of Home Affairs, effectively enforces laws on the employment of children. There were
 no reports of violations of the child labor laws. Forced and bonded labor by children
 is prohibited and it is not practiced (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Skilled labor is in short supply, and market
 forces enable most citizens to command good salaries. There is no minimum wage.
 The standard workweek is Monday through Thursday and Saturday, with Friday
 and Sunday off, allowing for two 24-hour rest periods each week. Overtime is paid
 for work in excess of 48 hours a week, and double time is paid for work performed
 on legal holidays. Occupational health and safety standards are established by gov-
 ernment regulations. The DOL inspects working conditions on a routine basis and
 in response to complaints. The DOL generally enforces labor regulations effectively.
 However, in the unskilled labor sector enforcement is lax, especially for foreign la-
 borers (see also the subsection on Women in Section 5). The DOL is empowered to
 close any workplace where health, safety, or working conditions are unsatisfactory,
 and it has done so in the past.
