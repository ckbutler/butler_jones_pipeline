 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy with a federal structure and an inde-
 pendent judiciary. The bicameral Parliament elects the seven members of the Fed-
 eral Council, the highest executive body, whose presidency rotates annually. Be-
 cause of the nation's linguistic and religious diversity, the Swiss political system em-
 phasizes local and national political consensus and grants considerable autonomy to
 individual cantons.
 The Swiss armed forces are a civilian-controlled militia based on universal mili-
 tary service for able-bodied males. There is virtually no standing army apart from
 
 
 1528
 training cadres and a few essential headquarters staff. Police duties are primarily
 a responsibility of the individual cantons, which have their own distinct police forces
 that are kept under effective control. The National Police Authority has a coordinat-
 ing role and relies on the cantons for actual law enforcement. There were allega-
 tions of occasional abuses by police.
 Switzerland has a highly developed free enteprise, industrial, and service econ-
 omy strongly dependent on international trade. The standard of living is very high.
 The Government generally respects human rights, and the law and judiciary pro-
 vide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. There continue
 to be allegations by nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) of occasional police har-
 assment directed against foreigners, particularly asylum seekers, and reports of
 verbal abuse against foreigners by private citizens. Some laws still tend to discrimi-
 nate against women. The Government is continuing to take serious steps to address
 violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution proscribes such practices, and there were no reports of violations.
 There were allegations by NGO's and some individuals of occasional police harass-
 ment of foreigners, particularly asylum seekers (see Section 2.d.).
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, although some NGO's
 complain of prison overcrowding. The Government has taken measures to improve
 prison conditions and address overcrowding.
 Brazilian national Lus Felipe Lourenco was living illegally in the country and
 was arrested in June by police in Geneva on charges of theft of a credit card. He
 allegedly was beaten by prison guards while in custody. The guards reportedly wait-
 ed 2 hours before transporting Lourenco to the hospital, where he was diagnosed
 with a perforated lung and damage to his spinal cord. The Brazilian Embassy re-
 portedly asked the authorities to look into the incident.
 The 1997 case of Nigerian human rights activist Clement Nwankwo, who was ar-
 rested in Geneva and allegedly abused by police, is still pending. Nwankwo was con-
 victed initially of shoplifting and disturbing the peace, and sentenced to 4 days' im-
 prisonment (which he had already served in pretrial custody) as well as expulsion
 from the country. A lower court subsequently dropped the shoplifting conviction and
 lifted the sentence of expulsion. However, the Supreme Court rejected Nwankwo's
 subsequent appeal of his conviction for disturbing the peace. Nwankwo reportedly
 intends to file a further appeal to the European Human Rights Court in Strasbourg.
 Swiss NGO's believe that the Nwankwo case underscores overall problems with
 police treatment of foreigners, especially asylum seekers in Geneva and perhaps
 elsewhere. The cantonal government took measures in response to the incident, in-
 cluding launching an administrative inquiry into the conduct of the three police offi-
 cers involved. The police successfully appealed the reprimand and warning that
 were imposed as a result of the inquiry. In 1998 the NGO Association for the Pre-
 vention of Torture organized a special seminar for police officers in Geneva. The
 Federal Government and the Canton of Geneva are expected to finance publication
 of a special brochure aimed, at increasing respect for and awareness of the rights
 of all persons in custody. The brochure will be distributed throughout Switzerland.
 In 1997, following its examination of Switzerland's third periodic report, the
 United Nation's Committee Against Torture expressed concern about "frequent alle-
 gations of ill-treatment" inflicted in the course of arrests and police custody and a
 lack of independent mechanisms in the cantons of certain legal guarantees such as
 the possibility, "especially for foreigners," to contact their family or a lawyer in case
 of arrest, and to be examined by an independent doctor on entering police custody,
 after each interrogation, and before being brought before an investigating mag-
 istrate or being released. The Committee recommended the introduction of mecha-
 nisms to receive complaints of mistreatment by police officers against suspects and
 for the harmonization of the 26 different cantonal codes of penal procedure, "particu-
 larly with regard to the granting of fundamental guarantees in the course of police
 custody." In addition the Committee recommended that the Swiss authorities pay
 "the greatest possible attention" to the handling of cases of violence attributed to
 police officers in order to ensure the opening of investigations and, in proven cases,
 the imposition of possible sanctions. The Federal Government invited cantonal po-
 lice directors to a special meeting during the year to discuss these recommendations.
 
 
 1529
 However, the cantons have primary responsibility for these matters, and it is not
 clear the extent to which each canton has implemented these recommendations.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The legal prohibitions on arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile are fully respected at all levels of government. The cantons
 are responsible for handling most criminal matters, and their procedures vary some-
 what from canton to canton. In general a suspect may not be held longer than 48
 hours without a warrant of arrest issued by an investigative magistrate. However,
 asylum seekers and foreigners without valid documents may be held for up to 96
 hours without an arrest warrant. Some NGO's alleged that the authorities arbitrar-
 ily detained asylum seekers (see Section 2.d.). A suspect has the right to choose and
 contact an attorney as soon as the warrant is issued; the State provides free counsel
 for indigents in most situations. Investigations are generally prompt, even if in some
 cases investigative detention may exceed the length of sentence. Release on personal
 recognizance or bail is granted unless the magistrate believes the person is dan-
 gerous or will not appear for trial. Any lengthy detention is subject to review by
 higher judicial authorities. In 1997 about one-third of all prisoners were in pretrial
 detention, and the average length of such detention was 1 week.
 It a ppears that Nigerian human rights activist Clement Nwankwo was-at least
 initially-tried without full due process (see Section l.c.).
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 All courts of first instance are local or cantonal courts. Citizens have the right
 to appeal to a higher instance court and ultimately to the Federal Court.
 Minor cases are tried by a single judge, difficult cases by a panel of judges, and
 murder (or other serious cases) by a public jury. Trials usually are held expedi-
 tiously. The Constitution provides for public trials in which the defendant's rights
 are fully respected, including the right to challenge and to present witnesses or evi-
 dence.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Can-
 tonal laws regulate police entry into private premises. These regulations differ wide-
 ly from canton to canton, but all prohibit such practices without a warrant All gov-
 ernment authorities respect these provisions, and violations are subject to effective
 legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system
 combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 The authorities may legally restrict these freedoms for groups deemed to be a threat
 to the State, but no groups were restricted during the year. In addition, an article
 of the Penal Code criminalizes racist or anti-Semitic expression, whether in public
 speech or in printed material.
 The nationwide broadcast media are government-funded but possess editorial au-
 tonomy. Private and foreign broadcast media operate freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for complete freedom of reli-
 gion, and the Government respects this right in practice. There is no single state
 church, but most cantons support one or several churches with public funds. In all
 cantons, an individual may choose not to contribute to church funding. In some can-
 tons, however, private companies are unable to avoid payment of the church tax.
 Due to increasing public concern over certain groups, especially Scientology, the
 Government in 1997 asked an advisory commission to examine Scientology. The
 commission published its findings in August. According to the report, there is no
 basis at present for special monitoring of Scientology, since it does not represent any
 direct or immediate threat to the security of the country. However, the report stated
 that Scientology had characteristics of a totalitarian organization and had its own
 intelligence network. The commission also warned of the significant financial bur-
 den imposed on Scientology members and recommended reexamining the issue at
 a later date.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Under the Constitution and the law, citizens are free to travel in or
 outside the country, to emigrate, and to repatriate. Non-Swiss convicted of crimes
 
 
 1530
 may receive sentences that include denial of reentry for a specific period following
 completion of a prison sentence.
 Switzerland traditionally has been a haven for refugees, but public concern over
 the high number of asylum seekers generated pressure on the Government to tight-
 en its policy. During the year, Parliament considered a new asylum law. However,
 due to increased numbers of asylum seekers, the Government decided in July to im-
 plement emergency measures to avoid alleged abuse of the asylum procedure and
 to control the influx of refugees. Under these measures, authorities no longer con-
 sider asylum requests from individuals who do not have identification papers (un-
 less there is clear evidence of persecution), or from individuals already residing "ile-
 gally" in the country. NGO's expressed concern over these emergency measures, but
 authorities reportedly insist that their actions are consistent with international law.
 Some human rights organizations have charged the authorities with abuses in
 connection with the implementation of a 1995 law aimed at asylum seekers or for-
 eigners living illegally in Switzerland who are suspected of disturbing the public
 order or avoiding repatriation. In particular, these groups have alleged instances of
 abuse, including arbitrary detention as well as denial of access to established asy-
 lum procedures, involving police at the two main airports. They also charge that po-
 lice officers used the law to detain or harass asylum seekers who were not suspected
 of having disturbed public order. However, the allegations of these human rights or-
 ganizations have never been substantiated, and these groups indicate that the situa-
 tion has improved. Under the law, police actions are subject to judicial oversight,
 and the Federal Court has overturned many cases in which it believed that there
 was not sufficient regard for the rights of asylum seekers or other foreigners.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Govern-
 ment provides first asylum and provided it to 2,000 persons during the year. Refu-
 gees whose applications are rejected are allowed to stay temporarily, if their home
 country is experiencing war or insurrection. The Government denies having forced
 p ersons to return to countries where they have a well-founded fear of persecution.
 However, NGO's have charged the Government with expelling rejected asylum seek-
 ers even though conditions in their native country remain unfavorable. This has
 been true especially with respect to Bosnian refugees, although officials insist that
 very few people have been forcibly returned (around 200 in the last 3 years) and
 that each case is examined thoroughly.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully (at local, cantonal, and federal levels), and citizens exercise this right in
 p ractice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suf-
 age. In addition initiative and referendum procedures provide unusually intense
 popular involvement in the legislative process.
 Women were disenfranchised until 1971 at the federal level, but since then their
 participation in politics has continued to expand. Women occupy 51 of the 246 seats
 in the Parliament, 1 of 7 seats in the Federal Council (Cabinet), a record one-fourth
 of the seats in the cantonal government executive bodies, and about one-fifth of the
 seats in communal executives. However, in 1995 and 1996 voters rejected two local
 initiatives designed to reserve a fixed percentage of elective seats for women. In
 1997 the Federal Court declared invalid another local initiative with the samepur-
 pose. A vote on an initiative to mandate equal gender representation in all federal
 institutions is scheduled to take place no later than 2001.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A large number of international and domestic human rights groups operate with-
 out government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human
 rights cases. Government officials are cooperative and generally responsive to their
 views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, sex, reli-
 gion, language, or social status. The Government generally enforces these prohibi-
 tions effectively, although a few laws tend to discriminate against women.
 Women.-Violence against women is a problem. According to a government-funded
 study on domestic violence, one-fifth of all women suffer in their lifetimes at least
 once from physical or sexual violence, and about 40 percent suffer from psycho-
 logical or verbal abuse.
 
 
 1531
 
 The law prohibits wife beating and similar offenses. Spousal rape is a crime in
 the Penal Code. Victims of violence can obtain help, counseling, and legal assistance
 from specialized agencies or from nearly a dozen hot lines sponsored privately or
 by local, cantonal, and national authorities. An estimated 680 women and nearly as
 many children took refuge in 14 women's shelters during the year. Those in charge
 of the shelters estimate that nearly as many were denied access due to a lack of
 space.
 The difficulty in gathering information about the number of prosecuted, convicted,
 or punished spouse abusers stems in part from the fact that legal cases are handled
 by each canton and data are often not up-to-date. According to police criminal statis-
 tics, 318 men were suspected of having abused women in 1997, and in 1996, 58 men
 were sentenced for such abuse.
 The Federation of Women's Organizations and numerous other women's NGO's
 have heightened public awareness of the problem of violence against women. Two
 government-supported women's organizations that fight for equal gender rights
 jointly conducted the first national campaign against violence in relationships. This
 campaign received extensive media coverage. No significant demonstrations or
 marches for women's rights took place during the year.
 The Penal Code criminalizes sexual exploitation and trafficking in women. The
 authorities effectively enforce these laws. In order to confront modern forms of traf-
 ficking in women, especially via the Internet, the federal police have increased the
 number of their agents. In 1996 (the last year such conviction statistics were avail-
 able) four persons were convicted of trafficking in women and eight were convicted
 of sexual exploitation.
 Although the Constitution prohibits all types of discrimination, a few laws still
 tend to discriminate against women. However, in 1996 a new federal law on equal
 opportunity for women and men came into force. The law includes a general rohibi-
 ion on  ender-based discrimination and incorporates the principle of "equ  wages
 for equa  work." The law also includes provisions aimed at eliminating sexual har-
 assment and facilitating access to legal remedies for those who claim discrimination
 or harassment.
 At the aggregate level, men earn more than women, but it is not clear if this cir-
 cumstance reflects overt discrimination or other factors. Individual cases of denial
 of equal pay for equal work are subject to the new law.
 Journalistic reports of pre-1970's instances of forced sterilization of women led
 parliamentarians in 1997 to ask the Federal Council to write a report on the prac-
 tice as well as the legal, medical, historical, and social policy background of forced
 sterilization, in view of a projected tutelage law that is to include regulations con-
 cerning sterilization of mentally disabled persons. The Federal Government has not
 decided whether to issue such a report. Forced sterilization was not ordered by the
 Federal Government. However, one cantonal government adopted such a law in
 1928, which was abrogated in the 1970's. Women's organizations apparently made
 no public statements about the reports.
 In its December review of the Governments 1996 Report on the Implementation
 of the U.N. Covenant for Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, the U.N. Committee
 for Human Rights criticized continuing discrimination against women in Switzer-
 land. The Committee-noted that despite the existence of legislation against discrimi-
 nation, de facto discrimination against women and ethnic minorities continues to
 exist in various areas. This is especially true in the labor market, where a dis-
 proportionate number of women and minorities occupy lower paid and part-time
 jobs. As a result, women suffer from poverty more often than men. The Committee
 also expressed concern about the level of domestic violence against women, which
 authors of a Government study estimate at over 100,000 cases per year.
 Children.-Despite the fact that the Government has no special program for chil-
 dren and that there is no special governmental office for children's matters, the Gov-
 ernment demonstrates its strong commitment to children's rights and welfare
 through a well-finded public education system and medical care. The federal and
 cantonal governments, as welLas.about 80 NGO's that defend children's rights, have
 devoted considerable attention. in recent years to child -abuse, especially sexual
 abuse.-For convicted perpetrators of the latter, the law provides for imprisonment
 for up to 15 years. In 1997 amendments to the federal Penal Code came into effect
 which provide for an increase in the statute of limitations in cases of child abuse
 from 5 to 10 years. To combat child pornography, the Federal Office for Police now
 provides on its worldwide web page a service called "Internet Monitoring." Individ-
 uals who find pornographic material involving children are asked to contact the
 Federal Office via electronic mail.
 With respect to child abuse abroad, the law provides for prosecution only if the
 act is considered a crime in the country in which it took place. Experts have pro-
 
 
 1532
 
 posed making such acts punishable in Switzerland regardless of where the crime
 took place, but there was no action on the problem during the year.
 Parliament's ratification of the U.N. Convention on Children's Rights included five
 reservations, the most important of which concerned children of migrant seasonal
 workers Who are not automatically permitted to join their parents. Children of for-
 eigners working as migrant laborers are only permitted to visit on tourist visas for
 a period of 3 months at a time. After 3 months, they must return to their homeland
 for 1 month. In February the Federal Council asked the Department of Justice and
 Police to reexamine the necessity of these reservations.
 People With Disabilities.-There are strong legal prohibitions against discrimina-
 tion directed at disabled persons in employment, education, and the provision of
 other state services. Advocates for the disabled have called for new measures to en-
 sure greater protection for their rights, including easier access to buildings and pub-
 lic transportation. However, the Government has not mandated that building or
 transportation facilities be made accessible. In 1996 a Member of Parliament pro-
 posed legislation to amend the Constitution to provide equality of opportunity for
 the disabled. The legislation has received broad support in Parliament, but it would
 be subject to a mandatory voter referendum. In 1998 advocates for the disabled also
 launched a separate initiative to amend the Constitution to provide equal rights for
 the disabled (and other minorities).
 A 1995 law exempts disabled men from the tax imposed on those who have not
 fulfilled their military duty.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-According to NGO statistics, there were 70
 reported attacks against foreigners/minorities in the first half of the year, compared
 with 33 reported for the same period in 1997. These figures include instances of
 verbal and written "attacks", which are much more common than physical assaults.
 Investigations of these attacks are conducted effectively and lead, in most cases, to
 the arrest of the persons responsible. Persons convicted of racist crimes are com-
 monly sentenced to from 3 days' to 3 years' imprisonment with a fine of up to ap-
 proximately $27,210 (40,000 Swiss francs).
 In November Switzerland ratified the European Council's Convention on the Pro-
 tection of National Minorities.
 Religious Minorities.-In response to the issue of Holocaust era assets, the Gov-
 ernment and private sector initiated a series of measures designed to shed light on
 the past, provide assistance to Holocaust victims, and address claims to dormant ac-
 counts in Swiss banks. These measures include: The Independent Commission of
 Experts under Professor Jean-Francois Bergier charged with examining the coun-
 try's wartime history and its role as a financial center; the Independent Committee
 of Eminent Persons under Paul Volcker charged with resolving the issue of dormant
 World War II era accounts in Swiss banks; and the Swiss Special Fund for Needy
 Holocaust Victims which received approximately $190 million (273 million Swiss
 francs) in contributions from the private sector and the Swiss National Bank. In Au-
 gust a $1.25 billion settlement of the class action lawsuit filed in the U.S. against
 Swiss banks was announced.
 In the context of the discussions over Nazi gold and Holocaust era assets, anti-
 Semitic slurs reportedly are increasing. Government officials, including the Presi-
 dent, have spoken frequently and publicly against anti-Semitism. According to NGO
 statistics, about a dozen persons have been convicted so far based on the antiracism
 law. The heaviest penalty was a 15-month imprisonment and a fine of $5,600 (8,000
 Swiss Francs) against a person for denying the existence of the Holocaust. The case
 is pending appeal.
 On November 5, the Federal Commission against Racism released a report on
 anti-Semitism in Switzerland, expressing concern that the recent controversy over
 the country's role during World War II had to some extent opened the door to ex-
 pressions of latent anti-Semitism. At the same time, the Commission described the
 emergence of strong public opposition to anti-Semitism, and credited the Federal
 Council with taking a "decisive stand" against anti-Semitism. The Commission also
 proposed various public and private measures to combat anti-Semitism and encour-
 age greater tolerance and understanding. In its initial response to the report, the
 Federal Council pledged to facilitate implementation of the Commission's rec-
 ommendations.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, including foreigners, have the freedom
 to associate freely, to join unions of their choice, and to select their own representa-
 tives. The Government does not hamper the exercise of these rights. About one-third
 of the work force is unionized.
 
 
 1533
 
 The right to strike is legally recognized and freely exercised, but a unique labor
 peace under an informal agreement between unions and employers-in existence
 since the 1930's-has meant fewer than 10 strikes per year since 1975. There were
 no significant strikes during the year.
 Unions are independent of the Government and political parties, and laws pro-
 hibit retribution against strikers or their leaders. Unions can associate freely with
 international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-By law workers have the
 right to organize and bargain collectively, and the law protects them from acts of
 antiunion discrimination. The Government fully respects these provisions. Periodic
 negotiations between employer and worker organizations determine wages and set-
 tle other labor issues at the national and local levels. Nonunion firms generally
 adopt the terms and conditions fixed in the unions' collective bargaining.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although there is no specific con-
 stitutional or statutory ban on forced or compulsory labor in general, and on child
 labor in particular, such practices are not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for employment of children is 15 years, and children are in school up to
 this age. Children over 13 years of age may be employed in light duties for not more
 than 9 hours per week during the school year and 15 hours otherwise. The employ-
 ment of youths between the ages of 15 and 20 is strictly regulated; they cannot work
 at night, on Sundays, or in hazardous or dangerous conditions. The Federal Office
 for Industry, Trade, and Labor effectively enforces the law on working conditions.
 The Government does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by chil-
 dren, although such prohibitions are implicitly included in the Labor Act. Such
 forms of labor are not believed to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 Government officials inspect companies that employ children after having received
 complaints. Every year a few employers are fined or receive conditional imprison-
 ment for violations of the law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. The low-
 est wages fixed in collective bargaining are always adequate to provide a decent
 standard of living for workers and their families.
 The 1964 Labor Act established a maximum 45-hour workweek for blue- and
 white-collar workers in industry, services, and retail trades, and a 50-hour work-
 week for all other workers. The law prescribes a rest period during the workweek.
 Overtime is limited by law to 260 hours annually for those working 45 hours per
 week and to 220 hours annually for those working 50 hours per week.
 Legal and illegal foreign workers are protected by law. However, illegal foreign
 workers 'are not covered by mandatory health insurance in case of illness or acci-
 dent. Wage discrimination against foreign workers is not permitted.
 The Labor Act and the Federal Code of Obligations contain extensive regulations
 to protect worker health and safety. There have been no reports of lapses in the en-
 forcement of these regulations, but the degree to which enforcement is effective is
 unclear. In a second vote in 2 years, voters approved in November a new labor law
 designed to increase flexibility in the workplace and to remove restrictions on
 women working at night. A worker may leave a dangerous assignment without pen-
 alty.
