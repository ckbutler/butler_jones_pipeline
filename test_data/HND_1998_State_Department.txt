 HONDURAS
 Honduras is a constitutional democracy, with a president and a unicameral con-
 gress elected for 4-year terms. President Carlos Flores Facusse took office on Janu-
 ary 27. The two major political parties, the Liberals and the Nationalists, have al-
 ternated in power peacefully after free elections. The judiciary is independent, but
 often ineffective and subject to outside influence.
 The Honduran Armed Forces (HOAF) comprise the army, the air force, and the
 navy. The National Police (formerly a paramilitary force known as the FUSEP) were
 transferred to civilian control in 1997. The Government created a new Ministry of
 Security in 1998 to oversee police operations and counter a nationwide crime wave.
 In September the National Congress unanimously amended the Constitution to es-
 tablish direct civilian control over the armed forces-through a civilian Minister of
 Defense-for the first time in nearly half a century. This change, ending the consid-
 erable institutional and legal autonomy with which the HOAF operated, was ex-
 pected to take effect in January 1999. Reports of human rights abuses have declined
 since the police were separated from the military forces; however, members of both
 the armed forces and the police continued to commit abuses.
 The market-based economy is based primarily on agriculture, with a small but in-
 creasingly important maquiladora (in-bond processing for export) industry that ac-
 counts for about 100,000 jobs, most filled by young women. The armed forces indi-
 rectly play a declining role in the national economy through their pension fund,
 which controls some enterprises usually associated with the private sector, including
 a bank and several insurance companies. About 37 percent of workers labor in agri-
 culture, with most of the rest in industry and manufacturing, commerce, and serv-
 ices. The principal export crops are coffee and bananas; these, along with "value
 added" income from the maquiladora industry, constitute the leading sources of for-
 eign exchange. Nontraditional products, such as melons, pineapples, and shrimp,
 play an increasingly important role in the economy. In October Hurricane Mitch
 devastated the country, causing thousands of deaths, leaving hundreds of thousands
 of persons temporarily homeless, and seriously damaging the nation's infrastruc-
 ture. Annual per capita income is about $830; about two-thirds of the country's
 households live in poverty.
 The Government's human rights record improved somewhat, but serious problems
 remained. Members of the security forces allegedly committed extrajudicial killings,
 particularly of presumed criminals, leading human rights groups to charge that the
 security forces had formed neighborhood death squads. Incidents of police beatings
 and other abuse of detainees remained a problem. Prison conditions remain harsh,
 detainees do not always receive due process, and lengthy pretrial detention is com-
 mon. Considerable impunity for members of the economic and official elite, exacer-
 bated by a weak, underfunded, and sometimes corrupt judicial system, contributes
 to human rights problems. Although civilian courts increasingly considered allega-
 tions of human rights violations or common crimes against armed forces personnel
 and some cases went to trial, there were relatively few convictions. In November
 an appellate court upheld a lower court grant of amnesty to a military officer con-
 victed of committing human rights abuses. While no senior government official, poli-
 tician, bureaucrat, or member of the business elite was convicted of crimes, the Gov-
 ernment removed numerous military officials, police investigators and agents, and
 judges from office on corruption and other charges. The judicial system continued
 to deny swift and impartial justice to prisoners awaiting trial. In the aftermath of
 Hurricane Mitch, in November the Government, with congressional assent and in
 accordance with the Constitution, temporarily suspended certain civil liberties;
 these were restored 4 weeks later. On occasion the authorities conducted illegal
 searches. Other human rights problems included societal discrimination and vio-
 lence against women, discrimination against indigenous people, and abuse of street
 children. The Government does not enforce effectively all labor laws. Child labor is
 a problem, particularly in rural areas and in the informal economy, but not in the
 export processing sector.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial KMlling.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings. However, human rights organizations alleged that individual
 members and former members of the security forces, acting as vigilante "security
 squadrons," committed extrajudicial killings. The Government publicly denied accu-
 sations relating to the security forces as institutions, but investigated individual al-
 legations against members of neighborhood vigilante groups. Human righits groups
 also implicated members of the security forces in a number of killings of street chil-
 dren (see Section 5).
 In February persons in Santa Rosa calling themselves "Vigilantes of the Nighf'
 killed Ernesto Sandoval Bustillo, a former judge who was the Copan department
 representative of the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras
 (CODEH). Sandoval had been investigating the possible involvement of local offi-
 cials in contraband and narcotics smuggling, land expropriation schemes, environ-
 mental destruction, and police abuses. The Government deployed police investiga-
 tors from Tegucigalpa who determined that the Chinchilla crime organization had
 carried out the murder-, the police subsequently arrested two dozen members of the
 Chinchilla gang who were awaiting trial at year's end.
 In May unknown persons killed Carlos Antonio Luna Lopez, a town councilman
 in Catacamas. Police continued to investigate this case. In October Pedro Garcia
 Villanueva, a regional director of attorneys for the Public (Justice) Ministry, was
 killed in Santa Barbara. Garcia had been investigating several notorious human
 rights cases, including the 1992 murder of former national electric company director
 Marco Tulio Castellon Baide. The police detained several suspected assailants.
 Dramatic increases in violent crime fueled the continued growth in the number
 of private, often unlicensed, guard services, and of volunteer groups who patrolled
 their neighborhoods or muncipalities to deter crime. The continued proliferation of
 private s.ecurity forces made it more difficult to differentiate among homicides that
 may have been perpetrated by government security personnel, private vigilantes, or
 common criminals. The number of homicides nationwide rose, reaching 6 to 12 mur-
 ders per day in the capital city of Tegucigalpa alone; random shootings and other
 violent assaults also were common.
 Human rights groups asserted that at least some of these homicides were
 _ extrajudicial executions. Over 100 youtls associated with criminal gangs were
 killed, execution-style. In such cases, renegade elements of the security forces, or ci-
 vilian (including vigilante) groups working with such elements, allegedly used un-
 warranted lethal force against supposed habitual criminals. The Government did
 not take effective action to try, convict, or punish anyone for these offenses.
 Concerns that the security forces would not investigate credible allegations of
 extrajudicial killings by members of the former FUSEP led to the creation in 1994
 of a civilian-controlled Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DIC) under the Public
 Ministry (which also includes a prosecutorial branch). The Police Organic Law,
 which took effect in November, placed the DIC under the new Ministry of Security
 and renamed it the General Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DGIC). Since
 the creation of the DIC, the Attorney General and human rights groups have noted
 a decrease in reported human rights abuses.
 In January a judge of the second criminal court ruled that although Lieutenant
 Colonel Juan Bias Salazar Mesa was guilty of participating in the kidnaping, tor-
 tore, and murders of students in 1982, he qualified for amnesty. In December the
 Supreme Court upheld the lower court's ruling on amnesty for Salazar.
 In 1997 the authorities jailed two former senior military and security officials in
 the cases of Adan Aviles Funez and Nicaraguan citizen Amado Espinoza Paz, who
 disappeared in Choluteca on June 12, 1982. Authorities detained Colonel Manuel
 Enrique Suarez Benavides, while retired police colonel Marco Antonio Matute Lagos
 surrendered voluntarily; both faced charges of ilegal detention and murder. Both
 officers appealed their detention. Suarez was freed on appeal in late 1997, and
 Matute was granted conditional liberty in October. Police Colonel Alexander
 aymundo Hernandez, another suspect in this case, has been missing since 1995;
 the police discontinued his salary in 1997 and discharged him from the force in
 March.
 There was no progress in the investigation or prosecution of other alleged
 extrajudicial   lgs committed in previous years. In June the armed forces named
 a commission of senior military officers to investigate accusations of human rights
 violations or other criminal activities by armed forces personnel. At years end, this
 commission had made no public findings.
 b. Disappearane.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 
 
 670
 The Attorney General continued investigations into the disappearances of 184 per-
 sons in the 1980's. Various witnesses, survivors, and a few former members of the
 military have charged that members of Battalion 3-16 kidnaped, tortured, and mur-
 dered many of those who disappeared. The National Commissioner for Human
 Rights, Leo Valladares, also continued his investigation into the human rights
 abuses alleged to have been committed by members of Battalion 3-16 and the
 former police intelligence unit. At the request of the Government, the U.S. Govern-
 ment in 1997 and 1998 reviewed and declassified thousands of pages of official docu-
 ments related to alleged human rights abuses in Honduras during the 1980's and
 provided them to Commissioner Valladares.
 In December the Supreme Court upheld a lower court's grant of amnesty for Lt.
 Col. Juan Blas Salazar Mesa. The lower court had found him gilty of participating
 in kidnapings and other human'rights abuses in 1982 (see Section L.a.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, but there were isolated reports that officials em-
 ployed such practices. The National Commissioner for Human Rights reported seven
 known instances of torture during 1997, the lowest recorded figure for the decade.
 Police beatings and other alleged abuses of detainees remained a problem. The po-
 lice also engaged in violence (including beatings and a number of killings) against
 street children (see Section 5).
 The Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) within the National Police inves-
 tigates allegations of official torture and abuse and can recommend sanctions
 against police agents found guilty of such mistreatment. However, neither the police
 commander nor the OPR is empowered to punish wrongdoers; only the immediate
 superior of the accused agent has the authority to do so. The Public Ministry and
 human rights groups criticized the OPR for being unresponsive to their requests for
 impartial investigations of police officers accused of abuses. In 1996 the Public Min-
 istry created the office of Human Rights Inspector within the former DIC to monitor
 the behavior of its agents; the Inspector reports to the head of the human rights
 section of the Public Ministry and to the Attorney General.
 The DGIC dismissed or suspended over two dozen agents for involvement in cor-
 rupt activities and abuses of authority. The National Police took similar action
 against over 50 policemen, including police commander Colonel Julio Cesar Chavez
 and police chief of staff Colonel Manuel Antonio Urbina, on similar grounds. The
 civilian Police Transition Board, established when the police were removed from
 military control in September 1997, exercised operational control over the National
 Police, pending its planned integration into the new Ministry of Security in January
 1999. The Board dealt swiftly with charges of corruption or malfeasance against in-
 dividual police officials by removing them from positions of authority, pendg judg-
 ment. In October the Public Ministry sought arrest warrants for police Colonels
 Chavez and Urbina and three other senior police officials for allegedly trafficking
 in stolen vehicles.
 The widespread frustration at the inability of the security forces to prevent and
 control crime, and the well-founded perception that corrupt security personnel were
 complicit in the high crime rate, led to considerable public support for vigilante jus-
 tice. In October President Flores, with congressional backing, deployed 600 army
 troops in the country's four major cities to assist the National Police in curbing
 surging street crime. In October the Congress ratified a 1997 constitutional amend-
 ment that permits sentences of life imprisonment to be included in the pending re-
 form of the Penal Code.
 In 1996 the Supreme Court issued a special decree permitting officials associated
 with the criminal justice system (including the military, police, prison wardens and
 employees, criminal investigative agents, public prosecutors, judges, and other mag-
 istrates) who are undergoing inves tion or on trial to serve their preventive de-
 tention at military bases and police centers, rather than at the central penitentiary
 in Tegucigalpa, as had been the case in the past. It was hoped that the decree would
 encourage military officers sought for alleged human rights abuses in the 1980's to
 turn themselves in. However, ony a small number of officers whose cases fell under
 the decree surrendered or were apprehended; most have been freed for lack of evi-
 dence.
 In December the Supreme Court upheld a lower cour s grant of amnesty for Lt.
 Col. Juan Bias Salazar Mesa. The lower court had found him guilty of participating
 in torture and other human rights abuses in 1982 (see Section l.a.).
 Elements of the armed forces withheld their cooperation from official efforts to
 track down military officers wanted in connection with alleged human rights abuses
 dating back toe the 1980's. IAugt    a o   we soes an o      armed forces
 commander as having admitted that the military was protecting officers accused of
 human rights violations; the HOAF subsequently claimed that the news media had
 
 
 reported the commander's remarks erroneously. The Supreme Court considered
 whether government amnesties for crimes committed in the 1980's covered the mili-
 tary, as political deliberations in the Congress had suggested. The Court determined
 in December that, while the amnesty laws were constitutional, amnesty appeals
 would have to be decided on their individual merits (see Section i.e.). Constitutional
 amendments aimed at reforming the armed forces and eliminating the legal immu-
 nity enjoyed by military officials were expected to be ratified by January 1999.
 There were developments in two cases involving alleged former members of the
 army's notorious counterinsurgency Battalion 3-16. Canada deported Fausto Ramon
 Reyes Caballero, and he subsequently provided testimony regarding several human
 rights cases of the 1980's. However, that testimony did not lead to any new charges
 or convictions. Retired captain Billy Fernando Joya Amendola, who fled to exile in
 Spain in 1995, returned voluntarily in December to face charges in several cases of
 torture and disappearance.
 Prison conditions remained harsh. Prisoners suffered from severe overcrowding,
 malnutrition, and a lack of adequate sanitation, and allegedly were subject to var-
 ious other abuses, including rape. The 24 penal centers held over 10,000 prisoners;
 more than 90 percent of these were awaiting trial for an average of 22 months, with
 some waiting over 5 years (see Sections 1.d. and i.e.). Prison disturbances, caused
 primarily by harsh conditions, occurred throughout the year, resulting in deaths and
 injuries, the destruction of prison facilities, and mass escapes. In some instances,
 the Government placed army troops in temporary command of prisons until order
 was restored.
 In February approximately 25 inmates escaped from the jail in El Progreso, Yoro,
 which holds nearly 250 prisoners despite a designed capacity of 150. In August four
 murderers, including Nahum and Santos Padilla Bustillo, brothers convicted of
 homicide and other crimes, escaped from the prison in San Pedro Sula. Another 12
 prisoners fled from the San Pedro Sula facility in October. In December Juan
 Ramon Hernandez, an alleged major drug trafficker who headed a major criminal
 organization, bribed his way out of the new maximum security prison outside the
 capital, where he had been awaiting trial.
 The colonial-era central penitentiary in downtown Tegucigalpa suffered severe de-
 terioration, with some prisoners narrowly escaping death from collapsing walls, and
 was destroyed in October due to flooding caused by Hurricane Mitch. The Govern-
 ment opened a new central prison in Tamara, outside the capital, for prisoners who
 have been sentenced, but it proved no more secure than older prisons; sections of
 the new facility were closed to enhance overall security, and the Government
 launched an investigation into charges of corruption related to its construction. The
 new Ministry of Security is to assume responsibility for the prison system in early
 1999.
 The Government sought and secured assistance for its prisons from international
 sources. Mexico provided technical assistance to the prison -system, including the
 first rehabilitation program in the central penitentiary. The Government also allo-
 cated emergency funds for prisons and their staff as part of its efforts to combat
 rising crime, but improvements were not expected to be evident before 1999. Despite
 the decrepit condition of the prisons, the new civilian National Police showed in-
 creased respect for the human rights of the prisoners.
 More often than not, and for lack of alternative facilities, wardens housed the
 mentally ill and those with tuberculosis and other infectious diseases among the
 general prison population. Prisoners with money routinely bought private cells, de-
 cent food, and permission for conjugal visits, while prisoners without money often
 lacked the most basic necessities, as well as legal assistance. The prison system
 budgets just $0.43 (6 lempiras) per day for food and medicine for each prisoner.
 Prisoners were allowed visits, and in many cases relied on outside help to survive,
 as the prison system could not provide adequate or sufficient food. Street children
 in detention often were housed in adult prisons, where they were abused routinely.
 Women were incarcerated in separate facilities under conditions similar to those of
 male prisoners, except that female prisoners do not have conjugal visit privileges.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for protection against
 arbitrary arrest and detention; however, the authorities occasionally do not observe
 these legal requirements in practice. The law states that the police may arrest a
 person only with a court order, unless the arrest is made during the commission
 of a crime, and that they must clearly inform the person of the grounds for the ar-
 rest. By law the police cannot investigate; it only detains suspects. Police must bring
 a detainee before a judge within 24 hours; the judge then must issue an initial tem-
 porary holding order within 24 hours, make an initial decision within 6 days, and
 
 
 672
 conduct a preliminary investigation to decide whether there is sufficient evidence
 to warrant further investigation.
 While bail is legally available, it is granted primarily for ostensibly medical rea-
 sons; however, procedures in such cases are confused and unclear. Poor defendants,
 even when represented by a public defender, seldom are able to take advantage of
 bail (see Section i.e.). Lengthy pretrial detention is a-problem; more than 90 percent
 of prisoners are awaiting trial, some for over 5 years (see Sections l.c. and 1.e.).
 Under the 1984 Code of Criminal Procedures, judges, the police, public officials,
 or any citizen may initiate criminalproceedings. Perhaps as many as 80 percent of
 the ases reported to the police are never referred to the criminal justice system,
 but inste.ad are settled administratively by the poice or by the municipal courts.
 Neither the Constitution nor the legal code explicitly prohibit exile, but it is not
 used as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, the judiciary is often ineffective and subject to outside influence.
 While the Government respects the constitutional prvisions in principle, implemen-
 tation has been weak and uneven in practice. A number of factors limit the effec-
 tiveness of the system. Both the judiciary and the Public Ministry suffer from inad-
 equate funding, low wages make aw enforcement officials susceptible to bribery; the
 civil law inqisitorial 'system is both inefficient and nontransparent; and powerful
 special interests- still exercise influence and often prevail in many courts. Also,
 many leading politicians enjoy-constitutional immunity from prosecution because of
 their membership in either the National Congress or the Central American Par-
 liament. That immunity extends to acts committed before taking office.
 The court system is composed of a 9-member Supreme Court, 10 appeals courts,
 67 courts of first instance of general jurisdiction, and 325 justice of the peace courts
 of limited jurisdiction. Congress elects the nine Supreme Court justices and names
 the president of the Court; the Supreme Court, in turn, names all lower court
 judges. The 4-year term for justices of the Supreme Court coincides with those of
 the Congress and the President.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial. However, the written, in-
 quisitorial trial system is labor intensive, slow, and opaque; it does not protect the
 rights of defendants adequately. Judges legally are in charge of investigations, as
 well as of trials and sentencing. Both prosecutors working for the Public Ministry
 and private prosecutors may bring criminal charges against citizens. A judge may
 jail an accused person for 6 days before a determination is made of probable cause
 to accept charges. If a judge sustains the criminal accusation, the accused remains
 in jail, or may be released on bail while awaiting trial (see Section 1.d:).
 An accused person has the right to an initial hearing by a judge, to bail, to an
 attorney provided by the State, if necessary, and to appeal. Although the Constitu-
 tion recognizes the presumption of innocence, the Criminal Code in practice often
 is administered by poorly trained judges operating on a presumption that the ac-
 cused is guilty; consequently, the rights of defendants often are not observed. All
 stages of the trial process are conducted in writing and, at the judge's discretion,
 may be declared secret and, thus, even less "public" than normal.
 Defendants and their attorneys are- not always genuine participants in the proc-
 ess, despite rights accorded under law. Defendants may confront witnesses against
 them and present evidence on their own behalf, but only through the judge. By law,
 defendants and their attorneys -are entitled to review government-held evidence rel-
 evant to their cases, but this right is not always respected in practice.
 A public defender program provides service to those unable to afford an adequate
 defense. There are 137 public defenders providing free legal services nationally to
 37 percent of the prison population; however, public defenders are hard pressed to
 meet the heavy demands of a nonautomated, inadequately funded, and labor-inten-
 sive criminal justice system. The Supreme Court issued an instruction that holds
 judges personally accountable for reducing the number of backlogged cases; sepa-
 rates judges into pretrial investigative judges and trial and sentencing judges; and
 creates a program to monitor and enforce compliance with these measures. The
 Court's instruction was intended to ensure more effective protection for the rights
 of the accused to a timely and transparent defense, but it has had little effect to
 date.
 Detention of criminal suspects awaiting trial averaged 22 months and lengthy de-
 tention remained a serious problem. In 1996 the Government enacted a law regard-
 ing unsentenced prisoners that mandates the release from prison of any detainee
 whose case has not come to trial, and whose time under detention exceeds the maxi-
 mum prison sentence for the crime of which he is accused. Nonetheless, many pris-
 oners remain in jail after being acquitted or completing their sentences, due to the
 failure of responsible officials to process their releases. A significant number of de-
 
 
 fendants served the maximum possible sentence for the crime of which they were
 accused before their trials were concluded, or even begun. In September the Su-
 preme Court erroneously imposed a 15-year sentence on a detainee who had died
 4 years earlier. As of year's end, more than 90 percent of all prisoners had been
 neither tried nor sentenced.
 Modest progress was made in previous years towards implementing a judicial ca-
 reer system to enhance the qualifications of sitting judges, depoliticize the appoint-
 ment process, and break the subcultures of corruption, clientism, patronage, and in-
 fluence-peddling within the judiciary. Nonetheless, many courts remained staffed by
 politically selected judges and by unqualified clerks and were inefficient and subject
 to influence from special interests. In September the Attorney General made public
 a list of 31 judges who were under investigation for alleged corruption.
 Over the past 4 years, the Public Ministry has taken positive steps to investigate
 and charge not only military officers for human rights violations, but also ranking
 officials of the twoprevious governments, for abuses of power, fraud, and diversion
 of public funds and resources. However, at year's end, none of those accused had
 been tried or convicted.
 Following much-publicized investigations of alleged past and present human
 rights violations by national security personnel, judges in the civilian court system
 brought criminal charges in 1997 against a number of senior active or retired mili-
 tary officers for murder, attempted murder, and illegal detention during the 1980's.
 Nonetheless, the appellate courts dismissed all these cases for lack of evidence. Only
 four military officers accused of human rights violations have turned themselves in;
 three were acquitted and one awaits trial. Although the HOAF continued to profess
 respect for civilian court jurisdiction over its members, it vigorously promoted the
 right to amnesty of military personnel.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution specifies that a person's home is inviolable, and that persons in the em-
 ploy of the State may enter only with the owner's consent or with the prior author-
 ization of a competent legal authority. Entry may take place only between 6 a.m.
 and 6 p.m., or at any time in the event of an emergency or to prevent the commis-
 sion of a crime. However, as in previous years, there were credible charges that po-
 lice and armed forces personnel failed at times to obtain the needed authorization
 before entering a private home. Despite an improved system of "duty judges" and
 "duty prosecutors" to issue search warrants, coordination among the police, the
 courts, and the Public Ministry remained weak. The Government respects the pri-
 vacy of correspondence.
 In the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, President Flores temporarily suspended civil
 liberties pertaining to unlawful detention and privacy of the home; Congress allowed
 the suspension to lapse 4 weeks later on November 30.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the authorities largely respected these rights in practice. Jour-
 nalists admitted to self-censorship when their reporting threatened the political or
 economic interests of media owners. Although there was little serious investigative
 journalism, the news media were, at times, critical of certain government entities,
 including the HOAF and municipal officials. The news media themselves suffered
 from corruption and politicization. Credible reports existed of regular and substan-
 tial payments to journalists by public and political entities either to carry or sup-
 press certain stories.
 In April HOAF commander General Mario Hung Pacheco asked that a civil court
 order the arrest of CODEH president Ramon Custudio, charging that he forged doc-
 uments presented as evidence when Custodio prosecuted Hung in January for the
 1988 disappearance of student Roger Gonzales. The courts ultimately dismissed
 both complaints.
 The Government respects academic freedom and has not attempted to curtail po-
 litical expression on- university campuses.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religton.-The Constitution provides for all forms of religious ex-
 pression, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and e-
 patriation.-Citizens enter and exit the country without arbitrary impediment, and
 the Government does not restrict travel within the country's borders.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The Government
 
 
 674
 
 provides first asylum and grants asylum or refugee status in accordance with the
 terms of the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
 and its 1967 Protocol.
 There were -no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they
 feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens last exercised the right to change their government through democratic
 and peaceful means in the November 1997 elections. International observers found
 the elections to be free and fair.
 The President, three vice presidents, and the National Congress are chosen by
 free, secret, direct, and obligatory balloting every 4 years. In 1997 voters for the
 first time were able to cast separate ballots for the President, deputies in the Na-
 tional Congress, and municipal leaders, making individual elected officials more rep-
 resentative and accountable. Voting was made easier for citizens by a change that
 allowed them to vote closer to their homes.
 Suffrage is universal, but neither the clergy nor members of the military or civil-
 ian security forces are permitted to vote. Any citizen born in Honduras or abroad
 of Honduran parentage may-hold office, except for members of the clergy, the armed
 forces, and the police. A new political party may gain legal status by obtaining
 20,000 signatures and establishing party organizations in at least half of the coun-
 try's 18 departments.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation of women or minorities in
 government and politics; however, the proportion of women and minorities in politi-
 cal organizations and elective office is far lower than their overall represenhtaon in
 society. Women in the Government include one of the three vice presidents, two cab-
 inet ministers, and a Supreme Court justice, as well as a number of cabinet vice
 ministers and agency heads. Of the 128 deputies in the Congress, 10 are women.
 In the 1997 elections, for the first time a woman ran as the presidential candidate
 of a major political party.
 There were few indigenous persons in leadership positions in government or poli-
 tics; there are no members of Congress who state that they-are indigenous.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operates without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials genery cooperate with these groups and are responsive to their views.
 In 1996 the Congress ratified a presidential decree expanding the functions of the
 National Commissioner for Human Rights and unanimously reelected Leo
 Valladares to a 6-year term as National Commissioner. Under this decree, and in
 fulfillment of his expanded functions, the National Commissioner has free access to
 all civilian and military institutions and centers of detention, and is supposed to
 perform his functions with complete immunity and autonomy. However, efforts -by
 the National Commissioner to inspect military archives for evidence of past human
 rights violations were unsuccessful, as upon inspection the requisitioned file cabi-
 nets were literally empty.
 Anonymous telephone callers continued to threaten persons active in human
 rights endeavors. Commissioner Valladares and his family received numerous tele-
 phone threats. CODEH president Ramon Custodio and Bertha Oliva de Nativi, gen-
 eral coordinator of the Committee of Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared in
 Honduras (COFADEH), also received numerous telephone threats. Attorney General
 Edmundo Orellana and Comptroller General Vera Rubi reported threats against
 themselves and their families due to their investigations into high-level corruption.
 The HOAF commander and the CODEH president filed defamation suits against
 each other in the courts over public declarations by both, but the courts ultimately
 dismissed both complaints (see Section 2.a.).
 In March the commander created the post of armed forces human rights ombuds-
 man to supervise the incorporation of human rights training into all the military
 education curriculums.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution bans discrimination based on race or sex. Although it also bans
 discrimination on the basis of class, in fact, the political, military, and social elites
 generally enjoyed impunity before the legal system. Members of these groups rarely
 were arrested or jailed; legislators enjoy legal immunity. Although the Government
 detained two officials of the former Callejas administration, Jose Tomas Guillen Wil-
 
 
 675
 liams and Luciano Coello, on charges of corruption and abuse of authority in 1996,
 both remained in the central penitentiary in Tegucigalpa and have not yet been
 brought to trial.
 Women.-Violence against women remained widespread. The Penal Code was
 amended in 1997 to classify domestic violence and sexual harassment as crimes,
 with penalties of 2 to 4 years' and 1 to 3 years' imprisonment, respectively. Most
 such violence took place within the family. The penalties for rape are relatively
 light, ranging from 3 to 9 years' imprisonment. Under pressure from women's advo-
 cacy and reform groups, the Congress in 1997 enacted a Law Against Domestic Vio-
 lence to strengthen the rights of women and increase the penalties for crimes of do-
 mestic violence. The new law allows the Government to protect battered women
 through such emergency measures as detaining an aggessor or separating him tem-
 porarily from the victim's home. All rapes are considered public crimes, so a rapist
 can be prosecuted even if he marries his victim.
 There are few shelters specifically maintained for battered women. The Govern-
 ment operates 1 shelter that can accommodate 10 women and their families. Six pri-
 vate centers for battered women opened in 1996, offering legal, medical, and psycho-
 logical assistance, but not physical shelter. In 1998 some 3,000 women took action
 under the Law Against Domestic Violence, but their cases remained p ending be-
 cause the Government has not yet created the special courts authorized by that law.
 The Government attempted to remedy this situation by working with women's
 groups to provide specialized training to police officials on enforcing the Law
 Against Domestic Violence. Sexual harassment in the workplace also continued to
 be a problem.
 Women were represented in at least small numbers in most professions, hut cul-
 tural attitudes limited their career opportunities. In theory, women have equal ac-
 cess to educational opportunities, but famly pre ess often impede the ambitions
 of women intent on obtaining a higher education. The law requires employers to pay
 women, who make up 51 percent of the work force, equal wages for equal work, but
 employers often classif women's jobs as less demanding than those of men in order
 to justify paying them lower salaries.
 Some organizations have begun to offer assistance to women, principally targeting
 those who live in rural areas and in marginal neighborhoods of cities. For example,
 the Honduran Federation of Women's Associations provided home construction and
 improvement loans, offered free legal assistance, and lobbied the Government on
 women s causes. The Center for the Investigation and Promotion of Human ignts
 continued to operate a program to make women aware of their rights under the law.
 Women advanced significantly in some professions. For the first time, the HOAF
 and National Police academies accepted female recruits; women at the air force
 academy also received aeronautical training for the first time. In September Reyna
 Dinora Aceituno was elected secretary general of the Confederation of Honduran
 Workers (CT), the country's second largest labor confederation. Aceituno is the
 first woman to head a national labor confederation. In March the Government
 granted cabinet-level status to its Office of Women's Affairs.
 Children.-Although the Government allocated 38 percent of its 1999 budget to
 public education and health care, this was insufficient to address the needs of the
 nation's youth. The Government provides free, universal, and compulsory education
 through the age of 10. The Government estimated that up to 175,000 children each
 year fail to receive schooling of any kind. The Government announced in November
 that it would seek to increase the minimum required education for minors to the
 12th grade by the year 2005.
 The Government was unable to prevent the abuse of street children (see Section
 1.c.) and child laborers (see Section 6.d.). The Government raised its estimate of
 street children to 8,000, only half of whom have shelter on any given day. Many
 street children have been molested sexually, and about 40 percent regularly engaged
 in prostitution. Approximately 30 percent of the street children in Tegucigalpa and
 San Pedro Sula, the two population centers, were HIV-positive. At least 40 percent
 were addicted to sniffing glue. Over 75 percent of the street children found their
 way to the streets because of severe family problems; 30 percent simply were aban-
 doned. The number of children on the street increased substantially due to Hurri-
 cane Mitch. Both the police and members of the general population engaged in vio-
 lence against street chmdrea een the authorities arrested minors charged with
 the commission of capital and other serious crimes, they were housed with adult de-
 tainees who often abused them.
 In 1996 the Government opened juvenile centers in Tamara, El Carmen, and El
 Hatillo (located in sections ofTegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula). Nonetheless, a gen-
 eral lack of juvenile detention facilities contributed to the detention of minors in
 adult prisons, and to vigilante violence against, and police abuse of, street children.
 
 
 676
 Over 100 street children or members of youth gangs were murdered in the streets.
 Human rights groups implicated out-of-uniform security force personnel in some ju-
 venile deaths.
 Covenant House of Honduras, an organization dedicated to children's rights, ex-
 posed an alleged kidnaping ring that employed as many as 200 children as drug
 couriers to, or as prostitutes in, Canada. Police and congressional investigations en-
 sued. In 1997 Covenant House brought charges before the Public Ministry against
 unnamed members of the armed forces and the police for the alleged torture of 63
 juveniles or 'minors, 35 of whom reportedly were murdered, since 1990. The Govern-
 ment took no action in this instance. There was no progress in the case of police
 agents who were detained and placed under investigation for detaining and beating
 youths in October 1997.
 New legislation covering children and adolescents took effect in 1996, covering the
 rights, liberties, and protection of children, including in the area of child labor (see
 Section 6.d.). It established prison sentences of up to 3 years for persons convicted
 of child abuse. In September the Government launched a National Commission for
 the Gradual and Progressive Eradication of Child Labor, comprising government
 ministries, official family, welfare agencies, and local NGO's (see Section 6.d.). Also
 in September, the Government for the sixth consecutive year convened a national
 children's congress at which boys and girls from across the country, including street
 children, discussed issues affecting the nation's youth.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no formal barriers to participation by an esti-
 mated 300,000 disabled persons in employment, education, or health care, but nei-
 ther is there specific statutory or constitutional protection for them. There is no leg-
 islation that requires access by disabled persons to government buildings or com-
 mercial establishments.
 Indigenous -People.-The small communities of indigenous people have little or no
 ability to participate in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the
 allocation of natural resources. Indigenous land rights are communal. While the law
 permits persons to claim individual freeholding titles, this is difficult to accomplish
 in practice. Tribal lands often are defined poorly in documents dating back to the
 mid-19th century and, in most cases, lack any legal title based on modern cadastral
 measurements. The Honduran Forestry Development Corporation (COHDEFOR)
 makes all decisions regarding exploitation of timber resources on indigenous lands,
 often over strenuous tribal objections.
 The lack of clear title by indigenous groups to public lands that they occupy often
 leads to conflicts between such groups and COHDEFOR and other government enti-
 ties. However, such disputes are equally common between COHDEFOR and non-
 indigenous groups, and COHDEFOR is working with numerous indigenous groups
 on management plans for public and tribal lands that they occupy. In view of the
 absence of clear land titles and their unequal access to legal recourse, indigenous
 groups also are vulnerable to the regular usurpation of their property rights by non-
 indigenous farmers and cattle ranchers. Expanded coverage of the national cadaster,
 property titling, and government land registries is reducing this vulnerability.
 The courts commonly denied legal recourse to indigenous groups and often showed
 bias in favor of nonindigenous.,parties of means and influence. Failure to obtain
 legal redress frequently caused indigenous groups to attempt to regain land through
 invasions of private property, which usually provoked the authorities into retaliat-
 ing forcefully.                                                   .
 The Government generally is responsive to indigenous land claims, but numerous
 cases remained unresolved because of conflicting claims by nonindigenous persons.
 During the year, the Government issued over 100 land titles, encompassing over
 250,000 acres, to various indigenous groups. An additional 170 land claims by indig-
 enous people were under adjudication at year's end. The Government issued over
 20,000 individual land titles in 1997, benefiting many indigenous families. Indige-
 nous groups nonetheless charged that the Government had fulfilled barely 20 per-
 cent of its 1997 commitments in this area.
 In 1997 Candido Amador Recinos, a leader of the Chorti indigenous group active
 in efforts to acquire claimed tribal lands, was murdered in Corralitos; there has
 been no progress in the investigation of his death. Also in 1997, after a month of
 nationwide protests by indigenous organizations that included a hunger strike, the
 Government signed a 22-point agreement with representatives of various groups
 that made available 9 initial land grants of about 22,000 acres each to different
 tribes, granted some contested land titles outright to indigenous petitioners, and set
 aside $15,385 (200,000 lempiras) in government funds for indigenous housing. The
 Congress also created a commission to study indigenous land claims, which often
 conflict with the claims of small farmers.

 Indigenous groups objected to a proposed Constitutional amendment to permit for-
 eigners to own and develop the country's coastal areas and territory abutting its
 land frontiers. The Government sought to spur domestic economic growth and pro-
 vide job opportunities for indigenous persons by attracting new foreign investment
 and tourism to such areas, but the indigenous groups asserted that the proposed
 amendment would vitiate indigenous claims to ancestral lands anddeprive indige-
 nous people living in the areas affected of their access to those zones. In December
 the Congress approved the proposed amendment, and a second vote required for its
 ratification was scheduled for early 1999.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to form and join labor
 unions; the unions are independent of the Government and political parties. Most
 peasant organizations are affiliated directly with the labor movement. Unions fre-
 quently hold public demonstrations against government policies and make extensive
 use of the news media to advance their views. However, only about 14 percent of
 the work force is unionized, and the economic and political influence of organized
 labor has diminished in recent years.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, along with a wide range of other
 basic labor rights, which the authorities honor in practice. However, the Civil Serv-
 ice Code denies the'right to strike to all government workers, other than employees
 of state-owned enterprises. Public sector employees in the fields of health and edu-
 cation conducted illegal work stoppages during the year.
 A number of private firms have instituted "solidarity" associations, essentially
 aimed at providing credit and other services to workers and managers who are
 members of the associations. Representatives of organized labor groups criticize
 these associations, asserting that they do not permit strikes, have inadequate griev-
 ance procedures, and neutralize genuine, representative trade unions.
 The three national labor confederations maintain close ties with various inter-
 national trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law protects worker
 rights to organize and to bargain collectively; collective bargaining agreements are
 the norm for companies in which workers are organized. However, although the
 Labor Code prohibits retribution by employers for trade union activity, it is a com-
 mon occurrence. Some employers have threatened to close down unionized compa-
 nies and have harassed workers seeking to unionize, in some cases dismissing them
 outright. The labor courts are considering hundreds of appeals from workers seeking
 reinstatement and back wages from companies that fired them for engaging in
 union organizing activities. However, once a union is recognized, employers actually
 dismiss relatively few workers for union activity. Nonetheless, such cases serve to
 discourage workers elsewhere from attempting to organize.
 Workers in both unionized and nonunionized companies are protected by the
 Labor Code, which gives them the right to seek redress from the Ministry of Labor.
 The Ministry took action in several cases, pressuring employers to observe the code.
 Labor or civil courts can require employers to rehire employees fired for union activ-
 ity, but such rulings are uncommon. Agreements between management and unions
 generally contain a clause prohibiting retaliation against any worker who partici-
 pates in a strike or other union activity.
 The Banco de Trabajadores reinstated two workers who had unionized the bank.
 The firm had fired the workers in 1997 but rehired them at their former salaries
 under a court order. However, it assigned them to an empty office and denied them
 the opportunity to work. The bank had refused to cooperate with an investigation
 into these circumstances by the National Commissioner for Human Rights, who
 threatened to pursue legal action against the bank. The Government also had seized
 control of the bank's records and threatened to arrest bank officials for noncompli-
 ance with the court's edict.
 The Labor Code explicitly prohibits blacklisting. Nevertheless, there was credible
 evidence that informal blacklisting occurred in the privately owned industrial parks.
 When unions are formed, organizers must submit a list of initial members to the
 Ministry of Labor as part of the process of obtaining official recognition. However,
 before official recognition is granted, the Ministry must inform the company of the
 impending union organization. The Ministry has not always been able to provide ef-
 fective protection to workers. There were credible reports, particularly in the Export
 Processing Zone (EPZ) sector, that some inspectors had gone so far as to sell the
 names of employees involved in forming a union to companies that then dismissed
 union organizers before the Ministry could recognize the unions.
 The same labor regulations apply in EPZ's as in the rest of private industry.
 Unions are active in the government-owned Puerto Cortes free trade zone (7 of 11
 
 
 678
 maquiladoras there are unionized), but factory owners have resisted efforts to orga-
 nize the privately  owned   industrial parks. The Honduran    Association  of
 Maquiladores (AHM) over thepast 3 years has sponsored seminars and other meet-
 ings between its members an major labor groups. As a result, tensions have de-
 clined, and some two dozen plants have unionized peacefully in the privately owned
 EPZ's.
 In 1997 the AHM adopted a voluntary code of conduct governing salaries and
 working conditions in the industry and recognizing workers right to organize. Al-
 though local unions were not consulted during the drafting process and have no for-
 mal role in its implementation, the code nonetheless represented a public commit-
 ment by apparel manufacturers to abide by local laws and regulations governing
 their industries. It provided a starting point for a dialog among the AHM, organized
 labor, and the Government. The attitude of the Government towards organized labor
 in the EPZ's is the same as regards other industries.
 In a number of maquiladora plants, workers have shown little enthusiasm for
 unionizing, since they consider their treatment, salary, and working conditions to
 be as good as, or better than, those in unionized plants. In the absence of unions
 and collective bargaining, several EPZ plants have instituted solidarity associations
 that, to some extent, function as "company unions" for the purposes of setting wages
 and negotiating working conditions. Other EPZ plants use the minimum wage to set
 starting salaries, and-adjust wage scales by negotiating with common groups of
 plant workers and other employees, based on seniority, skills, categories of work,
 and other criteria.
 In 1997 a South Korean-owned maquiladora plant agreed to permit an independ-
 ent monitoring group composed of religious, huan rights, and women's organiza-
 tions to inspect its facility and observe the working conditions of its employees. The
 national labor confederations objected to the agreement-because it excluded them,
 while other maquiladoras observed that the monitors lacked relevant expertise in
 the industry. Plant officials gave the independent monitors office space on the prem-
 ises in 1997, but withdrew it in June. However, they continued to allow periodic vis-
 its by the monitors, who have provided assistance to the local union during contract
 ne otiations.
 abor leaders blame the Government for allowing private companies to act con-
 trary to the Labor Code and expect the problem to continue until the Ministry of
 Labor is reorganized to make it more efficient. They criticize the Ministry for not
 enforcing the  aor Code, for taking too ion to make decisions, and for being timid
 and indifferent to workers' needs. A 1995 Memorandum of Understanding between
 the Ministry of Labor and the Office of the United States Trade Representative call-
 ing for greater enforcement of the Labor Code resulted in some progress. However,
 labor unions charged that the Ministry has made insufficient progress towards en-
 forcing the code, especially in training its labor inspectors and in conducting inspec-
 tions of the maquiladora industry. The Government has acknowledged that it does
 not yet adhere completely to international labor standards and in 1997 agreed,
 along with other Central American nations, to fund a regional program to modernize
 the inspection and labor management functions of the Ministry of Labor.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and the law pro-
 hibit forced or compulsory labor, and this applies equally to children. Although there
 were no official reports of such practices in the area of child labor, there were credi-
 ble allegations of compulsory overtime at EPZ plants, particularly for women, who
 make up an estimated 80 percent of the work force in the maquiladora sector.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution and the Labor Code prohibit the employment of minors under the age of
 16, except that a child who is 15 years of age is permitted to work with parental
 and Ministry of Labor permission. The Children's Code prohibits a child of 14 years
 of age or less from working, even with parental permission, and establishes prison
 sentences of 3 to 5 years for individuals who allow children to work illegally. An
 employer who legally hires a 15-year-old must certify that the child has finished or
 is finishing the required compulsory schooling. The Ministry of Labor grants a lim-
 ited number of work permits to 15-year-olds each year.
 The Ministry of Labor cannot effectively enforce child labor laws outside the
 maquiladora sector, and violations of the Labor Code occur frequently in rural areas
 and in small companies. According to the Ministry, human rights groups, and chil-
 dren's rights organizations, an estimated 350,000 children work illegally. The most
 significant child labor problem is in the construction industry. Many children also
 work on small family farms, as street vendors, or in small workshops to supplement
 the family income.
 The employment of children under the legal working age in the maquiladora sec-
 tor may occur, but not on a large scale. (Younger children sometimes obtain legiti-
 
 
 mate work permits by fraud or purchase forged permits.) The maquiladoras in re-
 cent years have raised their minimum employment age, and some hire only at age
 18 or above, reducing the number of legal job opportunities available to persons
 under 18 years of age.
 In September the Government created a National Commission for the Gradual
 and Progressive Eradication of Child Labor (see Section 5). Forced or compulsory
 labor is prohibited, including that performed by children, and there were no reports
 of its practice (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In January the Government decreed a median
 17 percent increase in the minimum wage. Daily pay rates vary by geographic zone
 and the sector of the economy affected; urban workers earn slightly more than work-
 ers in the countryside. The lowest minimum wage occurs in the nonexport agricul-
 tural sector, where it ranges from $2.12 to $2.62 (28.65 to 35.40 lempiras) per day,
 depending on whether the employer has more than 15 employees; the highest mini-
 mum wage is $3.47 (46.80 lempiras) per day in the export sector. All workers are
 entitled to an additional month's salary in June and December of each year. The
 Constitution and the Labor Code stipulate that all labor must be paid fairly, but
 the Ministry of Labor lacks the personnel and other resources for effective enforce-
 ment. The minimum wage is insufficient to provide a standard of living above the
 poverty line for a worker and family. Labor leaders claimed that the Government
 was ignoring salary issues for workers earning above the minimum wage (for exam-
 ple, those in the maquiladoras and in other industries, such as banking), and called
 for an across-the-board increase of 40 percent for all workers.
 The law prescribes a maximum 8-hour workday and a 44-hour workweek. There
 is a requirement of at least one 24-hour rest period every 8 days. The Labor Code
 provides for a paid vacation of 10 workdays after 1 year, and of 20 workdays after
 4 years. However, employers frequently ignored these regulations due to the high
 level of unemployment and underemployment and the lack of effective enforcement
 by the Labor Ministry.
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing national health and safety laws,
 but does not do so effectively. Although fewer than in previous years, some com-
 plaints alleged the failure of foreign factory managers to comply with the occupa-
 tional health and safety aspects of Labor Code regulations in factories located in the
 EPZ's and private industrial parks. There is no provision allowing a worker to leave
 a dangerous work situation without jeopardy to continued employment.
