 AFGHANISTAN
 Afghanistan is a remote, landlocked, and resource-poor country
 whose population primarily engages in subsistence agriculture.
 One of the world's least economically developed and socially
 integrated nations, Afghanistan contains a mosaic of ethnic and
 tribal groups whose kinship ties cross national borders. While
 sharing a fundamental belief in Islam, Afghanistan's population
 is divided by ethnic, regional, tribal, and sectarian
 cleavages. Independent, xenophobic, and famous for their
 fractiousness, Afghans traditionally unite only in the face of
 foreign invasion or a perceived threat to their conservative
 Islamic beliefs.
 The last Afghan king, Zahir Shah, was deposed in 1973 by his
 cousin, Mohammad Daoud, who established a republican-style
 Government. In 1978 this Government was overthrown by a
 Marxist coup staged by the Khalq faction of the small People's
 Democratic Party of Afghanistan. The first Marxist president,
 Nur Mohammad Taraki, was subsequently deposed in September 1979
 by his Prime Minister, Hafizullah Amin. In December 1979
 Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan, killed President Amin and
 his family, and installed a puppet regime led by Babrak Karmal
 of the minority Parcham faction of the ruling Party.
 Strong resistance to the regime and the Soviet invasion
 developed quickly and has spread and grown. Armed opposition
 by the mujahidin (freedom fighters) is now countrywide,
 although the various resistance groups are not united.
 Soviet advisors have moved into controlling positions in the
 Afghan government ministries, in the army, and in the organs of
 the security apparatus and are involved in all significant
 decisions. The Sovietization of important institutions such as
 industries, the media, and the educational system, is now
 complete. The Soviets control the central Government of
 Afghanistan. They appear to have no intention of withdrawing
 their soldiers nor their influence.
 The most pervasive and systematic violator of Afghan human
 rights is the Kabul regime's 20,000-strong secret police
 organization, known officially as the State Information
 Services and unofficially by its Persian acronym, KHAD. KHAD'S
 chief, Dr. Najibullah, is a Party politburo member and a
 Parcham faction leader. Najibullah presides over a
 multi-faceted organization which is modeled upon the Soviet KGB
 and is responsible for foreign and domestic intelligence
 collection and clandestine operations; for maintaining public
 order through surveillance, arrest, imprisonment,
 interrogation, torture, trial, and sentencing; and even, via
 its military wing, for the conduct of the Soviet-sponsored
 war. In a closed society, and with no rival institution
 capable of checking its influence, KHAD is the law in Kabul and
 other cities and towns controlled by the regime. KGB officers
 are assigned to every major department of KHAD, from the
 director's office down, and all major KHAD operations require
 Soviet approval before implementation. In effect, KHAD has
 become an increasingly efficient agent of terror and repression
 and a prime tool for Soviet control of the Afghan population.

 Violations of human rights in Afghanistan take place in the
 context of a bitter war between a martial and highly
 independent people and a powerful and determined invader. The
 Soviet Union seeks not only to dominate Afghanistan militarily,
 but to convert that traditional and highly uncentralized Muslim
 society into a modern communist state. To achieve this, the
 Soviets are using not only military force, Soviet
 decision-makers in all major Afghan government offices, and an
 all-pervasive secret police apparatus, but also a large-scale,
 long-term program of training and indoctrinating Afghan young
 people and children in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc
 countries. This multi-faceted effort is supported by the small
 corps of communists who make up the party. Party leaders claim
 approximately 60,000 members, which would constitute only .4
 percent of the Afghan population, estimated to have been 15
 million before the Soviet invasion. The overwhelming majority
 of Afghans has chosen to resist the Soviets and their puppet
 regime. The result of this conflict is the tearing apart of
 Afghanistan and above all, the inflicting of great hardship on
 the general population.
 The scope and efficiency of the secret police are increasing in
 areas of the country under regime control. The result is the
 creation of a pervasive atmosphere of mutual suspicion and fear
 in the cities and towns controlled by the regime. Tensions in
 urban areas are heightened by the systematic violation of the
 sanctity of the home by military and secret police forces
 searching for arms, new recruits, loot, and political
 opponents. In the countryside, where the regime's control is
 generally minimal or non-existent, a different order of human
 rights is being violated. The population in war zones suffers
 loss of property and life from increasingly frequent
 bombardments by regime and Soviet forces, from being caught in
 crossfires, and from exactions by regime and Soviet forces as
 well as by elements of the resistance.
 While the beginning of the Babrak Karmal regime was less
 repressive and brutal than the Taraki/Amin period, with many
 political prisoners being released from prisons, the Karmal
 regime has grown more repressive with time and this trend
 appears to be accelerating. With the Soviet military
 offensives of 1982 the civilian population throughout
 Afghanistan suffered greater devastation than ever before. As
 KHAD's power and efficiency increase, so does its control over
 the population; as the Afghan army's need for recruits
 continues to be a major problem, so sweeps for draft-age men
 will continue. Thus the situation for human rights in
 Afghanistan is likely to deteriorate still further as the
 struggle continues between the Soviet and Babrak regime forces
 on one hand and the mujahidin on the other.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Continuing inability to crush the Afghan resistance in 1982 has
 led Soviet forces and the puppet Babrak Karmal regime
 increasingly to target and kill the civilian populace in areas
 of high mujahidin activity. The residential neighborhoods of
 
 
 1074
 Kandahar, Afghanistan's second largest city, were heavily
 bombarded in early 1982 with high civilian casualties. Later
 in the year the towns and villages of the strategic Panjsher
 Valley were bombed and rocketed until some villages and many
 dwellings were destroyed. Not far from Kabul, the villages of
 the Lowgar Valley to the south, the resort town of Paghman to
 the northeast, and the villages of the Shomali region to the
 north have suffered months of bombing, rocketing, and shelling
 in 1982. While no sure estimate of casualties is possible,
 survivors speak of thousands killed or wounded, primarily women
 and children.
 Survivors also relate the savagery and lack of regard for life
 shown by Soviet troops searching for resistance fighters,
 weapons, and loot. There are numerous accounts which are given
 wide credence of rape, butchery, and looting by Soviet troops
 sent into Kandahar following the bombing last January. There
 are also eyewitness reports of unprovoked murders in the
 Shomali region. In one Shomali village, according to reliable
 sources, all males over the age of ten were shot in the
 presence of their female relatives. On another occasion,
 Soviet soldiers blew the front door off a house with a tank
 round and machine-gunned an elderly man for his money. In
 another incident an 18 year-old boy was shot dead by Soviets in
 front of his mother and the equivalent of $70 taken from his
 body.
 Summary execution is not uncommon on the battlefield and in
 Afghan prisons. After interrogation, captured mujahidin are
 often killed out of hand, as are Afghan soldiers attempting to
 defect to the resistance. In mid-1982, over a dozen imprisoned
 members of an extreme leftist group opposed to the regime were
 taken from their cells and machine-gunned by prison officials
 in retaliation for a series of assassinations reportedly
 carried out by other members of the organization.
 The mujahidin have responded in kind. At the beginning of the
 conflict resistance fighters usually killed captured Soviet
 prisoners. More recently, however, some resistance leaders
 have kept Soviet prisoners in their custody. Beginning in
 1982, some captured Soviet soliders have been transferred to
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for
 internment in Switzerland. Afghan soldiers who are taken
 prisoner are usually given the option of changing sides. In
 urban areas, including the capital, resistance assassination of
 Soviets, Afghan communists, and other figures sympathetic to
 the regime are daily occurrences. There are also credible
 reports of occasional fights and assassinations between rival
 resistance groups.
 b. Disappearance
 Though not as frequent as during predecessor communist
 governments, disappearance of citizens under the current regime
 remains commonplace. Many who disappear are picked up by KHAD
 but many others are caught in frequent sweeps to round up men
 for military service. In efforts to increase the size of the
 army in 1982 there was a series of revisions to the draft laws
 which extended the tour of duty for regular recruits by six
 months to three years. Other reservists had their present
 
 
 1075
 tours extended, and another class of reservists became eligible
 for duty when the age ceiling was raised from 35 to 39. The
 net effect was a sizable increase in desertions, forcing the
 army to use even more sweep operations to find recruits. Even
 though the legal draft age is 19, many younger boys along with
 older men are seized on the street and dragooned into military
 service. Relatives often do not know whether a person has been
 forcibly conscripted or taken by the KHAD and imprisoned for
 real or imagined crimes against the regime. Families sometimes
 learn that relatives have been imprisoned through requests for
 money, food, or clothes passed along by prison guards or
 released prisoners. In some cases, relatives and friends of
 the detainee are allowed short and regular visits.
 c. Torture
 Afghan security services clearly resort to torture as a means
 of interrogation and punishment, often in the presence of
 Soviet advisers. Refugees frequently refer to torture in
 recounting their experiences, and foreign prisoners have
 observed the frequent presence in interrogation rooms of the
 torturer's paraphenalia such as electrodes for administering
 electric shocks. In addition to electric shock, often applied
 to the genitals, beatings, and sexual violations, one
 eyewitness reported seeing prisoners kept in neck-deep water
 for ten hours at a time in early 1982.
 One Afghan who was held for eight days in April 1982 in the
 KHAD detention center in the Prime Ministry told of the torture
 thot was inflicted on his cellmates. One young man had had his
 head beaten against a wall, had had electric shock, his nails
 broken and pulled out, and had not been allowed to sleep for
 four days. A hunchback had been repeatedly picked up and thrown
 against a wall. Another inmate's face was grossly swollen from
 belt beatings, and his hands were swollen and broken from
 continuous blows from rifle butts.
 To what extent torture is being used by both sides on
 Afghanistan's battlefields cannot be estimated. While
 resistance groups occasionally allow the transfer of Soviet
 prisoners to Pakistan, a more common fate is summary execution,
 sometimes preceded by mutilation such as blinding, docking of
 ears, amputation of noses, castration, and flaying. There are
 reports of similar treatment meted out to officers of the
 ruling party captured in the Panjsher Valley during the
 Soviet/regime offensive to crush the resistance in that area in
 May and June 1982.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Conditions at the Pol-e-Charkhi prison near Kabul, the largest
 in the country, vary from acceptable, by traditional Afghan
 norms, to conditions constituting extreme violations of human
 rights. The food is inadequate, cells overcrowded, and
 sanitary facilities virtually non-existent, but the majority of
 prisoners are allowed the freedom of the central courtyard
 during the day and may receive food, laundry, and money sent by
 relatives. A smaller number of prisoners, primarily foreigners
 or relatives of officials from the previous two communist
 governments, are accorded better quarters, food, and other
 
 
 1076
 privileges. Other prisoners, however, according to reliable
 reports, are kept in darkness and solitary confinement.
 According to an eyewitness account, prisoners are sometimes
 bound so tightly and for so long that they are unable to feed
 themselves when freed from their bonds. Bad as they are at the
 Pol-e-Charki prison, conditions at the Kabul city jail, the
 detention cells at the Prime Ministry, and various KHAD
 installations in Kabul appear to be considerably worse, leading
 some prisoners to bribe officials in order to be transferred to
 Pol-e-Charkhi prison. One man who was held and then released
 from the Prime Ministry detention center spoke of huge cells,
 holding three to four hundred prisoners, with no room for the
 inmates to sit or lie down. Similar cells held equal numbers
 of women. Information about conditions inside provincial
 prisons, which are often the targets of resistance'attacks, is
 limited, but they appear to be very grim.
 Cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of the civilian
 population is commonplace in areas of active fighting between
 mujahidin and Soviet/regime forces. For example, from May
 through September, villages in the Panjsher Valley were reduced
 to rubble by constant bombings, the burning of grain and other
 foodstuffs, and the intentional killing of livestock. Both in
 the Paghman and Shomali regions in summer 1982 Soviet soldiers
 burned stocks of grain, slaughtered livestock, looted
 valuables, and despoiled what food they did not steal from
 houses. In violation of Afghan and Islamic norms, Soviet
 patrols also searched and occasionally abducted women from
 villages in the Shomali.
 Security forces continue to use air-dropped anti-personnel
 mines in areas of suspected resistance activity. During a
 mid-1982 withdrawal from the upper Panjsher Valley, Soviet and
 Afghan forces left behind booby-trapped houses, weapons, and
 household items. Non-lethal chemicals such as riot-control
 agents, irritants, and incapacitants have been used regularly
 by the Soviets in Afghanistan. In November 1982, the
 Department of State issued an updated report on the Soviet use
 of chemical warfare in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan which
 gives convincing evidence on the continued selective Soviet
 employment of lethal chemical weapons against the mujahidin in
 1982. Analysis of two contaminated Soviet gas masks acquired
 in Afghanistan shows the use of the deadly trichothecene
 mycotixins ('yellow rain'). There are reports that Soviet
 soldiers poisoned underground waterways in Lowgar Province
 where the mujahidin were hiding. Other reports note nerve
 gases and crystals, often dropped from airplanes or helicopters.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment continue to be a pervasive
 fact of day-to-day life in Afghanistan. The number of
 political detainees is difficult to estimate since the Babrak
 regime seldom distinguishes political from common criminals.
 In Kabul there are probably between 20,000 and 25,000 inmates
 in the Pol-e-Charkhi prison, a further 400 at the KHAD
 detention center in the Prime Ministry, and an undetermined
 number in the dozen or so houses and offices which the KHAD has
 converted into jails. A substantial portion of those held at
 Pol-e-Charkhi are believed to be political prisoners, and the
 
 
 1077
 vast majority in the KHAD's detention centers are there for
 alleged political offenses.
 Afghans in regime-controlled areas live in constant fear of
 arbitary and often inexplicable arrest. In one case, an Afghan
 white-collar worker was held without charge for three months in
 mid-1982, after having been picked up in a neighborhood
 search. During his confinement, in several KHAD detention
 centers, he was questioned only occasionally, and always on
 subjects other than his presence in the suspect neighborhood,
 without any explanation whatever. Afghans with less education
 have commented in bewilderment to fellow prisoners that they,
 have no idea why they are in jail.
 The corruption which permeates KHAD sometimes alleviates some
 of the system's cruelty, at least for those with money and a
 measure of influence. Middle class Afghans often pay large
 bribes to KHAD officers and *judges' in the hope of obtaining
 the release of a relative or friend on one of the national
 holidays when acts of clemency are traditional. Prominent
 Afghans who are not co-opted into the system are sometimes able
 to intervene successfully with friends and relations in high
 regime places to secure the release of political detainees or
 to avoid being arrested themselves. As often as not, however,
 KHAD officers take their bribes and then fail to do what they
 promised.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most of those accused of non-political offenses are apparently
 tried in the civil court system under the norms of
 pre-communist judicial codes. All courts, whether civil,
 military, or secret police, are controlled by the regime. The
 Law of the Organization and Jurisdiction of the Courts of the
 Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, issued in 1981, sets out as
 the first priority of the system 'the safeguarding and
 protection of the gains of the Saur Revolution." One
 consequence is that plaintiffs may be denied due judicial
 process because of their political beliefs or social position.
 Often imprisoned for months without trial, Afghan political
 prisoners are tried and sentenced, in secret with KHAD playing
 a major role. On the rare occasions when foreigners are
 accused of political crimes, they are given a 'defense lawyer,*
 but are not allowed to question regime witnesses, whose
 testimony is invariably accepted as fact by the court.
 The Afghan regime occasionally uses its judicial process as
 part of its unrelenting propaganda effort. In the summer of
 1981, Kabul TV viewers were shown a previously filmed "trial'
 of the British archeologist, Pinder-Wilson, who, after being
 picked up and held incommunicado for several months, was tried
 on the charges of having smuggled artifacts out of Afghanistan,
 of giving false information to the Western news media, and of
 aiding Afghans to flee the country. The judicial process was a
 sham; in the end he was expelled on Eabrak Karmal's personal
 order. All this had been worked out before, not according to
 law, but at the whim of the omnipresent secret police.
 Journalists' accounts from the Panjsher Valley confirm that at
 least some resistance groups have established prisons for
 
 
 1078
 captured Soviet and Afghan military detainees, and that there
 are now resistance 'courts' for judging offenders. Little is
 known of the working of these bodies, although they are
 believed to be based on Islamic jurisprudence.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Forced entry into private homes, both by day and by night, is a
 regular occurrence in Afghan cities and towns, and in rural
 villages suspected of harboring mujahidin. Official intruders
 include military press gangs looking for new recruits or draft
 evaders; army, police, or party cadres searching for hidden
 weapons; secret police or party functionaries pursuing leads on
 regime opponents; and Soviet and Babrak Karmal soldiers seeking
 loot. The Afghan populace universally assumes that the secret
 police monitor phone calls, and there is no question that
 incoming and outgoing international mail is opened by the
 regime.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 All the information media are controlled by the regime and its
 Soviet decision-makers, who assert tight control over content.
 The press, radio, and television are used solely to convey and
 reflect regime policy and Soviet views of world events.
 Criticism of the regime or the USSR is not permitted. In
 mid-1982, the regime forbade the unlicensed importation and
 sale of all foreign video and music tapes, magazines, books,
 posters, and other publications on the expressed grounds that
 they might contain material contrary to 'religion and
 traditional Afghan values.*
 In Kabul and other cities, "shabnamas" or "night letters,*
 which are a traditional Afghan means of expressing political
 dissent, circulate surreptitiously. The regime considers the
 printing and circulation of such handbills to be criminal. In
 mid-1982 a student suspected of circulating night letters was
 sentenced to five years imprisonment. There are also several
 small, clandestine radio transmitters operated by the
 resistance which broadcast short programs attacking the regime
 and its Soviet backers and reporting mujahidin activity around
 the country.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The regime only permits assemblies which serve its purposes,
 and all such meetings are carefully orchestrated. In order to
 create the impression of popular support for :various policies,
 the regime frequently stages meetings and demonstrations both
 in Kabul and other major towns. Although Afghanistan has a
 miniscule industrialized sector, the regime continues to
 develop official labor organizations controlled by the
 Government. These have no right to negotiate or strike.
 Afghanistan's few professional bodies, such as the Academy of
 Sciences, are totally controlled by the regime.
 
 
 1079
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Afghanistan has for centuries been an overwhelmingly Islamic
 nation, though small Hindu, Sikh, and Jewish enclaves of
 foreign origin have traditionally been tolerated. The present
 regime is based on parties that were militantly secularist in
 orientation. The Babrak Karmal regime now goes to great
 lengths to associate itself with Islam: major policy
 initiatives are immediately sanctioned by a regime-controlled
 council of religious figures, and the media constantly portray
 the regime as the defender of the faith. Despite these
 efforts, the vast majority of the religious leadership and the
 populace of Afghanistan consider the regime and its Soviet
 sponsors anathema to the tenets of Islam.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within Afghanistan has been severely disrupted by the
 war. Resistance attacks on military convoys, destruction of
 bridges, and mining of some secondary roads have rendered
 overland travel difficult and dangerous. Surface travelers
 also run the risk of becoming involved in the frequent clashes
 between resistance fighters and Soviet/regime troops. They
 face *tolls" exacted by Soviet soldiers and mujahidin alike, as
 well as possibly becoming victims of outright banditry in
 remote areas. The regime attempts to curtail foreign travel.
 Permission for professionals, such as doctors, engineers and
 academics, to travel outside the communist world is routinely
 denied for fear they will not return. Businessmen can still
 obtain passports, but many Afghans are forced to pay bribes of
 over $1,000 to have a passport issued. Bank or property
 deposits are often asked of Afghans applying to leave the
 country for short periods and passports are commonly
 confiscated by airport authorities on their return.   Afghan
 pilgrims to Mecca are issued documents valid only for the
 pilgrimage in an effort to keep them from leaving the country
 permanently.
 While legal emigration is thus virtually impossible, large
 numbers of Afghans continue to depart the country clandestinely
 to seek refuge abroad. Most estimates place the number of
 Afghan refugees at over three million--over 20 percent of
 Afghanistan's former population.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Since the Soviet invasion in December 1979, a totalitarian
 one-party state ruled by the People's Democratic Party of
 Afghanistan has given way to a totalitarian apparatus
 controlled totally by the Soviet Union. Soviet military and
 civilian advisors sit in almost all ministries and make or
 approve every significant decision done in the name of the
 regime. The Party itself is ruled by a small group who form
 the Party's politburo. The Party is torn by feuding between
 its Khalq and Parcham factions. The less numerous Parchamis
 (including Babrak) retain control of the Party apparatus.
 Regime figures put party membership at 60,000 (out of pre-1978
 population of close to 15 million), though actual membership is
 probably much lower. Membership in the Party (the only legal
 
 
 1080
 one)--and effectively membership in the Parcham faction--is a
 prerequisite for political participation and professional
 advanceaent. There has been no constitution since the first
 Marxist coup in 1978. The Babrak Karmal regime has stated that
 the 64 principles enumerated in early 1980 will serve as an
 interim constitution.
 In the roughly 75 to 80 percent of the countryside of
 Afghanistan controlled by the mujahidin, the political process
 is controlled by resistance groups. These groups usually have
 some ties to the various resistance offices located in
 Peshawar, Pakistan, but communication and coordination between
 the various groups and these offices, and between the
 resistance groups themselves, is naturally uneven,
 uncoordinated, and difficult. Local mujahidin groups control
 political and judicial activities that take place in their
 areas, and also often levy taxes. In some areas the mujahidin
 authorities are traditional tribal figures, in others young
 military organizers. Under the conditions existing, the
 authority of leaders necessarily depends on some form of
 popular consent.
 3. Governament Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Soviet-installed Babrak Karmal regime has been censured for
 its human rights record by many international bodies, including
 the UN Human Rights Commission. The regime rejects such
 resolutions and portrays them as interference in its internal
 affairs. In mid-August 1982 a four-man International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) team was allowed to come to Kabul to
 discuss the possibility of a program within Afghanistan, the
 first such visit since the ICRC was expelled in 1980. Although
 the ICRC representatives were allowed to visit some hospitals
 in Kabul and parts of the Pol-e-Charkhi prison, the delegation
 was asked to leave in early October. Major private
 international human rights organizations such as Amnesty
 International have expressed concern about the Afghan
 situation. Freedom House gives Afghanistan its lowest ranking
 for political rights and civil liabilities. The Peoples'
 Permanent Tribunal, the successor to the Russell Tribunal, at
 its second session on Afghanistan in Paris in December 1982,
 condemned the Soviet Union for violations of the rules of war
 *which are closely linked to the inalienable rights of the
 Afghan people."
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, with
 an estimated per-capita income of $150 in 1982. Since the coup
 and the Soviet invasion in December 1979, economic conditions
 have deteriorated. The difficulty of internal travel has
 disrupted the internal marketing system, and interrupted the
 movement of surplus regional agricultural products to areas of
 scarcity. In most of the countryside, there is no significant
 regime administrative presence, and educational and medical
 facilities are at a minimum. In some areas, the populace
 relies on local resistance organizations for basic commodities
 
 
 ' 1081
 
 and medicines. In areas under regime control, some social
 services exist but are frequently disrupted by fighting between
 Soviet/regime forces and mujahidin. Large numbers of internal
 refugees, who have been driven from their villages by Soviet
 bombardments to Kabul and provincial capitals in 1982, have
 severely strained already inadequate services.
 The participation of Afghan women in activities beyond the home
 has always been severely limited by the traditional beliefs and
 religious practices of Afghanistan. Before the 1978 coup
 d'etat the literacy rate for women was only 2 percent. Since
 the installation of the Babrak regime, socially the position of
 women has improved in Kabul, and other large cities under the
 control of the Soviets and regime forces, and women in.these
 localities have better access to education. In areas of
 intense fighting and in areas of mujahidin control the role of
 women remains as it traditionally has been.
 The Soviet war in Afghanistan has also changed the demographic
 profile of the country. The literacy rate before the forced
 closing and destruction of over 2,000 government schools and
 the flight of many draft age students was under 10 percent.
 The school enrollment rate in Afghanistan has necessarily
 declined below what it was in 1978. Civilian and military
 casualties and the massive continuing exodus of Afghan refugees
 have certainly lowered the average life expectancy, increased
 infant mortality, and created a negative net population growth
 rate.
