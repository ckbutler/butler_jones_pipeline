 VIETNAM
 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) is a one-party state controlled by the Vi-
 etnamese Communist Party (VCP). The VCUs constitutionally mandatedleadng
 role and the occupancy of nearly all senior Government positions by Party officials
 ensures the primacy of Politburo guidelines. The National Assembly, chosen in elec-
 tions in which all candiates are approved by the Party, remains largely subservient
 to the VCP. However, an effort is underway to reduce Party intrusion into Govern-
 ment operations and Government officials have more latitude in implementing pol-
 icy. The Government continued to restrict individual liberties on national security
 and other grounds.
 The military is responsible for external defense and has no direct role in main-
 taining internal security. The Ministry of Interior is responsible for internal secu-
 rity, employing a large border defense force and the police to monitor persons sus-
 pected of involvement in unauthorized political or religious a ctivities. The Govern-
 ment continued to monitor the general populace through informants, household reg-
 istration, and party-appinted block wardns, but apparently reduced somewhat the
 
 
 710
 extent of such monitoring to concentrate on those suspected of engaging, or likely
 to engage, in political or religious activities opposed by the Government.
 The Government continued the market-oriented economic reforms begun in 1986
 to try to modernize and develop the predominantly agricultural economy. The re-
 forms have had the greatest impact in urban areas, where private businesses are
 increasing, and in fertile agricultural regions where farmers have incentives to grow
 and market their produce. Although Vietnam remains very poor, particularly in
 marginal rural areas, the reforms have helped raise most people's standard of living.
 Also, private sector growth has made it more difficult for the Party and the Govern-
 ment to dominate people's lives, particularly in urban areas, to the extent they did
 in the past.
 Nonetheless, the Government was responsible for continued human rights viola-
 tions in 1994. Vietnamese citizens did not have the right to change their govern-
 ment or to assemble, associate, or speak freely. The Government continued to pro-
 hibit establishment of an independent press and independent organizations. It also
 maintained its longstanding policy of not tolerating dissent. Despite some progress
 in developing a legal infrastructure, Vietnam does not yet enjoy the rule of law. The
 judicial system  is not independent, and the judicial process lacks transparency.
 However, citizens enjoyed greater freedom to travel and change their residence, to
 engage in economic activity, and to initiate labor strikes. Within narrow boundaries
 the Government tolerated and even welcomed serious press and public debate and
 criticism-including occasional public protest-primarily with regard to corruption
 and mismanagement.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings. Little information is available on the number of deaths in police custody
 or on official investigations into such incidents, but some extrajudicial killings do
 occur. In at least 2 instances, killings were acknowledged and legal action was
 taken against the perpetrators. The Vietnamese press reported in September that
 the Institute of People's Investigation in Quang NIn  province had decided to take
 legal action against police officials in Ha Long City or reportedly beating a sus-
 pected thief to death. In October, following a public outcry, a Hanoi court tried and
 convicted policeman for robbing and shooting to death an innocent passerby.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no documented incidents of political abductions by
 Government security organizations or by antigovernment forces.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits physical abuse and torture. However, there were credible reports
 of inhuman treatment in the penal system, although the lack of access to jails and
 prisons makes any conclusive judgments impossible. There were no credible reports
 of torture of detainees. Authorities reportedly did use threats and other psycho-
 logical coercion to elicit confessions.
 =-ion conditions are severe but do not enerally threaten the lives of prisoners.
 There were credible reports of the use of forced labor. Prisoners doing hard labor
 complained that the diet and health care available at the prisons was insufficient
 to sustain their health, especially when they were detained in remote, disease-rid-
 den areas.
 Credible reports indicate that well-known dissident Dr. Doan Viet Hoat, who is
 in poor health, was shackled, placed in solitary confinement, and denied visits from
 his wife after refusing to carry out hard labor in a remote prison camp near the
 Laotian border. In July prison officials eventually allowed Dr. Hoat's wife to visit,
 but she reported she was given only 15 minutes to see him and said that prisn
 authorities harassed her. According to unconfirmed reports, four Buddhist monks
 imprisoned in Ba Sao reeducation camp near Hanoi conducted a hunger strike to
 protest prison conditions. In both cases, SRV authorities denied the reports but re-
 fused to allow international observers to visit the prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Little information is available on the ex-
 tent to which families and attorneys have access to criminal and political prisoners.
 Anecdotal evidence indicates that they generally are able to visit. Diplomats had
 limited access to imprisoned nationals.
 The Government continued to arrest and imprison people arbitrarily. Although
 the 1989 Criminal Procedure Code provides for various rights for detainees, includ-
 ing time limits on pretrial detention and the right to have a lawyer present during
 negotiation, in practice authorities often ignore these legal safeguards.
 w enforcement personnel appear able to arrest and incarcerate people without
 presenting arrest warrants. In cases where a warrant is presented, the procurator
 
 
 711
 rather than an independen t judiciary approves issuance of warrants. Once arrested,
 people are often held fr mdefinite periods without formal charges and without ac-
 cessto a law~er. There is no functioning bail srtm, and  ainees do not have the
 right to judicial determination of the legality o temir detention. The extent to which
 authorities hold detainees incommunicado is unknown. Two Vietnamese-Americans,
 Nguyen Tan Tri and Tran Quang Liem, were arrested in November 1993 for trying
 to organize a democracy conference in Ho Chi Minh City. At years end, they had
 not been charged but were still being detained.
 Those arrested for peaceful expression of their views are likely to be charged
 under any one of sevend provisions in the Criminal Code outlawing acts against the
 State. For example, authorities arrested Pham Van Quang in December 1992 for
 waving the former Republic of Vietnam flag during the Ho Chi Minh City inter-
 national marathon. In February 1994, Quang was tried and convicted of "rebellion"
 and was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. According to press reports, Buddhist
 monk Vo Hanh Duc, arrested following disturbances involving Buddhists in Ba Ria-
 Vung Tau province in July 1993, was sentenced to 3 years in prison in January for
 "activities against the law" and "handing out documents hostile to the Socialist Gov-
 ernment of Vietnam."
 There are no reliable figures on the number of political detainees being held since
 the Government often does not publicize arrests and frequently condut secret
 trials and sentencing.
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The court system consists of local people's courts,
 military tribunals, and the Supreme People's Court, an appellate court. In addition,
 local mass organizations are empowered to deal with minor breaches of law or dis-
 putes, and the National Assembly in late 1993 approved the establishment of eco-
 nomic courts to hear commercial disputes.
 While the Constitution provides for the independence of judges and jurors, in
 practice the VCP closely controls the courts at all levels, selecting udges primarily
 for political reliability. Credible reports indicate that Party officils, including top
 leaders, instruct courts how to rule on politically important cases. The procurator
 determines, based on a police investigation, whether to prosecute or to release the
 accused. The procurator serves as both prosecutor and supervisor of the trial pro-
 ceedings. A two-person judging council, made up of a judge and a p eople's Juror (lay
 judge), determines guilt or innocence and also passes sentence on te convicted. The
 President appoints judgs. The relevant people's council appoints people's jurrs
 who are to be people of hgh moral standards but who are not required to have gaI
 training.
 Trials are open to the public, although the procurator has the right to close trials
 in sensitive cases. Defendants have the right to be present during their trial, and
 the defendant or his lawyer has the right to cross-examine witnesses. Little informa-
 tion is available on the extent to which defendants and their lawyers have time to
 prepare for trials and obtain access to government evidence. Although Vietnam has
 made some progress in establishing a legal system, many judges and other court of-
 ficials lack adequate legal training, and the lack of openness in the judicial process,
 cdupled with judicial subservience to the executive branch, continue to block the
 emergence of a fair and effective judicial system.
 There is no reliable information on the total number of political prisoners in Viet-
 nam. Anti-SRV exile groups have claimed there are as many as 1,000 political pris-
 oners in the country; other reliable sources put the figure closer to 200. The secrecy
 surrounding the Vietnamese judicial and prison systems makes it difficult for out-
 side observers to make an accurate estimate.
 Several persons are known to be in prison for peaceful expression of their views.
 For example, Doan Thanh Liem is currently serving a 12-year labor camp sentence
 for spreading anti-Socialist propaganda. Truong Hung Thai, arrested with Liem, is
 serving an 8-year sentence. Doan Van Hoat is serving a 15-year sentence for
 "counterrevolutionary" activity. Human rights activist Nguyen Dan Que sentenced
 to 20 years imprisonment in 1991, remains in prison despite his  er nth.
 In 1994 the Government released a number of well-known polcal prisoners, in-
 cluding the well-known dissident Quach Vinh Nien. Nien, who was aowed to join
 his family abroad, had been in prison since 1978 serving a life sentence for
 "antigovernment activity and disloyalty."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government continued to operate a nationwide system of surveillance and control
 through household registration and party-appointed block wardens who use inform-
 ants to keep track of individual activities. However, many foreign observers believe
 this monitoring was done with less scope and efficiency than in the past, with au-
 thorities concentrating on those suspected of involvement in unauthorized political
 
 
 or religious activities. Anecdotal evidence suggests Government monitoring is strict-
 er in the south, especially in Ho Chi Minh City. Particularly in urban areas, most
 Vietnamese citizens were free to contact, talk, and work with foreigners, although
 many remained nervous about extensive social contacts.
 The Government continued to selectively censor mail, confiscate packages and
 monitor telephone and facsimile transmissions. In the past, the Par  pressed peo-
 ple to belong to one or more mass organizations, which exist for villages, city dis-
 tricts, schools, work (trade unions), youth, and women. However, with the growth
 of the private sector, these organizations play a less important role than in the past.
 While membership in the VCP remains an aid to advancement in the Government
 or in state companies, and vital to promotion to senior levels of the Government,
 the Party faced increased difficulty attracting members. In response, the Govern-
 ment increased its recruitment effbrts and was marginally successful in attracting
 new members from the private sector.
 The Government continued to implement a family-planning policy that urges all
 families to have no more than two children. It sometimes penalized people who have
 more than two children by denying promotions or permission to change jobs.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, but in practice the Government severely limits such freedoms. The Party
 and the Government tolerated public discussion and even criticism somewhat more
 than in the past, though still within narrow and poorly defined limits. For example,
 Vietnamese citizens could and did complain openly about bureaucratic lethargy, ad-
 ministrative procedures, corruption, and even economic policy.
 However, the Government continued to clamp down on free speech that ques-
 tioned the role of the Party, criticized individual SRV leaders, promoted multiparty
 democracy, or discussed sensitive matters such as human rights. For example, credi-
 ble nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) reported that in March, the authorities
 arrested Nguyen Ho a southern Party figure, for writing and circulating an article
 calling for greater democracy and respect for human rights in Vietnam. In poor
 health, he was released in June and at year's end remained at home under surveil-
 lance.
 The Government did not use systematic prior censorship to control the media, but
 Party guidance was pervasive, and national security legislation remained suffi-
 ciently broad to ensure effective self-censorship in the domestic media. The Govern-
 ment continued to control the domestic print media, but new newspapers were ap-
 proved for publication and investigative reporting of corruption and mismanagement
 increased. In addition, there was some debate on economic policy with political over-
 tones. Restrictions against new publications by dissident writers remained in force.
 The Party and the Government continued to control the broadcast media and did
 not normally permit the broadcast of opposing views. The Government made no ef-
 fort to limit access to international radio or television, which many Vietnamese lis-
 ten to regularly. Vietnamese television and radio frequently carried interviews with
 and speeches by foreigners, including diplomats and businessmen, and foreign publi-
 cations continued to be widely available. Although the Government announced its
 intention to control satellite dishes more strictly, they appear to be proliferating.
 Foreign journalists must be approved by the Foreign Ministrys press center. The
 center monitors their activities and decides on a case-by-case basis whether to send
 a press center representative to accompany journalists covering specific events.
 The trend toward increased information flow appeared to extend into the univer-
 sity system. Foreign scholars working temporarily at Vietnamese universities said
 they were able to discuss freely a wide range of issues, including human rights, in
 the classroom. Vietnamese academic publications, however, usually reflect the views
 of the Party and the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assciation.-The Government restricts the
 right of assembly in law and practice. People wishing to gather in a group are re-
 quired to apply or a   rmit, which local authorities can deny arbitrarily. However,
 people routinely gathered in an informal groups. The Government does not usually
 interfere as long as the gatherings are not organized. Normally, the Government
 does not permit demonstrations or meetings for political purposes, but has been
 more tolerant than in the past of occasional popular demonstrations about specific
 grievances against local officials. With few exceptions, the Government prohibits the
 establishment of private, independent organizations, insisting that individuals work
 within etablished party-controlled organizations. Vietnamese citizens cannot estab-
 lish independent political parties, religious organizations, labor unions, business or
 veterans organizations.
 
 
 713
 c. Freedom of Re/igion-Although the Constitution provides for freedom of wor-
 ship, the Government continued to restrict religious organizations significantly. The
 Party forbids its officials to adhere to a religion, although it appears to have relaxed
 enforcement of this rule. The Government continued to ease restrictions on the prac-
 tice of religion in 1994.
 The Party and the Government continued policies designed to control religious
 hierarchies and organized religious activities, i part because the Government per-
 ceives that religion may threaten the Party's monopoly of influence. All religious
 groups report continued difficulties in obtaining teaching materials, expanding rei-
 gious training facilities, and publishing materials.
 The Government requires all Buddhist monks to work under the Government-con-
 trolled Buddhist organization's umbrella. The Government has actively suppressed
 recent efforts by the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) to operate outside
 of Government control. The Government has arrested Buddhists who have pushed
 for an independent organization, and it has harshly criticized the UBCV in a series
 of speeches and publications calling it a tool of reactionary exiles.
 The tension between the overnment and the UBCV, which had escalated in 1993
 with public demonstrations and the arrest of Buddhist monks and followers in Hue
 and Ba Ria-Vung Tau province, continued in 1994. The UBCV's leader, the Vener-
 able Thich Huyen Quang, called on his followers to step up their fight against the
 Government's domination of religion. Despite SRV claims to the contrary, credible
 reports indicated that Quang remained under house arrest in Quang Ngai province
 for most of the year. In late December. Buddhist organizations abroad reported that
 the Venerable  hch Huyen Quang and the Venerable Thich Quang Do had been
 arrested for their activities. Four monks imprisoned in 1993 after disturbances in
 Hue reportedly began a hunger strike at the Ba Sao reeducation camp. There was
 also an unconfirmed report that in July the Venerable Thich Hunh Duc began a
 hunger strike in Phuoclo prison in Ba Ria to protest his prison sentence and the
 postponement of his appeal. Subsequently, his appeal was rescheduled and his sen-
 tence reaffirmed.
 In a marked improvement from the 1980's, people appear free to attend worship
 services, and attendance at religious services continued to increase. Catholic church-
 es in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, as well as Buddhist temples and Hoa Hao and
 Cao Dai edifices in the south, a ppear active. Also, in July the Government issued
 Directive 1379 which called for the authorities to allow the restoration of places of
 religious worship, allow the printing of religious books in accordance with the law,
 and create favorable conditions for religious denominations to train their mission-
 aries at religious training centers approved by the Government. It is unclear what
 impact this Directive wilhave on religious freedom.
 The Government has sought to control the Catholic Church hierarchy in Vietnam,
 in part by requiring all clergy to belong to the government-controlled Catholic Patri-
 otic Association. It has also insisted on its right to approve Vatican appointments,
 and as a result key church positions remained-unfille  or long periods. The Vatican
 has acceded to the Government's demand that it approve Vatican appointments. As
 a result, increasing numbers of vacant clerical positions were filled, including bish-
 ops and archbishops.
 In mid-1994 the Vatican and the SRV reached agreement on the appointments of
 Bishop Tung ofBac Ninh to be Archbishop of Hanoi and Nguyen Nhu The as Apos-
 tolic Administrator for the Archdiocese of Hue. The Vactican's reassignment of Bish-
 op Nguyen Van Thuan opens the way to appoint a successor to the ailing Bishop
 of Ho Chi Minh City. The Government has slightly eased some restrictions on
 Catholic Church activities while maintaining control of its hierarchy and restricting
 training of new clergy. In March the Government declared that bishops and priests
 could travel freely in their dioceses and that priests released from reeducation
 camps could carry out religious duties if local authorities agreed. Five training
 seminaries are now open, with 120-150 students. All students must be approved by
 the Government, both upon entering the seminary and prior to ordination as priests.
 The Christian Missionary Alliance of Vietnam, the only government-approved
 Protestant organization in the country, enjoyed slightly greater freedom. Church at-
 tendance grew despite continued Government restrictions on proselytizing activities.
 NGO's reported the arrest of several Hmongprotestants for proselytizing m northern
 Vietnamese villages. The Government has allowed the Alliance to open a Bible col-
 lege in Danang and to reestablish ties with foreign religious groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the CountM, Foregn Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Most citizens enjoyed greater freedom to travel within the country. In
 general, the Government no longer requires permits to travel across provincial lines
 and in practice enforces few restrictions on internal travel. However, there were
 credible reports of members of ethnic minorities being required to obtain permission
 
 
 from local authorities to travel outside of certain highland areas. Officially, citizens
 must obtain permission to change their residence, but many people have done so
 without approyal. Foreigners are free to travel througout  e country. Foreigners
 are generally free to travel throughout the country, athough the Government must
 approve travel by foreigners to border areas, some areas in the central highlands,
 and some islands. Lcal authorities have sometimes been willing to allow foreigners
 to travel to the border without permission.
 The Government still requires citizens traveling abroad to obtain exit visas but
 is more willing to grant those visas than in the past. For example, the well-known
 dissident writer, Dinh Thu Huong, was allowed for the first time to travel to con-
 ferences in Europe in the fall. However, not everyone is allowed to travel abroad.
 For example, members of Vietnam's small Muslim community have not been al-
 lowed to leave the country to make the hajj.
 The Government continued to permit emigration for some categories of Vietnam-
 ese. The U.S. Orderly Departure Program continued to resettle beneficiaries, includ-
 ing Amerasians former reeducation camp detainees, and family unification cases,
 at the rate of about 4,000 persons per month. Other nations operate smaller reset-
 tlement programs for Vietnamese nationals. There are some concerns that members
 of minority ethnic groups, particularly highland peoples such as the Montagnards,
 may not have ready access to these programs.
 The Government generally permits Vietnamese who emigrate to return to visit
 but it considers them citizens and therefore subject to Vietnamese law even if they
 have adopted another country's citizenship. Because it regards overseas Vietnamese
 both as a valuable potential source of foreign exchange and expertise and as a po-
 tential security threat, the Government generally encourages them to visit Vietnam,
 whether they emigrated legally or illegally, but at the same time it monitors them
 carefully.
 In 1989 Vietnam signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Na-
 tions High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to increase acceptance of voluntary
 repatriates, provided there was financial assistance. The agreement included a com-
 mitment byVietnam to waive prosecution and punitive measures for illegal depar-
 ture from Vietnam of persons who return under the UNHOR voluntary repatriation
 program. Vietnam also agreed to permit the UNHCR to monitor the returnees
 through direct visits. This agreement has resulted in a substantial flow of repatri-
 ates from several countries to Vietnam. More than 65,000 Vietnamese have re-
 turned voluntarily. The UNHCR, which extensively monitors those who have repa-
 triated voluntarily, reported that they do not face retribution or official discrimina-
 tion.
 Although the source of refugees itself in the past, Vietnam has also been the coun-
 try of first asylum for Cambodian refugees, mainly ethnic Chinese but also ethnic
 Vietnamese. The Government has worked closely with the UNHCA in repatriating
 those desiring to return to Cambodia. There were no reports of forced repatriation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are not free to change their government. All authority and political power
 is vested in the VCP; political opposition and other political parties are not toler-
 ated. The Central Committee is the supreme decisionmaking body in the nation, and
 the Politburo is the locus of policymaking. The Secretariat of the Central Committee
 oversees day-to-day implementation of leadership directives. Debate and criticism
 are limited to certain aspects of individual, state, or Party performance determined
 by the VCP itself. No public challenge to the legitimacy of the one-party state, or
 even debate on this subject, is permitted.
 Citizens elect the members of the National Assembly, ostensibly the chief legisla-
 tive body, although the VCP approves all candidates. The National Assembly en-
 gaged in increasingly vigorous debate on economic and social issues, but it remained
 largely subservient to the VCP. Legislators rewrote laws,questioned ministries, and
 occasionally rejected draft legislation. However, Party officials occupy most senior
 Government positions and continued to have final say on key issues.
 The law provides the opportunity for equal participation in politics by women and
 minority groups, but in practice they are under represented. Most of the senior lead-
 ers, including all 17 members of the Politburo, are male. The President of the Na-
 tional Assembly, who is also a Politburo member, is a member of an ethnic minority.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit private human rights organizations to form or
 operate and generally prohibits private citizens from contacting international
 
 
 715
 human rights organizations. It has permitted international visitors to monitor im-
 plementation of its repatriation commitments under the Comprehensive Plan of Ac-
 tion agreed on at the 1989 Geneva Conference, and it has caried on a limited dialog
 with human rights organizations. In October a delegation from the UNHRC was
 permitted to visit prisons- a report is expected in early 1995.
 The Government has hown increased willingness to discuss human rights issues
 bilaterally with other governments if such discussions take place under the rubric
 of "exchanges of ideas" rather than 'investigations." However, in July it canceled
 the visit of an Australian human rights delegation when an ethnic Vietnamese
 member of that delegation said publicly that the group would be "investigating" the
 human rights situation in Vietnam.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 People released from reeducation camps have reported varying levels of discrimi-
 nation in the areas of housing and education. They generally are not eligible to re-
 gain their citizenship rights until I year after their release. They and their families
 are not allowed employment with the Government, though this was less a factor in
 1994 than in the past because of the growth of the private sector.
 Women.-While there is no legal discrimination, women face deeply engrained so-
 cial discrimination. Despite extensive provisions in the Constitution, legislation, and
 regulations that mandate equal treatment, few women can compete with men for
 higher status positions. The Government has not enforced the constitutional provi-
 sion that women and men must receive equal pay for equal work. Despite the large
 body of legislation and regulations devoted to the protection of women's rights in
 marriage, the workplace, and the new labor law calling for the preferential treat-
 ment of women, these legal pronouncements are distant from the reality for many,
 if not most, women.
 Although the law addresses the issue of domestic violence, there is credible evi-
 dence that these laws are not enforced. A 1993 report by a Vietnamese researcher
 stated that domestic violence has grown in recent years. Some international NGO
 workers as well as many Vietnamese women have commented that domestic vio-
 lence against women is common. Most divorces are due to domestic violence. Many
 women remain in abusive marriages rather than confront the stigma of divorce.
 These problems tend to be more prevalent in rural than in urban areas.
 Children.-Reputable international organizations, including the United Nations
 Children's Fund (UNICEF), commended the Government's interest in children's is-
 sues and its promotion of child welfare. The Government has continued a nation-
 wide immunization campaign, and the government-controlled press regularly
 stresses the importance of health and education for all children. Despite some suc-
 cess, UNICEF estimates there are still 3 million children living in "especially dif-
 ficult circumstances.r There is no information on the extent of child abuse.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minoritie&--Although the Government says it is opposed
 to discrimination against ethnic minorities, there continued to be credible reports
 that some local officials restricted ethnic minority access to education, employment,
 and travel, both internal and foreign. The Government continued to implement poli-
 cies designed to narrow the gap in the standard of living between ethnic groups liv-
 ing in the highlands and lowland ethnic Vietnamese by providing preferential treat-
 ment to domestic and foreign companies investing in highland areas. There is no
 information available on whether repression of some highland minorities for sus-
 pected ties with resistance groups, reported in the past, continued in 1994.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government provides little official protection or
 support for the disabled, and there are no laws mandating access for the disabled.
 However, the 1994 Labor Law calls on the State to protect the right and encourage
 the employment of the disabled and includes provisions for preferential treatment
 for firms that recruit disabled persons for training or apprenticeship and a special
 levy on firms that do not employ disabled workers. It is not yet clear whether the
 Government has begun to enforce these provisions. The Government has permitted
 international groups to assist those who have been disabled by war or by subse-
 quent accidents involving unexploded ordinance.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers are not free to form or join unions of their
 own choosing unless they have obtained approval from the local trade union federa-
 tion office. The party-controlled Vietnam General Confederation of Labor (VGC1) is
 the umbrella organization under which all local trade unions must operate. The
 Labor Law requires provincial trade union organizations to establish unions at all
 new enterprises as well as at existing enterprises that currently operate without
 
 
 trade unions. Management of union-affiliated companies is required to accept and
 cooperate with those unions. However, most joint ventures and small, private com-
 panies, especially at the retail level, do not have unions.
 The June 1994 Labor Law provides for the right to strike under certain cir-
 cumstances. It calls for management and labor to resolve labor disputes through the
 enterprise's own labor conciliation council. If that fails, the matter goes to the pro-
 vincial labor arbitration council. If the council's decision is unsatisfactory, unions
 have the right to appeal to the provincial people's court or to strike. However, the
 law prohibits strikes at enterprises that serve the public and at those that are im-
 portant to the national economy or to national security and defense, as defined by
 the Government. It also grants the Prime Ministerhe e right to suspend a strike con-
 sidered detrimental to the national economy or to public safety.
 A number of strikes occurred in 1994, prmarily against foreign-owned companies
 but also involving state-owned and private firms as well. The Government tolerated
 the strikes, even though some occurred before the new Labor Law made them legal.
 The new Labor Law prohibits retribution against strikers, and there have been no
 credible reports of such retribution.
 Unions are not legally free to, and do not in practice, join, affliat with, or par-
 ticipat in international labor bodies. However, in 1992, Vietnam rejoined the Inter-
 national Labor Organization, from which it bad withdrawn in 1985.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Woiers have the right to or-
 ganize unions in their enterprises,but they must be approved by the local union
 leadership. They also can bargain collectively through the party-approved unions at
 their enterprises. In the past, the Government generally set wages, since most peo-
 ple worked for state companies. With the growth of the private sector and the in-
 creased autonomy of state firms, a growing percentage of companies are setting
 wages through collective bargaining with the relevant unions, and market forces
 play a much mre important role in determining wages. Antiunion discrimination
 on the part of employers against employees seeking to organize is forbidden in the
 labor code.
 The Government has approved formation of a number of export processing zones
 and new industrial zones, which are governed by the same labor laws as apply to
 the rest of the countcry.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Copler Labor.-The new Labor Law prohibits all
 forms of forced labor, and there have been no reports of such practices, except in
 some detention facilities.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Law sets the minimum
 ago for employment at 15. Children as young as 13 can register at trade training
 centers,which are a form of vocational training. Vietnam also has compulsory edu-
 cation laws. These laws are not effectively enforced, especially in rural areas where
 children are needed to farm. However, the Vietnamese culture's strong emphasis on
 education leads most people to send their children to school, rather than to work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Law requires the Government to set
 a minimum wage, which changes with inflation and other economic changes. The
 Government does not publicize minimum wage rates. The minimum wage, including
 for those working for joint ventures, is by itself insufficient to provide a worker and
 his family with a decent standard of living. However, many workers receive sub-
 sidized housing, bonuses, and also supplement their incomes by engaging in entre-
 preneurial activities. The Government enforces the minimum wage at foreign and
 morVietnamese firms. It has little control over other wages.
 TeLabor Law sets working hours at a maximum of 8 per day and 48 per week,
 with a mandatory 24-hour break each week. Any additional hours require overtime
 pay, and the law limits compulsory overtime. it is not clear how well the Govern-
 ment enforces these provisions.
 The Labor Law cails on the Government to promulgate rules and regulations to
 ensure worker safety. The Ministry of Labor, in coordination with local people's com-
 mittees and labor unions, is charged with enforcing the reulation. In practice, en-
