 BRAZIL
 Brazil is a constitutional federal republic with a directly
 -elected president, a bicameral legislature, and an independent
 judiciary. The rights to free speech and to a free press are
 broadly exercised.
 Public security responsibility is shared by federal, state, and
 local police, with the state police bearing the-greatest
 responsibility for law enforcement activity which most directly
 affects most citizens. Under a new law passed in July,
 authority to activate the military forces in domestic security
 matters is firmly restricted to the President. Some local and
 state police officers have been implicated in human rights
 abuses, including extrajudicial killings and serious physical
 abuse of detainees. A few delinquent, police have been charged
 and punished, but most act with impunity.
 President Fernando Collor's economic and administrative reform
 program continued to move Brazil toward a free market economy.
 However, income distribution remains marked by wide
 disparities. Although the Collor Administration called for
 heavy investment in education and public health programs, such
 new initiatives are severely restricted by-limited fiscal
 resources.
 The principal human rights problems in Brazil are the high
 number of extrajudicial killings and death threats against
 rural activists by landowners and their agents, and of criminal
 suspects and minors by vigilante groups in urban areas.
 Reports of killings of peasants and union organizers involved
 in land disputes continued, as did confrontations involving the
 landless. Government efforts to effect agrarian reforms which
 would alleviate rural tensions were obstructed by funding
 shortages and legislative bottlenecks. Cases of human rights
 violations generally were not investigated and prosecuted. The
 Administration demarcated 9.4 million hectares of land as an
 exclusive preserve for the Yanomami Indian tribe and initiated
 a national program to combat violence against minors.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom'from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Extrajudicial killings are Brazil's most serious human rights
 problem. Several hundred Brazilians died at the hands of
 landowners, hired thugs, vigilante groups, and policemen in
 urban gang wars and in land conflicts. Brazilian and
 international'human rights organizations made credible charges
 that state and local policemen and hired gunmen kill persons
 suspected of common crimes, including street youths and
 children. They charge that federal, state, and local
 authorities frequently fail to take legal action'against those
 responsible for such killings. They affirm that police often
 fail to conduct complete investigations, sometimes because they
 cooperated with the.hired gunmen or their employers to carry
 out the crimes.
 Conflicts between rural landholders and the landless continued
 in 1991, in part because of the failure of the Government to
 settle conflicting  land tenure claims. Approximately 40
 persons died in rural conflicts during the year. This
 represents a marked decline from the 80 such killings
 
 
 514
 BRAZIL
 registered in 1990. The victims included labor leaders and
 other activists helping to organize agricultural unions, as
 well as law enforcement officials and landowners. Death
 threats against rural leaders, landowners, and rural laborers
 also continued; a federal deputy estimated that 163 persons
 were threatened in rural conflicts. Human rights groups and
 legislators charge that killings and threats are carried out
 with no fear of punishment. Out of more than 1,000 killings
 related to land disputes during the 1980's, only a handful of
 persons had come to trial by the end of 1991.
 About a dozen rural leaders were killed in 1991. The murder of
 Rural Workers Union leader Expedito Ribeiro de Souza in
 February attracted international attention. President of the
 Rio Maria, Para, chapter of his union, de Souza was involved in
 the same land issues which led to the murders of Paulo and Jose
 Canuto in 1990 and of their father, Joao, in 1985. Expedito's
 successor, Carlos Cabral Pereira, was wounded by gunfire 4
 weeks after Expedito's murder, in the midst of an ongoing
 police investigation. In the case of Expedito's murder, police
 arrested the gunman within a few days and named the'person who
 instigated the crime a few days later. However, as of year's
 end the case had not come to trial. Father Ricardo Rezende, an
 activist priest in Rio Maria, was threatened with death by
 presumed agents of local landlords. Officials of the Church's
 Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) in the state of Para charge that
 police ignored evidence of-an even wider conspiracy in the Rio
 Maria area, including threats against the judge who would try
 the case. Two other Rural Workers Union leaders were shot, and
 one killed, in nearby areas on March 8. In August Darcy
 Araujo, a rural union leader from Amazonas, was killed by a
 shot-to the head; he had previously been threatened by a local
 rancher. No arrests have been made in these cases. Two more
 rural unionists, Mauro Carneiro dos Santos and Francisco Nunez
 de Souza, were killed in Para-in October.
 The widow of assassinated rubber-tapper leader Chico Mendes and
 other rubber-tapper leaders, including Mendes' successor,
 Osmarino Amancio, continued to receive death threats. On
 September 17, agronomist Gumercindo Rodrigues, a colleague of
 Chico Mendes, was shot and wounded in Rio Branco, Acre. Human
 rights-groups have also expressed concern over alleged judicial
 harassment of rubber-tapper leader Antonio Macedo's organizing
 activities in northern Acre. Members of the landless movement
 concluded that austerity measures by the Federal Government led
 to increased rural tensions. Government monitoring offices
 suffered personnel cuts, while the unavailability of funds to
 expropriate disputed properties deprived landholders who are
 party to land conflicts of the prospect of compensation.
 Vigilante actions to control rising urban crime continued to be
 cited as a major human rights problem during the year.
 Brazilian and international human rights-organizations made
 credible charges that policemen, often acting off-duty as
 members of vigilante groups, kill persons suspected of common
 crimes, including street youths. Vigilante groups engaged in
 killings of alleged or suspected criminals in working-class
 neighborhoods and shantytowns. In the Baixada Fluminense area
 of Rio de Janeiro, 1,015 homicides were registered from January
 to May; Rio state authorities assert that a significant portion
 of these homicides are the work of vigilantes. The vice
 - governor and chief of civil police for Rio de Janeiro state
 asserted that the police broke up 15 organized vigilante groups
 in the first half of 1991. On August 13, Fausto Ribeiro da
 Silva Filho, a lawyer for the urban squatters' movement, was
 
 
 515
 BRAZIL
 killed by a gunman. Human rights groups suspect that he was
 murdered by opponents of the squatters' movement. The
 authorities frequently fail to take effective legal action
 against those responsible for such killings, and some police
 fail to conduct complete investigations because they either
 cooperate or sympathize with vigilante actions.
 Human rights groups detailed many cases in which street
 children were killed by thugs, including off-duty policemen
 hired by businessmen. Rio de Janeiro church groups estimate
 that minors constitute 30 percent of those murdered in the
 Baixada Fluminense. Deaths of street youths in Sao Paulo
 reportedly increased from one every 3 days in 1989 to one every
 2 days in the first half of 1991. Studies and spot surveys
 suggest that most minors killed in 'arge cities are between the
 ages of 16 and 18 and are often suspected of criminal
 activity. Most are black and poor. Volmer Nascimento, Rio de
 Janeiro coordinator for the National Street Children's Movement
 (MNMR), has received death threats.
 The Government initiated a national plan to combat violence
 against minors in April. Under the plan, which recommends a
 number of measures to implement the 1990 Statute of the*Child
 and the Adolescent, the Federal Government, through'the
 Brazilian-Center for Children and Adolescents (CBIA), funded
 state efforts to coordinate action to reduce the killings of
 minors. In lateNovember, the governor of Ceara state ordered
 the arrest of five military polic6men believed to be involved
 in the killing of minors in that state. Nevertheless, violence
 against minors remained high in 1991.
 The Government confronts several obstacles in its efforts to
 prevent extrajudicial killings, including widespread public
 apathy. According to local human rights sources, Brazilian
 citizens are reluctant to report extrajudicial killings by
 police because the -police tend to protect their own during
 internal investigations of such killings. The high crime rate,
 the failure to apprehend most criminals, the slowness- of the
 judicial system, and the legal requirement to release criminals
 pending trial contribute to public acquiescence in police
 brutality and killings of criminal suspects. Investigations
 into these incidents are hampered because witnesses hesitate to
 cooperate with authorities for fear of retribution or because
 they and the general public often sympathize with the actions
 of vigilantes.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated abductions in
 1991. There were, however, numerous reports of disappearances
 of persons purportedly involved in common crimes, which
 appeared to be the result of vigilante action
 (see Section l.a.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution, which contains
 severe legal penalties for torture and acquiescence in
 torture. However, there continued to be many credible reports
 of widespread police beatings and torture of criminal suspects
 and landless peasants to extract information, confessions, or
 money, and sometimes to punish. Human rights groups estimate
 that as little as 10 percent of police brutality cases are
 
 
 516
 BRAZIL
 reported in some areas as the victims are generally poor,
 afraid, and unaware of their legal rights.
 Most prison facilities are severely overcrowded. Victims of
 torture and beating by prison guards often have little
 effective recourse. Eight prison guards have been charged in
 the 1989 suffocation of 18 inmates in a Sao Paulo prison; their
 cases had not been tried as of December 1991. Three guards at
 Ary Franco prison in Rio de Janeiro were charged with starting
 a fire that killed 26 prisoners following a thwarted escape
 attempt on October 28." The prison, designed to hold 950,
 contained 1,400 inmates at the time of the fire.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution limits arrests to those caught committing a
 crime or those arrested by order of a judicial authority,
 except in cases of soldiers charged with violating military
 rules and regulations or with military crimes as defined by
 law. The constitutional provision for judicial determination
 of the legality of detention is respected although some
 convicted inmates are kept after the expiration of their
 sentences due to poor record keeping. The law permits
 provisional detention for up to 5 days in certain circumstances
 stipulated by law during a police investigation or during the
 prosecution phase of a case. This period may be extended until
 the case comes to trial or until a judge rules that reasons for
 the detention no longer exist. Provisional detention is used
 infrequently.-
 In 1991 there were several cases of illegal and incommunicado
 -detention without a judicial order. Human rights groups charge
 that police detained people, including street youths and
 children, for questioning without probable cause, in some cases
 based on arbitrary criteria such as vagrancy. In Belo
 Horizonte, 520 minors were arrested and 200 detained on the
 night of August 22, in response to complaints that youth gangs
 were operating freely in the downtown area. In Manaus, a
 program of mass arrests of street minors was ended in June at
 the insistence of federal authorities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is an independent branch of government. The
 judicial system, with the Federal Supreme Court at its apex,
 includes courts of first instance and appeals courts. The
 states organize their own judicial systems but must adhere to
 the basic principles in the Federal Constitution. Brazil also
 has a system of specialized courts dealing with military,
 labor, electoral, juvenile, family, and narcotics matters,
 among others. Separate police courts manned by police
 officials rule on charges of police brutality. Human rights
 groups make credible charges that police courts are reluctant
 to punish their colleagues for human rights abuses. Military
 courts do not have jurisdiction over civilians.
 The right to a fair public trial is provided for by law and is
 generally respected in practice, although an international
 human rights group charged in a 1991 report that state judges
 are sometimes biased in favor of landowners in cases involving
 rural activists. Defendants are entitled to counsel and must
 be made fully aware of the charges against them. In cases in
 which a defendant cannot'afford an attorney, one must be
 provided at public expense; private attorneys are appointed by
 courts to represent poor defendants when public defenders are
 
 
 517
 BRAZIL
 unavailable. Defendants and their attorneys have the right to
 be informed of the evidence on which charges are based. Only
 cases of willful crimes against life are tried by jury; all
 others are tried by a judge.
 The judicial system is inefficient and continues to have a
 serious backlog; many cases are not tried for years. According
 to several state judges in Sao Paulo, the judicial system is so
 inefficient and outdated that it is incapable of playing an
 effective role in controlling crime.
 Lynchings of suspected criminals by irate citizens, arising out
 of public rage against crime levels and a perceived failure of
 the judicial system to mete out justice, is a significant
 problem in Brazil. In February nationally televised video
 footage of the November 1990 killing and burning of three men
 apprehended in an act of burglary and hostage-taking in the
 rural town of Matupa, Mato Grosso, raised a public outcry.
 Local judges subsequently sought to disassociate themselves
 from the trial of the accused vigilantes, and the prosecutor in
 the case received death threats. In April two men believed to
 have robbed and killed a-taxi driver were killed by a group of
 taxi drivers in Rondonia, and two suspected teenage criminals
 were killed, mutilated, and burned in Belem in July. By
 midyear, police sources in Bahia reported 64 such vigilante
 killings.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary intrusion
 into the home. There were no reports of illegal entry for
 political reasons, but illegal entry into homes without a
 warrant occurs in searches for criminal suspects. Wiretaps are
 unconstitutional except for purposes of criminal investigation
 and prosecution and then only when authorized by a judicial
 authority in circumstances defined by law. The inviolability
 of private correspondence is respected.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right to free speech and to, a free press is provided for in
 the Constitution and is broadly exercised. The press and
 broadcast media routinely discuss controversial social and
 political issues, with opposition viewpoints aired freely.
 Most radio and television stations are privately owned; the
 Government, through Congress, controls licensing authority.
 Newspapers are privately owned and vigorously report and
 comment on government policies and performance. The 1988
 Constitution abolished-all forms of censorship. Foreign
 publications are widely distributed in Brazil; prior review of
 films, plays, and radio and television programming is practiced
 only to determine a suitable viewing age.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right to assemble peacefully,
 and this right is respected in practice. Permits are not
 required for outdoor political or labor meetings, and they
 occur throughout Brazil with frequency.
 
 
 518
 BRAZIL
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no favored or state religion. Most Brazilians belong
 to the Roman Catholic Church, but spiritism has many adherents,
 and Protestantism has been expanding in recent years. All
 faiths are free to establish places of worship, train clergy,
 and proselytize, although the Government reserves the right to
 control entry into Indian lands. The National Council of
 Brazilian Bishops and various missionary groups continue to
 complain that visas for missionaries and other foreign
 religious personnel are systematically delayed by immigration
 authorities. Church sources ascribe the delays to mistrust on
 the part of some Brazilian authorities of the foreign
 missionary presence.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Brazil, except for
 the protected Indian areas, nor are there any restrictions on
 emigration or return. Brazil admits few immigrants, does not
 formally accept refugees for resettlement, and is selective in
 granting asylum.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change
 their government through free elections, a right that was
 exercised in a 1989 presidential election and in elections for
 the Federal Congress and state governors in 1990. Executive
 and legislative offices throughout the country at local, state,
 and national levels are filled through democratic direct
 elections among candidates representing many political parties.
 Voting is secret and mandatory for all literate Brazilian
 citizens aged 18 to 70, except military conscripts who may not
 vote. It is voluntary for minors aged 16 to 18, for the
 illiterate, and for those aged 70 and over. Women have full
 political rights under the Constitution, and they are
 increasingly active in politics and government. Indians were
 given the franchise under the 1988 Constitution.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Brazilian nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) actively
 investigate allegations of human rights violations and often
 initiate legal proceedings. Several international NGO's either
 maintain offices in Brazil or visit periodically. Both
 Brazilian and foreign human rights organizations report that
 the Federal Government under the current Administration and
 some state governments have been more responsive than previous
 administrations to human rights problems.
 The Foreign Ministry accepts international approaches on human
 rights questions and transmits human rights inquiries to
 relevant federal and local authorities.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, and
 nationality is unconstitutional, and racial discrimination,
 
 
 519
 BRAZIL
 illegal since 1951, is a crime excluded from bail. However,
 poor, uneducated, and darker-skinned Brazilians encounter
 substantial de facto discrimination. The black population is
 disproportionately concentrated in the lowest economic strata.
 For example, while 40 to 60 percent of Brazil's population is
 of African or other non-European ancestry, few senior officials
 in government and the armed forces are black. Similarly, there
 are relatively few blacks in senior private sector management
 positions. In 1990 blacks were elected governors of 3 of
 Brazil's 27 states. Black consciousness organizations
 challenge the view that Brazil is a racial democracy and
 denounce discrimination in housing, education, the workplace,
 and society at large. These organizations complain that blacks
 are more likely to be stopped by police and deprived of their
 civil rights and that they bear the brunt of police brutality.
 Surveys of murders of minors in major cities show that the
 victims are disproportionatley black; a Rio de Janeiro state
 legislator estimated that 75 percent of minors killed in the
 Baixada Fluminense slum neighborhood are black.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex in
 employment or salaries and provides for 120 days of paid
 maternity leave. However, the provision against wage
 discrimination is rarely enforced, and, as a reaction against
 the maternity leave law, some employers seek sterilization
 certificates from prospective employees or try to fire or avoid
 hiring women in their childbearing years.
 There is a high incidence of physical abuse of women in
 Brazil. Major cities annually report several thousand cases of
 violence against women, usually domestic violence. Although
 there is still a strong cultural bias against the filing of
 complaints by victims of abuse or their families, officials
 note that women are now more willing to make official
 complaints. A special study by an international human rights
 group on.this issue.concluded that over 70 percent of all
 reported cases of violence against women takeplace in the
 home. The study also concluded that'rape is seldom
 investigated and is rarely prosecuted. Special women's health
 police precincts in more than 12 major cities provide shelter,
 assist in bringing actions against offenders, and provide
 general information on women's health. Women's organizations
 have been active in promoting women's rights and lobbying the
 Government in such areas as combating violence against women,
 respecting the constitutional rights of women, and promoting
 sensitivity to women's issues through courses and seminars,
 including courses for local police.
 There are approximately 250,000 Indians in Brazil. The
 Constitution gives Indians the exclusive use of the riches in
 the soil, rivers, and lakes located on their lands. -The
 Federal Government has the responsibility to demarcate'and
 protect Indian lands. The Federal Government also has the
 .authority to develop Indian lands, but the Indians must receive
 a share of the proceeds from any such exploitation. Brazilian
 Indians may bring suits in court to defend their rights and
 interests, and in such suits they are to be assisted by a
 public prosecutor. In February President Collor ordered a
 restructuring of government administration of Indian affairs.
 On April 19, the Day of the Indian, President Collor nullified
 a 1985 decree demarcating Yanomami Indian territory into 19
 "islands" and placed off-limits to outsiders a 9.4-million
 hectare area which includes those lands. On July 1, the
 president appointed a prominent Indian affairs specialist as
 
 
 520
 BRAZIL
 president of the National Foundation for the Indian (FUNAI).
 In July FUNAI management reactivated "Operation Free Jungle" to
 clear illegal prospectors from the area and ordered the
 formalization of the 9.4-million. hectare area as a Yanomami
 reserve. On November 15, President Collor officially
 designated the area as the Yanomami Reserve. The announcement
 followed the ratification in October-of 71 Indian land
 demarcations and the demarcations in August and September of 13
 new indigenous areas by FUNAI. On November 28, the President
 also announced the demarcation of a 4.9-million hectare reserve
 for the Menkragnotire Indians of Para state.
 Land disputes between Indians and non-Indian neighbors
 continued to lead to killings of Indians in 1991. Indian
 rights groups state that seven Guajajara Indians were killed in
 land conficts in Maranhao state between July and October. On
 October 16 and 17, a group of Roraima farmers entered two
 Makuxi villages, beating residents, burning down houses, and
 destroying livestock pens. They were assisted by local police,
 according to human rights sources. Random violence against
 Indians, such as the murder on August 15 in Amazonas of an
 Arapacu Indian for refusing to lend his tape recorder to the
 murderer, also persists in Brazil.
 Illegal prospecting continues on Indian lands. Prospectors
 evicted from Yanomami lands by Operation Free Jungle have
 reportedly migrated in large numbers to other indigenous areas
 in Roraima. In one Indian area in Mato Grosso, the population
 of prospectors reportedly grew from about 300 to as much as
 2,000 between March and October. President Collor ordered the
 closing of an illegal mining operation on Indian lands in Para
 in December. Government efforts to control illegal prospecting
 are hampered by a lack of resources to allow effective policing
 of the extensive borders of indigenous areas and by powerful
 local interest groups.
 Effective health care for Indians, a federal government
 responsibility, is also impeded by lack of funds. Private
 donations support some health care costs in the Yanomami
 territories, but many Indians still must travel long distances
 to find health care facilities.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Brazil's Labor Code has long provided for union representation
 of all Brazilian workers but imposed a hierarchical, unitary
 system known as "unicidade," which prohibited multiple unions
 of the same professional category in a given geographic area.
 It also stipulated that no union's geographic base could be
 smaller than a municipality. Workers in a union whose numbers
 increased (as when an industry grew) could petition the state
 to split a preexisting union into two or more unions.
 The 1988 Constitution retains both "unicidade" and the
 requirement that no union's geographic base may be smaller than
 a municipality, but it frees workers to organize new unions out
 of old ones without prior authorization from the Government.
 The decision to retain unicidade drew opposition both from
 elements of Brazil's labor movement and from the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). In practice,
 however, unicidade has proven more formal than real, as
 hundreds of new unions have sprung up across .Brazil and
 compete, in many cases, with unions and federations that had
 already enjoyed official recognition. The sole bureaucratic
 
 
 521
 BRAZIL
 requirement for new unions is to register with the Ministry of
 Labor and Social Security which, by judicial decision, is bound
 to receive and record their registration. The Government has
 introduced legislation that would remove itself from dues
 collection and would automatically recognize the existence of a
 new union organization. However, the proposal in its most
 recent form would also give the Government responsibility for
 recognition of a union as bargaining agent for a specific group
 of workers, thus retaining control of a key step in the process.
 Several prominent rural labor leaders were killed in 1991
 (see Section l.a.).
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike. Enabling
 legislation passed in June 1989 stipulates that essential
 services remain in operation during a strike and that workers
 notify employers at least 48 hours before beginning a walkout.
 The Constitution prohibits government interference in labor
 unions but provides that "abuse" of the right to strike (such
 as not maintaining essential services or not giving advance
 notice, denying workers not on strike access to their jobs, or
 damaging property) will be punishable under the law.
 During the year, there were strikes in the steel, oil,.and
 banking industries, and an attempted general strike. Courts
 ruled the petrochemical workers' strike abusive because of its
 disruption of fuel supplies in much of southern Brazil.
 Formerly the ruling of abusiveness was virtually automatic;
 more recently the courts have been applying the law with more
 discretion. The Sao Paulo Regional Labor Court ruled on April
 30 that the Sao Paulo metalworkers' strike was not abusive and
 refused to issue a back-to-work order. According to union
 officials, this was the first metalworkers' strike since 1964
 that had not been ruled abusive.
 Although Brazilian laws do not make any provision for a central
 labor organization, three such groups have emerged--the General
 Workers Central CCGT), the Sole Workers Central (CUT), and
 Forca Sindical. The centrals do not have legal standing to
 represent professional categories of workers and have been
 created in Brazil as nonprofit civil associations. Unions and
 union centrals are free to affiliate internationally. In
 November the ICFTU accepted the CGT as a member. Forca
 Sindical has a pending application with the ICFTU, and the CUT
 remains unaffiliated.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize is provided for by the Constitution, and
 trade unions are legally mandated to represent workers. The
 Government has encouraged labor and management to resolve
 differences through collective bargaining, which has become
 commonplace. Nevertheless, a system of labor courts continues
 to exercise normative powers with regard to the settlement of
 labor disputes, thereby discouraging direct negotiation.
 Existing law charges these same courts (as well as personnel
 linked to the Federal Labor Ministry) with mediation
 responsibility in the preliminary stages of dispute
 settlement. Arbitration by neutral, professional third parties
 is part of a labor reform proposal introduced by the Collor
 Administration and awaiting congressional action.
 International Labor Organization (ILO) bodies noted in 1991
 that provisions of law restrict collective bargaining by
 imposing wage parameters which may not be exceeded.
 
 
 522
 BRAZIL
 The Constitution incorporates a provision from the Labor Code
 that prohibits the dismissal of employees who are candidates
 for or holders of union leadership positions. In one instance,
 the president and a number of directors of the aeronautical
 workers' union were fired by Varig and Vasp airlines after a
 February 1988 strike. Some were subsequently rehired, but the
 president and five directors remained without work, and their
 cases were still pending at the end of 1991. In general,
 enforcement of laws protecting union members from
 discrimination lack effectiveness.
 Labor law applies uniformly throughout Brazil, including the
 free trade zones. However, the unions in the Manaus zone are
 relatively weaker vis-a-vis industry as compared to unions in
 the major industrial cities in the southeast.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While the Constitution prohibits forced labor, there have been
 repeated credible charges that it exists in Brazil, despite
 federal government assertions that it is taking steps to halt
 the practice and prosecute perpetrators. In 1991 the Pastoral
 Land Commission (CPT) again denounced specific labor
 contractors for maintaining "slave" work forces. The CPT
 charged that these contractors deducted transportation and
 other inflated expenses from the workers' meager salaries and
 employed armed guards to prevent the "indebted" workers from
 leaving. The CPT complained that state and federal authorities
 have not promptly investigated reports of compulsory labor.
 Several farms in the south of Para state were raided by federal
 police in July and August; CPT sources charged that police
 delayed mounting such operations and thereby failed to arrest
 or punish a number of involved persons. In November formal
 indictments for slave labor practices were entered against two
 agents for employers of involuntary labor in the state of
 Para. Other accusations of compulsory labor occurred in Acre,
 Mato Grosso do Sul, Goias, Rio Grande do Sul, Sao Paulo state,
 and in Rio de Janeiro state.                             "
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum working age under the Constitution is 14, except
 for apprentices, and legal restrictions have been approved to
 protect working minors under age 18. By law, the permission of
 parents or guardians is required for minors to work, and
 provision must be made for them to attend school through the
 primary grades. All minors are barred from night work and from
 work that constitutes a physical strain. Minors are also
 prohibited from.employment in unhealthful, dangerous, or
 morally harmful conditions. Despite these legal restrictions,
 however, approximately 34 percent of all children between the
 ages of 10 and 14 are working. Many, perhaps most, of these
 working minors are working in violation of the law, but
 accurate statistics are not available. Economic conditions
 often compel children to contribute income to their families
 (or their own upkeep if they have left home). Enforcement of
 these laws is severely limited because the Ministry of Labor
 and Social Security, the responsible agency, deploys too few
 inspectors and accepts a widely held view that it is better for
 these minors to work than to be involved in street crime.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The 1988 Constitution limits the workweek to 44 hours. It
 expanded pay and fringe benefits and established new
 
 
 523
 BRAZIL
 protections for agricultural and domestic workers. Several of
 these provisions have proved unenforceable under current
 economic conditions in Brazil. Worker purchasing power
 declined in recent years, but in September Congress raised the
 monthly minimum wage to roughly double its value during the.
 first 8 months of the year, and a new increase is scheduled for
 January 1992. However, this is not sufficient to provide a
 minimally decent standard of living for a worker and his
 family. It is estimated that some 40 percent of economically
 active individuals, including minors, earn no more than the:
 minimum wage.
 Many Brazilian workers suffer from unsafe working environments.
 Occupational health and safety standards are set by the Fundo
 Centro, which is under the authority of the Minister of Iabor
 and Social Security. Enforcement of these standards is
 inconsistent because the Ministry lacks sufficient resources
 for adequate inspection and enforcement. In practice, if a
 worker has a problem in the workplace and has trouble getting
 relief directly from his employer, he can file a claim with the
 regional labor court, although in practice this is a
 cumbersome, protracted process. The most recent figures
 gathered by the Government's social security system show that
 in 1990 there were 745,555 total registered workplace
 accidents, of which 5,355 were fatal and 18,878 caused
 permanent disabilities. As these figures measure only those
 incidents involving covered workers (some 23 million out of a
 total work force which exceeds 50 million) they undoubtedly
 understate the extent of the problem.
