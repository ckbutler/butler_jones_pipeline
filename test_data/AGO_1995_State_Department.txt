 ANGOLA
 The Republic of Angola is in transition from a single party state to a multiparty
 democracy. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) has ruled
 Angola since its independence from Portugal in 1975. In November 1994, the Gov-
 ernment signed the Lusaka Protocol peace accord with the National Union for the
 Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi, ending 20 years of
 civil war. Under the auspices of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission
 (UNAVEM) and with the help of three observer countries, the United States, Por-
 tugal, and Russia, the Government and UNITA continued to implement the Lusaka
 Protocol's provisions for a cease-fire, withdrawal of forces in contact, disarming and
 quartering of UNITA forces, and the creation of a new national army made up of
 elements from both sides.
 The Constitution was revised in 1991 to provide for elections and for guarantees
 of basic human rights, but the Government does not generally respect its provisions
 in practice. In 1992 President Jose Eduardo dos Santos received a plurality of the
 votes in Angola's first elections, which the United Nations' observers declared to be
 free and fair. The President and the MPLA, backed by the security services, con-
 tinue to dominate the Government and to repress all opposition forces that they re-
 gard as a threat to their power.
 The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for internal security. It exercises this
 function through the National Police and the paramilitary Rapid Intervention Police
 created in 1992 to quell civil unrest. The armed forces have responsibility for exter-
 nal security but have been primarily engaged in fighting the civil war against
 UNITA. While civilian authorities generally maintain effective control of the secu-
 rity forces, there are frequent instances in which the security forces act independ-
 ently of government authority. Members of the security forces committed numerous,
 serious human rights abuses.
 Angola is a war-torn, developing country with great economic potential from ex-
 tensive petroleum and diamond reserves, rich agricultural land, and latent hydro-
 electric resources. Subsistence agriculture, the traditional livelihood for the majority
 of Angola's approximately 10 million citizens, continued to be severely constrained
 by heavily mined fields and roads. In mid-1995, 1.4 million people relied on emer-
 gency food aid in the world's largest humanitarian relief effort. Areas under govern-
 ment control suffered from hyperinflation, scarcity of consumer goods, massive un-
 employment and underemployment, and continuing pervasive corruption. UNITA-
 controlled areas reportedly experienced similar problems. The principal exports are
 petroleum and diamonds, which together with foreign aid are the country's leading
 sources of foreign exchange. Annual per capita gross national product is approxi-
 mately $620. Most of the country's wealth is concentrated in the hands of the small
 MPLA, military, and business elite. The average monthly salary of wage earners is
 equivalent to only about $6, which provides most of the population with a very low
 standard of living.
 As a consequence of the gradual implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, the mas-
 sive extrajuclicial killing that characterized Angola in 1994 has largely abated. Al-
 though there was some improvement in other areas, the Government s human rights
 record continued to be poor, and it continued to commit numerous, serious abuses.
 Government leaders cite the 20-year civil war with UNITA to justify allowing emer-
 gency considerations to override concerns over human rights abuses. Members of the
 security forces committed numerous extrajudicial killings, arbitrarily and secretly
 arrested and detained individuals, and routinely tortured and beat detainees. The
 Government did not take any effective action to punish abusers. Prison conditions
 are life threatening.
 The Government restricts freedom of expression and freedom of the press and in-
 hibits the free movement of its citizens both inside and outside the country. As a
 
 
 result, although Angola is nominally a multi party democracy, its citizens have no
 effective ability to change their government. Violence against women is widespread.
 Children and the disabled continue to suffer as a result of the civil war and poor
 economic conditions. The Government continues to dominate the labor movement,
 and there was no improvement in the poor worker rights situation.
 Government and UNITA forces are guilty of flagrant violations of humanitarian
 law in their prosecution of the civil war. Both inhibited independent investigations
 of human rights abuses in territories under their control.
 Within the territory under its control, UNITA's human rights abuses included dis-
 appearances, arbitrary arrests and detentions, denial of fair public trial, violations
 of humanitarian law in the civil war including attacks on civilian populations, forced
 conscription of young children, and restrictions on the freedoms of speech, press, as-
 sembly, association, and movement.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Politically and economically moti-
 vated violence by state security forces and common criminal violence are often indis-
 tinguishable in Angola. A large number of violent crimes including robbery, vehicle
 hijackings, assault, kidnaping, rape, and murder are committed by members of the
 military and police forcesboth in and out of uniform. Although much of this crimi-
 nal activity is committed by poorly paid rogue elements of the security forces, there
 are credible reports that some of these attacks are carried out under orders from
 the Government. Moreover, the Government did not take any effective action to
 punish abusers.
 On January 18, independent journalist Ricardo de Mello was murdered in an ap-
 parent political killing. The police had not divulged the results of their investigation
 by years end. The April slaying in Luanda of United Nations Police Observer Raul
 Rubin Aguirre and the July 14 assassination of UNITA official and former National
 Police commandant Jose Adao da Silva also remained unexplained.
 There were credible accounts that the Rapid Intervention Police summarily exe-
 cuted people caught in the act of committing a crime. Frequent gun battles between
 members of the military and police, and fighting among soldiers, police, and bandits
 in Luanda's streets, suburbs, and open air markets resulted in numerous civilian
 casualties.
 The August 1994 murder of a well-known journalist and the July 1994 assassina-
 tion of the Vice Governor of Malange Province remain unsolved. The results of the
 investigation into the November 1993 death of opposition politician Carlos Simeao
 were never released. It is widely believed that they were killed for political reasons.
 The Government alleges that in April and May UNITA forces in the municipality
 of Dange Kitexe, in Uige Province, killed 27 people, mostly local MPLA officials and
 civil servants. The Government also alleges that UNITA forces massacred 28 civil-
 ians at Quibaxe. UNAVEM observers were unable to conclude investigations into
 these reports.
 b. Disappearance.-Reports by the Government and UNITA accusing each other
 of abductions, disappearances, and killings of civilians continued. Real abuses are
 numerous and serious, but whereas at the beginning of 1994 thousands of people
 were dying daily, the current rate of kidnapings/abductions/disappearances is in the
 range of dozens per month. Despite the efforts of the international community, there
 were no develooments in the case of two persons associated with Africare, Vincent
 Douma and Oliveira Lembe, who disappeared in Cuanza Sul Territory in August
 1994.
 UNITA arrested two Angolan humanitarian relief workers in Huambo in mid-
 1994 for violating "state security." One was held incommunicado; the other was held
 without charge but was allowed visitors. When government forces recaptured
 Huambo in November, these two detainees had disappeared. The International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and U.N. agencies continued searching for them
 throughout the year.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were credible firsthand reports that the police committed to.ture. Prison offi-
 cials employed by the Interior Ministry routinely beat accused individuals in
 Comarca de Viana, a prison on the outskirts of Luanda, to extract information and/
 or confessions prior to trial. In many cases, the police routinely beat and then re-
 lease detainees rather than make any effort to prepare a formal court case.
 Prison conditions are so poor as to constitute a threat to the health and life of
 prisoners. The Government and. the National Assembly Committee on Human
 Rights have acknowledged that conditions are inhuman. Cells designed for 10 pris-
 
 
 3
 oners contain as many as 30 persons and are divided by open toilets and sewage.
 Many prisons, lacking financial support from the Government, are unable to supply
 prisoners with adequate food and health care. There are credible reports that many
 prisoners die of malnutrition and tuberculosis. Prisoners depend on families, friends,
 and international relief organizations for basic support. The Attorney General re-
 portedly visited prisons throughout Angola and is attempting to improve sanitary
 conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the law, a person caught in the
 act of committing a crime may be arrested and detained immediately. Otherwise,
 the law requires that an arrest warrant be signed by a judge or a provincial attor-
 ney general, followed by a public statement of the grounds for arrest. The
 Consitution provides for the right to a prompt judicial determination of the legality
 of the detention. Under the law the prosecution and defense have a maximum of
 90 days before trial to prepare a case. The Consitution also provides prisoners with
 the right to receive visits by family members. However, because of a scarcity of re-
 sources and the lack of qualified and motivated personnel in the judicial system, the
 accused do not generaly enjoy the exercise of these rights.
 In 1993 the Council of Ministers decided to transfer control of the judiciaLprocess-
 and prison system from the Interior Ministry to the Justice Ministry,-but the trans-
 fer had not been made by year's end. Interior Ministry personnel continued to sys-
 tematically, arbitrarily, and secretly arrest and detain persons for all categories of
 crime for indefinite periods of time, often without any apparent intent of bringing
 the detainees to trial.
 The number of people detained by the Government and UNITA for political and
 security reasons is unknown. In May the security police arrested opposition politi-
 cian N'zuzi Domingos for allegedly defaming the character of Vice nMiister of the
 Interior/National Police Commandant Francisco da Piedade Dias dos Santos,
 "Nando." Domingos was held incommunicado for a week and was eventually re-
 leased in July with no charges filed against him.
 The Lusaka Protocol provides for the release, under ICRC auspices, of persons de-
 tained for war-related reasons. In August in the first groupthe Government re-
 leased 210 prisoners, and UNITA released 20. As of November, UNITA continued
 to deny ICRC access to another 20 prisoners who should have been released with
 the first group. In November the ICRC visited 213 persons still being detained by
 both sides; however, it only had continuing access to, and sufficient information
 about, 78 of that number.
 During the exchange process, the Government detained 200 more people in Octo-
 ber, and said it would only release them after UNITA released its prisoners. Subse-
 quently the Government resumed cooperation with the ICRC, and the release of the
 Government held detainees got back on track. The detainees included 60 civilians
 who were arrested for engagingin alleged subversive activities and held in shipping
 containers in Uie after traveingto Uige from UNITA controlled territory. Most
 government-held prisoners of war had been released by year's end.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Consitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but in practice the court system lacks the means, experience, and training to
 be truly independent from the influence of the President ana the ruling MPLA.
 The court system comprises the Supreme Court at the appellate level and munici-
 pal and provincial courts of original jurisdiction (the latter under the authority of
 the Ministry of Justice). The President of the Republic has strong appointive pow-
 ers, including appointment of Supreme Court judges, with no requirement for con-
 firmation by the National Assembly. As of October, half of the 16 seats on the Su-
 preme Court remained vacant. The Court serves as an appellate tribunal for ques-
 tions of law and fact, but it does not have authority to interpret the Constitution.
 The Constitution reserves this role for a Constitutional Court, a bench that re-
 mained empty throughout the year. Trials for political and security crimes are han-
 dled exclusively by the Supreme Court. There were no known plitical or security
 trials.
 There are credible reports that the Government holds political prisoners; however,
 the number is unknown.
 The Constitution provides defendants the presumption of innocence, the right to
 a defense and legal assistance, and the right of appeal. Amendments to the Code
 for Penal Process in 1991 provided for public trials, established a system of bail, and
 recognized the accused's right to counsel and to testify. However, the Government
 often does not respect these rights in practice. Municipal courts normally deal r-
 idly with routine civil and misdemeanor cases on a daily basis. Judges are normany
 respected laymen, not licensed lawyers. The judge and two laymen selected by the
 full court act as jury. Routine cases are normally dispatched by a court within 3
 
 
 4
 months. The verdict is pronounced the day following the conclusion of the trial, in
 the presence of the defendant.
 UNITA has established a military and a civilian court system in territory under
 its control, but the Civil Code remains secret, and trials are never public. UNITA
 President Jonas Savimbi appoints the judges. The juries consist of male elders cho-
 sen from the community. Reportedly the accused has the right to a lawyer. In early
 October, UNITA announced its intention to execute 8 former UNITA members who
 had been summarily found guilty of murdering 10 people 2 weeks earlier. It stayed
 the executions upon intervention from the international community.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government maintains a sophisticated security apparatus dedicated to surveillance,
 monitoring, and wire tapping of certain groups, includin journalists, opposition
 party leaders, members and suspected sympathizers of  TA, National Assembly
 deputies, and foreign diplomats. The law requires judicial warrants for searches of
 private homes, and that law is generally respected in practice.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.---Considation of the Lusaka Protocol peae process resulted in a substantial
 decline in the widespread abuses of humanitarian standards committed by both gov-
 ernment and UTA forces during the previous 20 years. However, government and
 UNITA forces continued to rob, rape, and kill civilians. "Bandits" (a term also ap-
 plied to rogue elements of the armed forces) were also responsible for many attacks
 against civilian populations. Millions of mines planted by Portugal, South Africa,
 Cuba, Angolan government and UNITA forces during the 20-year civil war contin-
 ued to kill and maim thousands of people. Although beth the Government and
 UNITA actively committed themselves to support demining programs, there were
 isolated instances in which local commanders in some areas continued to plant
 mines. Both sides continued to forcibly conscript children as young as 12 years into
 service throughout Angola.
 Many roads were demined and reopened as a consequence of commitments by
 both the Government and UNITA to allow the free circulation of people and goods
 throughout Angola. However, in many areas local authorities and military com-
 manders of beth parties continued to restrict free and safe passage of local popu-
 lations, humanitarian organizations providing relief assistance, and United Nations
 observers. Men in military and police uniform attacked and stole humanitarian aid
 from beneficiaries and, on a few occasions, also attacked and looted warehouses and
 road convoys carrying humanitarian relief supplies.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion and of the press, and specifically provides that the press cannot be subject to
 political, ideological, or artistic censorship. However, the Government does not re-
 spect these rights in practice. Citizens, including deputies in the National Assembly,
 expect reprisals for public criticism of the Government or the MPLA, and the Gov-
 ernment attempts to impede such criticism by monitoring political meetings. Jour-
 nalists are intimidated into practicing self-censorship. The Government runs and
 tightly controls the only daily newspaper, the only television station, and the major
 radio station and tightly restricts opposition leaders' access to these media. Two
 commercial radio stations and three private weekly and biweekly newspapers all
 practice self-censorship. The transmissions of one private radio station were cut sev-
 eral times after it broadcast remarks mildly critical of the Government.
 Media policy and censorship are controlled by a committee composed of the Min-
 ister of Social Communication, the press spokesman for the Presidency, and the di-
 rectors of the state-owned radio, television, and newspaper. Additionally, the Prime
 Minister has staff members devoted exclusively to censoring the government-owned
 and controlled newspaper Jornal de Angola. The state-controlled national radio
 headquarters in Luanda clears all programs broadcast on national radio stations in
 provincial capitals.
 Government censorship of the press and intimidation of journalists increased in
 1995. Several journalists were beaten, some brutally, in apparent retaliation for
 writings critical of government and MPLA leaders. Journalists admit that they prac-
 tice self-censorship and that repeated "errors in judgement" can result in dismissal
 and death threats. The January 18 murder of Ricardo de Mello, editor of the inde-
 pendent newsletter Imparcial Fax was a major blow to the development of a free
 press in Angola (see Section L.a.). Imparcial Fax closed down, and several of its staff
 sought safety outside the country when harassment and death threats against them
 continued. Another well-known journalist received death threats after reporting an
 embezzlement scandal involving high-level government leaders.

 The Government is less restrictive with foreign news agencies such as the Voice
 of America (VOA), the British Broadcasting Corporation, and Cable News Network.
 However, one journalist was beaten after giving an interview to VOA. Foreign jour-
 nalists require authorization from the Minister of Interior without which they can-
 not obtain access to government officials or travel within Angola. Both the Govern-
 ment and UNITA invited journalists to planned press events and to visit areas
 under their control.
 UNITA runs a tightly controlled radio station whose broadcasts of often inflam-
 matory  material are heard throughout Angola. UNITA's newspaper, Terra
 Angolana, cannot be found in government-controlled areas.
 Academic life has been severely circumscribed by the civil war, but there is aca-
 demic freedom, and academics do not practice self-censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of association, assembly, and protest, but the Government does not re-
 spect these rights in practice. Both assembly and association are strictly controlled
 by the Government. Legislation allows the Government to deny required registra-
 tion to private associations on security grounds, and the Government uses its pow-
 ers arbitrarily to limit organized activities deemed inimical to its interests. The law
 also requires a minimum of 3-days' prior notice to authorities before public or pri-
 vate assemblies and makes participants liable for "offenses against the honor and
 consideration due to persons and to the organs of sovereignty. In January the Gov-
 ernment warned ethnic Bakongos not to commemorate the second anniversary of
 the Januar 1993 "bloody Friday" massacre of Bakongos by military, police, and
 armed civilians.
 UNITA did not allow free assembly and association in areas under its control.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, includ-
 ing the separation of church and state, and the Government respects this right in
 practice. However, in October the Government published an order prohibiting the
 practice of religious activity outside of expressly approved locations. The order ap-
 peared to be aimed at Protestant evangelical churches, but it was unclear at year's
 end how it would be enforced.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement and residence with-
 in Angola and freedom of exit from and entry into the country, but the Government
 does not respect these rights inpractice. As part of the peace process both the Gov-
 ernment and UNITA committed themselves to allow the free circulation of people
 and goods, but local authorities and military commanders continued to restrict
 movement in many areas. Nevertheless, several major roads were demined and
 opened to traffic, and part of Angola's 850,000 internally displaced persons and
 300,000 refugees in neighboring countries began to return to their homes. The Gov-
 ernment continued to restrict travel of its citizens abroad, largely by limiting access
 to travel documents and exit visas, although the Government did allow resident sen-
 ior UNITA leaders to travel abroad.
 There are approximately 10,300 Zairian refugees in Angola. Angola is a signatory
 to both the United Nation s and Organization of African Unity's conventions on refu-
 gees, and the Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees. An eligibility committee to evaluate asylum claims was established on paper
 in 1990, but it was first staffed in 1995 and has yet to meet. There were no reports
 of forced expulsions of persons with valid claims to refugee status, although some
 people who were deported in course of the year for criminal violations claimed to
 be refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides all adult citizens with the right to vote by secret ballot
 in direct, multiparty elections to choose the President of the Republic and deputies
 of the National Assembly. The President is elected by absolute majority. If no can-
 didate obtains a majority of votes cast there is a runoff between the two candidates
 with the highest number of votes. The National Assembly consists of 220 deputies,
 130 elected on a national basis and 90 elected to represent the provinces. Ruling
 power is concentrated in the President, who appoints a Prime Mister and other
 members of the Council of Ministers through which the President exercises execu-
 tive power. The Council can enact decree-laws, decrees, and resolutions, thereby
 controllng most functions normally associated with the legislative branch.
 The Angolan people exercised their new constitutional right to elect their govern-
 ment in September 1992 presidential and legislative elections. President dos Santos
 won 49.5 percent of the votes and should have faced UNITA leader Savimbi in a
 run-off election. UNITA and other parties accused the Government of massive elec-
 
 
 toral fraud, but United Nations' observers declared that the elections were generally
 free and fair and called on UNITA to accept the results. The civil war resumed after
 UNITA rejected the election results, and the runoff in the presidential elections was
 postponed indefinitely. Consequently, a small group within the MPLA has succeeded
 in maintaining a monopoly on government power. As part of the peace process both
 parties agreed in 1995 to amend the Constitution to provide for two vice-presidents;
 one of the two was offered to UNITA.
 The National Assembly exercises no meaningful power independent of the ruling
 executive structure. Five of the 70 UNITA deputies elected to the National Assem-
 bly in the 1992 election took their seats in 1995. Several small parties are also rep-
 resented in the National Assembly; however, few opposition deputies participated in
 National Assembly debate. Some MPIA deputies admitted that National Assembly
 debate was frequently superfluous, and the Assembly simply rubber-stamped the
 Presidency's initiatives.
 In 1993 the Government prepared guidelines for local government elections,
 scheduled to take place 2 years after the 1992 presidential and legislative elections.
 However the Council of Ministers took no action to implement these guidelines, ef-
 fectively shelving local elections indefinitely.
 There are no legal barriers to the participation of women in the political process.
 Women occupied 32 of the 220 National Assembly seats. Five of 68 senior members
 of the Government are women, and 1 of the 9 Supreme Court judges is a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Both the Government and UNITA impede independent investigations of human
 rights abuses in territory they control. Because of government suppression, there
 were no actively functioning Angolan human rights monitoring groups in 1995.
 Shortly after the Angolan Human Rights Association (ADHA) published a report
 critical of conditions in Angola's prisons in January 1994, both its President, Wil-
 liam Tonet, and its Secretary General, Lourenco Agostinho, were arrested on spuri-
 ous charges. William Tonet's trial was repeatedly postponed and remained pending
 at midyear. Agostinho remained in detention, and, at year's end, the Supreme Court
 had not yet responded to his appeal. The Human Rights Committee of the National
 Assembly remained moribund.
 The UNAVEM Human Rights Unit and UNAVEM's military and civilian police
 observers were the only effective human rights monitors, but they did not make the
 conclusions of their investigations public. Additionally, the Government and UNITA
 frequently interfered in UNAVEM's attempts to investigate complaints of human
 rights violations. The Government granted the ICRC limited access to prisons in
 1995. However, both the Government and UNITA denied the ICRC access to people
 it believes are being held as prisoners (see Section 1.d.).
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Under the Constitution all citizens are equal before the law and enjoy the same
 rights and responsibilities regardless of color, race, ethnicity, sex, place of birth, reli-
 Won, ideology, degree of education, or economic or social condition. The Government
 does not have the ability to effectively enforce these provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women is widespread and increasing. A study by a re-
 nowned jurist indicated that one-third of all homicides were perpetrated against
 women, usually by their spouses. There are credible reports that women are targets
 of violent crimes including rape and robbery in areas captured by government and
 UNITA soldiers. Due to dire economic circumstances, increasing numbers of women
 engage in prostitution, and the clergy report that marriages are breaking down at
 an alarming rate.
 Despite Constitutional provisions women suffer from societal discrimination. Some
 women hold senior positions in the military (primarily in the medical field), civil
 service, and political parties, but women are mostly relegated to low-level positions
 in state-run industries and in the small private sector. The law provides for eual
 pay for equal work, but in practice women are not compensated equally. Adult
 women may open a bank account, accept employment, and own property without in-
 terference from their spouses. Women also have the right to inherit property. Upon
 the death of a male head of household, the widow automatically is entitled to 50
 percent of any estate with the remainder divided equally among legitimate male and
 emale children.
 In many cities women swell the ranks of the disabled because they often set off
 land mines while foraging in the fields for food and firewood to feed their families.
 
 
 Children.-The Government gives only marginal attention to children's rights and
 welfare. As noted in Section 1.g., both the Government and UNITA forcibly con-
 script children as young as 12 into service. A great increase in the number of street
 children in Luanda and other cities resulted from the continuing breakdown of fam-
 ily structure caused by the resumption of the civil war in 1992 and the continuing
 deterioration of the economy. Young girls often take jobs as domestic servants in
 private homes while young boys roam the market places and streets. Living condi-
 tions in government youth hostels are so poor that the majority of homeless chnildren
 prefer to sleep on city streets.
 The Government-sponsored National Institute for Children-viewed as an MPLA
 organ-has not seriously addressed the problems children face and has been indif-
 ferent toward efforts by international nongovernmental organizations to assist dis-
 possessed youth. There are no active private children's rights advocacy grups.
 Medical authorities say that some female genital mutilation (FGM), which is
 widely condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and
 psychological health, occurs in remote areas of Moxico Provine, bordering Zaire and
 Zambia. Government health workers sporadically have campaigned against the
 practice.
 People With Disabiities.-The number of physically disabled persons in Angola in-
 cludes an estimated 70,000 people who required amputations due to mine explo-
 sions. While there is no institutional discrimination against people with disabilities,
 the Government is doing little to improve their physical, financial, or social distress.
 There is no legislation mandating accessibility for the disabled to public or private
 facilities, and, given the war-torn nature of the nation's infrastructure, it is difficult
 for the disabled to find employment or participate in the educational system.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Angola's population includes 1 to 2 percent
 of Khoisan and other linguistically distinct hunter, gatherer tribes scattered
 throughout the southern provinces of Namibe, Cunene, and Cuando Cubango. There
 is no evidence that they suffer from official discrimination or harassment, but they
 do not participate actively in the political or economic life of the country and have
 a marginal ability to influence government decisions concerning their interests.
 The long civil conflict has deep ethnic and urban versus rural roots. Many of the
 small number of white and mixed race Angolans who occupy technical and govern-
 mental positions have strongly backed the MPLA. The Government accuses UNITA
 of exacerbating ethnic tensions by dwelling on the perceived colonial ties of these
 people.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right to form and
 join trade unions, engage in union activity, and strike, but the Government does not
 respect these rights in practice. The Government dominates the labor movement
 through the National Union of Angolan Workers (UNTA), the labor organ of the rul-
 ing MPLA. The law requires that labor unions be recognized by the Government.
 At least three independent labor unions, which have petitioned for recognition, have
 never received a response from the Government. Restrictions on civil liberties effec-
 tively prevent any labor activity not approved by the Government.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and legislation passed in 1991
 provides the legal framework for, and strictly regulates the exercise of, that right.
 The law prohibits lockouts and worker occupation of places of employment and pro-
 vides protection for nonstriking workers. It prohibits strikes by military and police
 personnel, prison workers, and firemen. The law does not effectively prohibit em-
 ployer retribution against strikers.
 There were wildcat strikes against the Government by teachers, doctors, nurses,
 airline personnel, and Justice Ministry civil servants, among others. The Health and
 Education Ministries negotiated settlements but repeatedly failed to honor them be-
 cause of lack of resources. The Justice Ministry declared the strike by its civil serv-
 ants illegal. In September UNTA announced a planned 1-day general strike that
 was to have been the first labor action in its history. However, the strike was can-
 celed after the Government announced price controls on essential commodities and
 agreed to continue discussions with UNTA on other issues.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to organize and the law provides for collective bargaining, but the Govern-
 ment does not respect these rights in practice. The Government dominates the econ-
 omy through state-rn  enterprises and the Ministry of Public Administration, Em-
 ployment and Social Security sets wages and benefits on an annual basis. In the
 small private sector, wages are based on multiples of the minimum salary set by
 the Government. Legislation prohibits discrimination against union members. Union
 members' complaints are adjudicated in the regular civil courts. Employers found
 
 
 guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union
 activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor-Current law authorizing forced
 labor for breaches of worker discipline and participation in strikes has been cited
 by the International Labor Organization as a violation of its Convention 105.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 14. The Inspector General of the Ministry of Public Administration, Em-
 ployment, and Social Security is -responsible for enforcing labor laws. This Ministry
 maintains employment centers where prospective employees register, and these cen-
 ters screen out applicants under the age of 14. However, many younger children
 work on family farms, as domestic servants, and in the informal economy. The sur-
 vival of Angola's growing number of street children underscores the role of child
 labor in the informal urban economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage set by the Ministry of
 Public Administration, Labor and Social Security was equivalent to $0.67 (6,336
 kwanzas reajustados) per month in September. However, the Government does not
 enforce this standard. Neither the minimum wage nor the average monthly salary
