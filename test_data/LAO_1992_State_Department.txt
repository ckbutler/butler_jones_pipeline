LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) is a Communist, one-party state.
 The ruling Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) is the only party and the pri-
 mary source of political authority in the country. The party's leadership imposes
 broad controls on Laos' 4 million people.
 In 1992 the Government launched a campaign to disseminate the new Constitu-
 tion, which had been adopted by the National Assembly in 1991, to the Lao public.
 The Constitution confers substantial powers on the National Assembly and provides
 for the free election of National Assembly members. However, the Constitution is
 silent on the question of allowing competing political parties. To date there has been
 no visible progress in implementing the freedoms provided for in the Constitution.
 In keeping with its efforts at economic development and legal reform, the Govern-
 ment has made a substantial effort to develoo a legal system with a codified body
 
 
 603
 of laws dealing with contracts, foreign investment, private property, labor and fam-
 ily, and a Penal Code. Elections for a new Nation      ly took place in Decem-
 ber.
 The Ministry of Interior (MOI) remains the main instrument of state control. The
 MOI police monitor Lao society and foreign nationals who live in Laos, and the
 LPRP also has its own system of informants in workplaces and residential commu-
 nities. However, the extent of this monitoring is decreasing as political and economic
 change continues.
 Laos is one of the world's poorest and least developed countries. In the first few
 years after the LPDR came to power in 1975, at least 350,000 La fled the country
 to escape the Government's harsh political and economic policies. The Government
 abandoned Socialist economic policies in 1985 and instituted a series of sweeping
 economic reforms that have changed the country from a centrally planned to a mar-
 ket-oriented economy. These reforms have improved the economy, which is now
 dominated by private enterprise.
 The people of Laos are denied many basic freedoms. Even under the new Con-
 stitution, freedom of speech and press, freedom of assembly, the right of privacy,
 and the right of citizens to change their government are still absent. Although pro-
 vided for in the new Constitution, freedom of worship, freedom of speech, and free-
 dom of the press, remain significantly restricted in practice, and citizens do not have
 the right and ability to change the Government peacefully.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Composed primarily of Hmong
 tribesmen who conduct small-scale military operations, an ongoing, small-scale in-
 surgency continued in 1992 at a level somewhat greater than the previous year.
 Greater cooperation between Laos and Thailand on border security further eroded
 foreign support for the insurgency. Both sides reportedly used brutal tactics, with
 the insurgents occasionally assassinating military and local officials. In early 1992,
 insurgents allegedly ambushed a civilian bus near Tha Bok. Seven Vietnamese pas-
 sengers were executed. Insurgents in Vientiane Province also launched attacks
 against undefended villages at Sanakham and at Muang Pheuang. There were also
 unconfirmed reports that in late 1992 Lao military forces launched reprisals against
 proinsu    t Hong villages in Sayaburi Province. Reportedly a number of Hmong
 civilians were killed in these reprisals.
 b. Disappearances.-No disappearances were reported in 1992.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Lao Penal Code prohibits torture or mistreatment of prisoners, and the police
 do not appear to use torture or abuse during arrest and detention. However, jail
 conditions are harsh, and prisoners are routinely denied family visitation and prop-
 er medical care. Prisoners in some jails reportedly must resort to bribing their
 guards to obtain food and medicines.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Those accused of hostility to the regime
 are subject to arrest and confinement for long periods. The Lao Supreme Court tried
 three of the eight former Royal Lao Government officials and officers who had been
 held in internal exile in Houaphan Province on November 4. Prior to the December
 17 announcement of the trial and sentencing, the Government had consistently
 maintained that the eight had in fact been released and were remaining in
 Houaphan of their own choice. The three were found guilty of various crimes alleg-
 edly committed during the previous regime and given life sentences. These alleged
 crimes included murder, illegal arrest and detention, infringement of individual lib-
 erty abuse of power, and intentional acts of damaging thepeople's property. In De-
 cember the remaining five persons who had been held in Houaphan Province were
 released from internal exile and reportedly returned to Vientiane. At the same time,
 the Lao Supreme Court sentenced three former government officials, who had been
 held without charge since 1990 for advocating a multiparty system, to 14 years each
 for treason, subversive propaganda against the social order, defamation, and creat-
 ing disorder in the detention center where they had been held since their arrest.
 In 1992 provincial courts in Luang Namtha and Xieng Khouang Provinces handed
 down sentences ranging from 3 years to life imprisonment to Lao citizens convicted
 of unspecified "treasonous acts." Provincial courts in Sekong and Savannakhet Prov-
 inces handed down sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years to a group of Lao con-
 victed of spying and attempting to create public disturbances. On September 30, the
 court in Khammouane Province sentencedthree people for gathering some "bad ele-
 ments" with the intention of creating disturbances in society. One received a 3-year
 sentence, and the other two received 1-year sentences. Lao guilty of what the Gov-
 
 
 604
 ernment calls "socially undesirable habits" such as prostitution, drug abuse, and va-
 grancy are subject to arrest and confinement in 'rehabilitation centers," usually
 without public trial. In June a group of 93 Lao women were convicted of prostitution
 and given prison sentences ranging from a few months to 7 years. Most of those
 sent to rehabilitation centers are allowed to return home after serving sentences
 that include forced labor, political indoctrination, and admission of guilt. The No-
 vember 1989 Penal Code contains some protection for those accused of crimes, such
 as a statute of limitations and provisions for public trials. The Code has not been
 effectively implemented.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The National Assembly enacted a criminal code
 and laws establishing a judiciary in November 1989, but there has been no effective
 implementation. People may be arrested on unsupported accusations and without
 being informed of the charges or of the accusers' identities. Although regulations call
 for judgment to be given in public, this amounts in practice to public announcement
 of the sentence anfinot a true public trial. There is some provision for appeal, al-
 though there is reportedly no appeal in important political cases. The Council of
 Ministers must approve death sentences. Under the new Constitution, judges and
 prosecutors are supposed to be independent and their decisions not subject to out-
 side scrutiny. In practice, the courts appear to accept recommendations of other gov-
 ernment agencies, especially the MO, in making their decisions. While in theory
 government-provided legal counsel is available to the accused, in fact persons ac-
 cused of crimes must defend themselves without outside legal assistance. The Gov-
 ernment suspended the Laos bar in late 1992, pending the introduction of rules re-
 garding the activities of private lawyers. As a result, there are now no private law-
 yers practicing in Laos.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-With
 the recent liberalization of the economy, the Government has relaxed some elements
 of state control, including police monitoring of personal and business activities and
 enforcement of the nighttime curfew. However, while the new Constitution prohibits
 arrests or searches in homes without warrants or authorization, search and seizure
 cdntinue to be authorized by the security bureaus themselves rather than by judicial
 authority. Monitoring of international mail and telephone calls continues. In 1992
 the MOI began making late-night inspections of households to insure that all those
 in the house were registered with police. Those found unregistered were often de-
 tained for several days. The Government also began reinstating workers' committees
 among Lao employees of embassies and international organizations. The committees
 are charged with conducting political training and maintaing i    pline among
 employees. The new Penal Code outlaws listening to telephone cals wthout author-
 ization, but the security bureaus themselves probably have the right to make such
 authorization. The Government has lifted restrictions on the sale of privately owned
 land and implemented a new law to return property confiscated after 1975 to the
 original owners. However, a November 1990 decree provides for the confiscation of
 property of some 30 officials of the former government who were convicted in
 absentia in 1975 and are not allowed to return to Laos. In practice, many returning
 Lao have successfully petitioned the Government to have their property returned.
 In some cases where the property is now used as housing by government officials,
 the petitions to have property returned remain in litigation.
 The Government and party continue to monitor some aspects of family life
 through a system of neighborhood and workplace committees. The neighborhood
 committees have responsibility for maintaining public order and reporting "bad ele-
 ments" to the police.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Despite the constitutional guarantees of free-
 dom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly, the exercise of these
 freedoms is broadly controlled by the Government. The Government reacts harshly
 to expressions of political dissent. As noted in Section 1.d., three officials and former
 officials arrested in October 1990 for reportedly advocating a multiparty system for
 Laos each received 14-year prison sentences. The new Penal Code bars slandering
 the State, including distorting party or state policies, and spreading false rumors
 conducive to disorder. The Penaf Code also bars disseminating books and other ma-
 terials that are deemed indecent or would infringe on the national culture. In De-
 cember an American citizen received a 3-year prison sentence for having brought
 politically sensitive and allegedly pornographic material into the country.
 Newspapers and the state radio andtelevision are instruments of the Govern-
 ment, reflecting its views. The constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press
 leaves open the possibility of nongovernment publications, and at least one privately
 owned business publication is now published in Laos. The Government has tradi-
 
 
 tionally sought to control the flow of information from abroad, and there are limita-
 tions on the importation of foreign publications, though some Thai and Western
 newspapers and magazines are sold. The Government makes no effort to discourage
 reception of Thai radio or television broadcasts, which are widely listened to and
 watched in the Mekong River valley. Video rental stores operate largely without re-
 strictions in most Lao cities, although such stores are prohibited from carrying por-
 nographic or politically inflammatory material.
 Academic freedom remains tightly controlled by the Government. Lao academi-
 cians are often denied permission to travel aboard for conferences or for training.
 The Government also severely restricts the activities of Western scholars wishing
 to conduct research in Laos. In 1992 two American Fulbright scholars were denied
 permission to conduct research outside of Vientiane, and they were forced to leave
 Laos before the completion of their research when their visas were not renewed.
 Scholars from other countries have reported similar difficulties in conducting re-
 search in Laos.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government controls and
 organizes most largepublic gatherings except for religious, athletic, and communal
 events. The new Pena Code expressy prouZits demonstrations or protest marches
 aimed at causing turmoil and social instability, prescribing penalties from 1 to 5
 years' imprisonment. Unspecified "destabilizing subversive activities" are also
 banned, with penalties ranging from house arrest to death. All associations are
 party controlled and disseminate official policy. The Constitution specifies the right
 of Lao citizens to organize and join associations, but they have been unable to exer-
 cise this right except through professional groups that are organized and directed
 by the LPRP.
 Contact between ordinary Lao and foreigners is increasing as restrictions, such
 as the requirement for government approval of invitations to most foreigners'
 homes, are no longer enforced. The prohibition against foreigners staying with Lao
 families has likewise been eased in urban areas, and the Government allows Lao
 citizens to marry foreigners as long as government approval of the marriage is ob-
 tained first. Marriages conducted without government approval may be annulled
 and the foreign spouse subject to fine or arrest. In 1992 the MOI arrested or seized
 the passports of several overseas Lao who married without prior government ap-
 proval and detained them or prevented their departure from Laes for periods of up
 to several weeks. In 1992 the Government tightened restrictions on foreigners trav-
 eling outside of Vientiane, making travel difficult. In many instances the restric-
 tions appear aimed at forestalling contact between foreigners and insurgent groups
 or preventing religious proselytizing.
 c. Freedom of Rel   n.-In offcial statements, the Government has recognized
 the right to freedom of religion as well as the contributions religion can make to
 the development of the nation, and the Constitution contains provisions for religious
 freedom. However, the practice of religion remains restricted, especially for non-
 Buddhists.
 Nearly all lowland Lao are Buddhists, with substantial Christian and Moslem mi-
 norities in urban areas; most highland Lao are animists. The Government has open-
 ly supported Buddhist organizations in recent years. It no longer seeks to suppress
 Buddhism, and high-ranking government officials routinely attend Buddhist func-
 tions. The Government tolerates and encourages the open practice of Buddhism, and
 many temples are being repaired -und restored. The number of Buddhist monks has
 increased in recent years, and there are about 30,000 practicing in Laos. Monks re-
 main the only social group still entitled to use special honorific terms of address,
 and these are used even by high party and government officials. Buddhist clergy are
 prominently featured at important state and party functions. The Government per.
 mits religious festivals to be held without hindrance.
 Links with coreligionists and religious associations in other countries require gov-
 ernment approval. The Government does not formally ban missionaries from enter-
 ing Laos to proselytize but almost always denies them permission to enter. Many
 resident foreigners are active in Lao churches and provide assistance in setting up
 new churches. The Government welcomes nongovernmental organizations with reli-
 gious affiliations as long as they contribute to national development and do not
 openly proselytize. In 1992 the director of the Lao office of a U.S. nongovernmental
 organization was expelled from Laos, allegedly for bringing religious material into
 the country. His organization agreed to his expulsion and is maintaining its office
 in Laos.
 Roman Catholics and Protestants are permitted to worship openly, and new
 churches have opened since 1990. About a dozen Catholic and Protestant churches
 are active in Vientiane, with many other churches scattered throughout the country.
 All Catholic and Protestant seminaries were ordered closed by the Government in
 
 
 606
 1975, and they have not reopened. Those wishing to enter the priesthood must study
 privately with priests or ministers. Almost all Protestant ministers are lay preach-
 ers.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government retains the right to require citizens to obtain official
 permission for internal travel. The Government must approve travel by all foreign-
 ers. In 1992 the Government tightened restrictions on travel outside Vientiane. It
 ceased issuing blanket travel permits to aid workers, requiring them to obtain such
 permission each time they traveled outside Vientiane. The Government likewise in-
 creased restrictions applying to tourists visiting other provinces.
 In contrast, most Lao easily obtain government permission and exit permits to
 travel abroad. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues passports and eit permits.
 Border crossing permits for Lao to visit Thailand are routinely available from local
 village committees for a modest issuance fee. Travel to the United States and other
 Western countries has risen dramatically in the past several years. In recent years,
 the number of Lao emigrating to live with relatives abroad has also increased sharp-
 ly, and the Government does not appear to interfere with persons desiring to emi-
 grate.
 The stated government policy since 1977 has been to welcome back the approxi-
 mately 10 percent of the population who fled after the change of governments in
 1975. Since 1988 thousandsof Lao living abroad have returned to visit family and
 friends. A number of Lao have returned to investigate business possibilities, and
 several have remained operating businesses. Under the new Property Code, many
 returning Lao have successfully petitioned to regain their property.
 Laos has also agreed to take back its citizens who crossed into Thailand, mostly
 to seek refugee status, but who now wish to return home. The Government's policy
 is to return any properties that were confiscated, but some who fled Laos are ex-
 cluded from this policy. Since May 1980, when the Government reached agreement
 on a repatriation prgram with Thailand, the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR), voluntarily returned nearly 12,000 Lao to Laos. Lowland
 Lao made up the majority of returnees; manof f the 46,000 hilltribe Lao living in
 refugee camps in Thalandhave expressed an interest in returning.
 In July 1992, as in 1991, Laos, Thailand, and the UNHCR agreed on a phased
 return of the hilltribe Lao remaining in Thailand who wiShed to return to Laos.
 This agreement includes provisions for the careful monitorin of returnees to insure
 they are given the same rights and treatment as residentiLao. Those who return
 are generally given several days of political instruction and then usually sent to spe-
 cial resettlement areas provided by the Government. The UNHCR provides basic ne-
 cessities and is given regular access to monitor treatment of the returnees and liv-
 ing conditions. Aoding to the UNHCR, returnees have not been subjected to dis-
 crimination, official or otherwise, and are allowed back with all the beogng they
 accumulated while outside of Laos.
 In addition to those repatriated under the UNHOR program, an estimated 30,000
 people have repatriated themselves without official involvement.
 In May 1992, a Chinese engaged couple sought political asylum with the Vien-
 tiane UNHCR office. Asylum was granted, and the couple was accepted for emigra-
 tion to Denmark. However, the Government subsequently detainedthe couple and
 forcibly returned the man to the People's Republic of China. The woman evaded the
 police and was allowed to depart for Denmark. The Government declined to discuss
 the case with Western embassies or to accept a demarche from Western amibas-
 sadors to prtest the detention and forced return of the man.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of' Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the ability to change their government despite constitutional
 provisions for secret ballots and universal suffrage in the public eletion of National
 Assembly members. Under the new Constitution, citizens elect members of the As-
 sembly, which in turn elects the President. Becaus he LPRP continues to domi-
 nate government and politics, there is no structured way in which citizens could re-
 move the LPRP from power.
 The National Assembly was elected by secret ballot in December. It includes a
 number of legislators who are not members of the LPRP, though all candidates had
 to be approved by the carty. A total of 85 seats were contested. No other parties
 were permitted to organlze, and voting was mandatory.
 The new Constitution provides for elections by secret ballot of many important of-
 ficials. It stipulates the primacy of the LPRP but does not s  '.cally prohibit other
 parties. The Government has yet to allow the formation od other political arties.
 Four women and 4 members of minority tribes were elected to the 55-person Central
 
 
 607
 Committee of the LPRP in April 1991. Ethnic minorities occupy many important
 government positions, including that of Minister of Interior.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no domestic human rights groups. Any organization wishing to inves-
 tigate and publicly criticize the Government's human rights policies would face seri-
 ous obstacles, if it were permitted to operate at all. Laos generally does not cooper-
 ate with international human rights organizations. It has,however, permitted visits
 by officials of international humanitarian organizations and has communicated with
 them by letter. The Government characterized the "Country Report on Human
 Rights Practices for 1991" as interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign coun-
 try.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Approximately one-half of the population is ethnic Lao, also called 'Lowland Lao,"
 and the other half a mosaic of upland hilltribes. The Government is attempting to
 integrate these groups through voluntary programs and to overcome traditional an.
 tagonisms between lowland Lao and minority groups. The new Constitution specifi-
 cally provides for equal rights for all minorities, and there is no legal discrimination
 aganst them. While the Government encourages the preservation of minority cul-
 tures and traditions, minority tribes have virtually no voice in government decisions
 affecting their lands and the allocation of natural resources. The party and the Gov-
 ernment continue to be dominated by lowland Lao males, though efforts have been
 made to include minorities in the political and governmental elites.
 The Hmong, the largest highland tribe are split along clan lines. During the Viet-
 nam War era, many were strongly anti-Communist whle others sided wit hthe Lao
 communists and. the Vietnamese. The Government has repressed many of those
 ups who fought against it, especially those continuing to resist its authority by
 force. The Hmong tried to defend some of their tribal areas after 1975, and some
 continue to support insurgent groups. Lao armed forces conduct operations against
 armed insurgents, most of whom are Hmong. Many Hmong who supported the Lao
 Communistsdfore 1975 today occupy important positions in the Government.
 Traditionally, women in Lao society have been subservient to men and have often
 been discouraged from obtaining an education. The Government claims a higher per-
 centage of women are in school now     there were before 1975 and that women
 are being encouraged to assume a greater role in, economic and political activity.
 The active, but government-controlled, Lao Women's Union has as one of its stated
 goala the achievement of equal rights for women, which are provided for in the new
 Constitution. Women ocupy responsible positions in government and private busi-
 ness. The 1990 Labor Code offers special protection for women and children in the
 workplace. There is no pattern of widespread domestic or culturally approved vio-
 lence against women, but bth lowland 7Lao and hilltribes tend to hold women in
 lower esteem than men.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Asociation.An estimated 85 percent of the Lao working popu-
 lation are subsistence farmers. Among salaried workers, the majority are employed
 by the State, though this is changing rapidly as the Government privatizes many
 oufits stat enterpnses and encourages private investors to open new factories. Be-
 cause of the emerging private sector, in November 1990, the Government adopted
 a Labor Code which permits labor unions to be formed in the private enterprises
 so long as they operate within the framework of the officially sanctioned single trade
 union federation, the Federation of Lao Trade Unions (FLt), which is controlled
 by the LPRP. The Labor Code also stipulates that labor disputes have to be resolved
 by workplace ommittees whose membership includes union representatives. The
 FLTU is affiliated with the Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade
 Unions. The extent to which the FLTU is free to engage in contacts and activities
 with foreign labor organizations   o unknown.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no right to organize
 and bargain collectively. The Labor Code stipulates that disputes must be resolved
 through the formation of a committee in the workplace composed of employees and
 representatives of the local labor union, as well as representatives of the FLTU.
 Wages and salaries for government employees are set by the Government, while
 wager es   e    s forprivate business employees are set by management. Most sal-
 aried employees work or the State. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Cornpulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 labor except in time of war or national disaster, when the state may conscript labor-
 ers. Prisoners in prison camps are expected to do manual labor, including growing
 
 
 their own food, and they are used routinely for labor an both state and private en-
 terprises located near prison facilities. In addition, there are reports that some of
 these prisoners when released, are restricted to the general area of the camp and
 expected to work in state enterprises.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the Labor Code, children
 under 15 may not be recruited for labor. Because many children help their families
 on farms or in shops, the Code allows for younger children to work for their families,
 provided they are not engaged in dangerous or difficult work. Employment of chil-
 ren in Laos, grwing industrial sector is not widespread, although it is common in
 urban shops. The MOI and Ministry of Justice are responsible for enforcing these
 provisions, but enforcement is ineffective owing to a lack of inspection personnel and
 other resources. The Government has established a standard of compulsory edu-
 cation requiring completion of primary school grade 5, but this requirement is rarely
 observed in the rural areas or among disadvantaged urban families.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Laos has a minimum wage, although it is not
 widely known and largely ignored by employers. The Labor Code has provisions for
 a broad range of entitlements for workers, including a workweek limited to 48 hours
 (36 in dangerous activities) and safe working conditions. A worker may not be fired
 without cause. Workplace conditions are not systematically exploitative but often
 fail to protect workers adequately against sickness or accident. The Labor Code re-
 quires employers to provide a safe work environment for employees and offers spe-
 cial compensation for workers engaged in dangerous work. Employers must gen-
 erally provide all expenses for a worker injured or killed while at work. In general,
 the stipulations of the Labor Code are not observed in practice, seem to be little
 known to employers, and lack any real enforcement mechanisms.
