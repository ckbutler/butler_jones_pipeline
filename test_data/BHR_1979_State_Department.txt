 BAHRAIN
 A crossroads and trading center in the Arabian Gulf as far
 back as Mesopotamian times, Bahrain today is governed by an
 Amir and a 17-member cabinet composed of 8 members of the
 ruling Al-Khalifa family and nine commoners, four of whom
 are of the Sunni branch of islam, while five are Shia. The
 first state of the Gulf to discover oil and to offer broad
 educational and social services to its populace, Bahrain
 enjoys a   regional reputation for sophistication, tolerance
 and liberalism, and has long served as a safehaven for re-
 fugees. Governed under the liberal Malikite tradition of
 Islam, the Shaikhdom offers full religious freedom to its
 diverse communities. Christians, Jews and Hindus worship
 freely as do a variety of Islamic sects, both Shia and Sunni.
 A dual judicial system of Sunni and Shia courts operates in
 the areas of family and customary law.
 The constitution of May 26, 1973 provides strict safeguards
 for personal liberties and commits the state to advancing
 social welfare. After a 20-month experiment with a partfal1y"
 elected legislature, the Amir in 1975 dissolved the National
 Assembly, and no new elections have been held. The constitu-
 tional provision permitting the formation of trade unions has
 not yet been implemented. Illegal demonstrations by Shia
 dissidents in August/September 1979 were generally treated
 with     restraint. When repeated warnings failed to produce
 compliance with local law, a small number of organizers (5 to
 10 persons) were arrested and detained in prison without trial
 under the 1974 state security law. Some ten other prisoners,
 previously detained for civil disobedience, were released on
 the Eid al-Fitr (August 1979) by amnesty of the Amir.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 In dealing with a small but well-organized radical opposition
 group, which carried out the political assassination of a
 journalist in 1976, security officials during interrogation
 tortured some persons believed to-be involved in the assassina-
 tion. No more recent instances of torture, which is specifically
 forbidden by the constitution, have been reported.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Purishment
 The government of Bahrain does not practice cruel, inhman or
 degrading punishment.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or imprisonment
 The State Security Act of 1974 permits preventive detention
 when police authorities have evidence of words or deeds con-
 sidered detrimental to the Nation's internal or external security.
 In practice, this broad provision has been interpreted to mean
 a serious and imminent threat to public order or to members of
 the ruling family, diplomats, or high officials, Imprisonment
 under this law requires a court order and may not exceed three
 years. A detainee may appeal his imprisonment to the Supreme
 Appelate Court after three months in detention and may
 renew the appeal every six months.
 In August 1979, the government invoked this law to arrest and
 imprison several Shia religious leaders for publicly inciting
 the populace against the ruling family and government. Two

 others were arrested for receiving and distributing
 inflammatory leaflets against the Amir. In the recent past,
 the law also has been used to detain members of leftist or-
 ganizations advocating violent overthrow of the government
 in Bahrain. It is believed that there were at the end of
 1979 fewer than 20 persons imprisoned under the State Security Act.
 There have been instances in wbich the same people were
 arrested, released and re-arrested several times over a
 period of years.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials are usually provided in Bahrain. The
 constitution provides that defendants in criminal cases, shall
 be presumed innocent until proven guilty and shall have the
 right to counsel. Trials related to national security are
 held in camera before the Supreme Court of Appeal. There
 have been no such trials in the past three years.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution declares private residences to be inviolable
 except in cases of dire necessity as p-rescribed by law.
 The state security law allows private residences to be search-
 ed in cases where the occupant is suspected of
 posing a serious and imminent threat to public order and after
 a court order has been obtained. Although in the past
 Bahraini authorities occasionally entered and searched
 private residences without a permit, no such instances
 have been reported in the last three years
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Beginning with the first receipt of oil income forty years ago,
 Bahrain's government has set an example in the region by adopting
 generous social policies toward public health care and educa-
 tion. Free public health treatment is available to all citizens
 and residents of Bahrain, as is education through the high school
 level. The constitution states that it is a national purpose to
 ensure public education and to eliminate illiteracy. Since
 1975, the government has subsidized basic food prices and has
 been engaged in an ambitious program to provide public housing
 for low and middle income families. Social security programs
 are being expanded. Over fifty percent of the public budget
 goes to providing social services to the nation's citizens.
 Virtually no taxes are imposed, and public funds are
 equitably distributed. There is a small number of
 wealthy families who have benefited disproportionately from
 the development boom of the mid-seventies. Bahrain takes
 pride in the low level of crime in its society and the re-
 lative lack of serious corruption in its public life.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Bahrainis are free to express views critical of the government
 in private, but publication of such criticism "directed toward
 the Amir or heads of state of friendly governments, or which
 would tend to undermine public morals or public order," is
 restricted both by the State Security Law and the 1979 Publi-
 cations Law. The latter act requires local journalists to
 obtain permits from the Ministry of Information and gives the
 Ministry potentially far-reaching authority to censor local
 media and control importation of foreign publications. It has
 
 
 721
 not yet been invoked, and the press readily criticizes the
 government's handling of domestic economic and social
 matters. Religious, ethnic, and racial tolerance is charac-
 teristic of Bahraini social attitudes and legal practice.
 Bahraini Jews play an important role in the business community.
 A variety of Islamic and Christian sects maintain places of
 worship and freely practice their religion in Bahrain.
 Freedom of private assembly is guaranteed by the constitution,
 but the government, as recently as mid-1979, has prohibited pub-
 lic gatherings deemed threatening to internal security.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Babrainis are free to move within the country, to travel abroad
 and to emigrate. The constitution prohibits exile as a form
 of punishment. Passports of students which had been withdrawn
 because of their political activities or associations outside
 the country were restored by Decree of the Amir in September 1979.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Bahrain's first popularly-elected legislature was dissolved in
 1975 after a stormy, 20-month existence. Citizens enjoy easy
 access to government leaders and to the Amir whose twice-weekly
 audience (majlis) is open to all Bahrainis. The cabinet is
 reasonably representative of the community and consults widely,
 though informally, with community interest groups.
 The status of women in Bahrain is advanced for the peninsula
 region. Education has long been available to women, and women now
 constitute about eight percent of the Bahraini component of the work
 force. Several senior government officials are women.
 For thirty years, Bahrain has had an active labor movement, which
 at one time represented a potent political force. Trade unions,
 while envisaged in the constitution, remain illegal. Workers are
 organized on an industry-by-industry basis into workers' councils
 which perform social welfare functions and serve as a channel to
 management for resolving worker grievances. The labor law and
 readily available government mediation mechanisms offer workers
 a reasonably high degree of legal and social protection.
 4.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Amnesty International, according to its 1978 report, had 24
 adopted prisoners in Bahrain. It also reported that previous
 approaches to the Amir had resulted in a number of prisoners
 being released. In June 1979, a number of prisoners previously
 held in rather primitive conditions on Jidda Island and in
 Safra Prison were transferred to a new prison facility at Jau.
 On religious or national holidays, the Amir periodically announces
 an amnesty of prisoners. He did so in December 1977 and again in
 August 1979.
