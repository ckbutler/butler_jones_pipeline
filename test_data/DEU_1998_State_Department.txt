 GERMANY
 The Federal Republic of Germany is a constitutional parliamentary democracy;
 citizens periodically choose their representatives in free and fair multiparty elec-
 tions. The head of the Federal Government, the Chancellor, is elected by the lower
 house of Parliament. The powers of the Chancellor and of the Parliament are set
 forth in the Basic Law (Constitution). The 16 states enjoy significant autonomy, es-
 pecially as concerns law enforcement and the courts, education, the environment,
 and social assistance. The judiciary is independent.
 Law enforcement is primarily a responsibility of state governments, and the police
 are organized at the state level. The jurisdiction of the Federal Criminal Office is
 limited to counterterrorism, international organized crime, especially narcotics traf-
 ficking, weapons smuggling, and currency counterfeiting. Police forces in general are
 well trained, disciplined, and mindful of citizens' rights, although there were in-
 stances of police abuse.
 A well-developed industrial economy provides citizens with a high standard of liv-
 ing.
 The Goveermet gnrally respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse.
 However, instances of police abuse continued, especially involving foreigners. Soci-
 etal violence and harassment directed at foreign residents continued. However,
 crimes against foreign residents decreased by 25 percent in the first half of 1998,
 compared with the first half of 1997. Anti-Semitic incidents decreased by 15 percent
 during the same period. The Government is taking serious steps to address the
 
 
 1274
 problem of violence against women and children. Women continue to face some wage
 scrimination in the private sector, as do members of minorities and foreigners.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government officials.
 The trial of Yasser Mohammed Shraydi, All Chanaa (alias Alba) and his former
 wife, Verena Helga Chanaa (a German national), and his wife's sister, Andrea
 Haeusler (also a German), in the case of the April 1986 bombing of the Berlin dis-
 cotheque La Belle, which began in 1997, continues and is not expected to reach a
 verdict for at least 2 years. The attack killed 1 Turkish citizen and 2 U.S. citizens
 and injured 230 persons.
 Four former high-ranking officials of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) re-
 ceived up to 2-yeai- suspended sentences in July for fatal shootings that occurred
 on the GDR-FRG borders. The Berlin State Court found the former German Social-
 ist Unity Party politician Wolfgang Herger, Deputy Defense Minister Hoerst
 Bruenner, and two other former military officers guilty of complicity in the murders.
 The judge in the case ruled that the four were jointly responsible for the GDR "basic
 orders for the protection of the border" and thereby also responsible for the deaths
 of two persons fleeing the GDR.
 Alfons Gotzfried, an  ethnic' German   who immigrated to    Germany from
 Kazahkstan in 1991, was accused of being an accessory in the murder of 70,000 per-
 sons, mostly Jews, at the Majdanek Concentration Camp during World War II.
 Gotzfried admitted after the war that he took part in the mass shooting of 500 Jews
 at the camp. Although he was convicted for National Socialist crimes and served 25
 years at hard labor in the Soviet Union, he faces a trial and possible reimprison-
 ment in Germany since he was not convicted in a German court and since there
 was no treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union cov-
 ering such crimes.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and the authorities generally respect these prohi-
 bitions; however, there continue to be instances of excessive use of force by the po-
 lice, especially against foreigners. Amnesty International published a report in July
 that found that police treatment of foreigners in custody showed "a clear pattern
 of abuse."
 The Government prosecutes police who mistreat persons in custody. For example,
 in May a Frankfurt (Oder) Brandenburg court sentenced 3 police officers from the
 Bernau to 10 to 24 months' suspended sentences for mistreating Vietnamese detain-
 ees in 11 cases between the summer of 1993 and the summer of 1994. The Vietnam-
 ese were arrested for selling cigarettes and physically mistreated while in custody.
 In addition, the three police officers were suspended from duty in 1994 after initial
 charges were filed and subsequently were banned from any future work as police
 officers. A fourth officer had to pay a fine of $3,330 (DM 5,400) for failing to stop
 the mistreatment of the detainees. The Attorney General's office appealed the sen-
 tence as too light and called for jail terms of 6 months to 4 years. The case was
 pending at year's end.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human-rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Basic Law prohibits arbitrary arrest,
 detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition. A person can be
 arrested only on the basis of an arrest warrant issued by a competent judicial au-
 thority, unless the person is caught in the act of committing a crime, or the police
 have strong reason to believe the person intends to commit a crime. Any person de-
 tained by police must be brought before a judge and charged by the day after the
 arrest. The court must then issue an arrest warrant stating the grounds for deten-
 tion or order the person's release. Police often detain known or suspected right and
 leftwing radicals for brief periods when the police believe such individuals intend
 to participate in illegal or unauthorized demonstrations. For example, in August po-
 lice detained about 25 persons suspected of heading for illegal rallies to mark the
 11th anniversary of the death of Rudolf Hess (see Section 5). The rules governing
 this type of detention are different in each state, with authorized periods of deten-
 tion ranging from 1 to 14 days, provided judicial concurrence is given within 24
 hours of initial apprehension.
 If there is evidence that a suspect might flee the country, police may detain that
 person for up to 24 hours pending a formal charge. The right of free access to legal
 
 
 1275
 counsel has been restricted only in the cases of terrorists suspected of having used
 contacts with lawyers to continue terrorist activity while in prison. Only judges may
 decide on the validity of any deprivation of liberty. Bail exists but is seldom em-
 ployed; the usual practice is to release detainees unless there is clear danger of
 hi ght outside the country.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Basic Law provides for an independent judici-
 ary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 The court system is highly developed and provides full legal protection and nu-
 merous possibilities for judicial review. Ordinary courts have jurisdiction in criminal
 and civil matters. There are four levels of such courts (local courts, regional courts,
 higher regional courts, and the Federal Court of Justice), with appeals possible from
 lower to higher levels. In addition, there are four types of specialized courts: Admin-
 istrative, labor, social, and fiscal. These courts also exist on different levels, with
 the possibility for appeal to the next higher level.
 Separate from these five branches of jurisdiction is the Federal Constitutional
 Court, which is not only the country's supreme court but an organ of the Constitu-
 tion with special functions defined in the Basic Law. Among other things, it reviews
 laws to ensure their compatibility with the Constitution and adjudicates disputes
 between constitutional organs on questions of competencies. It also has jurisdiction
 to hear and decide claims based on the infringement of a person's basic constitu-
 tional rights by a public authority.
 The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process, although
 court proceedings are sometimes delayed due to ever increasing caseloads.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Basic Law prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these
 prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 In July the authorities supported the decision of the Stuttgart school district not
 to hire a Muslim woman for a teaching position in a public school because she wore
 a traditional headscarf (see Section 2.c.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including.
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Basic Law provides for freedom of the
 press, and the Government respects this right in practice. An independent press, an
 effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure
 freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom. Propaganda of Nazi
 and other proscribed organizations, as well as statements endorsing nazism, are ilMe-
 gal.
 The authorities seek to block what they consider dangerous material on the Inter-
 net. A recent law bans access to prohibited material (for example, child pornography
 and Nazi propaganda). The law's implications regarding the possible liability of
 Internet service providers who do not filter prohibited material are not yet clear.
 In May a Munich court sentenced the former head of Compuserve's German oper-
 ations to 2 years' probation and fined him $60,000 (DM 100,000) for distributing
 pornographic materials on the Internet. Despite expert testimony during the trial
 that it was not feasible technically to screen Internet material, the judge ruled that
 Compuserve should have deleted material known to be offensive. The verdict was
 handed down despite the fact that the prosecutors who originally filed the charges
 later reversed themselves and argued for acquittal. The case was being appealed at
 year's end.
 In a public appearance in Munich late in  1997, French politician Jean-Marie
 LePen reportedly referred to the gas chambers as a detail in history. The Munich
 public prosecutor's office undertook an investigation, the results of which were pend-
 ing at year's end, on a possible charge of inciting hatred-a criminal offense. LePen
 reportedly submitted a statement to prosecutors regarding this event.
 .Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.The law provides for freedom
 of assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 A number of antinuclear demonstrators who staged an illegal sit-down blockade
 of the Castr nuclear transport train suffered hypothermia when police ended their
 11-hour action with water cannons. In another incident regarding the same trans-
 port, police and demonstrators were injured when 3,000 leftwing anarchists at-
 tackedpolice with stones, Molotov cocktails, and tracer bullets.
 Authorities prevented several several neo-Fascist marches and demonstrations,
 and arrested a number of participants (see Section 5).
 A number of clashes took place between leftwing and rightwing groups. For exam-
 ple, in May leftwing groups and anarchists protesting a rightwing demonstration
 fought with police (see Section 5).
 
 
 1276
 The law provides for freedom of association, and the Government respects this
 right in practice. The Basic Law permits the banning of organizations whose activi-
 ties are found to be illegal or opposed to the liberal democratic order as established
 by the Basic Law. A 1950's ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court outlawed a
 neo-Nazi and a Communist party. A number of other organizations that authorities
 generally classify as rightwing or leftwing, foreign extremist, or criminal, are
 banned. State governments may-outlaw only organizations that are active solely
 within their state, with activities crossing state boundaries coming under federal ju-
 risdiction. In February the state of Lower Saxony banned two organizations, Heide-
 Heim and Heindenheim, as rightwing organizations. In April the state of Bremen
 banned the Kurdish-German Solidarity Association as a foreign extremist organiza-
 tion. In August the Federal Government banned the Turkish Revolutionary People's
 Liberation Party/Front and the Turkish People's Liberation Party/Front-Revolution-
 ary Left as leftwing organizations, and the state of Hesse banned and dissolved the
 "International Citizen's House of Frankfurt/Main," for activities related to the the
 banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). In addition, several hundred organizations
 were under observation by the federal and state Offices for the Protection of the
 Constitution (OPC). The OPC's are charged with examining possible threats to the
 democratic system; they have no law enforcement powers, and OPC monitoring by
 law may not interfere with the organizations' continued activities.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Basic Law (Constitution) provides for religious free-
 dom, and the Government respects this right in practice. Most religious organiza-
 tions are treated as nonprofit associations and therefore enjoy tax-exempt status. In
 order to obtain this status, state-level authorities must find that the organization
 operates on a nonprofit basis and contributes socially, spiritually, or materially to
 society.
 Church and state are separate, although historically a special partnership exists
 between the state and those religious communities that have the status of a "cor-
 poration under public law." If they fulfill certain requirements, including an assur-
 ance of permanency and an indispensable loyalty to the state, organizations may re-
 quest that they be granted "public law corporation" status, which, among other
 things, entitles them to levy taxes on their members that are collected by the state
 for the church. The decision to grant "public law corporation" status is made at the
 state level. State governments also subsidize various institutions affiliated with
 such public law corporations, such as schools and hospitals. Most visible among the
 denominations and religions that were granted this status are the Lutheran and
 Catholic churches and Judaism. Many others also have been granted such status,
 including the Mormons, Seventh Day Adventists, Mennonites, Baptists, Methodist,
 Christian Scientists, and the Salvation-Army.
 The- right to provide religious chaplaincies in -the military, in hospitals, and in
 prisons is not dependent on the public law corporation status of a religious commu-
 nity. The Ministry of defense is currently looking into the possibilities for Islamic
 clergymen to provide religious services in the military, although none of the many
 Islamic communities has the status of a corporation under public law. The right to
 provide religious instruction at public schools also is no longer confined to religious
 communities with public law corporation status. In November the Berlin Higher Re-
 gional Court ruled that the Islamic Federation had to be given the opportunity to
 provide religious instruction in the Berlin public schools even though it was not a
 corporation under public law. The decision drew criticism from the many Islamic or-
 ganizations that the Islamic Federation does not represent.
 Jehovah's Witnesses are appealing to the Constitutional Court a July 1997 deci-
 sion of the Berlin state government that had denied the church public law corpora-
 tion status. Later in 1997 the Federal Administrative Court in Berlin upheld the
 Berlin state government's decision. The Court concluded that the church did not
 offer the "indispensable loyalty" towards the democratic state "essential for lasting
 cooperation" because, for example, it forbade its members from participating in pub-
 lic elections. The church does enjoy the basic tax-exempt status afforded to most re-
 ligious organizations.
 According to the Christian Community in Cologne (CCK), no incidents of harass-
 ment, discrimination, or death threats have been directed at CCK members since
 1992, with the exceptiori of occasional letters from a particular individual, whom
 they describe as harmless. CCK representatives claimed that the church's current
 tax difficulties were due to harassment by local tax authorities. However, they ad-
 mitted that the church's tax problems were based on errors made by the church,
 although they questioned the motivation of the authorities for scrutinizing the
 church's application for extension of tax-exempt status (which must be renewed
 every few years, depending on state law). The fact that the church apparently vio-
 
 
 1277
 lated tax law, and the authorities' voluntary reduction of the church's tax liability,
 raise questions about the merit of the CCK's allegations of harassment.
 In July the Baden-Wuerttemberg minister of education supported the decision of
 the Stuttgart school district not to hire a Muslim woman for a teaching position in
 a public school because she wore a traditional headscarf. The minister took the posi-
 tion that the scarf was a political symbol of female submission rather than a reli-
 gious practice prescribed by Islam. The Minster permitted the woman to conduct the
 practice teaching required for her degree, but argued that allowing a state employee
 to wear a headscarf on the job would violate the religious and political neutrality
 legally required of all civil servants. The woman concerned announced her intention
 to appeal the decision in the court system. While the minister held that the political
 act of donning a headscarf was unacceptable for a teacher as a role model, thou-
 sands of Muslim students are free to wear the headscarf in school.
 In April in the Frankfurt suburb of Oberursel 100 Turkish families from a mod-
 erate Islamic group made inquiries about converting a building into a mosque. Local
 officials rebuffed the suggestion, and the mayor commented to the press that no
 mosque would be built in Oberursel until a Christian church is permitted in Mecca.
 The refusal polarized the local Islamic community, and the Hesse Protestant
 Church's Ombudsman for foreigners is mediating the dispute. Turkish groups in
 Stuttgart also failed to get permission to build a mosque or to convert an existing
 building into one.
 The Church of Scientology remained under scrutiny by both federal and state offi-
 cials who contend that it is not a religion but an economic enterprise. Authorities
 sometimes sought to deregister Scientology organizations previously registered as
 nonprofit associations and require them to register as commercial enterprises. In
 1997 the Federal Administrative Court in Berlin, in sending an appeal concerning
 the deregistration of a Scientology organization in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg
 back to a lower level for further review, declared that a registered nonprofit associa-
 tion, religious or otherwise, could engage in entrepreneurial activities as long as
 these were only supplementary and collateral to its nonprofit goals. The case contin-
 ued in the lower court at year's end.
 Some government officials allege that Scientology's goals and methods are anti-
 democratic and call for further restrictions on Scientology-affiliated organizations
 and individuals. In 1997 authorities of the federal and state OPC's placed Scien-
 tology under observation for a year because of concerns raised by some offices that
 there were indications that Scientology may pose a threat to democracy. Under the
 observation decision, OPC officials seek to collect information mostly from written
 materials and firsthand accounts to assess whether a "threat" exists. More intrusive
 methods would be subject to legal checks and would require evidence of involvement
 in treasonous or terrorist activity. Federal OPC authorities stated that no requests
 had been made to employ more intrusive methods, nor were any such requests envi-
 sioned. In November federal and state OPC's agreed to continue the observation of
 Scientology, subject to another review in 1999. The decision was based on an OPC
 report that concluded that although there was no imminent danger for the political
 system or the economy of being infiltrated by Scientology, there were nevertheless
 indications of tendencies within Scientology, supported by its ideology and pro-
 grammatic goals, which could be seen as directed against Germany's free and demo-
 cratic order. One state, Schleswig-Holstein, did not agree to implement such obser-
 vation, on the grounds that the situation did not appear to justify such measures.
 Scientology filed a suit in Berlin to enjoin the Berlin Interior Ministry from the al-
 leged practice of bribing members of Scientology to "spy" on other members. The
 case continued at year's end.
 In April officials in Baden-Wuerttemberg posted bail and apologized to Swiss au-
 thorities when  one of their police investigators gathering information   on
 Scientology's activities in Baden-Wuerttemberg was arrested by Swiss police after
 interviewing a contact in Basel. The investigator was charged with espionage and
 violating Swiss neutrality.
 Most major political parties continued to exclude Scientologists from membership,
 arguing that Scientology is not a religion but a for-profit organization whose goals
 and principles are antidemocratic and thus incompatible with those of the political
 parties. However, there has been only one known instance of enforcement of this
 ban. In a 1997 ruling a Bonn state court upheld the expulsion of three Scientologists
 from a state-level organization of the Christian Democratic Union party, ruling that
 a political party had the right to exclude from its organization those persons who
 do not identify themselves with the party's basic goals.
 In June the commission established in 1996 to investigate "so-called sects and
 psycho-groups," including Scientology, presented its final report to Parliament. The
 report concluded that these groups did not pose a threat to society and state and
 
 
 1278
 
 underlined the constitutional principle of religious freedom and the state's obligation
 to observe strict neutrality in these matters. However, it called upon the Govern-
 ment to introduce legislation for consumer protection in the "psycho-market" and
 highlighted the need for the Government to inform the public about dangers to
 health and property posed by psycho-cults and groups. Particular emphasis was
 placed on Scientology because it allegedly pursued policies of "misinformation and
 intimidation" of its critics, according to the report. The report did not classify Scien-
 tology as a religion, but as a profit-oriented psycho-group with totalitarian internal
 structures and undemocratic goals. The commission contended that there were con-
 crete indications that Scientlogy was a political extremist organization, in German;
 a "combine with totalitarian tendencies." The commission also recommended to Par-
 liament that observation of Scientology continue. The report also recommended that
 because of its derogatory connotation the term  'sect" should be avoided, and that
 instead the designation "new, religious and ideological communities and psycho-
 groups" be used. The report referred to psycho-groups as "commercial cults" that of-
 fered their services in a fast-growing psycho-market.
 The interministerial group of mid-level federal and state officials that exchanges
 information on Scientology-related issues continued its periodic meetings. The group
 published no report or policy compendium during the year and remains purely con-
 sultative in purpose.
 On June 4, Bavarian interior minister Geunther Beckstein released two new bro-
 chures warning against the Church of --Scientolofy. "The Scientoloy System" and
 "Scientology: An Anti-Constitutional Movement' warned about alleged hard-sell
 methods by the church and asserted that Scientology was striving for world power.
 Beckstein -asserted that the Church was even ordering the commission of criminal
 acts and compared its psychological methods to those of the former East German
 secret police. He added that due to government measures, membership in Germany
 had dropped to an estimated 10,000 persons.
 Scientologists continued to report discrimination, alleging both government-con-
 doned and societal harassment -because of their church affiliation. "Sect-filters,"
 statements by individuals that they are not affiliated with Scientology, are used by
 some businesses and other organizations to discriminate against Scientologists in
 business and social dealings. Scientologists assert that business firms whose owners
 or executives are Scientologists, as ,well as artists who are church -members, faced
 boycotts and discrimination, sometimes with state and local government approval.
 Other church members reported employment difficulties, and, in the state of Ba-
 varia, applicants for state civil service positions are screened for Scientology mem-
 bership. However, according to Bavarian and federal officials, no one in Bavaria lost
 a job, was denied employment, or suffered any infringement of rights by public offi-
 cials or entities solely because of association with Scientology. Bavarian officials also
 contended that a Scientologist was teaching in a Munich public school and that an-
 other Scientologist was a member of the Bavarian Ministry of Culture. Several
 states have published pamphlets warning of alleged dangers posed by Scientology.
 In June foreign professional tennis player Arnaud Boetsch's contract with the
 Ruppuer Tennis Club, to represent the club in the German Championships League,
 was canceled when the club learned that he was a Scientologist.
 A United Nations report in April agreed that individuals were discriminated
 against because of their affiliation  with -Scientology. However, it rejected
 Scientology's comparison of the treatment of its members with that of Jews during
 the Nazi era.
 In August officials in Frankfurt defended their decision to allow about 6,000
 Scientology members and supporters to hold a demonstration in the city's Opera
 Square. Responding to criticism for issuing the demonstration permit, the officials
 defended Scientology's freedom of assembly.
 Scientologists continued to take grievances to the,courts. Legal rulings have been
 mixed. Some individuals who had been fired because they are Scientologists took
 their employers to court for "unfair dismissal." Several have reached out of court
 settlements with employers.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to move anywhere within the country, to travel
 abroad, to emigrate, and to repatriate, without restrictions that violate human
 rights.
 For ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the Basic
 Law provides both for citizenship immediately upon application and for legal resi-
 dence without restrictions. Other persons may acquire citizenship (and with it the
 right of unrestricted residence) if they meet certain requirements, including legal
 residence-for at least 10 years ,(5 if married to a German), renunciation of all other
 citizenships, and a basic command of the language. Long-term legal residents often
 
 
 1279
 
 opt not to apply; they receive the same social benefits as do citizens, and after 10
 years of lega residency they are entitled to permanent residence.
 The Basic Law and subsequent legislation provide for the right of foreign victims
 of political persecution to attain asylum and resettlement. The Government cooper-
 ates with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 Asylum applications dropped to their lowest level since the amendment of the asy-
 lum law in 1993, when the criteria for granting asylum were tightened. In 1998 the
 Government received 98,644 applications for asylum, down 9.5 percent from 104,353
 in 1997. The acceptance rate was 4.0 percent for the 147,391 asylum cases reviewed
 during the year.
 Persons coming directly from any country that officials designate as a "safe coun-
 try of origin" cannot normally claim political asylum but may request an adminis-
 trative review of their applications while in Germany. Persons entering via a "safe
 third country"-any country in the European Union or adhering to the Geneva Con-
 vention-are also ineligible for asylum.
 The law limits legal recourse against denials of asylum applications. Critics argue
 that few countries can assuredly be designated as "safe third countries" and that
 the law unjustly fails to allow applicants to rebut such designations. While the law
 permits appeals against designations of "safe countries of origin," critics protest that
 the 48-hour period allotted for hearings is too brief. However, the Constitutional
 Court upheld the constitutionality of the amendments in 1996.
 In 1997 for the first time in mor hana    e        reigners left the country
 than arrived, partially due to the departure of Bosnian refugees: 615,000 arrivals
 compared to 637,000 departures. Due to the recent decline in asylum seekers, the
 welfare office in Stuttgart closed 32 of 150 asylum facilities and over 1,000 beds.
 Stuttgart had only one-fifth as many asylum applicants as in 1994.
 During the year, state authorities continued the "second phase" of Bosnian refu-
 ee repatriations, whereby al remaining refugees were to return to Bosnia unless
 ey qualified for an extension of stay on certain humanitarian grounds. A number
 of prominent national officials, as well as the UNHCR, cautioned that the refugees'
 place of origin and ethnicity should be given careful consideration in the implemen-
 tation of returns. During the year, certain states (Bavaria) resumed the deportation
 of refugees from the "Republika Srpska" region of Bosnia on the grounds that condi-
 tions there had improved. Since 1992 approximately 320,000 Bosnian refugees lived
 in Germany under temporary protection, and another 25,000 applied for asylum.
 The Government provided first asylum and has granted "temporary protection" (first
 asylum) to these Bosnian refugees. Government support for these refugees costs an
 estimated $2.8 billion annually (DM 4.9 billion). Between January and the end of
 July, an estimated 75,000 refugees returned to Bosnia voluntarily (compared to
 100,000 for all of 1997), roughly 10,000 emigrated to other countries, and approxi-
 mately 1,200 more were deported by state authorities (compared with 900 for all of
 1997). Of those who were deported, less than half were convicted criminals; the ma-
 jority were persons whose asylum applications were denied. Approximately 210,000
 Bosnian refugees left the country since late 1996. However, even those refugees who
 left the country "voluntarily" were subjected to tremendous pressure. If they did not
 leave on their own they could have been deported and then permanently excluded
 from reentering the country. Once their residence permits expire, foreigners are lia-
 ble to arrest and incarceration for up to 6 weeks pending a final decision regarding
 deportation. The overwhelming majority of Bosnians legally residing in the country
 have limited residence permits with no enforceable right to have these permits ex-
 tended. The Federal Government pays Bosnian refugees who choose to leave the
 country between $765 and $2,550 (DM 1,350 and DM 4,500).
 In the first half of the year, some states resumed deportations of Kosovar Alba-
 nians to Serbia-Montenegro, in spite of the UNHCR's request that deportations to
 the region be suspended due to security threats for deportees. In May a Saarland
 administrative court set aside deportation orders in two cases on the grounds of the
 race-based persecution Kosovar Albanians would face in Serbia. According to law
 enforcement officials, Kosovo Albanians control the drug trade. According to the di-
 rector of asylum and alien affairs for the Bavarian Interior Ministry, up to 50 per-
 cent of Kosovar Albanians in the country are serious criminals who are eligible for
 deportation regardless of the conditions in Serbia. However, by year's end most
 states lacked the practical means for return.
 On May 12, Mehmet Ali Akbas, a Kurd who was deported to Turkey in January
 after his request for political asylum was rejected by Hannover's civil court, was
 brought back to Germany. According the Refugee Council of Lower Saxony, a non-
 governmental organization, Turkish authorities questioned, detained, and tortured
 Akbas for 8 days following his arrival in Istanbul. After unsuccessfully trying to ac-
 
 
 1280
 
 quire an official visa to travel to Germany, Akbas fled to Greece and from there re-
 turned to Germany. German authorities approved Akbas' return after a doctor cer-
 tified for the German Embassy in Ankara that Turkish police tortured Akbas.
 A Munich administrative court ruled on October 20 that a 14-year-old Turkish ju-
 venile delinquent named Muhlis A. (also known as Mehmet) could be deported.
 Mehmet was convicted and sentenced to to 1 year in custody for robbery and griev-
 ous bodily harm-the latest in a string of crimes. The court ruled that the Munich
 foreign affairs office was correct in its judgment that the over 60 offenses that
 Mehmet committed before his 14th birthday were ample evidence that he was a
 threat to society. The court also upheld that although a juvenile (he was born in
 Munich), he could be deported without his parents. The Munich city manager stated
 that Turkish attendants would receive Mehmet upon his arrival and that he could
 live either with an uncle or in a foster home. He was deported on November 14.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Basic Law provides citizens with the right to change their government peace-
 fully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elec-
 tions. The governmentis elected on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot-
 ing. Members of the Parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, are elected from a
 mixture of direct-constituency and party-list candidates. The upper house, the Bun-
 desrat, is composed of delegations from state governments.
 The law entitles women to participate fully in political life, and a growing number
 are prominent in the Government and the parties. Slightly over 31 percent of the
 Federal Parliament is female. Women occupy 5 of 15 Federal Cabinet positions. One
 state minister-president is a woman. On the Federal Constitutional Court, 6 of the
 16 judges are women, including the Chief Justice. All of the parties have under-
 taken to enlist more women. The Greens/Alliance 90 Party requires that women con-
 stitute half of the party's elected officials; both party. co-chairpersons are female, as
 are 57.5 percent of the party's federal parliamentary caucus members. The Social
 Democrats have a 40-percent quota for women on all party committees and govern-
 ing bodies. The Christian Democrats require that 30 percent of the first ballot can-
 didates for party positions be women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are very cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits denial of access to housing, health care, or education on the
 basis of race, religion, disability, sex, ethnic background, political opinion, or citizen-
 ship. The Government enforces the law effectively.
 Women.-While violence against women occurs and is almost certainly under-
 reported, it is prohibited by laws that are enforced effectively. Societal attitudes to-
 ward such violence are strongly negative, and legal and medical recourse is avail-
 able. Police statistics on rape, including attempted rape, showed a 6.6 percent in-
 crease to 6,636 cases in 1997 from 6,228 in 1996. Spousal rape, which is illegal, is
 included in these statistics.
 The Government conducted campaigns in the schools and through church groups
 to bring public attention to the existence of such violence and proposed steps to
 counter it. The Federal Government has supported numerous pilot projects through-
 out the country. There are, for example, 387 "women's houses", including 116 in the
 East, where victims of violence and their children can seek shelter, counseling, and
 legal and police protection.
 Trafficking in women and forced prostitution is also forbidden by law. The laws
 against trafficking in women were modified in 1992 to deal more effectively with
 problems stemming from the opening of Germany's eastern borders. In recent years,
 the Federal Ministry for Women and Youth commissioned a number of studies to
 gain information on violence against women, sexual harassment, and other matters,
 producing, for example, a special report on violence against women in 1995. More
 recently, the Ministry's public information poster campaign to combat violence
 against women and discriminatory behavior has been highly visible in schools, offi-
 cial buildings, and public spaces.  -
 Union contracts typically identify categories of employment in which participants
 are to be paid less than 100 percent of the wage of a skilled laborer covered by the
 
 
 1281
 same contract. Women are disproportionately represented in these lower-wage scale
 occupations.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates a strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. Public education is provided and is mandatory through the age of 16.
 The Government recognizes that violence against children is a problem requiring
 its attention. Police figures indicate that there were 16,888 alleged cases of sexual
 abuse of children in 1997, a 7.7 percent increase from 15,674 in 1996. Officials be-
 lieve that the number of unreported cases may be much higher. The Child and
 Youth Protection Law stresses the need for preventive measures, and the Govern-
 ment has taken account of this in stepping up its counseling and other assistance.
 The Criminal Code was amended in 1993 and in December 1997 to further protect
 children against pornography and sexual abuse. For possession of child pornog-
 raphy, the maximum   sentence is 1 year's imprisonment; the sentence for distribu-
 tion is 5 years. The 1993 amendment made the sexual abuse of children by German
 citizens abroad punishable even if the action is not illegal in the child's own country.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against the disabled in em-
 ployment, education, or in the provision of other state services. The law mandates
 several special services for disabled persons, and the government enforces these pro-
 visions in practice. The disabled are entitled to assistance to avert, eliminate, or al-
 leviate the consequences of their disabilities and to secure employment commensu-
 rate with their abilities. The Government offers vocational training and grants for
 employers who hire the disabled. The severely disabled may be granted special ben-
 efits, such as tax breaks, free public transport, special parking facilities, and exemp-
 tion from radio and television fees.
 The Federal Government set guidelines for the attainment of "barrier-free" public
 buildings and for modifications of streets and pedestrian traffic walks to accommo-
 date the disabled. All 16 states have incorporated the federal guidelines into their
 building codes, and 98 percent of federal public buildings follow the guidelines for
 a " barrier-free environment."
 Religious Minorities.-Anti-Semitic acts decreased 14.7 percent, with 436 inci-
 dents reported in the first 6 months of 1998, compared with 511 in the same period
 in 1997. These incidents included, in part, 86 cases of the distribution of anti-Se-
 mitic materials or the display of symbols of banned organizations, 26 cases of dese-
 cration of cemeteries, and 7 cases of bodily injury. In a case that received inter-
 national attention, on December 19 a bomb destroyed the gravestone of Heinz
 Galinski, chairman of the Jewish Community of Berlin until his death in 1992. This
 was the second instance of vandalism at this site during the year. While cases of
 vandalism against Jewish graves have declined nationally, Berlin has witnessed an
 increase of approximately 20 percent in anti-Semitic incidents during the year. The
 overwhelming majority of the perpetrators of anti-Semitic acts were frustrated,
 largely apolitical youths and a smal cre of righ ng eemists.
 Scientologists continued to report instances of societal discrimination (see Section
 2National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The number of antiforeigner crimes de-
 creased by one-fourth in the first 6 months of 1998, compared with the same period
 in 1997. There were a total of 1,164 xenophobic crimes reported in the first 6
 months of 1998, compared with 1,544 such crimes during the same period in 1997.
 Of these, 205 were violent attacks, including 183 cases of attacks on persons and
 11 cases of arson. Among the total number of xenophobic crimes reported were 293
 cases of the distribution of materials or the display of symbols of banned organiza-
 tions. The percentage of such crimes was significantly higher in the eastern states.
 As in previous years, most of these offenses were directed against foreign residents.
 Perpetrators of antiforeigner violence were predominantly young, male, and low
 in socioeconomic status; they often committed such acts spontaneously and while
 inebriated. Some offenders were rightwing extremists, such as neo-Nazis and
 "skinheads. However, many could best be described as rightwing-oriented, having
 loose, if any, practical or ideological ties to extremist groups. Other perpetrators
 were apolitical.
 Some state governments, particularly in eastern Germany, established special
 commissions to deal with incidents of antiforeigner violence. Brandenburg estab-
 lished a "Mobile SWAT Team Against Violence and Antiforiegner Groups* in Feb-
 ruary. The force is made up of several dozen officers under the direction of the
 Brandenburg State Office for Crime Prevention (Landeskriminalamt). The emphasis
 of the unit is crime prevention, and it is deployed in areas of Brandenburg known
 to be gathering places for rightwing extremists. According to Brandenburg's interior
 minister, the number of rightwing incidents declined by 50 percent in the first half
 of the year, compared with the first half of 1997.
 
 
 1282
 In July the Bundestag Defense Committee completed its report on rightwing ex-
 tremism in the military. The report noted one incident during the year of a "Heil
 Hitler" shout.-The report concluded that there was no rightwing tendency and were
 no rightwing structures in the Bundeswher. Some 95 percent of the incidents in-
 volved conscripts who had contact with rightwing circles and thinking prior to their
 military service. The report noted that the percentage of soldiers oriented to right-
 wing extremist ideology mirrors the percentage of the population with similar views.
 The federal and state governments were committed firmly to combating and pre-
 venting rightwing violence and continued to search for more effective law enforce-
 ment measures, as well as measures aimed at the societal-roots of extremist crimes.
 Police in the eastern states continued to move toward reaching standards of effec-
 tiveness characteristic of police in the rest of Germany and demonstrated greater
 coordination in preventing illegal rightwing and neo-Nazi activities.
 In August 100 German neo-Fascists planned to march in Copenhagen on the anni-
 versary of Rudolf Hess' death but were prevented from entering Denmark by
 Schleswig-Holstein's police and border police forces. In Goslar, Lower Saxony, police
 prevented a parade of neo-Fascists from Bremen, Bielefeld, Kiel, and several other
 cities by detaining -19 neo-Fascists who ignored a police order to disperse. Authori-
 - ties brought 18 of the neo-Fascists before a custody judge after Fascist -propaganda
 material was found in their possession. Municipal authorities in Lueneburg, Lower
 Saxony, refused to grant permission for a demonstration of up to 200 neo-Fascists
 who wanted to march through Lueneburg praising, Rudolf Hess. The city justified
 its decision by the late registration and the likelihood of criminal offenses occurring,
 like the display of prohibited Nazi symbols and the disturbance of the peace. There
 continued to be evidence that neo-Nazi groups were making efforts to achieve great-
 er coordination among themselves, particularly through the use of modern commu-
 nication technologies. The Federal OPC reported that 47,000 persons belonged to
 far-right organizations in 1997, an increase from 45,300 in 1996.
 On May 1, approximately 4,000 supporters of the rightwing National Democratic
 Party held a largely peaceful rally in Leipzig. Some 6,100 police officers from 7
 states kept a tight rein on the rally. However, leftwing groups and anarchists fought
 a string of violent battles with the police while trying to reach the rightwing dem-
 onstrators. Some of the 1,200 protesters built barricades, overturned cars, set fires,
 and tore up cobblestones to throw at police officers. The authorities responded with
 verbal warnings, followed by water cannons and baton charges. During the riots, 35
 police officers were injured.
 Rightwing youth repeatedly attacked foreign students attending the 6th European
 Summer Academy in Weimar in the downtown area. A spokesman for Bauhaus Uni-
 versity reported that the harassment continued during the entire 4-week course. In
 one incident paving stones and beer cans were thrown at a teacher from France.
 Isolated attacks targeting- Turkish establishments and individuals occurred. Al-
 though some attacks were linked to rightwing perpetrators, most were attributed to
 intra-Turkish political or private disputes, but none were directly attributable to the
 Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Several trials of PKK members were nevertheless
 under way.
 Resident foreigners and minority groups continued to voice credible concerns
 about societal and job-related discrimination. Unemployment affects foreigners dis-
 proportionately, though this in-part is due to the sometimes inadequate language
 skills or nontransferable professional qualifications of the job seekers. The Federal
 Government and all states have established permanent commissions to assist for-
 eigners in their dealings with government and society.
 In April the rightwing German Peoples' Union (DVU) unexpectedly captured al-
 most 13 percent of the vote in the Saxony-Anhalt state parliamentr elections,
 which triggered a debate about whether eastern Germany is susceptible to extremist
 views. However, it appeared that support for the party came primarily from protest
 voters who were frustrated with the mainstream parties' inability to deal with the
 issues of crime and unemployment. The overwhelming majority (62 percent) of right-
 wing extremists now live in eastern Germany although only one-fifth of the overall
 population resides there. Of the approximately 7,400 violent skinheads in the coun-
 try, 47 percent live in the East.
 In 1997 the Government pledged to protect and foster the languages and cultures
 of the national and ethnic minorities that have lived traditionally in Germany (e.g.,
 Sorbs, Danes, Roma, Sinti, and Frisians). In July the Saxony state government
 passed a law to protect the Sorb minrity, and the Hesse government recognized
 Romani as a minority language.
 Although the Government has recognized the Sinti and Roma each as an official
 "national minority" since 1995, the Federal Interior Ministry and indiidual states
 have thus far resisted including Romani among the languages to be protected and
 
 
 1283
 cultivated under the European Charter on Regional and Minority Languages. Dur-
 ing the year, the Hesse government had indicated its willingness to meet the obliga-
 tions of the Charter to protect Romani, although the other states have not yet fol-
 lowed suit. According to the Chairman of the Central Council of German Sinti and
 Roma, the Sinti/Romani minority is the only of the national minorities recognized
 by the Government that does not have any unique legal protection, political privi-
 lege, or reserved representation in certain public institutions. According to the
 chairman, opinion polls indicated that 60 percent of Germans opposed protected sta-
 tus for Sinti and Roma, and public statements of government officials and the media
 continued to perpetuate prejudice against Sinti and Roma.
 The state of Saxony passed a new law in July to protect the Slavic Sorb minority.
 The law grants Sorb status to the broadest possible spectrum of residents living
 near the Polish border. The law, together with the recently negotiated agreement
 between Saxony and Brandenburg, also ensures the Sorb community a steady flow
 of state financing for educational and cultural activities. The new law and agree-
 ment follow a federal government announcement that it would cut grants to the
 Sorbs from $9.5 to $5 million (DM 16 million to DM 8 million) by 2007.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right to associate freely, choose representatives,
 determine programs and policies to represent workers' interests, and publicize views
 is recognized and freely exercised. Some 31.6 percent of the total eligible labor force
 belongs to unions. The German Trade Union Federation (DGB) represents 83.3 per-
 cent of organized workers.
 The law provides for the right to strike, except for civil servants (including teach-
 ers) and personnel in sensitive positions, such as members of the armed forces. In
 the past, the International Labor Organization (ILO) has criticized the Govern-
 ment's definition of "essential services" as overly broad. The ILO was responding to
 complaints about sanctions imposed on teachers who struck in the state of Hesse
 in 1989 and, earlier, the replacement of striking postal workers by civil servants.
 In neither case did permanent job loss result. The ILO continued to seek clarifica-
 tions from the Government on policies and laws governing the labor rights of civil
 servants.
 In 1997 strikes affected 144 companies. Workers numbering 13,801 participated
 in the strikes, and 56,896 work hours were lost. In February demonstrations were
 held for the labor unions' "unemployed persons initiative" to protest the high unem-
 ployment rate. The demonstrations started with 40,000 to 60,000 persons but soon
 became smaller. Some union elements staged warning strikes as a bargaining tactic
 in March.
 The DGB participates in various international and European trade union organi-
 zations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Basic Law provides for
 the right to organize and bargain collectively, and this right is widely exercised. Due
 to a well-developed system of autonomous contract negotiations, mediation is un-
 common. Basic wages and working conditions are negotiated at the industry level
 and then are adapted, through local collective bargaining, to particular enterprises.
 However, some firms in eastern Germany have refused to join employer associa-
 tions, or have withdrawn from them and then bargained independently with work-
 ers. Likewise, some large firms in western Germany withdrew at least part of their
 work force from the jurisdiction of employer associations, complaining of rigidities
 in the industrywide, multicompany negotiating system. However, they have not re-
 fused to bargain as individual enterprises. The law mandates a system of works
 councils and worker membership on supervisory boards, and thus workers partici-
 pate in the management of the enterprises in which they work. The law thoroughly
 protects workers against antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Basic Law prohibits forced or
 compulsory labor, including forced or bonded child labor, and there were no reports
 that it occurred.
 The Diehl Armaments Factory in Nuernberg announced that it would pay com-
 pensation to Jewish women who were forced to work in two company-owned fac-
 tories in Poland during World War II. The decision followed a controversy in the
 Nuernberg city council over conferring honorary citizenship on Karl Diehl, the 90-
 year-old founder of the family business, despite Diehl's active involvement in the
 Third Reich's armament policies. Bavarian Motor Works (BMW) and other compa-
 nies also declared their readiness to contribute to a national fund to reimburse per-
 sons subjected to forced labor during World War II. A group of survivors earlier had
 threatened to sue Volkswagen. In August lawyers put other major companies on no-
 
 
 1284
 tice that they would face claims for compensation in connection with the use of slave
 labor during World War II.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Federal
 law generally prohibits the employment of children under the age of 15, with a few
 exceptions: those 13 or 14 years of age may do farm work for up to 3 hours per day
 or may deliver newspapers for up to 2 hours per day; those 3 to. 14 years of age
 may take part in cultural performances, albeit under stringent curbs on the kings
 of activity, number of hours, and time of day. The Federal Labor Ministry effectively
 enforces the law through its Factory Inspection Bureau.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated or administratively de-
 termined minimum wage. Wages and salaries are set either by collective bargaining
 agreements between unions and employer federations or by individual contracts.
 Covering about 90 percent of all wage- and salary-earners, these agreements set
 minimum pay rates and are legally enforceable. These minimums provide an ade-
 quate standard of living for workers and their families. The number of hours of
 work per week is, regulated by contracts that directly or indirectly affect 80 percent
 of the working population. The average workweek for industrial workers is 36 hours
 in western Germany and about 39 hours in the eastern states.
 Federal regulations limit the workweek to a maximum of 48 hours. Provisions for
 overtime, holiday, and weekend -pay vary depending upon collective bargaining
 agreements.
 Foreign workers are protected by laiv and generally, receive treatinent equal to
 that of German workers. However, foreigner  who are illegally employed, particu-
 larly in the construction industry in Berlin, are especially susceptible to sub-
 standard wages. Wage discriminatioh also affects legal foreign workers to some ex-
 tent. For example, seasonal workers from Eastern Europe who come to Germany on
 temporary work contracts often receive wages below normal German standards.
 Furthermore, workers from other European Union':cuntries sometimes are em-
 ployed at the same wages that they would receive in their home country, 'even if
 the corresponding German worker would receive a higher wage.
 An extensive set of laws and regulations on occupational safety-and health incor-
 porates a growing body of European Union standards. These provide for the right
 to refuse to perform dangerous or unhealthy work without jeopardizing employment.
 A comprehensive system of worker insurance carriers enforces safety requirements
 in the workplace The Labor Ministry and its counterparts in the states effectively
 enforce occupational safety and health standards through a' network of government
 organs, including the Federal Institute for Work, Safety. At the local level, profes-
 sional and tradeassociations-self-governingpublic corporations with delegates both
 from the employers and from the umons-oversee worker safety.
