 SOUTH AFRICA
 South Africa is a multiracial society whose laws codify the
 doctrine of apartheid, which prescribes the basic rights and
 obligations of people according to their racial or ethnic
 origin. The country's black majority (72 percent of its
 population) continues to suffer from pervasive, legally
 sanctioned discrimination based on race in political, economic,
 and social aspects of life. The "colored" (mixed-race) and
 Asian minorities also suffer from extensive racial
 discrimination, although to a somewhat lesser degree than
 South Africa's black population. Currently, the political
 rights of the black majority are confined to participation in
 tightly controlled urban councils in the country's black
 residential areas ("townships") and through the 10 government-
 designated tribal areas known as "homelands." Blacks have
 been excluded from even the limited political changes that
 have been made under South Africa's new Constitution,
 implemented in 1984, which features a racially based
 tricameral Parliament with a dominant white House of Assembly,
 a colored House of Representatives, and an Asian House of
 Delegates. The respective groups are represented in
 Parliament on a racial ratio of 4/2/1--white/colored/Asian.
 Blacks do not have the right to vote in national elections and
 have no representation in Parliament.
 In 1986 there was a major deterioration of human rights in
 South Africa. Throughout the year, political discontent and
 violence persisted in the nation's black and colored townships.
 Following the July 1985-March 1986 State of Emergency, the
 Government imposed a new State of Emergency on June 12, 1986,
 which remained in effect at the end of the year. Under both
 States of Emergency, police and military exercised
 extraordinary arrest and detention powers. Furthermore,
 legislative amendments passed in 1986 gave the executive branch
 broad emergency powers without the need for a declaration of a
 State of Emergency.
 The South African Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR) reported
 Ohat 1,263 people had died as the result of political unrest
 from January to November. Most of the deaths occurred in the
 first half of the year, prior to the imposition of the second
 State of Emergency. By the end of 1986, human rights groups
 estimated more than 20,000 people had been detained under this
 second State of Emergency. An estimated 10,000 remained in
 detention at the end of the year. The Black Sash, an
 antiapartheid organization, estimated up to 1,800 of those
 detainees were under the age of 18, including many children
 15 years of age or younger. Leaders of the opposition United
 Democratic Front (UDF), a coalition of more than 600
 antiapartheid groups, and various black trade unions were
 special targets for detention under the latest State of
 Emergency. Throughout the State of Emergency, there were
 widespread reports of continuing officially sanctioned acts of
 violence against dissidents, despite the State President's
 public call in June for good behavior by security forces.
 The banned African National Congress (ANC), most of whose
 leadership is in exile, imprisoned, or operating underground
 within South Africa, proclaimed 1986 as a year of intensified
 armed struggle against the apartheid system. In 1986 the ANC
 claimed responsibility for a number of acts of urban terrorism
 and landmine explosions in rural areas, although it often
 equivocated on its responsibility for incidents which involved
 civilian deaths. The ANC also called on blacks to overthrow
 the apartheid regime by concerted acts of violence, notably
 
 
 275
 SOUTH AFRICA
 against black police and township officials, to make the
 townships ungovernable. ANC leader Nelson Mandela, imprisoned
 after being convicted for sabotage in 1964, continued to serve
 a life sentence, despite repeated domestic and international
 calls for his release. In 1986 the Government reiterated its
 earlier position that it would release Mandela only if he
 renounced violence.
 Other opponents of apartheid, such as young black activists in
 the townships, also advocated and engaged in violent attacks
 on black township officials and others suspected of
 "collaborating" with the Government. Many blacks were
 attacked by activists attempting to enforce protest activities
 such as school or consumer boycotts.
 The Government imposed progressively harsher curbs on the
 media throughout the year to prevent the reporting of political
 unrest and antigovernment activities. In December the
 Government tightened existing emergency regulations to prohibit
 reporting on a variety of politically related topics without
 clearance by state censors.
 In the first half of 1986, Parliament enacted some changes in
 the apartheid system. These changes included abolition of
 influx control or "pass" laws, which for years extensively
 regulated the right of South African blacks to be present in
 urban areas. Parliament passed legislation permitting some
 blacks to regain the South African citizenship they had lost
 involuntarily in previous years when some homelands were given
 "independence." The Government also introduced a freehold
 system of land ownership for blacks, permitting them to own
 residences in urban areas designated for blacks under the
 Group Areas Act. Notwithstanding the reforms, race still
 remains the fundamental basis for the organization of South
 African society. Discriminatory laws and practices remain
 woven throughout the fabric of South African life.
 In November the Indaba--a constitutional convention of leaders
 of all races from the province of Natal and the homeland of
 KwaZulu--issued a far-reaching proposal for a new unified
 governmental structure for Natal/KwaZulu. The proposal
 included a bill of rights with firm constitutional guarantees
 of individual liberties and a universal franchise. The
 Government had not commented on the proposal by the end of the
 year, but the Indaba leaders planned to present it formally to
 the Government for approval and hold a referendum among the
 people of Natal and KwaZulu.
 A serious economic downturn since 1984 has been a significant
 factor in generating political unrest. Some economic
 indicators in mid-1986 pointed to a modest improvement in the
 country's growth rate. The Government has estimated that an
 annual real growth rate of 5 to 6 percent is necessary for the
 economy to absorb the approximately 250,000 black entrants to
 the labor market each year. An even higher rate of growth
 would be necessary to reduce present black unemployment, which
 private observers estimate at 25 percent or more.
 In May the South African Defense Force (SADF) launched
 simultaneous air raids on alleged ANC training camps in
 Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. In addition, attacks were
 made against Lesotho and Swaziland which were widely believed
 to have been launched by South African commandos. Several
 people, including refugees under the protection of the United
 
 
 276
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), were killed or
 injured in these raids.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political violence in South Africa continued in 1986. The
 SAIRR reported 1,263 unrest-related deaths from January to
 November, an increase over the 1985 total of 879 deaths. Most
 of the deaths occurred in the first half of 1986. There was a
 marked decrease in the number of unrest-related deaths
 following the imposition of the State of Emergency. In
 December the SAIRR said that conflict within the black
 community accounted for 45 percent of all political fatalities
 in 1986; deaths at the hands of security forces, 33 percent;
 deaths in unclear political circumstances, 12 percent;
 insurgency-related deaths and casualties among security
 forces, 10 percent.
 Police often quelled demonstrations with excessive force,
 utilizing tear gas, birdshot, whips, and rubber bullets, and,
 at times, live ammunition. On March 26 police in
 Bophuthatswana (one of four so-called "independent" homelands)
 opened fire on a group of several thousand demonstrators in
 Winterveldt, near Pretoria, killing at least 11 people.
 While many unrest-related deaths occurred as a result of
 police action, a sizable number of killings resulted from
 internecine political strife within the black community. In
 August the Government Bureau of Information said that there
 were more than 300 deaths by burning alone as a result of
 "black-on-black" violence from January through mid-June of
 1986. Many of these deaths involved the notorious "necklace,"
 in which a gasoline-soaked automobile tire is placed around
 the victim's neck and then lighted. In April authorities in
 the Lebowa homeland found the remains of more than 30 victims
 of suspected black-on-black violence in shallow graves in
 Sekhukuneland. It was not clear whether these killings were
 politically motivated. As of the end of 1986, they were still
 unsolved. Many were killed in clashes between supporters of
 different political factions, such as Inkatha, the Azanian
 Peoples' Organization (AZAPO), and the UDF.
 Some critics of the Government have claimed that much
 black-on-black violence was instigated by covert government
 agents. In some instances, most notably in fighting in May
 and June in the "Crossroads" squatter camps in Cape Town,
 there was ample evidence to support this charge. Early in the
 year, residents of the black township of Alexandra (near
 Johannesburg) furnished affidavits in which they said that
 known police officers had participated in fire bomb incidents
 in the township. The Government supports vigilante groups
 that ostensibly ensure neighborhood safety, and, in some cases
 of'unrest, the police have stood aside to let armed vigilante
 groups subdue dissidents. In the KwaNdebele homeland, a late
 member of the leadership allegedly led gangs who attacked
 groups opposed to the acceptance of independence for that
 homeland. In January there were reports that police observed
 a violent incident in which UDF leader Ampie Mayisa was
 murdered in the Transvaal township of Leandra but did nothing
 to prevent it. On December 1, unidentified gunmen in the
 
 
 277
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Pretoria township of Mamelodi assassinated Dr. Fabian Ribeiro
 and his wife. Both were known for their opposition to the
 Government. Circumstantial evidence pointed to the possible
 involvement of elements of the government security
 establishment in these killings, which remained unsolved at
 the end of 1986.
 As in prior years, 1986 saw a continuation of the serious
 problem of suspicious deaths while in police custody. In
 April Lucky Kutumela, a journalist and member of the AZAPO,
 died in police custody of head injuries only hours after being
 taken into detention. Also in April, Peter Nchabaleng, a
 Transvaal provincial official of the UDF, died in the custody
 of the Lebowa homeland police. Authorities claimed he
 suffered a sudden heart attack, but family members said that
 Nchabaleng, 59, was in good health at the time of his arrest
 and had no history of heart difficulties. As of the end of
 1986, the Government had not undertaken prosecutions in either
 of these cases. Several other deaths of detainees occurred
 during 1986, although not all involved political figures.
 Simon Marule, a 20-year-old detainee, died while in custody in
 December of what police described as an epileptic seizure, but
 his family claimed that he had no history of epilepsy. Some
 of the deaths of detainees were reported suicides. South
 African human rights groups have pointed out that, of 89 known
 deaths in detention since 1963, at least 29 have been
 attributed to suicide.
 The ANC, a revolutionary organization that openly advocates
 the overthrow of the apartheid regime, encouraged violent
 activity throughout the year but often equivocated or was
 silent on the question of responsibility for individual
 terrorist incidents. Following a car bomb blast in Durban in
 mid-June that killed three, the ANC declined comment on what,
 if any, responsibility it had for the incident. It equivocated
 with regard to a number of other urban terrorist incidents and,
 with regard to still others, denied involvement. As in
 previous years, in 1986 the ANC primarily targeted offices and
 installations involved with the administration of apartheid
 (so-called "hard" targets), although it did hit some civilian
 or "soft" targets.
 In 1986 the ANC continued with its 1985 strategy of blurring
 the distinction between hard and soft targets. While ANC
 rhetoric from overseas broadcasts urged a spread of violence
 to white areas, officials of the organization disavowed a
 strategy of deliberately hitting civilian targets, but said
 that the involvement of civilians as "crossfire" victims was
 inevitable. In August the ANC acknowledged responsibility for
 a landmine attack in the eastern Transvaal. The ANC takes the
 position that white farmers in northern border areas of South
 Africa constitute part of the Government's security
 establishment. In April a court in Durban convicted Andrew
 Zondo, an admitted ANC supporter, of five counts of murder in
 connection with a December 1985 shopping center bomb blast in
 Amanzimtoti, near Durban. Zondo received the death sentence.
 After exhausting judicial appeals, he was executed in
 September.
 Many casualties in black township political violence were due
 to attacks by radical blacks on township government officials,
 black policemen, and other suspected "collaborators." These
 attacks were probably at least partly inspired by the ANC,
 which has called on blacks to render the townships ungovernable
 and to attack so-called collaborators in the black community.
 
 
 278
 SOUTH AFRICA
 The Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), another antiapartheid
 organization in exile, also advocated violent opposition to
 the South African Government. In addition, many blacks in
 South Africa espoused or condoned violent opposition to
 apartheid. In April Winnie Mandela, wife of jailed ANC leader
 Nelson Mandela, said in a speech: "With our boxes of matches
 and our necklaces, we shall liberate this country." Many
 young black activists in the townships (so-called "comrades")
 were responsible for numerous acts of violence and
 intimidation. In several instances, they killed or seriously
 injured blacks who they believed were not complying with such
 protest activities as school or consumer boycotts. Frequently,
 the distinction between politically motivated violence and
 common crimes has been blurred where criminal elements in the
 townships with no political motivation have posed as
 comrades."
 b. Disappearance
 In recent years many people have disappeared, reportedly into
 police custody, :or long periods. Some, missing for very long
 periods of time, are suspected by friends and associates to
 have been killed by security forces. South African law does
 not require nc.tification of an individual's family, lawyer, or
 any other person in the event of his detention or arrest. The
 second Police Amendment Act of 1980 prohibits the unauthorized
 publication of the name of any person detained where "the
 prevention of or combating of terroristic activities" is the
 reason for the detention.
 In the weeks following the Government's June 12 State of
 Emergency declaration, various human rights groups estimated
 the number of "disappeared" persons at 12,000 or more.
 Because the Government, for a period of more than 2 months,
 would not release the names of detained persons, human rights
 groups, families of missing persons, and lawyers were unable
 to distinguish between "detained" and "disappeared" persons.
 In August the Minister of Law and Order tabled a list of 8,553
 State of Emergency detainees in Parliament. Several weeks
 later, a supplemental list of 786 persons was added. These
 lists only included detainees held for at least 30 days. As
 of the end of 1986, this constituted the Government's only
 official public accounting of emergency detainees. The
 opposition Progressive Federal Party (PFP) and human rights
 monitoring groups estimated that substantial ' .nbers of
 detainees were not named by the Government in the August list,
 claiming that by mid-August the Government had detained between
 10,000 and 12,000 persons under the emergency. while
 government spokesmen say that family members were routinely
 informed of emergency detentions, in practice this did not
 occur in numerous instances.
 Following the June 12 emergency declaration, many black
 activists reportedly left the country surreptitiously or went
 into hiding to avoid detention. These circumstances further
 complicated the task of accurately accounting for the many
 persons who reportedly disappeared after June 12. Government
 press curbs imposed in December prohibited news reporting on
 detention cases and on unresolved litigation concerning
 detentions without prior government clearance, which rendered
 the task of accounting for missing persons still more
 problematic.
 
 
 279
 SOUTH AFRICA
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Security legislation, in particular the Internal Security Act,
 allows police considerable latitude and generally unsupervised
 discretion in the arrest and detention of suspects and in the
 interrogation of detainees. The Act allows for lengthy periods
 of detention during which authorities are not obliged by law to
 present formal charges. Such detentions are a frequent
 occurrence and offer considerable potential for police abuse
 of detainees. State of Emergency regulations exempting law
 enforcement officials from both criminal and civil liability
 for "good faith" acts undertaken in enforcing both States of
 Emergency were cited by many observers as giving police the
 impression that they have a license to engage in abusive
 conduct.
 In 1986 many persons who had been released after being detained
 under State of Emergency and security legislation regulations
 gave accounts of beatings and other abuses by police. They
 reported that they had been held in solitary confinement during
 their detention. Others gave accounts of torture by police,
 including applications of electric shocks to hands, feet, and
 genitals. Most of the latter cases allegedly occurred during
 and immediately following arrest and often appear to be the
 result of poor discipline on the part of police officials.
 The chances of physical abuse taking place appear to diminish
 once a detainee is processed and made part of the general
 inmate population. Instances of abuse in prisons, while not
 unheard of, appear to happen with much less frequency than is
 the case at police stations. At the end of 1986, the Detainee
 Parents' Support Committee (DPSC) released a report in which a
 medical panel it sponsored had surveyed approximately 500
 released detainees under both States of Emergency. The
 survey's preliminary findings indicated that 83 percent showed
 signs of some physical abuse.
 In August the Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference
 brought an application in the Supreme Court alleging that its
 Secretary General, Father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa, had been
 tortured by security forces while held in State of Emergency
 detention. Available evidence suggested that Father
 Mkhatshwa's allegations of physical abuse were true. In
 response to this application, the Government agreed that its
 personnel would refrain from physical abuse of Father
 Mkhatshwa, without admission of any such abuse. The Government
 has permitted Supreme Court judges to visit State of Emergency
 detainees in prisons and in police cells. Government press
 regulations issued in December banned reporting on conditions
 of detention without prior government clearance.
 In a June 12 televised address on the State of Emergency, the
 State President said that security forces "are the friends of
 each peace-loving and law-abiding citizen of this country.
 The Government expects them, at all times, to act in such a
 way that there could be no doubt of this." For the most part,
 the Government has undertaken no serious public effort to hold
 erring police and other security force members accountable for
 apparent abuse of detainees. In 1986 two policemen were
 convicted of assault arising out of a 1985 attack on Natal
 Indian Congress Official Billy Nair, which took place in
 September 1985 while Nair was in detention. In March police
 in the Lebowa homeland assaulted an American citizen, Beth Ann
 Burris, while breaking up a meeting at a church with whips and
 tear gas. The available evidence indicated that Ms. Burris
 
 
 280
 SOUTH AFRICA
 was an innocent bystander who fell victim to random and brutal
 police conduct. While she pursued criminal charges against
 the police, Lebowa authorities obstructed this effort. In May
 a court in the Eastern Cape convicted one black security police
 officer of murder and another of assault in connection with
 attacks on young blacks.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Internal Security Act authorizes the Minister of Law and
 Order to order detention without trial for varying--in some
 instances potentially unlimited--periods of time. In 1986
 amendments to the Internal Security Act introduced a new form
 of preventive detention of up to 180 days which could be used
 in "unrest situations." The Minister of Law and Order himself
 must personally issue "preventive detention" orders under
 section 28 of the Act. Senior police officials have broad
 powers to detain people for interrogation under Section 29 of
 the Act when offenses such as terrorism, sabotage, or inciting
 a revolution are suspected. Access to Internal Security Act
 detainees is severely restricted. In May the Appellate
 Division of the Supreme Court ordered the release of several
 Internal Security Act detainees under Section 28 of the Act,
 holding the terms of the detention orders to be insufficient
 to make out a proper case of risk to the security of the state
 under the Act. This and other court decisions, while holding
 that the Government improperly detained numerous persons,
 nonetheless implicitly sanctioned Internal Security Act
 detentions when done in strict compliance with the Act.
 Invoking the Public Safety Act of 1953, the Government imposed
 a new State of Emergency June 12, 1986, which remained in
 force at the end of the year. Many observers characterized
 the latter State of Emergency as a more draconian version of
 the July 1985 emergency declaration. Under the June 1986
 emergency, in effect nationwide, SADF members and police
 officers down to the rank of constable were empowered to
 detain persons for a period of 14 days. At the expiration of
 this period, the Minister of Law and Order could extend the
 detention for an indefinite period of time, limited only by
 the duration of the State of Emergency. Following the
 emergency declaration, the Government made immediate and
 widespread use of these powers, arresting thousands and
 detaining them without criminal charges. Black trade union
 officials and members of the UDF were particular targets.
 At the end of 1986, the DPSC estimated total emergency
 detentions since June 12 at approximately 20,000. The Black
 Sash organization said up to 1,800 of the detainees were under
 the age of 18, including many children 15 years of age or
 younger. The Government admitted in December that 256 children
 under the age of 16 were in detention, but did not say how
 many detainees between the ages of 16 and 18 were being held.
 In addition, more than 2,400 people were reportedly detained
 under non-State of Emergency security legislation during the
 first 9 months of 1986, 181 of whom were still in custody as
 of the end of September. Amnesty International's 1986 Report
 estimated that 2,000 of those detained in 1985 under the first
 State of Emergency were under 16 years of age.
 While no accurate statistics are available, it is believed
 that a majority of detainees under the first State of Emergency
 (an estimated total of more than 10,000 persons in 7 1/2
 months) were not charged with criminal offenses. Similarly,
 
 
 281
 SOUTH AFRICA
 most persons detained under the June 12, 1986 State of
 Emergency have not been criminally charged.
 Many political figures, community activists, lawyers,
 churchmen, trade union officials, journalists, and others were
 detained under the June 12 State of Emergency. Prominent
 figures among the emergency detainees were: Richard Ramodipa,
 Executive Board member, Black Lawyers' Association; Saths
 Cooper, President, AZAPO; Phiroshaw Camay, General Secretary,
 Congress of Unions of South Africa; Zwelakhe Sisulu, Editor,
 New Nation newspaper; Father Smangaliso Mkhatshwa, Secretary
 General of the South African Catholic Bishops' Conference; and
 Bishop Sigisbert Ndwandwe of the Anglican Church. Ramodipa,
 Cooper, and Camay were freed at the end of August and Bishop
 Ndwandwe in September without criminal charges being filed
 against them. Sisulu was released in July but rearrested in
 December. The Labor Monitoring Group (LMG), which gathered
 statistics on State of Emergency detentions of unionists, said
 in late August. that 333 trade unionists remained in State of
 Emergency detention, while a grand total of 2,775 union
 members were detained at one time or another since June 12.
 LMG figures indicated that 79 percent of labor detainees were
 affiliated with the black membership of the Congress of South
 African Trade Unions (COSATU).
 Arbitrary arrests also occurred frequently in the so-called
 "independent" homelands, which have security legislation
 comparable to South Africa's, and whose law enforcement
 officers cooperate closely with the South African police
 establishment. In November Dean Simon Farisani of the
 Evangelical Lutheran Church was detained in Venda. He remained
 in custody without being charged as of the end of 1986. Police
 held him incommunicado, despite requests for visits by his
 family and legal representatives.
 Foreign nationals enjoyed no immunity from arbitrary emergency
 detention. For example, in June security police in Nylstroom,
 Transvaal, detained Charles Zechman, an American citizen
 missionary. Zechman was held in solitary confinement for 30
 days, was refused visitors (except for two consular visits),
 and was later released without being charged, but with the
 condition that he depart promptly from South Africa.
 Similarly, in June Pretoria police detained Annica van
 Gylswyck, a Swedish citizen with permanent residence in South
 Africa and a prominent figure in the Black Sash antiapartheid
 organization. Following 5 weeks in solitary confinement,
 police presented Mrs. van Gylswyck with an ultimatum to depart
 the country or face 180 days in detention to be followed by
 unspecified criminal charges. Both Mr. Zechman and Mrs. van
 Gylswyck departed South Africa following their respective
 releases.
 The Internal Security Act also authorizes the Minister of Law
 and Order to issue "banning" orders. Under such orders, any
 person judged by the Minister to be endangering law and order,
 threatening state security, or promoting the aims of communism
 or an unlawful organization can be (1) made to resign as an
 officer or member of any organization; (2) restricted to or
 excluded from certain areas; (3) prohibited from meeting with
 more than one person at a time; (4) ordered to report regularly
 to a police station; and (5) prohibited from being quoted or
 published. Courts cannot challenge the Minister's power to
 issue banning orders, although they may inquire into the
 technical validity of banning orders. According to the SAIRR,
 over 1,400 South Africans have been banned at some time since
 
 
 282
 SOUTH AFRICA
 1950. Prominent among "banned" persons at the inception of
 1986 was Winnie Mandela, wife of jailed ANC leader Nelson
 Mandela. By July the Government conceded that no restriction
 order of any kind was in effect with regard to her. In March
 the Government banned two Eastern Cape political activists,
 Henry Fazzie and Mkhuseli Jack. They remained under house
 arrest-style restrictions for some 10 days, until a court
 invalidated the banning orders. In 1986 the Government lifted
 longstanding banning orders against Rowley Arenstein, a Durban
 lawyer, and against Mathatha Tsedu, a black journalist and
 trade unionist. As of the end of 1986, local human rights
 groups said that there were no persons technically "banned"
 under the Internal Security Act. However, numerous State of
 Emergency detainees, while not technically "banned" under
 security legislation, were released from detention subject to
 restrictions on their movements and on their involvement in
 political matters. Still others were not detained but were
 placed under State of Emergency "restriction orders" which
 seriously curtailed their antigovernment activities.
 Forced labor is not used in South Africa as a means of
 political coercion or education nor as a sanction against
 political or ideological opinions. A 1984 International Labor
 Organization (ILO) report noted, however, that under the
 Prisons Act of 1959, the Commissioner of Prisons can "contract
 with any authority or public body or with a person or body of
 persons for the hiring and employment of prisoners under
 sentence." The report further noted that a large portion of
 the prisoners designated for such work were blacks convicted
 of pass law offenses, and that the agricultural sector made
 the greatest use of this convict labor. In 1986 the Government
 announced there were no more pass offenders in its prisons, a
 fact that human rights monitoring groups confirmed. In June
 1986, the Government announced that all convict labor would be
 phased out by September 30.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The power of the South African judiciary at all levels is
 circumscribed by stringent security legislation and by the
 jurisprudential principle of parliamentary sovereignty, under
 which judges possess no authority to alter, strike down, or
 refuse to enforce properly enacted Acts of Parliament. All
 judges of South Africa's Supreme Courts are white, as are the
 vast majority of its magistrates.
 South Africa has an adversarial system of criminal justice
 drawn from a mixed heritage of Roman-Dutch and British
 jurisprudence. Trials of lesser offenses are heard by
 magistrates, who are career employees of the civil service in
 the executive branch. More serious offenses, including
 capital crimes, are tried in the Supreme Courts.
 Determinations of guilt or innocence are made by the presiding
 judge or magistrate. There are no juries.  Judges in capital
 and other serious cases are empowered to appoint two
 "assessors," who serve as factfinders and who have the power
 to veto the presiding judge on the final verdict. Persons
 charged with common crimes are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty, although Parliament has modified this general
 presumption of innocence for many security offenses. The
 Internal Security Act effectively places the burden of proof
 of innocence on an accused for a number of offenses enumerated
 in the Act. Both security-related and common crimes cases are
 tried in civilian courts.
 
 
 283
 SOUTH AFRICA
 While South Africa's Supreme Courts are generally viewed as
 politically independent, critics of the system regard
 magistrates (who are often former government prosecutors) as
 strongly progovernment in their orientation. Judges of the
 Supreme Court are appointed to the bench by the State
 President. Their service is until age 70, and they cannot be
 removed from office except by impeachment by Parliament. By
 tradition, Supreme Court judges are appointed to the bench
 from the ranks of the elite corps of South African Supreme
 Court practitioners ("advocates"). While Supreme Court judges
 are believed to demonstrate considerably more intellectual and
 political independence than do magistrates, critics have
 charged that some Supreme Court judges tend to side with the
 Government in politically sensitive cases and are specifically
 selected by the Government to preside over these cases. The
 weeks following the State of Emergency declaration in June saw
 a spate of legal challenges to both the State of Emergency and
 to the legality of the detention of persons under State of
 Emergency regulations. In September the South African Supreme
 Court, Appellate Division (the nation's highest court), ruled
 that provisions of regulations promulgated by the executive
 under the State of Emergency complied with the relevant
 enabling statute, the Public Safety Act of 1953. There were
 numerous technical challenges throughout the country to various
 State of Emergency detentions during the second half of 1986,
 some of which succeeded.
 Defendants in criminal cases have the right to counsel. If a
 person cannot pay for his or her defense, limited funds for
 legal assistance are available through the government-supported
 legal aid fund and through various private organizations.
 These sources, however, are insufficient to meet the needs of
 all indigent defendants. Courts usually appoint counsel in
 capital cases where the defendant cannot afford his or her own
 lawyer. Security trials are often held in remote locations,
 far from metropolitan areas. Because of case backlogs,
 postponements, and the practice of hearing cases concurrently,
 criminal trials can sometimes take months, even years, to
 complete. This is particularly true in security cases.
 In January the Government began its prosecution of what many
 termed the most significant security/political trial of a
 generation, involving high treason, murder, and other security
 charges against 22 defendants, members of the UDF, AZAPO, and
 various black civic organizations. In November the Supreme
 Court, Transvaal Provincial Division, dismissed all charges
 against three defendants for the State's failure to make out
 prima facie cases against them. At that time, the Court also
 granted bail to 6 of the remaining 19 defendants. At the end
 of 1986, 13 defendants remained in custody, many of them having
 been imprisoned since late 1984. As of November, the State
 had rested its case, and the defense had begun its
 presentation. Defendants were represented by an extremely able
 team of legal counsel.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The system of apartheid necessarily involves the Government in
 extensive regulation of social, personal, and family life. A
 person's identification as a member of an ethnic group or race
 is based on definitions and decisions of the Government under
 the Population Registration Act. Under this law, every child
 born in South Africa must be registered and classified
 according to race. In borderline cases, racial classification
 
 
 284
 SOUTH AFRICA
 is determined administratively by a racial classification
 board, empowered to weigh "evidence" and to issue a verdict on
 an individual's race when the parents' racial classification
 is not known. Under apartheid, association in many social
 settings is not a matter of free choice. The Separate
 Amenities Act allows public premises to be reserved for the
 exclusive use of persons of a particular race. In recent
 years, the Government has expanded the scope of administrative
 exceptions to apartheid laws, and has allowed most restaurants
 hotels, theaters, cinemas, drive-in theaters, private
 hospitals, parks, libraries, and other public facilities to
 admit persons of all races upon application. Many but by no
 means all private establishments have opted for "multiracial"
 status.
 Despite many reforms in recent years in the area of so-called
 "petty apartheid," a substantial degree of social segregation
 still exists in South Africa, legally permitted--in some. case!
 mandated--by numerous statutes, provincial ordinances, and
 provincial bylaws. Social apartheid is now being enforced
 with less rigidity than in the past, however, and is evolving
 slowly toward a "local option" system. Some local authoritie:
 have made use of the limited discretion they have to
 desegregate facilities under their control, while others have
 not. In 1986 some big city governments desegregated central
 business districts under an amendment to the Group Areas Act
 permitting such action in commercial areas. Despite its
 having led in recent years with a reform policy in this area,
 the ruling National Party, during 1986, reiterated earlier
 government policy on the questions of segregated housing area
 and schools for the races, stating that racial segregation in
 these two critical areas will continue under the rubric of
 "group rights."
 The Group Areas Act remains one of the cornerstones of
 apartheid. Under its provisions, the Government mandates tha
 the different races must reside in separate areas. In some
 cases, when one spouse is prohibited from living with the
 other because of the Group Areas Act, the benefits of the
 repeal of the miscegenation laws in 1985 have been vitiated.
 For blacks, even the right to reside in a segregated urban
 township is not available if one is deemed a "citizen" of one
 of the so-called "independent" homelands. Such persons are
 regarded as aliens in so-called "white" South Africa, and,
 notwithstanding their birth in South Africa, are subject to
 the same restrictions as any foreigner. Most blacks who live
 in urban township houses rent them from the Government, whic
 owns and subsidizes them. In 1986 Parliament passed a law
 allowing freehold land ownership in appropriate group areas
 for blacks, who had hitherto only been able to lease land for
 99 years. Many urban townships are still seriously lacking i
 some or all modern amenities, such as electricity, running
 water, indoor plumbing, public sewage, paved roads, and
 recreational facilities. Some declared townships are little
 more than permanent shanty towns with "houses" constructed of
 fibreboard and corrugated iron. Townships are often located
 at long commuting distances from cities, where most employmen
 opportunities for South Africa's blacks are found.
 Notwithstanding the Group Areas Act, a growing number of
 so-called "grey areas" exist in some major cities, where
 blacks, coloreds, and Asians reside in technically white
 areas, often without government interference. Occasionally,
 there are criminal prosecutions for such violations of the
 Group Areas Act. In July a white Cape Town man was convicted
 
 
 285
 SOUTH AFRICA
 of a criminal violation of the Group Areas Act for cohabiting
 with his colored common-law wife. Some private schools in
 white-designated areas engage in technical violations of the
 Group Areas Act, without government interference, by admitting
 black, colored, and Asian students.
 The 1960's "grand apartheid" policy of extending "independence"
 to South Africa's tribally based homelands has involved the
 Government in long-term, institutionalized disruptions of black
 families. Blacks who are designated as "citizens" of the
 homelands may obtain work permits allowing them to reside in
 urban areas of so-called white South Africa, but they may not
 be accompanied by their spouses and children. Tens of
 thousands of such persons are forced by housing shortages to
 reside away from their families, often in overcrowded
 single-sex dormitories in urban areas.
 Because the blueprint of group areas called for by apartheid
 legislation has not always corresponded to the actual locations
 of the various racial groups, the Government has over the years
 forcibly relocated many people. The South African Council of
 Churches has estimated that since 1961, the Government has
 forcibly resettled approximately 3.5 million blacks, coloreds,
 and Asians. Government figures issued in 1984 asserted that 2
 million blacks had been resettled since 1960. In early 1985,
 the Government announced a suspension of forced removals in
 favor of a policy of negotiating with affected communities on
 relocation issues. In several instances, however, the
 Government has refused to negotiate with recognized black
 community leaders. In other instances, it has engaged in
 effectively coercive removals, refusing to furnish fundamental
 infrastructure such as sewage facilities, electricity, and
 running water in black communities it seeks to remove to other
 areas. The Government has also adopted the approach of
 refusing to assign new housing to persons in existing black
 communities where it seeks removals. In 1986 the Government
 adopted these tactics in an effort to remove the 15,000
 residents of the 60-year-old black community of Oukasie, near
 the town of Brits, to a site near the Bophuthatswana border.
 As of the end of 1986, the Government had "deproclaimed" the
 community as a black residential area, while some 10,000
 residents remained there in the hope that the Government would
 reverse this decision. Many of these people opposed removal
 on the suspicion that the community where they $would be
 resettled would eventually be incorporated into the so-called
 "independent" homeland of Bophuthatswana, a move that would
 have adverse consequences for their South African citizenship.
 Resettlement areas, particularly when located in the homelands,
 often have inadequate infrastructure and insufficient land and
 water for profitable agriculture.
 The Black Urban Areas Consolidation Act allows police to enter
 homes without a warrant if any black is suspected of residing
 or working in the area illegally. The Criminal Procedures Act
 of 1977 authorizes a judge or magistrate to issue a search
 warrant if there is some reason to believe that "the internal
 security of the republic or the maintenance of law and order
 is likely to be endangered by or in consequence of a 'meeting'
 being held in a given place." Under this same Act, a police
 officer may enter, search, and question without a warrant, if
 the officer has reason to believe a warrant would be issued
 but the delay caused by first obtaining the warrant would
 defeat the purpose of the search.

 SOUTH AFRICA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Throughout 1986 South Africa's largely white-owned press
 continued, when possible, to engage in vigorous criticism of
 the Government and its policies. Freedom of speech and press
 are seriously circumscribed by several acts of Parliament,
 including the Defense Act, the Police Act, the Prisons Act,
 the Internal Security Act, the Protection and Information Act,
 and especially the Public Safety Act which is the legal basis
 for the regulations and restrictions under both States of
 Emergency. The latter restrictions impair freedom of
 expression and press by making "subversive statements" a
 criminal offense (e.g. encouraging strikes, boycotts, the
 promotion of disinvestment) and include bans on television
 coverage, still photography, sketching, and radio recording
 from areas covered by the State of Emergency. Penalties for
 infractions include fines of up to $8,000 and/or imprisonment
 for up to 10 years. In December the Government issued an even
 tighter set of press restrictions which makes it a criminal
 offense to publish material on political unrest, detention
 cases, the treatment of detainees, and various types of
 political activity without prior government clearance. These
 restrictions greatly reduced media coverage in 1986, in
 particular through television, of political unrest, but also
 at the end of the year through government delays in clearing
 press articles.
 The Government took direct action against the press in a
 number of specific cases. In June shortly after the emergency
 declaration, the Government summarily confiscated an entire
 edition of one independent newspaper, the Weekly Mail, on
 grounds that it contained items that violated the emergency
 regulations. On two occasions, it also seized copies of the
 Sowetan, the nation's leading black daily. In July the
 Government expelled Newsweek Bureau Chief Richard Manning, an
 American citizen, as an "undesirable alien." It also expelled
 several other foreign journalists in the weeks following the
 emergency declaration. In November the Government ordered Los
 Angeles Times correspondent Michael Parks to leave South
 Africa by the end of December, but later extended the deadline
 to the end of January,,to allow Parks and his employer to
 appeal the order. The Government also impeded the flow of
 information from South Africa by refusing visa requests by
 foreign journalists or by subjecting them to inordinate
 delays. In August two U.S. broadcasting companies, ABC and
 CBS, stated that certain of their news tape cassettes,
 transported via international delivery services from South
 Africa to the United States, were tampered with or stolen in
 transit.
 In this atmosphere, self-censorship is rife, and many newspapel
 editors said that they have had to surrender ultimate editing
 responsibility to their lawyers. While there were no known
 convictions of journalists under the various laws or
 regulations, some were detained (see section l.d.). In late
 1985, the Government brought Internal Security Act charges
 against Cape Times Editor Anthony Heard and against South
 African Associated Newspapers (SAAN), the owner of the Times,
 after the newspaper published Mr. Heard's interview with ANC
 leader Oliver Tambo. In August the Government dropped the
 charges against Mr. Heard, while SAAN pleaded guilty to
 violations of the Act.
 
 
 287
 SOUTH AFRICA
 In July and August, several publishers launched a challenge to
 State of Emergency press curbs in the Supreme Court for Natal
 province. The court ruled in favor of the newspapers, holding
 that the emergency provisions against publication of
 "subversive statements" which allowed for police seizure of
 certain "subversive" publications were overly vague. This
 decision did not have nationwide effect, however, as the
 court's jurisdiction did not extend beyond Natal province.
 In addition to censorship and self-censorship, an
 institutionalized system of self-regulation exists in the
 newspaper industry. The Media Council, formed in 1983, has
 been given the power by its convenors to impose penalties on
 errant members of the newspaper press union and other media
 that submit to the council's jurisdiction.
 Under the Publications Act (applicable to most periodicals,
 with the exception of newspapers), the importation, possession,
 and publication of politically or morally "undesirable" works
 is prohibited. Materials subject to censorship include those
 found to be "indecent or obscene," "blasphemous," or
 "prejudicial to the safety of the State." Committee decisions
 are subject to review by a Publications Appeal Board. The
 Board's decisions are not subject to judicial review, except
 in rare instances.
 The Government exercises a near monopoly on television and
 radio broadcasting through the state-owned South African
 Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). With some exceptions, SABC
 largely reflects progovernment viewpoints both in its news
 reporting and editorial policy. While the Government professes
 that SABC is politically independent, a wide range of the
 political spectrum, from the liberal PFP to the right-wing
 Conservative Party, characterizes the corporation as an
 editorial arm of the ruling National Party.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Internal Security Act seriously obstructs freedom of
 assembly as it gives magistrates the power to ban or impose
 conditions on the holding of public meetings and to close off
 areas to the public to prevent prohibited gatherings. In
 response to widespread unrest in 1976, the Minister of Law and
 Order banned all outdoor gatherings except sports events or
 specially authorized meetings. The Government has renewed
 this ban on an annual basis since 1976 and did so again in
 1986. At the end of 1985, the Government imposed a 6-month
 ban on indoor meetings of some 74 antigovernment organizations,
 including the UDF, AZAPO, the Release Mandela Committee, and
 the DPSC. This ban was in effect in 30 magisterial districts
 throughout the country. Throughout the 1986 emergency, there
 was widespread banning of meetings of political, civic, and
 youth organizations throughout the country. Police frequently
 arrested persons in townships on charges of participating in
 illegal gatherings. The Government also maintained a ban on a
 number of important political organizations, premier among
 these the PAC, the ANC, and the Congress of South African
 Students (COSAS).
 During 1986 government policy appeared aimed at hindering the
 UDF by detaining key leaders. Founded in August 1983, the UDF
 is a loosely organized national movement of over 600 community
 groups, church and civic organizations, and labor unions.
 Although the movement contains elements that adhere to the
 more revolutionary values of the ANC, most of its member
 
 
 288
 SOUTH AFRICA
 organizations describe themselves as advocates of nonviolent
 political and social change. In October the Government
 declared the UDF an "affected organization," meaning it could
 no longer receive funds from abroad, a move which was
 interpreted by many observers as an effort to hamper the
 organization's effectiveness.
 The South African Labor Relations Act recognizes the right of
 employees to form and to join trade unions. Amendments to the
 Labor Relations Act passed between 1979 and 1981 for the first
 time granted South African blacks full status as employees and
 removed impediments to the legal operation of black trade
 unions. Trade union members, approximately 50 percent of whom
 are black, constitute about 17 percent of the total labor
 force of nearly 12 million. In 1979 fewer than 100,000 blacks
 were trade union members. At the beginning of 1986, black
 trade union membership stood at nearly 1 million, according to
 government estimates.
 The Labor Relations Act does not cover farm workers and
 domestic servants, who together comprise approximately
 2 million workers (about one-sixth of the total labor force).
 Workers in these two categories, nearly all of whom are black,
 enjoy few protections under the law. With the qualified
 exception of KwaZulu, none of the homelands has labor
 legislation to match the post-1979 reforms passed by the South
 African Parliament. Ciskei and Transkei have banned a major
 trade union active in the Eastern Cape (the South African
 Allied Workers Union), and Bophuthatswana has prohibited
 unions headquartered elsewhere from operating in its territory.
 The right to strike exists under the Labor Relations Act but
 is qualified by a mandatory prestrike conciliation process
 that can take as long as 2 months to complete. Nearly all
 strikes occurring in recent years have been staged by emerging
 black unions, and most of them have been technically illegal.
 In addition, the right to strike is seriously modified by the
 common law right of an employer to fire any striker (whether
 the strike is legal or illegal) on grounds of breach of the
 person's employment contract. A 1985 opinion of the
 Industrial Court, however, has significantly improved the
 position of legal strikers. The increase in the number of
 strikes, which reached record levels, in 1985 and the first
 half of 1986, reflects the success of black trade unions in
 mobilizing workers and in articulating grievances. However,
 massive detentions of trade union officials and members under
 the State of Emergency regulations served to reduce the
 political activism of black unions in the second half of 1986.
 South African trade unions are independent of the Government,
 and most of them have no links with any political party or
 movement. Some exceptions are: the all-white South African
 Confederation of Labor, with about 100,000 members, which is
 widely believed to have ties to the right-wing Herstigte
 Nasionale Party; COSATU, which emerged in 1986 as a de facto
 ally of the UDF; and the United Workers Union of South Africa,
 which is associated with Inkatha.
 Somth Africa has not been a member of the ILO since the early
 1960's. The Government monitors but does not prohibit trade
 union relations with the international labor movement.
 Government passport and visa policy, however, sometimes
 impedes these relations. As of the end of 1986, no South
 African labor organization had official links with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 
 
 289
 SOUTH AFRICA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 South Africa's multiracial society has a wide variety of
 religious denominations, and the Government generally respects
 freedom of worship. Religious organizations are allowed to
 hold meetings and other activities without interference as
 long as they do not seriously challenge government policies.
 As with other aspects of South African life, churches are
 often divided along racial lines, but many churches (including
 a growing number of white churches) challenge apartheid on
 moral grounds. The Defense Act provides alternative service
 options for religious objectors to national military service.
 Conscientious objectors on nonreligious grounds continue to be
 subject to a maximum 6-year sentence for refusing to serve.
 The Government is often at odds with a number of the country's
 church leaders, some of whom are outspoken critics of the
 apartheid system. These include Anglican Archbishop of Cape
 Town Desmond Tutu; Rev. Allan Boesak, President of the World
 Alliance of Reformed Churches; and Archbishop Denis Hurley,
 Head of the Catholic Archdiocese of Durban. In November the
 Government dropped subversion charges against Rev. Boesak,
 which had been pending since August 1985. These charges
 stemmed from an effort by Rev. Boesak to stage a march on
 Poolsmoor prison near Cape Town, where ANC leader Nelson
 Mandela is imprisoned. Some church leaders, most notably
 Archbishop Tutu, have openly advocated economic sanctions by
 the international community ,against South Africa. While
 Archbishop Tutu's remarks on this and other issues have drawn
 heavy criticism from some government officials, as of the end
 of the year the Government had taken no action to restrict him.
 Churchmen have been frequent targets of detention, both by
 South African authorities and by police in the so-called
 "independent" homelands. Dean Simon Farisani of the
 Evangelical Lutheran Church was detained in Venda in late
 November and remained in custody at the end of the year. In
 November police in the Transkei detained Larry Hill, an
 American citizen missionary, for 2 weeks without criminal
 charge. On December 17 Transkei authorities detained Father
 James Paulsen, also an American citizen, without criminal
 charge. He remained in custody at the end of the year.
 Numerous other clergymen have also been detained under
 security laws, nearly always without criminal charge.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Since the inception of the Government's homelands policy in
 the 1960's, an estimated 8 million South African blacks have
 been rendered aliens in the Republic of South Africa by virtue
 of what the Government characterizes as their "citizenship" in
 one of the so-called "independent" homelands (Transkei,
 Ciskei, Bophuthatswana, and Venda). They are subject to the
 same travel and residence restrictions in "white" South Africa
 as any alien.
 Until 1986 the right of black South African citizens to reside
 in urban areas was severely restricted by a complex set of
 statutes and regulations known as "influx control" or "pass"
 laws. In April Parliament repealed these laws in favor of one
 requiring all South Africans to carry a uniform identity
 document. Since the passage of this law, black South African
 citizens are no longer required to carry government-issued
 "passes" in order to prove to law enforcement officers their
 
 
 290
 SOUTH AFRICA
 right to be present in an urban area. Some critics of the
 pass law system hailed this reform but expressed the fear that
 urban housing shortages, antisquatting laws, and sanctions
 against employees who hire "illegal aliens" from the four
 so-called "independent" homelands would amount to a de facto
 system of influx control. Since the repeal of the pass laws,
 the Government has reiterated that putative citizens of the
 homelands will continue to be treated as aliens and will be
 subject to the same laws. In 1986 Parliament also passed the
 Restoration of Citizenship Act, providing for "restoration" of
 South African citizenship to a limited class of blacks who
 were denationalized as a result of homeland "independence"
 grants--those with "permanent residence" rights in South
 Africa. The Minister of Home Affairs has said that this
 reform will apply only to an estimated 1.75 million blacks,
 rather than to the estimated 6 million persons many observers
 hoped it would benefit.
 South Africans must possess valid travel documents in order to
 travel abroad or to emigrate legally. Except for banned
 persons, these documents generally are not difficult for whites
 to obtain. Blacks assigned to an "independent" homeland
 usually experience difficulty in obtaining South African
 passports as the Government takes the position that they are
 not citizens of South Africa. In some instances, this has the
 effect of deterring international travel as some blacks refuse
 to travel on a homeland passport, insisting that the Government
 recognize them as citizens of South Africa. In 1982 the South
 1982 the South African Supreme Court ruled that a citizen's
 access to a South African passport is a privilege and not a
 right and that the Minister of Home Affairs has the absolute
 discretion to revoke a passport without giving any reasons for
 his action. The Government often refuses passports to black
 trade union officials and other persons whom it regards as
 radically critical of the status quo. In October it refused
 permission to Winnie Mandela, wife of ANC leader Nelson
 Mandela, and to Albertina Sisulu, co-President of the UDF, to
 travel to Mozambique for the funeral of President Samora
 Machel. In December it refused permission to human rights
 activist Helen Joseph to travel to the United States to
 receive a human rights award.
 Until 1986 legal restrictions existed for Asians who wished to
 reside in or visit the Orange Free State and certain parts of
 Natal province. Parliament repealed these restrictions during
 its 1986 session.
 Although South Africa is not a signatory to international
 conventions on refugees, the Government provides informal
 sanctuary to as many as 200,000 Mozambicans displaced by civil
 strife in their country. Relief assistance is provided by
 South African private and voluntary organizations, as well as
 by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and
 the Government permits access by international observers to
 areas where these refugees are found. The number of South
 Africans who are officially registered as refugees in
 neighboring countries has not grown significantly since 1985
 and remains approximately 22,000. The South African Council
 of Churches estimates the total number of South African exiles
 to be 250,000 or more.
 
 
 291
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The extent to which South African citizens have the right to
 change their government democratically depends on race. Until
 1984 South Africa's national political institutions were
 reserved for whites only. Under the country's 1983
 Constitution, implemented in late 1984, the right of political
 participation at the national level was extended on a limited
 basis to South Africa's colored and Asian citizens but
 continued to be denied to the black majority, who comprise
 72 percent of the population. The new Constitution created a
 tricameral Parliament with separate chambers for whites,
 coloreds, and Asians. Officially registered political parties
 may operate as freely as the ruling National Party. The
 respective groups are represented in Parliament on a racial
 ratio of 4/2/1--white/colored/Asian. Members for each house
 are elected from separate, racially based voter rolls. Each
 house has primary responsibility for "own affairs" matters,
 i.e., legislation affecting its own racial constituency. The
 State President is empowered to decide arbitrarily which issues
 of general concern are to be treated by all three chambers. If
 efforts at consensus on general affairs matters fail, they are
 referred to the President's Council, a body composed of whites,
 coloreds, and Asians, for an advisory opinion. The ruling
 white National Party controls the President's Council. In
 June the colored and Asian houses of Parliament attempted to
 block security legislation passed by the white House of
 Assembly. This effort was vetoed by the President's Council,
 and the disputed security legislation became law.
 The lines between "own affairs" and "general affairs" are not
 always precise. Matters that are usually considered general
 affairs include foreign policy, defense, national security,
 and black affairs. Education is normally dealt with as an
 "own affair" but is subject to general laws prescribing norms
 and standards for salaries, curriculum, and examinations.
 The terms of the new Constitution and the existence of a white
 majority in Parliament work to ensure control by the white
 House of Assembly over key general affairs. While there is a
 vigorous, outspoken opposition in the House of Assembly, the
 ruling National Party, which has controlled South African
 political affairs since its first parliamentary victory in
 1948, dominates legislative affairs by sheer force of numbers.
 Within the National Party, viewpoints toward reform of the
 apartheid system range from moderate to reactionary. Internal
 differences are, in theory, resolved in party caucuses, but in
 practice the State President, who is also the National Party
 leader, resolves all disputes.
 Political participation for blacks, who have no representation
 in Parliament, remains limited to a franchise in 1 of the 10
 homelands to which all blacks are assigned through ethnic or
 linguistic identification, or in the case of urban blacks, to
 a franchise enabling one to vote for black local government
 officials. Assignments of blacks to homelands take place
 irrespective of the wishes of those assigned and without regard
 to the fact that they may not have been born, nor ever lived
 in, nor even visited, their putative homeland. When a homeland
 "requests" and is then granted "independence" by the South
 African Government, blacks assigned to that homeland lose
 their South African citizenship and receive the "citizenship"
 of the homeland. An estimated 8 million blacks have lost
 South African citizenship under this policy by South African
 legislation granting "independence" to four homelands:
 
 
 292
 SOUTH AFRICA
 Transkei (1976); Bophuthatswana (1977); Venda (1979); and
 Ciskei (1981). The South African Government stated in 1986
 that it had no intention of abolishing the homelands system.
 A fifth homeland--KwaNdebele--had been slated for
 "independence" in December 1986. In August the KwaNdebele
 legislative assembly, reacting to several months of political
 violence in the homeland and an evident groundswell of anti-
 independence sentiment among the homeland's inhabitants,
 rejected an earlier decision by the homeland's Chief Minister
 to accept independence. While the Minister of Constitutional
 Development and Planning publicly said that the Government
 would honor the wishes of the people of KwaNdebele, it was
 still not clear at the end of 1986 whether the South African
 Government would follow through with the grant of independence
 to KwaNdebele. On December 31, 1985, the Government formally
 proclaimed the excision of an area of the Lebowa homeland--the
 Moutse district--and its incorporation into KwaNdebele,
 despite opposition by the inhabitants of Moutse, who now
 constitute an ethnic minority in KwaNdebele.
 An estimated 10 million blacks live in townships near white
 urban areas. The only voting rights they are able to exercise
 are those granted under the Community Councils Act of 1977 and
 the Black Local Authorities Act of 1982. The Black Local
 Authorities Act of 1982 elevated the status of black municipal
 authorities to that enjoyed by white municipal governments.
 It did nothing, however, about the critical problems of
 inadequate financial resources and the lack of political
 credibility faced by black local government. Much of the
 violence that took place in black townships in 1986 was
 directed at black town councils and councillors, who were
 viewed by many blacks as collaborators with the South African
 Government. In many areas, there were wholesale abdications
 of town councils due to community opposition, which often took
 the form of political violence.
 In 1985 Parliament passed legislation to replace all-white
 provincial (state) councils with multiracial Regional Services
 Councils (RSC's), to include representatives of black, Asian,
 and colored local governments. The Government has experienced
 difficulty in drawing authentic black leaders into the RSC's.
 While characterized by the Government as a "devolution" of
 power to local bodies, the RSC's are widely regarded as not
 representing a meaningful shift towards greater democracy in
 local government.
 In Natal province, the Indaba--a convention representing all
 racial groups and a wide range of social and political
 organizations--met for several months in 1986 to formulate a
 proposal for a new constitution for the province. The
 proposal, which was unveiled in late November, provided (among
 other provisions) for a bill of rights with firm constitutional
 guarantees of individual liberties. It also proposed a
 universal franchise and a bicameral legislature in which the
 larger chamber would be elected on a one-person, one-vote
 basis and the smaller chamber would represent specified ethnic
 groups with veto rights over certain affairs affecting them.
 The leader of the ruling National Party for Natal province
 publicly rejected the terms of the Indaba proposal, but the
 responsible cabinet minister had not formally commented on the
 proposal by the end of the year. The Indaba leaders were
 planning to present it formally to the Government for approval
 and hold a referendum among the people of Natal and the
 homeland of KwaZulu on the proposals.

 SOUTH AFRICA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The South African Government extends little or no cooperation
 to various United Nations bodies or private organizations
 attempting to investigate the Government's human rights
 record. In October reacting to a vote of an International Red
 Cross conference in Geneva to expel a South African delegation,
 the Government announced the expulsion of 16 Swiss delegates
 of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). In
 November, however, the Government reversed this decision and
 stated that ICRC representatives could remain in South Africa.
 The Government has permitted the ICRC access to convicted
 security offenders.
 During 1986 the Government permitted an American Bar
 Association representative entry into the country to observe
 proceedings in the treason trial pending against 22 UDF and
 other black political organization leaders. The Government
 refused numerous requests by foreigners to interview Nelson
 Mandela but did allow members of the Commonwealth "Eminent
 Person's Group" to meet with Mandela on two occasions.
 Many South African organizations observe, report, and contest
 human rights violations in the country. In addition to black
 political organizations, the Lawyers for Human Rights, the
 Black Sash, the Legal Resources Center, the South African
 Council of Churches, the DPSC, the End Conscription Campaign
 (ECC), the Center for Applied Legal Studies and other groups
 are actively involved in a wide range of human rights issues,
 and assist persons who are aggrieved by the apartheid and
 security laws. The annual report of the South African
 Institute of Race Relations is a key source on human rights
 questions in South Africa. In December 1986, the Government
 entered restriction orders against a number of Black Sash,
 DPSC, and ECC leaders, prohibiting them from engaging in
 certain types of political activity.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 As stressed throughout this report, South Africa's black
 majority and, to a somewhat lesser extent, the colored and
 Asian communities, suffer from pervasive, legally sanctioned
 discrimination based on race in political, economic, and
 social aspects of life. For example, government expenditures
 on education per student in the financial year 1983/84 were:
 whites, $744; Asians, $489; coloreds, $256; and blacks
 (exclusive of Transkei, Ciskei, Bophuthatswana and Venda),
 $105. In 1981 black pupil enrollment was just over 5 million
 in regular primary though high school grades. Only slightly
 more than 1 percent of enrollment was in the last grade of
 high school, illustrative of the high drop-out rate. Black
 enrollment at "white" universities has been growing slowly.
 Political unrest which has swept many of the country's black
 and colored townships since late 1984 has taken the form of
 school boycotts in many areas. In some parts of the country,
 the Government has closed black schools. While black activist
 groups, in particular the National Education Crisis Committee,
 have sought to reconcile differences between black students
 and government educational authorities, political problems
 have exacerbated an already poor educational system for blacks.

 SOUTH AFRICA
 Women of all races in South Africa suffer varying degrees of
 legal, cultural, and economic discrimination, most of which is
 based on tradition rather than codified in law. Women
 traditionally earn lower wages than men and are generally
 underrepresented in the country's political and business
 establishment. No women presently serve as ministers in the
 Government. Two women serve as members of the State
 President's Council. Three of the 178 seats in the
 Parliament's white House of Assembly are held by women. The
 colored House of Representatives has two women members, and
 the Asian House of Delegates has one. Generally speaking,
 women have achieved more success in electoral politics at the
 local than at the national level.
 Black women suffer not only from extensive legal handicaps and
 acts of discrimination that stem from South Africa's system of
 apartheid, but also from other legal disabilities based on
 sex. They are regarded by South African law as perpetual
 minors. Maternity benefits are not guaranteed under South
 African law, and a pregnant woman can be legally dismissed
 from her job. Against a backdrop of traditional sex and race
 discrimination, a fledgling women's rights movement has taken
 hold in South Africa. Women's organizations, often
 multiracial, have been at the forefront of the struggle
 against both race and sex discrimination.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Government figures show an increase in unemployment in 1986.
 Black unemployment is not measured directly, but private
 estimates of total black unemployment (including the
 homelands) are in the 25 to 30 percent range. In some areas,
 especially in the eastern Cape, black unemployment rates are
 dramatically higher, reaching over 50 percent.
 The Labor Relations Act of 1956 provides a mechanism for
 negotiation between labor and management to set industry-by-
 industry minimum wage standards. At present, some 101
 industries come under the provisions of the Act. There is no
 universal minimum wage in South Africa. The Occupational and
 Safety Act prohibits the employment of minors under the age of
 16 in certain industries. On basic conditions of employment,
 the Act sets forth certain minimum standards for employment,
 including provisions for a standard workweek of 46 hours in
 most industries, as well as mandatory provisions for vacation
 and sick leave. The Machinery and Occupational Safety Act
 mandates minimum standards for the design and use of certain
 types of industrial machinery.
