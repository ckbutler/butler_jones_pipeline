 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 Antigua and Barbuda, a small two-island state, is a parliamentary democracy and
 a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. It is governed by a Prime Minister, a
 Cabinet, and a bicameral Legislative Assembly. The Governor General, with largely
 ceremonial duties, is the titular Head of State and serves as the representative of
 the British monarch. The Constitution requires general elections at least every 5
 years. Prime Minister V.C. Bird, Sr., and his Antigua Labour Party hold 15 of the
 17 seats in the House of Representatives. The Governor General appoints the 17-
 member Senate with the advice of the Prime Minister and opposition leader.
 Security forces consist of a police force and the Antigua and Barbuda Defense
 Force, a 90-person infantry unit. The police are organized, trained, and supervised
 according to British law enforcement practices. The security forces have a reputa-
 tion for respecting individual rights in the performance of their duties.
 Antigua and Barbuda has a mixed economy with a strong private sector. A slow-
 down in the important tourism industry was blamed for a decline in economic
 growth during 1993. The large and growing external debt, combined with the finan-
 cial pressures of meeting payroll demands of an oversized public sector work force,
 also contributed to the economic slowdown.
 The Constitution provides for political and civil rights, which are generally re-
 spected in practice. However, despite government promises in 1992 that opposition
 political leaders would have access to the government-controlled electronic media,
 news censorship continued. As a result, opposition parties or persons presenting
 opinions opposed to government policies were denied media access. Scattered inci-
 dents of violence marred campaign activities for general elections set for early 1994.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance or politically moti-
 vated abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel or inhuman treatment of pris-
 oners or detainees, and these prohibitions are generally respected in practice. In
 1990 Parliament amended the law to permit flogging as a penalty for rape. While
 there were no reported floggings of convicted rapists, several people were flogged for
 conviction on child molestation charges.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, which do not occur in practice. Criminal defendants have the
 right of judicial determination of the legality of their detention. Detainees must be
 brought before a court within 48 hours of arrest or detention. There were no reports
 of involuntary exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system is modeled on that of the
 United Kingdom and is part of the Eastern Caribbean legal system. Final appeal
 may be made to the Queen's Privy Council in the United Kingdom, which is invari-
 ably done in the case of death sentences. There are no military or political courts.
 Criminal defendants are assured a fair, open, and public trial. In capital cases only,
 the Government provides legal assistance at public expense to persons without the
 means to retain a private attorney.
 There are no political prisoners in Antigua and Barbuda.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspond-
 (345)
 
 
 ence in 1993. The police must obtain a warrant from an officer of the court before
 searching private premises.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 the press, and other forms of communication. These provisions are generally re-
 spected. However, the Government dominates the electronic media, the only daily
 source of news, and effectively denies access to opposition parties. The Government
 owns one of the two radio stations and the single television station. A son of the
 Prime Minister owns the second radio station, while another son is the principal
 owner of the sole cable television company. The government-controlled media re-
 ported regularly on the Government's activities but rarely on those of the opposition
 political parties.
 The political opposition publishes one weekly newspaper. Several private sector
 organizations, such as the Chamber of Commerce, publish newsletters with a vari-
 ety of opinions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. Required permits for public meetings are issued by
 the police and are normally granted. On a few occasions, police permits for political
 rallies and marches have been delayed in an effort to defuse confrontational situa-
 tions. On these occasions, the opposition parties accused the police of interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is unrestricted exercise of religious freedom. The
 population is overwhelmingly Protestant, but adherents of other religious denomina-
 tions practice their religion and proselytize openly without government interference.
 All groups are free to maintain links with coreligionists in other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Neither law nor practice restricts the right of citizens to move about
 within the country, to travel abroad, or to emigrate.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Antigua and Barbuda has a multiparty political system accommodating a wide
 spectrum of political viewpoints. All citizens 18 years of age and older may register
 and vote by secret ballot. The Constitution requires general elections at least every
 5 years. The Government is obligated by law to hold voter registration during a
 fixed period each year, and parties conduct their own registration drives free of gov-
 ernment interference. The last general elections were held in March 1989 and were
 won by the Antigua Labour Party (ALP). With 15 of the 17 seats in the House of
 Representatives, the ALP retains the power that it has held since 1951, except for
 a period of o position from 1971 to 1976. One seat is held by United irogressive
 Party (UPP) leader Baldwin Spencer. The remaining seat represents the Barbuda
 constituency and is held by a political independent who leads the Barbuda faction
 advocating secession from Antigua.
 The opposition has charged that the ALP's longstanding monopoly on patronage
 and its influence over access to economic opportunities make it extremely difficult
 for opposition parties to attract membership and financial support. In 1992, how-
 ever, public concern over corruption in government spawned the merger of three po-
 litical opposition parties into the UPP. This led to massive new UPP voter reg-
 istrants in 1993, but opposition leaders complained that the electoral rolls were in-
 accurate.
 The ALP responded by electing the Prime Minister's son, Lester B. Bird, as its
 new political leader to run as the ALP standard-bearer in the general elections
 scheduled for early 1994. Scattered incidents of violence marred the campaign by
 year's end.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no governmental restrictions, no local human rights groups have
 formed to date. There were no requests for human rights investigations or inquiries
 during 1993.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, creed, language, or social sta-
 tus, and it is generally observed.
 Women.-While the role of women in society is not legally restricted, tradition
 tends to limit women to home and family, particularly in rural areas, and to restrict
 their career options. To change these traditional roles, the Government began pro-
 grams to provide enhanced educational opportunities for both sexes, as well as fam-
 
 
 ily planning services. The Directorate of Women's Affairs (previously the Women's
 Desk) worked energetically, with some success to help women advance in govern-
 ment and the professions, but progress was slower in the private sector. In 1993
 the Directorate continued educational programs for women in such areas as health,
 crafts, and improving business skills.
 Most violence against women probably goes unreported; however, knowledgeable
 sources believe that over 1,600 cases of physical and mental violence occur each
 year. Gauging the extent of the problem is difficult due to the reluctance of women
 in many cases to testify against their abusers. Police may be reluctant to interfere
 in cases of domestic violence, and some women have credibly charged that the
 courts are lenient in such cases.
 Children.-The Government is a signatory of the U.N. Convention on the Rights
 of the Child and adheres to its principles. Approximately 17 percent of the national
 budget is allotted to children's human rights and welfare, including education.
 People with Disabilities.-There are no specific laws mandating accessibility for
 the disabled, but there are constitutional provisions that prohibit discrimination
 against the physically disabled in employment and education. There is no evidence
 of widespread discrimination against physically disabled individuals.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to associate freely and to
 form labor unions, and those rights are respected in practice. Although fewer than
 50 percent of workers belong to unions, the important hotel industry is heavily
 unionized. Unions are free to affiliate with international labor organizations and do
 so in practice.
 Antigua and Barbuda has two major trade unions: the Antigua Trades and
 Labour Union (ATLU) and the Antigua Workers' Union (AWU). The ATLU is associ-
 ated with the ruling ALP, while the larger and more active AWU is rather loosely
 allied with the opposition.
 The right to ptrike is recognized by the Labour Code. This right may be limited
 in a given dispute by the Court of Industrial Relations. Once either party to the dis-
 pute requests the court to mediate, there can be no strike. Because of the delays
 associated with this process, in practice labor disputes are often resolved before a
 strike is called. There were no strikes in 1993.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor organizations are free
 to organize and bargain collectively. Antiunion discrimination is prohibited by law,
 and there have been no reports of its practice. Employers found guilty of antiunion
 discrimination are not required to rehire employees fired for union activities but
 must pay full severance pay and full wages lost by the employee from the time of
 firing until the determination of employer fault. There are no areas of the country
 where union organization or collective bargaining is discouraged or impeded. There
 are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 or forced labor, and they do not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law provides a minimum
 working age of 13, which is respected in practice. Responsibility for enforcement
 rests with the Ministry of Labour, which is required by law to conduct periodic in-
 spections of workplaces. While there have been no reports of minimum age employ-
 ment violations, the political strength of the two major unions and the powerful in-
 fluence that the Government has on the private sector, combine to make the Min-
 istry of Labour very effective in enforcement in this area.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law permits a maximum 48-hour, 6-day
 workweek, but in practice the standard workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. Workers
 are guaranteed a minimum of 3 weeks of annual leave and up to 13 weeks of mater.
 nity leave. Different minimum wages for different work categories were established
 by law in 1981. The lowest minimum wage category, domestic workers, is $0.46
 (EC$1.25) per hour; the highest minimum wage category, for skilled labor, is $1.30
 (EC$3.50) per hour. Most minimum wages would not provide a decent standard of
 living for workers and their families, but in practice the great majority of workers
 earn substantially more than the minimum wage. Increases in the minimum wage
 were recommended in 1989, but there was no action to implement the recommenda-
 tion in 1993.
 There are no occupational health and safety laws or regulations. The Labour Code
 provides for inspection and safety standards approval by the Labour Commissioner.
