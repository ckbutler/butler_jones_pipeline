 GERMANY
 The unification of Germany on October 3, 1990, represents the
 beginning of a new chapter in the history of the Federal
 Republic of Germany (FRG) and the final one in the history of
 the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The Communist Government
 of the GDR, overthrown peacefully during 1989, was replaced
 first by a transitional coalition government and then by a
 parliamentary democracy based on a Western European model.
 Its 400-member Parliament (Volkskammer) was elected in the
 GDR's first democratic election on March 18, 1990. That
 parliament in turn elected a Prime Minister (Minister-
 President) and confirmed his Cabinet (Council of Ministers).
 With a GDR Government ideologically compatible with the
 coalition Government of the FRG, the two German states made
 rapid progress toward economic and political union.
 The establishment of a monetary union on July 1 united the two
 German economies, and inner-German border controls were removed
 simultaneously. Complicated negotiations following monetary
 union set guidelines for the GDR's accession to and absorption
 by the FRG under Article 23 of the FRG's Constitution. With
 the signing of the second FRG-GDR unification treaty on August
 31 and its subsequent ratification by the FRG Bundestag and
 the GDR Volkskammer (the two key parliamentary bodies of the
 German states), the internal preparations for the unification
 of Germany were virtually complete. -The suspension on
 September 12 of the rights of the four occupation powers dating
 from the end of World War II became the prelude to political
 union on October 3 under the official name of the Federal
 Republic of Germany.
 The FRG is a democratic society with a modern parliamentary
 system. National power is divided among executive,
 legislative, and judicial branches. The head of the Federal
 Government, the Chancellor, is elected by the Bundestag, the
 lower house of Parliament. The powers of the Chancellor and
 of the Parliament, which are substantial, are set down in the
 Basic Law. There is also division of governmental authority
 between national and state governments. The latter retain
 significant autonomy, especially in matters relating to law
 enforcement and the courts, culture and education, the
 environment, and social assistance.
 Organized essentially at the state level and operating under
 the direction of state governments, the police in the FRG are
 controlled by and responsive to the elected civilian Government
 and take care to respect citizens' rights. Until near the end
 of 1989, the GDR Government tightly controlled its population,
 using an efficient and pervasive security apparatus
 administered by the Interior and State Security Ministries.
 The latter, known as the "Stasi," was officially dismantled in
 late 1989 and early 1990, although problems caused by the
 Stasi connections of many political figures in the GDR and FRG
 continued to plague the newly unified Germany. Approximately
 350,000 Soviet troops are still stationed on the territory of
 the former GDR but are to be withdrawn by the end of 1994.
 The industrialized market economy of the FRG provides one of
 the highest standards of living in the world. The GDR had a
 highly industrialized, centrally planned economy in which the
 bulk of industry and agricultural.property was state owned.
 Although private property was permitted, controls were placed
 on its acquisition, inheritance, and income derived from it.

 GERMANY
 The foundation of the FRG's Basic Law, adopted in 1949, rests
 firmly on the principles of liberty, equality, and the free
 exercise of individual rights. Although the "basic rights"
 enumerated in that law are theoietically subject to limitations
 based on other duly enacted laws, in practice these human
 rights are scrupulously protected. As a result-of unification
 under the laws and Constitution of the FRG, the Germans in the
 territory of the former GDR now enjoy the same rights and
 privileges as those -in the old FRG. In general, laws in the
 former GDR that were in accordance with FRG laws continued in
 force after unification while those that contradicted FRG laws
 ceased to be effective.
 This report covers a unified Germany and will refer
 specifically to the GDR in areas where practices differed or
 relevant actions are noted for the record.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Politically motivated killing by the Government in the FRG, or
 by mainstream political organizations is unknown. Terrorist
 groups on the far left (the Red Army Faction--RAF) and the far
 right (neo-Nazi groups) as well as Middle Eastern terrorists
 continue to engage in political violence. There were no
 political or extrajudicial killings in the FRG in 1990,
 although the RAF unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate the
 FRG's Deputy Interior Minister.
 There were no reports of political or extrajudicial killing in
 the GDR in 1990.
 b. Disappearance
 Governmental or police authorities in the FRG do not abduct,
 secretly arrest, or otherwise illegally detain persons; there
 were no reports of disappearance in either the FRG or the GDR
 by political terrorist groups.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Police authorities did not physically or mentally torture
 prisoners, nor did they engage in cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment-
 The GDR Parliament on July 3 passed a new penal code,
 consistent with statutory provisions in the FRG, which was
 intended to protect prisoners' rights and to prevent abuse by
 organizations such as the Stasi (the secret police of the
 GDR). No reports of physical abuse by prison officials came
 to light in 1990.
 On September 28, in one of its final acts before German
 unification, the GDR Parliament heard a special report on
 alleged medical and ethical abuses under the Communist
 regime. The Parliament concluded that the abuses were not
 politically motivated, that one particular hospital that was
 alleged to be the site of such abuses should be closed, and
 that the unified German Parliament, which will convene on
 
 
 1158
 GERMANY
 January 14, 1991, should continue the investigation into this
 matter.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No person may be arrested except on the basis of an arrest
 warrant issued by a competent judicial authority. Any person
 detained by the police must be brought before a judge and
 charged no later than the day after the day of apprehension.
 The court must then issue an arrest warrant with stated
 reasons for detention or order the person's release.
 There is no preventive detention in the normal sense. There
 is, however, a provision that a prisoner may be held in
 custody (but no longer than 24 hours) while awaiting a formal
 charge if there is evidence that the prisoner might seek to
 flee the country to avoid prosecution. The right of free
 access to legal counsel has been restricted only in the cases
 of some terrorists who have used contacts with lawyers to
 promote and continue terrorist activity while in prison.
 Where there is an indication an attorney may be engaged in
 such activity, the attorney must be excluded from the case.
 The accused may then select a new lawyer or, if necessary, the
 court may select one for the accused. Only judges may decide
 on the validity of any deprivation of liberty. Bail bond
 exists but is seldom employed. There is no exile.
 There were allegations that detentions without warrants
 occurred in the GDR in 1990 before German unification, but
 these claims have not been accompanied by credible proof. A
 person held in detention had the right to a judicial review of
 continued detention. The Criminal Procedure Code set a limit
 of 3 months on investigative proceedings, and prosecuting
 authorities could obtain extensions of this period. In
 political cases under the Communist regime, it often took many
 weeks before interested parties were notified of an arrest.
 Laws against "anti-State agitation" and "asocial behavior"
 were apparently not enforced after the downfall of the
 Communist regime.
 Prison strikes occurred throughout the GDR in September.
 Inmates demanded a general amnesty and a review of their cases
 before unification. Although most of the prisoners remaining
 in East German jails had committed violent or other serious
 crimes, they contended that the former Communist Government's
 convictions should not stand without reexamination. GDR
 officials claimed that there were no more political prisoners
 but conceded that sentences in some cases may have been
 unreasonably harsh. On September 27, the GDR Parliament voted
 to enact a "partial amnesty," reducing the sentences of most
 prisoners by one-third. Inmates convicted of murder or other
 violent crimes, sexual offenses, war crimes, and crimes against
 humanity were not included. Persons tried before July 1 were
 granted the right to an independent review of their cases.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are public in the FRG. The Basic Law assures due
 process and prohibits double jeopardy. Defendants have access
 to counsel. The judiciary is free of government interference.
 There are no political prisoners.
 The GDR criminal code provided for access to a defense
 attorney from the beginning of the investigative proceeding.
 Since virtually all lawyers and judges working in the former
 
 
 1159
 GERMANY
 GDR in 1990 were educated and practiced under the Communist
 regime, the ability to obtain a fair trial and an acquittal in
 "political" or "security" cases was open to question.
 In the GDR, the caretaker Modrow Government in December 1989
 granted a general amnesty to all political prisoners,
 including those who had attempted to escape, those who had
 acted "in opposition to the power of the State," and all
 ordinary criminals with a term of less than 3 years left to
 serve. Life sentences in many cases were reduced to 15
 years.' Between the end of 1989 and July 1990, the prison
 population decreased from 24,170 to 4,375.
 f.- Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home is ensured by the Basic Law and
 fully respected in practice. Prior to forcible entry by
 police into a home, a warrant must be issued by a i-udge or, in
 an emergency, by a public prosecutor. Electronic surveillance
 or monitoring of mail may be undertaken only after
 authorization by a.court order.
 Following the 1989 revolution, the GDR Government halted the
 routine and comprehensive surveillance, of opposition and
 dissident elements. Several parliamentary committees were
 established in the GDR to investigate the files on 4 million
 East Germans and 2 million other persons accumulated by the
 Stasi. A number of newly prominent political figures were
 obliged to withdraw from public life following revelations
 that they had worked in some fashion for'the-Stasi. Questions
 of complicity, guilt, and innocence, as well as the right to
 privacy, are expected to- engage East Germans for many years.
 The all-German Parliament elected on December 2 will determine
 the ultimate disposition of the Stasi files.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The provisions of the Basic Law, independent media, an
 effective judiciary, and & functioning democratic political
 system combine to ensure freedom of.speech and press in-the
 FRG. Criticism of the government is unrestricted. The media
 and artistic works are not- censored; Academic freedom is
 complete. There is no censorship of foreign or domestic
 books. Newspapers and magazines are privately owned.
 In February the GDR Parldament passed a bill guaranteeing
 freedom of expiession, information, and the media.' It
 prohibited any form of media censorship, except that the media
 might not be "misused to promote war, violence, or racial,
 religious,.or ethnic hatred; or for militarist; Fascist,
 revanchist, or other antihumanist propaganda." Also banned
 were publications which might injure human dignity or
 jeopardize children and minors.
 The media in the GDR underwent massive change in 1990. No
 longer controlled and censored by the State, the GDR's 2
 national television channels, its 3 radio networks, and over
 100 daily newspapers won complete editorial freedom. Papers
 printed more advertising and had to achieve financial -
 independence to survive. Dozens of news organizations,'German
 and non-German, established offices in East Berlin.
 
 
 1160
 
 GERMANY
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of assembly and association are fully respected, as
 is the right to demonstrate. Organizers of street
 demonstrations are required to obtain police permits
 beforehand and may be asked to pay a deposit to cover the
 repair of any damage to public facilities.
 Membership in nongovernmental organizations of all types,
 including political parties, is entirely open. Parties found
 to be "fundamentally antidemocratic" may be outlawed. Under
 this constitutionally based provision, the Federal
 Constitutional Court in the 1950's declared both a neo-Nazi
 and a Communist party to be illegal. This ban is still in
 effect in the unified FRG, and there has been no movement to
 overturn the ban.
 As a direct consequence of the revolution, the GDR Parliament
 guaranteed freedom of peaceful assembly, and public protests
 and demonstrations occurred frequently. There were no
 restrictions on association. Twenty-four political parties,
 citizens' associations, and youth groups contested the March
 elections, and over 70 such groups were registered in the GDR
 by the summer of 1990.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The full practice of religion is allowed. Almost 50 different
 churches and religious denominations exist. About 85 percent
 of the population belong to the Catholic or Protestant
 churches. The Government subsidizes church-affiliated schools
 and provides religious instruction in schools and universities
 for Protestants, Catholics, and members of the Jewish
 community. Whether such public religious instruction should
 be extended to include Islam is currently under government
 consideration. The major religious groupings are active in
 public political debates. While religious affiliation
 continues to be reflected in political party preferences
 (Catholics tend to be members of the CSU or CDU; Protestants,
 of the SPD or FDP), this connection is lessening in importance
 with the current decline in church membership and generational
 change. Political parties are legally banned from refusing
 members on the basis of religion.
 In contrast to the situation under the GDR's Communist
 government, when religious activism often limited educational
 and professional opportunities, many government officials in
 the GDR in 1990 were Lutheran clergymen. The GDR Constitution
 provided for freedom of religion. The State allowed believers
 to acquire and possess religious publications. Churches were
 allowed to circulate newsletters, and there was no censorship
 of these publications in 1990. The Government rescinded a ban
 on Christian Scientists before the revolution and legalized
 the Jehovah's Witnesses in March.
 Alternative service in unarmed construction brigades in the
 GDR was always an option for people who objected to military
 service on religious grounds. Those opposed to any form of
 military service were imprisoned until 1986, when the
 Government stopped prosecuting such cases. In early 1990, a
 broader alternate civil service system was implemented which
 allowed anyone to fulfill his oblfgation with 15 months of
 social service work.
 
 
 1161
 GERMANY
 In the unified FRG, conscientious objectors whose objections
 to armed service are recognized by the Federal Government have
 the option of serving 15 months in social service work. In
 practice, this has meant 15 months of service in hospitals or
 in private homes caring for the disabled or handicapped.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 German citizens are free to move anywhere within the country
 and to leave and return at any time. Since November 9, 1989,
 this officially included Germans in the territory of the former
 GDR as well. However, in the GDR, the Berlin Wall remained a-
 real barrier for many of the GDR's foreign guest workers.
 Before July 1, Vietnamese guest workers in the GDR could not
 leave East Berlin or the GDR legally without exit permits,
 which most were unable to obtain. Workers continued to
 "escape" from (and back into) East Berlin by running through
 holes in the wall despite half-hearted attempts to stop them.
 Four:thousand Vietnamese are known to have left the GDR before
 July 1, and it is likely that the actual number is greater.
 Between January 1 and July 1, more than 238,000 East Germans
 had.registered for resettlement in the FRG. After the
 monetary union on July 1, the FRG ceased to count the East
 Germans as resettlers, considering them German citizens
 relocating within their country of residence.
 The Basic Law guarantees that ethnic Germans arriving in the
 Federal Republic from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union will
 be treated as German citizens, who may take up residence
 ,without restrictions. Continuing a trend begun in 1986, the
 number of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe coming to settle
 grew steadily, and by October 15 nearly 322,000 had registered
 to resettle. These numbers include over 122,100 from Poland,
 102,200 from the Soviet Union, and 97,100 from Romania.
 The right to asylum of politically persecuted persons is also
 guaranteed by the Basic. Law and respected in practice. By
 December 1, the total number of asylum seekers in the FRG was
 180,379. The largest groups came from Romania, Yugoslavia, and
 Turkey. Once formally granted asylum status and to a lesser
 extent while being processed, asylum seekers essentially have
 the same access to social welfare benefits as German citizens.
 Short of the right to vote, .asylum seekers also enjoy complete
 civil rights. While only about 10 percent of them are granted
 asylum, denial does not automatically result in. deportation-
 Typically 80 percent of those denied are allowed to remain in
 the country for other, humanitarian reasons. The Government
 is now considering a stricter practice in the future. Persons
 from Eastern European countries are normally allowed to remain
 whether or. not.official asylum status is granted.
 Section.3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the parliamentary democracy established by the Basic
 Law, the Federal Republic is ruled by a government chosen by
 the people through orderly elections based on universal
 suffrage. The Bundestag is elected through a mixture of
 direct constituency candidates and party lists. Members of
 the upper house of Parliament, the Bundesrat, are appointed by
 the state governments. Around 87 percent of voters normally
 participate in national elections, but lQcal contests attract
 
 
 1162
 GERMANY
 significantly lower participation. Candidates for public
 office are usually members of political parties but are not
 required to be. New political parties are free to form and
 enter the political process, but the Basic Law and the state
 constitutions stipulate that parties must achieve at least 5
 percent of the vote in order to be represented in the federal
 and state parliaments.
 Since the FRG's creation, its governments have been headed by
 one of the two major parties, the Christian Democratic Union
 (CDU) or the Social Democratic Party (SPD). The first all-
 German Bundestag elections took place on December 2. Germany
 is currently led by a coalition government composed of the
 Christian Democratic Union, together with its Bavarian sister
 party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Free
 Democratic Party (FDP). The SPD, along with the East German
 Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) and the East German
 Alliance 90 party grouping, comprise the opposition. After 7
 years in the Bundestag, the West German Green party did not
 succeed in reentering the Bundestag under the special election
 rules that governed the all-German Bundestag elections of
 December 2, 1990.
 During the GDR's final year, the Government was a parliamentary
 democracy under the leadership of a Prime Minister. The
 Volkskammer, or parliament, was elected in March by popular
 vote. Suffrage, which was universal, was also extended to
 foreigners who had lived in the GDR for at least 3 years.
 Twenty-four parties and other political groups, and 93 percent
 of the eligible voters, participated in the March elections.
 During 1990, the citizens of the GDR not only exercised their
 right to change their government but, with the decision for
 reunification with the FRG, brought about the end of their
 State as a separate entity.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Private nongovernmental human rights organizations operate
 freely. In 1990 independent human rights monitoring
 organizations also operated freely and without harassment in
 the GDR and were provided office space in buildings that once
 housed the former ruling party or its secret police. The GDR
 facilitated observation of the March parliamentary elections
 by European and other states, including an official United
 States delegation.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no discrimination in the availability of shelter,
 health care, and education to all inhabitants, regardless of
 race, religion, sex, ethnic background, political opinion, or
 citizenship. Some societal prejudice against foreign ethnic
 groups such as Turks and Gypsies does exist and is reflected
 in isolated instances of verbal harassment, rare instances of
 housing discrimination, and occasional physical harassment by
 certain elements of the population. The Turks are among the
 most established of Germany's foreign ethnic groups, and many
 Turks enjoy the right of unlimited permanent residence in the
 FRG. The Gypsies (mostly Romanian) arrived primarily after
 the Romanian revolution of 1989 in numbers that put
 significant soci4_l and economic strains on local communities
 
 
 1163
 GERMAN~Y
 in Germany's states which are charged with their care.
 Prominent figures in the FRG Government, especially Federal
 President Richard von Weizsaecker, have regularly made public
 calls for tolerance of foreign ethnic groups.
 The FRG Government has pursued a three-pronged policy with
 regard to foreign workers, who comprise some 7.85 percent of
 the work force. A national debate has been under way over
 whether the rights of guest workers should be broadened to
 permit unlimited residence and the right to vote or reduced by
 limiting the right of entry for dependent children.
 Women generally enjoy full and equal protection under the law,-
 including property and inheritance rights. Young women
 experience difficulties in gaining access to training in some
 traditionally male fields, but recent court rulings-and
 government pilot programs have helped break down some of these
 attitudinal and institutional barriers.
 Salariestfor women in the private sector tend to be lower than
 salaries for men in similar jobs. The FRG Government, through
 its Ministry for Youth, Family, Women, and Health Affairs, has
 acknowledged the existence of unequal, sex-differentiated pay
 scales in the private sector as a violation of the FRG's
 constitutional prohibition-against discrimination on the basis
 of sex, religious affiliation, or race. Several decisions by
 the FRG's national labor court in recent years have been in
 favor of women who initiated litigation to redress pay
 inequities. Movement on the issue of equal pay for equal work
 also takes place in collective bargaining between German
 unions and firms in the private sector.
 With unification, abortion became a controversial issue. GDR
 women enjoyed a legal right to an abortion without restriction
 during the first trimester, whereas abortion in the FRG'is
 permittdd only on medical grounds or in case of economic
 difficulties. .Under a compromise reached in August, the
 former GDR's abortion laws will continue to apply in East
 Germany for 2 years, a period during which theK German
 Parliament is to develop a unified national law.
 In the GDR, women received equal pay for equal work. Men and
 women were treated equally in most respects, and women's
 marridge and property rights were generous. An extensive
 social welfare system provided free medical care without
 discrimination. Although they encountered few educational or
 legal barriers, women tended to be concentrated in the lowest
 paying jobs. A comprehensive child care system made it
 possible for more than 80 percent of women of working age to
 be employed. Single mothers, who headed 50 percent of all GDR
 families, were able to bring up their children without unusual
 financial hardship.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, is not condoned
 either in law or in practice. The women's movement has urged
 public discussion of the problem and tougher penalties for
 crimes against women. According to the Interior Ministry, the
 number of rape cases officially reported in the first half of
 1990 rose by 5.4 percent over the same period of 1989. As a
 result of the extraordinary task of reorganizing GDR
 administrative structures with German unification, the FRG's
 Interior Ministry has no official figures for the number of
 rape cases for the territory of the former GDR or for the new
 FRG for the second half of 1990. The Interior Ministry will
 not have statistics on crime until 1991.
 
 
 1164
 GERMANY
 In a parliamentary speech in May 1989, the CDU Minister for
 Youth, Family, Women, and Health affairs referred to a recent
 study by the Allensbach Public Opinion Research Institute
 which said marital rape occurs in one out of every five
 marriages. Claims by some women's organizations that many
 rapes are not reported, and that rape in marriage is serious
 enough to require changes to FRG law, have so far not
 persuaded legislators to make marital rape a punishable
 offense. Annual statistics for violent crimes against women
 were not available in the GDR, but government officials
 indicate that reports of violent and sexual crimes against
 both women and children increased significantly in 1990.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right to associate freely, choose representatives,
 determine programs and policies to represent members'
 interests, and publicize views is recognized and exercised
 freely in the Federal Republic. The right to strike is
 guaranteed by law, except for civil servants and personnel in
 sensitive positions, such as members of the armed forces. The
 country has a long-established and highly organized labor
 movement, and about 40 percent of the eligible work force is
 unionized. The German Trade Union Federation (DGB) represents
 approximately 82 percent of organized workers and freely and
 actively participates in various international and European
 trade union organizations. While the two major parties are
 represented in the DGB, the unions are formally independent of
 all political parties.
 Until the fall of 1989, the GDR's Free German Trade Union
 (FDGB), an appendage of the Communist Party, consisted of 16
 unions covering all worker, employee, and professional branches
 and represented almost 10 million members, approximately 90
 percent of the work force. Although the FDGB officially
 dissolved itself on September 14, its functions were taken
 over even earlier by a variety of independent trade unions,
 most of them affiliated with West German DGB unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is guaranteed
 by law and is widely practiced. No government mechanism to
 promote voluntary worker-employer negotiations is required
 because of a well-developed system of autonomous contract
 negotiations. There is a two-tiered bargaining system,
 whereby basic wages and conditions are established at the
 industry level and then adapted to the circumstances prevailing
 in particular enterprises through local negotiations. A
 distinguishing characteristic, of FRG industrial relations is
 the legally mandated system of works councils which provide a
 permanent forum for continuing selective worker participation
 in the management of the enterprise. Workers are fully
 protected against antiunion discrimination. Germany has no
 export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is barred by the FRG Basic Law. In
 practice it was nonexistent in both the FRG and GDR in 1990.
 
 
 1165
 
 GERMANY
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Federal law generally prohibits the employment of children
 under the age of 15, with a few exceptions: children aged 13
 and 14 may do farm work for up to 3 hours per day or may
 deliver newspapers for up to 2 hours per day; children aged 3
 through 14 may take part in cultural performances under
 stringent conditions with regard to number of hours, time of
 day, and form of activity. The FRG's Federal Labor Ministry
 effectively enforces the law for the protection of child
 labor, through its Factory Inspection Bureau.
 .In the GDR, the employment of children under the age of 18 was
 regulated by the specific circumstances. In general, children
 under age 16 could not be hired as regular employees, but
 14-year-olds were permitted to work during school vacations or
 become apprentices.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Basic Law defines the FRG as a "social state." While-wages
 are determined either by collective bargaining agreements or
 individual contracts-, laws providing for national health care,
 accident insurance, and pensions cover all workers. However,
 there is no legally mandated national minimum wage in the FRG.
 Minimum wages are set by contract within each industry sector.
 At the lower end of the minimum wage scale is the*$6.20 per
 hour wage (at current exchange rates) for agricultural workers.
 Such minimum wage levels provide an adequate standard of living
 for workers and their -families. The number of hours of work
 per week is regulated by contracts which directly or indirectly
 affect 80 percent of the working population. The average
 workweek is 37.9 hours. Negotiation of a 35-hour workweek
 continues to be a major goal of FRG unions.
 Federal legislation sets occupational safety and health
 standards. For each occupation, there -is a comprehensive
 system of worker insurance carriers which enforce requirements
 for safety in the workplace. The FRG's Federal Labor Ministry
 also effectively enforces German occupational safety and health
 standards through a comprehensive network of government
 structures, including the Federal Institute for Work Safety.
 At the local level, professional and trade associations--
 self-governing public law corporations with-delegates of the
 employers and of the FRG Government--oversee the prevention of
 workplace accidents as well as worker safety.
 In the GDR, a minimum gross salary of $250 per month was
 established in 1976 and not changed. As of June 1990, however,
 the average individual gross income was $799 per month. -Until
 July 1, salaries in the GDR were paid in east marks. Although
 the official exchange rate was one east mark to one west mark,
 the actual value of the east mark was much less. Beginning on
 July 1, all salaries in the GDR were paid in west marks.
 GDR labor laws obliged enterprises to.protect their employees'
 health and safety in the workplace. While the GDR Labor Code
 regarding safety-ahd health had the appearance of being more
 modern than that of the FRG, in reality work conditions were
 often difficult, especially in mining and heavy industry. In
 1989 the GDR reported an industrial accident rate of 22.04 per
 thousand. The rate worsened in 1990, though the actual number
 of accidents declined-because fewer workers were employed.
 Safety inspections carried out by-the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Welfare in the past were takei over by the Labor Court.
