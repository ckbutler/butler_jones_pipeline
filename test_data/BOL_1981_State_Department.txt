 BOLIVIA
 Despite a wealth of natural resources, large territory,
 'and minimal population pressures, Bolivia is the poorest
 nation in South America. Deep social cleavages and
 the severe political instability that have plagued
 .the country:since its independence have contributed
 to this condition. Since-1978 the frequency of changes
 of government has increased. Between July 1978 and
 December 1981, there were three general national elections
 and nine military coups. In August 1981 army General
 Luis Garcia Meza Tejada, who had ousted the civilian
 government of interim president Lydia Gueiler on July
 17, 1980, was himself forced out of office. A junta
 of the military commanders succeeded Meza, and subsequently
 .army GeneralCelso Torrelio Villa alone took over the
 presidency on September 4, 1981.
 ..In the first part of 1981, during the Garcia Meza regime,
 repression continued at a fairly high level, albeit
 on a lower scale:than in the months immediately following
 the July 1980 coup. Since Torrelio's assumption of
 power, the human rights situation has improved, but
 some problems remain.
 A nationwide curfew, originally imposed by Garcia Meza,
 remains in force, although its duration has been progressively
 reduced, and it is now in effect only from 1:00 a.m.
 to 5:00 a.m. Press censorship has been relaxed, but
 there is a continued threat of government sanctions
 against the press. Political party and trade union
 activities remain officially "in recess," and unauthorized
 meetings are still prohibited.
 The major perpetrator of human rights violations was
 the Special Security Service (SES), which was established
 shortly after the July 1980.coup under interior minister
 Colonel Luis Arce Gomez. The service had no constitutional
 or legislative mandate for its existence. Many of
 its agents had no police training. They often were
 heavy-handed, clumsy and violent.
 In October 1981 the SES was formally dissolved and
 replaced by the Directorate of State Intelligence (DIE).
 Government sources have indicated that many lower-level
 :personnel employed by the SES were not rehired by the
 DIE. The DIE has been less active than was the SES,
 and fewer abuses by its personnel have been reported.
 .. Respect for-the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The use of torture decreased in 1981 from the high
 levels reported immediately following the July 1980
 coup and has decreased further since General Torrelio
 assumed the presidency in September 1981. Nevertheless,
 physical abuse of prisoners reportedly still occurs.
 The practice under the Garcia Meza regime, which continues
 under President Torrelio, is for detainees generally
 . to be held at the headquarters of the department of
 political order, an organization virtually absorbed
 
 (351)
 
 
 352
 by the SES (now DIE). Most abuse occurs shortly after
 arrest. Prisoners have stated that during interrogation
 they were beaten with rubber hoses around the shoulders
 and on the back. Severe bruises were the result; kidney
 injuries also were frequent. Prisoners have complained
 that they were tortured with electricity and cold water.
 There were reports that women were sometimes sexually
 abused and humiliated. The Torrelio regime is reportedly
 attempting to end such abuses.
 Torture is prohibited under the Bolivian constitution
 of 1967, which is technically still in force. It is
 difficult to determine at exactly which level torture
 has been sanctioned, but it is virtually certain that
 the interior ministry -- both under Garcia Meza and
 Torrelio -- was aware of this practice. There is no
 evidence that those responsible were punished. It
 has been a practice for church officials to be informed
 by family members soon after arrests take place and
 to be allowed by authorities to visit prisoners, thereby
 deterring abuses. However, some reports indicate such
 visits have been curtailed.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There is no pattern of summary executions in Bolivia.
 Executions are relatively rare and appear to result
 more from the abuse of individual authority than from
 official orders. On September 12, 1981, a miner from
 Oruro department was arrested and beaten to death at
 a military headquarters. On October 11 a microbus
 driver in La Paz was reportedly summarily killed by
 an SES agent after the security forces broke up a party
 after curfew. The minister of the interior said that
 the killing is being investigated, and one person involved
 has been turned over to civil authorities.
 In January 1981 the SES raided a clandestine meeting
 of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR). Nine
 senior members of the party were killed. The government
 maintained that the MIR members were armed, but other
 reliable sources reported that they were not. These
 sources stated that only two of the victims were killed
 on the spot during the raid, and that the others were
 later murdered while in SES custody. Most of the bodies
 reportedly showed signs of severe torture.
 In June 1981 the executive secretary of the Confederation
 of Peasant Workers and acting leader of the Bolivian
 Workers Central was wounded and paralyzed while trying
 to escape arrest by the SES. He was taken to its headquarters,
 where he was tortured and held for two days, before
 being transferred to a clinic. The Garcia Meza regime
 refused to give him adequate medical attention. After
 concerted appeals from several governments, including
 that of the United States, the regime finally allowed
 a doctor from Amnesty International to examine him
 and permitted him to leave Bolivia under International
 Red Cross auspices for medical treatment.
 In August 1981 a miners' leader, who had been arrested
 for alleged involvement in the dynamiting of a military
 barracks, died while in military custody. The miners
 alleged to the Catholic Church that his body showed
 signs of mistreatment. No charges were filed. His
 death provoked a strike by tin miners in two of the
 
 
 353
 14 enterprises of the government's mining corporation.
 The strike ended when the government promised to investigate
 the affair. To date no results of the investigation
 have been announced.
 Most prisons for common criminals are old and overcrowded.
 Corruption is a fact of life, with prisoners paying
 guards for outings, better cells, food and contraband
 liquor and goods. Rehabilitation programs are non-
 existent.
 c. Disappearances
 Some cases of disappearance dating from the beginning
 of the Garcia Meza regime remain unresolved. Other
 cases have been reported sporadically during the regime
 of President Torrelio. According to human rights sources,
 at any given time the list of missing people numbers
 about 20-25. It is difficult, if not impossible, however,
 to determine which of these disappearances are the
 result of detention by security forces, flight to escape
 arrest or simply family desertion. For this reason,
 not all disappearances can be characterized as politically
 motivated.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Throughout 1981 Bolivians were subject to arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment. People were arrested on accusations
 made by former friends and co-workers, sometimes themselves
 under torture. Some detainees lost their jobs as a
 result of their arrests. Arrests covered all sectors
 of society. For instance, during the Garcia Meza regime
 a 65 year old man was arrested and held for 48 hours,
 apparently solely because he was the second cousin
 of a prominent Bolivian politician in exile. In October
 1981 a prospective mother-in-law allegedly had the
 SES arrest a worker in order to forestall his marriage
 to her daughter.
 University faculty and students, journalists and workers
 are principal targets for arrest. Concrete information
 .about workers, particularly miners under detention
 in remote regions, is generally not available. In
 November a large number of. people were arrested in
 connection with a tin miners' strike in Huanuni. Besides
 the leaders of the strikes in the mines and of sympathy
 movements in other sectors, many ordinary miners, workers,
 university-students and campesinos were detained, apparently
 at random. When the strike was settled, the government
 released 59 miners; a few days later the government
 released the remaining persons from the other sectors.
 Detention on political grounds normally lasts three
 or four days, after which the person is either exiled,
 dispatched to internal exile, placed under house arrest,
 released with a requirement to register with the local
 police or simply given a warning. An exception to
 this pattern was a group of the right-wing Bolivian
 Falangistas, who attacked an Occidental Petroleum Company
 gasfield in the department of Santa Cruz in May 1981.
 They were held until July, when their leader found
 asylum in a nearby embassy.
 It is difficult to estimate the total number of people
 under detention at any given time. The government
 
 
 354
 has frequently asserted that it is not holding political
 prisoners. However, at other times, high government
 officials have acknowledged that some persons were
 being held on political grounds.  One source estimated
 that at any given time there were between 25 and 30
 political detainees in La Paz. In October 1981 the
 press reported that "almost 300" residents of La Paz
 petitioned the government to release them from the
 obligation of having to check in with the SES.
 Political detainees are routinely denied the right
 of habeas corpus, even though it is guaranteed by the
 constitution. Often they are held without being charged
 for longer than the authorized 24-hour period. Generally,
 they are not informed of the reasons for their detention,
 and in some cases they are held incommunicado.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Arrested persons are entitled by law to a fair public
 trial. However, there have been no trials of accused
 political prisoners since the July 1980 coup.  The
 criminal justice system -- based on civil or Roman
 law -- moves slowly. Some cases take years to complete
 because of antiquated procedures, shortage of qualified
 personnel etc. Defendants have the right to counsel
 and may confer with them in private.
 A narcotics law was promulgated in November 1981 to
 replace the act of June 1979. The 1979 law and a short-
 lived substitute bill violated the constitution, which
 guarantees equal treatment under the law to all persons
 regardless of origin. These laws subjected foreign
 nationals convicted of narcotics offenses to more severe
 penalties. The new law reportedly will end this discrimination.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is constitutionally protected.
 During both the Garcia Meza and Torrelio governments,
 warrantless searches have been made, although they
 have been less frequent under the Torrelio regime.
 Security forces involved in these entries reportedly
 have stolen personal property.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 There has been some loosening of restrictions on these
 rights since the resignation of General Garcia Meza,
 and during the year some excesses have been effectively
 redressed. Nevertheless, restrictions on free speech
 and assembly continue. Distributing anti-government
 pamphlets is a cause for arrest. Many radio stations
 (such as the Jesuit-run "Radio Fides") and opposition
 newspapers which were closed in 1980 remain closed
 or operate under formal or informal restrictions.
 The Catholic Church-run La Paz newspaper "Presencia"
 was shut down by the government from December 29, 1980,
 to January 7, 1981. From the July 1980 coup until
 December 10, 1981, all radio stations were required
 to broadcast only the news provided by the government's
 radio station, "Radio Illimani." Since the suspension
 ,of the national radio network in December 1981, private
 radio stations have been allowed to broadcast their
 
 
 355
 own news, but they have agreed to use the government's
 news service for 15 minutes at noon every day.
 There is no formal censorship at the present time,
 although the machinery for it still exists in the information
 ministry. However, the largely intimidated press exercises
 self-censorship. The situation has eased under the
 Torrelio government, and criticism of the government
 and of Garcia Meza has appeared in the press. Representatives
 of the Bolivian press recently denounced the government's
 restrictions before the Inter-American Press Society.
 Both local and foreign reporters have received threatening
 telephone calls.
 The balance sheet for press freedom in 1981 shows mixed
 results. On June 15 the top management of the Santa
 Cruz daily "El Mundo" was ordered by the interior minister
 to leave Bolivia within 24 hours. The Bolivian National
 Press Association succeeded in having the order reversed.
 However, when the private newsletter "Ipe" published
 in September 1981 the details of a possible purchase
 of warplanes, the Torrelio government issued a warning
 that such publications involved treason. The thfeat
 caused the newsletter's publisher to go into hiding
 for a month and to remain inconspicuous afterwards,
 although he continued to publish his newsletter. In
 October the Bolivian press reported the unmasking of
 an SES agent who infiltrated the press corps at a gathering
 in the Government Palace.
 Neither the Garcia Maze nor the Torrelio regime has
 has persecuted individuals for their religious beliefs.
 The Torrelio government has not detained any religious
 figures. However, the Garcia Meza government did arrest
 churchofficialson political grounds. For example,
 in May 1981 the pastor of a Methodist church in La
 Paz was detained briefly and beaten. The Catholic
 Church in Bolivia through the archbishop and the papal
 nuncio has sought to protect religion in general and
 to hold the government to strict account for human
 rights violations. The nunciature has offered asylum
 to people fleeing the government. The small Bolivian
 Jewish community was not abused, although there seems
 to be official tolerance of Nazi groups which sometimes
 publish anti-semitic tracts.
 Labor unions remained "in recess" in 1981. Their funds
 were frozen, and many of their leaders were in exile
 or in hiding. Some of those leaders who were living
 openly lost their jobs. On December 19, 1981, agreement
 was reached to lift the "recess" originally imposed
 by the Garcia Meza regime in 1980. Local unions will
 be reconstituted within 90 days of that date, national
 unions within 180 days and a national directorate of
 Bolivian workers will be created by December 19, 1982.
 A new labor law will be drafted. Until December 19,
 1981, strikes.were illegal, although some strikes and
 work slowdowns occurred during 1981. The most significant
 of these were the Huanuni miners' strikes in October
 and November, which.led to miner-government negotiations.
 The Catholic Church assisted as a mediator in these
 negotiations. The parties agreed that until unions
 are established, "local committees" of workers, freely
 elected, will represent workers in dealings with management.
 The agreement also called for an end to the "labor
 coordinators," who were appointed by the Garcia Meza
 
 
 356
 regime to replace the workers' elected leaders and
 who sought to remove unions from direct involvement
 in partisan politics.
 Bolivia's universities reopened in June 1981 after
 an 11-month hiatus. The government is taking steps
 to insulate the universities from national politics.
 A number of professors have been removed, and the student
 body is reportedly infiltrated by government agents.
 In September a number of students were detained for
 a few days for distributing pamphlets in the University
 of San Andres in La Paz and in workplaces around the
 city. Some of the students allegedly were arrested
 in November for pamphleteering and demonstrating in
 support of the Huanuni miners' strike.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Between September 27, 1980 and August 31, 1981, the
 Intergovernmental Committee for Migration resettled
 1,644 Bolivian polltical~refugees, mainly in Sweden,
 Mexico and Switzerland. About three-fifths of that
 number were dependents. Other sources put the total
 cumulative number of refugees and dependents at about
 5,000 during the Garcia Meza regime. The latter number
 may well include people who left Bolivia voluntarily.
 Most flights from Bolivia occurred just after Garcia
 Meza seized power, and many exiles returned after his
 resignation.
 During 1981 fewer people fled Bolivia.   In the beginning
 of 1981, the government reportly sent 15-30 people
 a week into exile. By late September, after Torrelio
 became president, that figure dropped to 5-6 people
 a week, but exiles seemed to be on the rise again in
 late 1981.
 One prominent case was that of the former executive
 secretary of the Bolivian Peasant Workers Confederation,
 who was exiled by the Torrelio government in mid-September.
 As a result of their activities in support of the Huanuni
 miners' strike, four students were exiled to Sweden
 in December. Shortly thereafter, the secretary general
 of the Colonizers of Santa Cruz was also exiled.
 The Garcia Meza regime sent some political opponents
 into internal exile. They were obliged to travel at
 their own expense to an isolated place of residence.
 Their families had to send or bring food to them.
 The detainee was required to report to the local police
 station usually daily, but sometimes as frequently
 as three times a day. Although the places of internal
 exile were near the border of Bolivia, most prisoners
 did not attempt to escape for fear that they might
 be shot in the attempt or that their families would
 suffer reprisals. One source reports that the Torrelio
 regime has sentenced at least four people to internal
 exile and remanded at least seven to house arrest.
 Persons under house arrest are required to report to
 the local police station, from once a week to three
 times a day. This requirement can cost workers their
 jobs if they take too much time off from work.
 The leaders of aborted coups were eventually allowed
 
 
 357
 -by the Garcia Meza regime to leave the country after
 finding-refuge in foreign embassies.
 Neither the Garcia Meza nor the*Torrelio government
 has either encouraged or prohibited emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Although the constitution of 1967 theoretically is
 in effect, in practice it has been superseded by military
 rule. Since the July 1980 coup, Bolivia's political
 parties have.been "in recess" as part of Garcia Meza's
 process of "national reconstruction." Many political
 leaders remain in exile.
 President TorrelLo stated upon the .inauguration of
 .his new cabi-net members in September that the process
 of judicial, administrative and'institutional reordering
 -that .would permit a "gradual and progressive opening"
 -towards democracy would last for three years. His
 foreign minister repeated-this pledge to return to
 .democratic, civilian rule in three years before the
 United Nations General Assembly.   In October President
 Torrelio announced his "three-year program" which contained
 the above objective. A plan to attain this objective
 Is reportedly being developed.
 -Generally speaking, women do not enjoy an economic
 .or-political place in Bolivian society equal to that
 -of men. zThere.are--exceptions. -The most notable recent
 example-was Lydia Gueiler, who served as interim president
 from November 1979 to July 17, 1980.
 3. Government Attitude and Record-Regarding International
 and-Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 'Violations of Human Rights
 The Garcia Meza regime was not receptive-to international
 �and-non-governmental review of human rights practices,
 but-in 1980 it extended a public invitation to the
 United Nations-Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) to visit
 Bolivia. After much delay, the Torrelio government
 permitted the UNHRC delegation to visit Bolivia in
 October .1981. The UNHRC team, during its week-long
 .visit, was able to visit prisons, receive petitions
 and observe the situation.
 An Inter-American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC) request
 for permission to-conduct an on-site investigation
 was rejected by the Garcia Meza regime. In December
 1981 the Organization of American States General Assembly
 approved a special report on Bolivia which the IAHRC
 had adopted in October. The report noted the gross
 .violations of human rights committed by-the Garcia
 Meza regime, but "trusted" .thatthe change of government
 "will signify an institutional opening" by which full
 civil and political freedom can be guaranteed.
 An International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 delegation extended protection assistance to political
 detainees from.July to mid-December 1980, when its
 mission was completed. Following a new wave of arrests
 in early 1981, in.February the ICRC regional delegate
 went to.La Paz to contact again senior authorities,
 who again permitted the ICRC to visit some places of
 detention. The regional. delegate went to 11 prisons,
 
 
 358
 four of which had not previously been visited, and
 saw 75 detained persons. In June 1981, a Red Cross
 representative obtained permission for a wounded and
 paralyzed campesino leader to obtain medical treatment
 abroad. In July, a two-person Amnesty International
 mission traveled to La Paz to intercede with Bolivian
 authorities on his behalf.
 Summaries of Amnesty International's 1981 report were
 published in the Bolivian press in December. This
 report described Amnesty's activities in calling to
 the government's attention Amnesty's concern with reports
 of disappearances, the use of torture, the killing
 of political opponents of the government and the detention
 of political prisoners.
 The Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, the country's
 principal non-governmental organization monitoring
 compliance with international conventions on human
 rights, was suppressed by the Garcia Meza regime, and
 its members were persecuted. At various times during
 1981, most notably on December 10, Human Rights Day,
 it published in the Bolivian press allegations of continuing
 abuses of civil liberties and manifestos for changes
 in the situation. The Civic Committee for Law and
 Justice is ap underground organization, largely comprised
 of church figures of different denominations, which
 monitors the human rights situation and compiles data
 on detentions and tortures. The Catholic Church itself
 also monitors this situation. Although there are agreements
 between the church and the government to allow designated
 clergy to visit detainees, the government's record
 has not always been good in complying with these agreements.
 The Intergovernmental Committee for Migration (ICM)
 maintains a permanent office in La Paz. Its representa-
 tives visit political prisoners and arrange for their
 placement and travel abroad.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Bolivian governments have not succeeded in carrying
 out, on any continuous basis, an effective program
 of balanced economic growth. Failure to capitalize
 on modest economic progress in the 1971-77 period contri-
 buted to the current economic problems, as did bad
 management and lower international prices for metals.
 Gross domestic product increases in that period were
 inflated by borrowing. Credits were advanced in expectation
 of unrealized petroleum findings and were incurred
 for essentially unrealistic, large-scale public sector
 industrial projects. Per capita GDP, estimated in
 1980 at $285 (in constant 1970 dollars) has stagnated
 since 1977. Given the economic recession evident throughout
 1981, little or no increase is expected in 1981 GDP.
 The recession was aggravated by a severe foreign exchange
 shortage that led to the imposition of exchange controls
 in July 1981.
 In 1980 debt service ratio was 27 percent of the value
 of legal exports. This heavy burden hampered the govern-
 ment's ability to implement necessary investment and
 social programs. Most bilateral and international
 lending agencies suspended assistance because of the
 uncertain political/economic situation. The ability
 of the present government to attract economic assistance
 
 
 359
 will depend largely upon its instituting appropriate
 fiscal and monetary measures, taking effective steps
 to control narcotics and improving its human rights
 performance.
 While all Bolivian governments since 1952 have professed
 strong support for promoting the livelihood and living
 standards of both the peasants and urban wage-earners,
 benefits have tended to favor the latter over the dispersed
 rural population (which still constitutes the vast
 majority), adding to an urban "pull" of growing intensity.
 Most urban wage-earners have been brought into the
 social security system, which is more appreciated for
 its medical benefits than for its very modest retirement
 or disablility payments. There is a severe shortage
 of low-cost housing units.
 Public education is free and, in urban areas, generally
 available, though subject to disruption during periods
 of governmental change or unrest. All universities,
 except the Catholic University in La Paz, belong to
 the state system. Funds spent on education and cultural
 affairs represented 27.8 percent of published central
 governmental expenditures for January-November 1980,
 as compared to the 18.5 percent published share for
 the military establishment in the same period, and
 to the 13.6 percent devoted to the service of the non-
 military public debt.
 Educational reforms and outreach begun in 1952 attempted
 to bring a basic level of literacy to most Bolivian
 youth and to integrate the Indian peoples into the
 national (or Spanish) culture. Except in the most
 isolated areas, Bolivian youth in rural areas can expect
 at least three years of schooling. Instruction at
 government schools is conducted only in Spanish. About
 66 percent of the population over 15 years of age is
 considered to be literate -- which indicates considerable
 progress since 1952.
 Wages have been frozen since July 1980. There was
 a general price rise of about 47 percent in 1980.
 The price rise in 1981 is expected to be higher than
 the 35 percent estimate made at midyear. As a result,
 the standard of living, particularly of the urban dweller,
 has suffered. Despite numerous promises over the years,
 no government has been able to extend social security
 coverage to the campesinos. An "administrative reform"
 in early 1981 transferred certain social security funds,
 formerly held by private firms for their employees,
 to the state, with the government assuming responsibility
 for medical and other services formerly provided by
 the private sector. No expansion of government medical
 facilities accompanied the shift.
 The national institute of statistics projects a 1980-
 1985 population growth rate of almost 2.8 percent annual-
 ly. The median age of the population in 1980 was estimated
 at about 18. As of July 1981, the estimated population
 reached 5,750,000. Life expectancy at birth in 1978
 was under 52 years. There is one doctor for about
 every 2,300 people. Few governmental rural health
 care delivery projects exist, and many rural clinics
 are the result of missionary efforts. Poor health
 conditions and malnutrition take a heavy toll. Intestinal
 diseases among infants and respiratory illnesses among
 
 89-510 0 - 82 - 24
 
 
 360
 miners are particularly virulent. Some 151 of every
 1,000 babies born do not live beyond the first year;
 252 per 1,000 cumulatively do not reach age five.
 The toll is hardest on rural children: 291 per 1,000
 fail to reach age five as compared to 186 per 1,000
 for urban residents, based on 1976 census data.
 Of some one million households counted in the 1976
 census, 60 percent had no piped water supply, 34 percent
 had access to potable water and only 11 percent had
 piped water within the house. The same census found
 78 percent of households without any form of sewage
 disposal. Although governments have attempted low-
 cost housing projects, the average Bolivian lives in
 rudimentary adobe quarters. The Bolivian government
 estimates the housing shortage at 113,000 housing units,
 based on the 1976 census. Only 1,000 units were constructed
 in 1978-1979, which went to public sector workers.
 Caution must be exercised in evaluating most Bolivian
 statistics outside of the financial sector.
