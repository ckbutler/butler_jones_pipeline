 LEBANON
 According to its Constitution, Lebanon is a parliamentary,
 democratic republic. General parliamentary elections have not
 been held since 1972 because of a long period of civil unrest.
 Under the Constitution and the National Pact of 1943, as
 amended according to the Taif Agreement of 1989, the President
 is a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and
 the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies a Shi'a Muslim. In June
 40 new deputies were appointed by the Cabinet to fill vacant
 seats.
 Overall, 1991 witnessed fewer incidents of violence and greater
 expansion of Lebanese central government authority over
 Lebanese territory than at any time since the civil
 disturbances began in 1975. Militias were disarmed throughout
 the greater Beirut and Mount Lebanon areas. Militias which
 cooperated, at least nominally, with the central Government's
 efforts to reassert control included the Lebanese Forces, Amal,
 the Progressive Socialist Party, Al-Waad, the Syrian Social
 Nationalist Party, and the Popular Nassirite Organization of
 Mustafa Saad.
 In July units of the Lebanese army wrested control over the
 southern towns of Sidon and Tyre from Palestinian groups after
 several days of fighting and also strengthened its presence in
 other areas of the south. Preliminary discussions began in
 August between the Government and Palestinian representatives
 on civil and social rights for Palestinians throughout Lebanon.
 Much of Lebanon, however, remains outside direct government
 control, and the presence of non-Lebanese armed forces further
 impinges on Lebanese central authority. In May Lebanon and
 Syria signed a potentially far-reaching Treaty of Brotherhood,
 Cooperation, and Coordination, called for in the Taif
 Agreement, which is to be fleshed out by a number of bilateral
 agreements. The first such agreement signed under this Treaty
 in September was a security and defense pact which establishes
 the framework for joint cooperation between Lebanese and Syrian
 armed forces. These Syrian forces, however, operate
 independently of Lebanese authorities. Syrian troops in parts
 of Beirut, north Lebanon, and the Biqa' valley numbered around
 25,000 at the end of 1991. Israel had about 1,000 troops in
 south Lebanon but maintained control in and near its
 self-proclaimed "security zone" largely through its surrogate,
 the South Lebanon Army (SLA). Israel also sent patrols across
 its border with Lebanon and undertook operations outside the
 security zone. In areas controlled by either Syria or Israel,
 soldiers from these countries and militias in the area
 sometimes carried out security and other functions normally
 reserved to a central government.
 The Hizballah militia and its allies (supported by Iran)
 refused to disarm and were responsible in the second half of
 1991 for a rising wave of operations against the SLA and the
 Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in south Lebanon, producing
 retaliatory actions.
 Lebanon's free enterprise economy, which worsened during the
 Persian Gulf conflict, struggled for revival in 1991. The
 value of the Lebanese pound stabilized against the dollar.
 Lebanese continued to use the U.S. dollar rather than the pound
 for many transactions.
 The human rights situation improved significantly in 1991 as
 the Government reasserted its control over more of Lebanese
 
 
 1486
 LEBANON
 territory and the level of violence was reduced. Nevertheless,
 neither the protections afforded by the Constitution nor
 ordinary legal norms apply in the large part of Lebanon outside
 government control, and civilians continued to be victims of
 artillery and aerial attacks, bombings, sniping, abductions,
 summary executions, and assassinations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The extension of central government authority and the
 restoration of calm throughout most of the country brought a
 sharp reduction in political killings in 1991. However, there
 were some instances of politically motivated killings by rival
 Palestinian factions, including civilians killed and wounded by
 car bombs, assassinations, and exchanges of fire between
 opposing factions; the number of such incidents was
 approximately the same in 1991 as in 1990! A number of
 political and religious figures received death threats, but
 none was carried out. Militia forces outside government
 control (see also Section l.g.) were responsible for these
 threats. President Hrawi issued statements condemning
 political killings during the year, and there were no credible
 reports of government involvement in such activities.
 During the Persian Gulf War, there were over 25 bomb attacks in
 Lebanon, most of them causing only property damage. A
 detonation at an Al-Waad office in February killed one
 individual. Two car bombings took place in March 9 days apart
 at Antelias in East Beirut and were believed to have targeted
 Defense Minister Michel Al-Murr. Eleven persons died
 immediately or due to injuries caused by the first explosion.
 An explosion in the car of Al-Waad leader Hubayqa killed his
 driver in March; it was unclear whether the car was
 transporting explosives or if the explosion represented an
 attack by another group. In May an official of the Popular
 Nasirite Organization in Sidon and his escort were
 assassinated. Several Palestinian officials were also killed
 in Sidon. A very large explosion rocked the American
 University of Beirut in November, resulting in one death.
 Investigations are under way to identify those responsible.
 The former head of the doctors' union was killed in his home in
 the East Beirut suburbs in May shortly after he criticized the
 Lebanese-Syrian draft treaty. Arrests were made and three
 persons were convicted in July. The court attributed the
 killing to criminal, not political, motives. In September
 eight people were killed in the now predominantly Druze town of
 Maasir As-Shuf by a displaced Christian whose parents had been
 killed, along with many other Christians, during
 Christian-Druze fighting in 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 Despite the improvement in the overall situation, thousands of
 Lebanon's inhabitants kidnaped during the years of civil unrest
 remained unaccounted for. Independent militias and
 non-Lebanese armed forces, rather than official Lebanese
 security services, appeared responsible for most of these
 kidnapings. Some victims are believed to have been summarily
 
 
 1487
 LEBANON
 executed. Occasional exchanges and releases occurred, but most
 of those abducted are still missing.
 Various Muslim groups continued to hold hostage foreign
 journalists, educators, and relief workers throughout 1991.
 One American and a Briton were released in August. A Frenchman
 held for 60 hours in August was released unharmed. Another
 Briton was released in September and an American in October.
 Fifty-one Lebanese held by the SLA in the Al-Khiam prison were
 released and the remains of nine Lebanese held by Israel were
 also returned in September. Fifteen Lebanese held by the SLA
 were released in October. A Briton and an American were
 released in November, and three Americans were released in
 December. The remains of two deceased Americans were dumped
 along streets in Beirut and returned to United States officials
 in December. There are no U.S. hostages still held, although
 two German hostages are still being held.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 No allegations of torture were made against Lebanese security
 services. There were occasional allegations of brutal   I
 treatment by Lebanese militias, Syrian and Israeli occupying
 forces, the SLA, Palestinian factions, and Hizballah. The
 truth of these allegations, often brought by fiercely partisan
 elements, could rarely be verified.
 Improved general security in greater Beirut and other areas was
 achieved at the cost of harassment of and extortion from some
 civilians by poorly paid Syrian troops, especially at Beirut
 International Airport and on public roads, according to
 widespread credible reports.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Lebanese law requires that a suspect'be arraigned before an
 accusation committee (a panel of three judges) and a prosecutor
 within 48 hours of arrest, but government prosecutors were said
 occasionally to hold suspects indefinitely for interrogation
 without reference to a court or judge. Every defendant has the
 right to legal counsel, and bail is permitted in most cases,
 but there is no public defender's office.
 However, if a defendant cannot afford a lawyer, and the judge
 deems one is needed, the judge requests the lawyers'
 association to appoint one to handle the case.
 In general, no militia or foreign occupying force observes the
 legal safeguards applicable to arrest cases. Persons arrested
 by these groups are frequently held incommunicado and are
 routinely denied access to the judicial system. Some militias
 periodically turn persons accused of civil crimes over to the
 legal authorities. Normally, however, the various militias
 detain-persons arbitrarily for indefinite periods, often to be
 exchanged for persons held by others.' For example, the
 Lebanese Forces and Hizballah carried out an exchange of
 prisoners in July.
 Some militias presume to enforce law and order in regions under
 their control, arresting, imprisoning, and executing persons on
 strictly criminal charges. This activity diminished in 1991
 with the spread of government control. The SLA maintains a
 detention center in the city of Al-Khiam in south Lebanon. A
 senior Israeli official said on August 17 that the SLA holds
 
 
 1488
 LEBANON
 between 250 and 300 Lebanese prisoners in Al-Khiam and a few
 score in Israel. He made clear, however, that he was referring
 only to Lebanese, and not Palestinian, prisoners. Human rights
 groups report that there are no legal procedures or due pr6cess
 guarantees for the prisoners held at Al-Khiam. Prisoners
 reportedly suffer torture and are denied contact with family
 members of with U.N. and International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) officials. Other militias hold their prisoners in
 small-numbers in different locations and have not concentrated
 them in one place as far as is known; they likewise'accorded no
 access to ICRC or other international humanitarian groups.
 Little is known about the conditions under which these groups
 held their Lebanese prisoners. Western hostages detained by
 radical Shi'ite groups were held in absolute isolation from
 outside visitors and were often kept in solitary confinement.
 Their conditions of detention were physically poor and
 psychologically debilitating. They were often kept chained for
 long periods and were sporadically beaten.
 All Lebanese officers seized following the October 13, 1990,
 operation against former LAF Commander, General Michel Aoun,
 were released by Syria in 1991.
 Although he wasnot technically exiled. from Lebanon, Aoun and
 two other officers were offered amnesty, permitting them to
 leave Lebanon safely but imposing conditions that they remain
 abroad for 5 years, during which time they cannot undertake any
 political activ'ity. General Aoun was never formally charged
 with any crime.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Lebanese law, practice, and custom provide the right to a fair
 public trial. Each confessional group has its own court for
 family and personal status cases. The military also has its
 own court-martial system. The various militia groups routinely
 imprisoned persons without due process.
 With the return of relative stability in 1991, Lebanon's
 judiciary made efforts to speed up the presentation of cases to
 the courts and to clear up the backlog that had developed
 during the war years. Many cases remain unadjudicated,
 however, due to that backlog. Trial delays result, for
 example, from the difficulty of conducting investigations when
 much of the country remains beyond effective government control
 and from a shortage of judges.
 Although the judiciary is considered independent and relatively
 impartial, and courts exist throughout the country, influential
 politicians intervened to protect supporters from detention and
 prosecution, and the Government occasionally launched
 investigations of critics of the Government or their close
 associates.
 In Auglust Parliament passed an amnesty law to provide the
 framework for pardoning many crimes committed during the civil
 unrest, as an aspect of national reconciliation. Some groups
 criticized the law, however, for amnestying the most serious
 crimes but not the more routine. Others said the law could be
 used to discriminate against one or another political group.
 It is too early to assess whether this law will be implemented
 fairly.
 Lebanese government prisons are not known to hold any political
 prisoners.

 LEBA1NON
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Lebanese authorities generally evince no interest in
 controlling personal life. Laws require that government
 prosecutors obtain the equivalent of a warrant before entering
 homes, except when the Lebanese army pursues an armed
 attacker. Rights of privacy, however, were violated frequently
 in the course of military operations mounted by the army,
 militias, and non-Lebanese forces in Lebanon and in the
 militias' administration of areas under their control.
 Accusations of violations of privacy were made occasionally in
 1991 during the Lebanese army's extension of control into areas
 long held under militia rule. The Government established an
 office to address citizen complaints and admitted on one
 occasion that government troops had exceeded legal norms.
 It is widely believed that various factions in Lebanon use
 informer networks and monitor telephones to gather intelligence
 on their adversaries.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Violations of international humanitarian standards with .respect
 to treatment of prisoners taken by nongovernmental groups
 during internal armed conflict continued during 1991.
 Prisoners seized as the result of interfactional and
 intracommunal conflict were often subjected to prolonged
 incommunicado detention and physical and psychological abuse,
 including torture. As a rule, permission for humanitarian
 organizations to visit detention facilities was denied by the
 parties responsible.
 Israeli air strikes and commando raids on alleged guerrilla and
 terrorist targets during the year, as well as fighting among
 Lebanese groups, led to some casualties among the civilian
 population of southern Lebanon, particularly in the period
 starting with the Madrid peace conference in late October.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Lebanon has a strong heritage of freedoms of opinion, speech,
 and press. Governmental authorities traditionally have
 respected the rights of those who opposed government policies
 through peaceful means. Dozens of newspapers and magazines are
 published throughout Lebanon, traditionally representing a wide
 spectrum of opinion. While the press'in Lebanon is nominally
 independent, virtually all newspapers and many magazines are
 financed by specific Lebanese and foreign groups. As a result,
 these supporters, which included Lebanese political and militia
 figures as well as foreign governments, were able to influence
 the content of the press. Direct press criticism of Syria
 virtually vanished in 1991, probably owing to self-censorship,
 although there were many editorials questioning, for example,
 the Lebanese-Syrian Treaty of Brotherhood, Cooperation, and
 Coordination. One editor who criticized Syria during the Gulf
 conflict was reportedly taken by Syrian forces to Damascus and
 told to support the Syrian position or lose his job. The
 Lebanese-Syrian security agreement signed in September
 contained a provision that has the effect of banning
 informational activity that would endanger the security of
 
 
 1490
 LEBANON
 either Syria or Lebanon. It remains unclear how this agreement
 may affect traditional press freedoms.
 Diverse political groups, particularly militias, operated a
 wide variety of radio and television stations, but the focus on
 heavily slanted propaganda diminished with the acceptance by
 most groups of the spread of government authority. In 1991 the
 Government attempted to implement strictly its requirements
 that all radio and television stations be registered. This
 effort, however, did not prevent Hizballah from launching a new
 television station without government authorization.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Lebanese are theoretically free to assemble and associate in a
 peaceful manner. Hizballah held many demonstrations and
 marches in its areas of strength throughout the year,
 unhindered by the authorities. Amal and Druze groups also held
 rallies. On the eve of Lebanese Army Day (August 1), however,
 supporters of ousted General Aoun clashed with Lebanese forces
 and Kataib (a pro-Maronite political party) supporters and with
 the authorities.
 Israel did not permit political groups that opposed the Israeli
 occupation to operate in areas under the control of the IDF or
 the SLA. The Syrians did not allow groups openly hostile to
 them to operate in areas Syria occupied.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Lebanese practice their various religions with a great degree
 of liberty. These include numerous Christian denominations,
 Muslims (Sunni, Shi'a, and others), and Druze. There is no
 state religion, nor are there restrictions on particular
 religious groups, foreign clergy, or places of worship.
 The various religious groups are free to publish religious
 material, participate in charitable activities, and provide
 religious education for their children. Many religious groups
 operate private schools. However, the intensification of
 religious sentiment has led away from confessional mixing and
 towards confessional segregation.
 Today, Lebanese live more and more in neighborhoods and
 villages inhabited exclusively by one religious community. In
 the areas controlled by extragovernmental forces, this
 exclusivity sometimes is maintained by force.
 The confessional character of the society makes conversion to
 another religion difficult, except in the case of women, who
 often adopt their husband's religion. Conversion can mean
 ostracism from family and friends and having to live among
 strangers. In small villages, local religious leaders often
 exert pressure on members of their congregation not to take
 part in the religious activities of other religious groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Lebanese traditionally have enjoyed freedom of travel, both
 domestic and foreign. The spread of government authority in
 1991 resulted in the tearing down of many barricades
 constructed during the fighting, significantly increasing the
 ability of the Lebanese to travel from one part of Lebanon to
 another. Checkpoints were maintained by Lebanese and Syrian
 
 
 1491
 LEBANON
 troops in areas under government or Syrian control. In parts
 of the south, militias maintained checkpoints. The SLA and IDF
 maintained tight restrictions on the movement of people and
 goods into and out of the "security zone" and other areas under
 their control, such as the city of Jazzin.
 Foreign travel by Lebanese citizens was not restricted by
 Lebanese- state authorities.
 There was no legal impediment to voluntary repatriation by
 Lebanese or Palestinians with valid identity papers. However,
 the government was confronted with the problem of providing
 appropriate shelter to an estimated 800,000 Lebanese displaced
 during the years of civil -unrest.
 Lebanon's relationship with the Palestinian community remained
 difficult. Lebanon does not grant citizenship to male
 Palestinians and other foreigners. Government and Palestinian
 representatives began meeting in the summer to discuss a new
 civil status for Palestinians in Lebanon, after the Prime
 Minister announced the-abolition of employment restrictions on
 them.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy in which the people
 theoretically have the right to change their government;
 however, owing to the breakdown of governmental authority
 during the past 16 years of civil strife, the people have not
 been able to exercise this right.
 According to the Constitution, direct elections must be held
 for the Parliament every 4 years. Parliament, in turn, elects
 a president every 6 years. The President and Parliament
 Speaker choose the Cabinet. Political parties may be formed.
 Since the emergence- of the post-1943 State, national policy has
 been determined largely by a. relatively restricted group of
 traditional regional and sectarian leaders. The 1943 National
 Pact essentially allocated political power on a confessional
 basis, according to the 1932 census of various religious groups
 in Lebanon. The unwritten National Pact stipulated that the
 President would be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a
 Sunni Muslim, and the Speaker of the Parliament a Shi'a
 Muslim. Seats in the Parliament were divided on a six-to-five
 ratio of Christians to Muslims. Positions in the government
 bureaucracy were allocated on a similar basis.
 Efforts to-alter or abolish the confessional system of
 allocating political power were at the center of Lebanese
 politics for more than 3 decades. Those religious groups most
 favored by the 1943 formula sought to preserve it, while those
 disadvantaged sought to revise it on the basis of new
 demographic realities or to abolish it entirely. The struggle
 gave a strongly sectarian coloration to Lebanese politics and
 to the continuing civil strife in the country.
 Under the national reconciliation agreement reached in Taif,
 Saudi Arabia, in October 1989, Members of Parliament agreed to
 alter the National Pact to create a 50-50 Christian-Muslim
 balance and reorder the powers of the different branches of
 government. Parliament elected Rene Moawad as president on
 November 5, 1989. After he was assassinated, the Parliament
 elected Elias Hrawi on November 24, 1989.
 
 
 1492
 LEBANON
 The political reforms stipulated in the Taif Agreement
 represented a dramatic political and psychological change. The
 constitutional amendments embodying these reforms, approved by
 Parliament in August 1990 and signed into law by the President
 in September, divide parliamentary seats equally between
 Christians and Muslims in an expanded 108-member Parliament.
 Forty new deputies were appointed in June to serve until
 elections can be held nationwide. One seat remains vacant
 because the occupant died after the amendments were passed.
 Many Lebanese, including many elected deputies who voted for
 the Taif provisions, objected to the appointment of deputies.
 Given improved security, they advocated holding elections
 instead so that the new members would owe their allegiance to
 the voters. The changes also transfer some powers from the
 President to the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers.
 The Lebanese political system provides for indirect election of
 a president by parliamentary deputies rather than by a popular
 vote. There have been no parliamentary elections since 1972.
 An estimated 17 Palestinian factions operate in Lebanon,
 ranging from several characterized as "Islamic" to numerous
 pro- and anti-Arafat organizations, many built around prominent
 individual leaders. Most Palestinians live in refugee camps,
 better described as neighborhoods or ghettos under the control
 of one or more of the political factions. Leaders are not
 elected, and there are no representative institutions which
 would permit popular participation in running the camps.
 Fundamental protections and freedoms expected of governments
 exist in some but not all Palestinian areas.
 There are no legal barriers to participation by women in
 politics, but for cultural reasons women are generally
 discouraged from open participation. One female deputy,
 appointed in 1991, serves in the Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government stated its support for international human
 rights and the basic international documents and declarations
 on the subject. However, the limited control exercised by the
 Government over some militias and non-Lebanese armed forces
 hindered its ability to be responsive to inquiries regarding
 human rights abuses outside areas of central government control.
 The SLA has refused requests for access by the ICRC and
 international humanitarian groups to visit the prison facility
 it maintains at Al-Khiam in south Lebanon. An Amnesty
 International representative visited Lebanon in October to
 interview ex-Al-Khiam detainees.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 .  Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on religion is built into the system of
 government. The Government has agreed in principle to
 Muslim-Christian parity in top-level positions and to the
 elimination of the use of sectarian criteria for top-level
 positions. The Government held a seminar during the summer to
 draw up an administrative reform plan; one provision aimed to
 abolish confessionalism for positions at the lower ranks. The
 Shi'a Muslim community is now the largest confessional group in
 
 
 1493
 LEBANON
 Lebanon, and the proportion of Christians in the population has
 declined significantly over the last 16 years.
 Palestinians have suffered discrimination in the area of
 employment because until the summer of 1991 the Government
 denied them work permits. The Government traditionally took
 the position that it could not open the Lebanese work force to
 outsiders because there were not enough jobs for Lebanese. The
 result was that Palestinian refugees, who were often skilled
 workers, were compelled to take menial or marginal jobs. In
 addition, Palestinians may own land only of a limited size and
 only after the approval of five district offices. Palestinian
 men face discrimination under Lebanese citizenship law: a
 Palestinian man married to a Lebanese woman cannot acquire
 citizenship ana the children are registered as Palestinians;
 but a Palestinian woman married to- a Lebanese man can acquire
 Lebanese citizenship and the children are Lebanese. This
 follows the general pattern of Lebanese citizenship law that
 only Lebanese males can transmit citizenship to their spouses
 and children.
 Lebanese women, many of whom possess advanced professional
 degrees, are able to work outside the home. Increasing numbers
 of unmarried and divorced women work out of necessity, and many
 help support children, parents, and other family members. The
 idea that women should be supported by men still prevails,
 however, and many with professional training remain home- with
 their families or until their children are grown. Women
 customarily work in agriculture as well.' Men exercise
 considerable control over women, often restricting their
 activities outside the home, such as-travel or contact with
 friends and relatives. Women may own property but may not be
 able to exercise full control over it. Violence against women
 occurs but, owing to the value attached to personal privacy An
 this traditional society, the issue is normally discussed only
 in private. Since no official statistics are produced on the
 subject, it is difficult to estimate the extent of the problem.
 Each confessional group in Lebanon has its own family and
 personal status laws administered by religious courts, and each
 religious group differs in its treatment of marriage and family
 law, and property rights. All groups, however, allow women to
 own property. Divorce is not permitted among Catholics and
 those adhering to the Catholic rite, but other Christians may
 obtain divorces. Divorce is permitted to Muslims, but Shi'a
 and Sunni practices and legal arrangements differ.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Lebanese labor law gives workers the right to organize, choose
 their own representatives, provided they are employed within
 the bargaining unit, and determine their own policies and
 programs as long as the unions do not involve themselves in
 politics. Workers enjoy the.right to strike and exercise it.
 Palestinians in Lebanon are permitted to organize their own
 labor unions. Restrictions on their right to work in the
 country, however, make this right more theoretical than real.
 In fact, few Palestinians participate actively in trade unions
 in Lebanon.
 There were strikes in 1991 by bank workers, municipal workers,
 power plant workers, and others which were resolved through
 
 
 1494
 LEBANON
 negotiations involving the Government, management, and
 workers. Lebanese university professors also struck for more
 than 5 months over demands involving academic freedom, wages,
 and benefits.
 Lebanese authorities do not control or restrict unions, but
 government employees may not organize or strike. The operation
 of trade unions was affected by the internal strife of recent
 years. There are 160 local labor unions in Lebanon; the major
 umbrella labor organization, the General Confederation of
 Lebanese Workers (CGTL), contains 18, federations of labor
 unions.. Unions are free to affiliate with international
 federations and confederations, and Lebanese unions maintain a.
 wide.variety of affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of workers to organize and to bargain collectively
 exists in law and practice in Lebanon. Most workers' groups
 engage in some form of collective bargaining with their
 employers. Stronger federations are able to obtain significant
 gains through their own collective bargaining efforts. Weaker
 unions rely heavily on the mediation of the CGTL, which
 negotiates across-the-board pay increases with private
 employers' associations. The CGTL often assists unions not
 affiliated with it in their bargaining efforts and on occasion
 has assisted nonunionized workers. There is no government
 mechanism to promote voluntary labor-management negotiations,
 and workers are not protected against antiunion
 discrimination. Lebanon has no special economic incentive or
 export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While not prohibited by law, forced labor is not practiced by
 the Government.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Lebanese law specifies the minimum age for employment of
 children as 16 years, but many younger children work in family
 businesses and, owing to the weakness of the Government, the
 law is not rigorously applied,
 f. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Ministry of Labor sets the minimum wage. In theory the
 courts could be called upon to enforce them. The minimum wage
 law is not enforced effectively in most of the private sector.
 Labor unions, however, are actively engaged in assuring the
 payment of at least minimum wages in both the public sector and
 in large-scale private sectors, such as teaching or
 transportation. The legal minimum wage does not provide a
 decent standard of living for a single individual; most workers
 and employees take on extra work and outside jobs to make ends
 meet.
 The Lebanese work a 6-day week. Labor law prescribes the
 maximum number of hours a person may work per week as 48. In
 practice, workers in the industrial sector work an average of
 35 hours a week, and workers in the other sectors of the
 economy work an average of 30 hours a week. The labor law
 includes specific occupational health and safety regulations.
 However, enforcement, which is the responsibility of the
 Ministry of Labor, is uneven due to the weakness of the central
 Government.
