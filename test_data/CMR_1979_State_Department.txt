 CAMEROON
 Cameroon has enjoyed stability and progress under the
 same responsible and moderate civilian leadership since
 1960, and has a multi-regional, poly-cultural, tri-
 religious, splintered ethnic character. This, plus its
 unique history as the only African state to fuse former
 British and French territories, has made national unity a
 principal objective of Cameroon. The former Federation of
 East and West Cameroon was made a unitary republic under
 the 1972 constitution. The Government has pursued the
 development of national institutions, such as a single
 National Political Party (UNC) and a Unified Labor Move-
 ment (UNTC). During the 1960's the Government supressed
 an ethnically based, ideologically motivated guerrilla
 challenge. In recent years, as the threat of internal
 subversion has receded, political detainees have been re-
 leased and restrictions on civil liberties have been re-
 laxed.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited in Cameroon.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Cameroonian Penal Code prohibits public servants from
 using force against any person, except under extraordinary
 circumstances (e.g., a person resisting arrest). Govern-
 ment representatives state this prohibition is strictly
 enforced and cite several examples of prison sentences
 given policemen who physically abused others. However,
 Amnesty International has reported allegations of harsh
 prison conditions and ill treatment of detainees, and
 there are continuing reports of the unnecessary use of
 force by the police, ranging in severity from bullying to
 outright brutality. Such incidents allegedly take place
 during checks for identification or other papers, appre-
 hensions of suspects or interrogations at police stations.
 The Cameroonian Government acknowledges that prison condi-
 tions are inadequate, as a result of a lack of resources
 rather than deliberate neglect. The diet and health care
 offered at the overcrowded prisons is minimal at best.
 Most prisoners supplement their diet with food brought by
 family or friends during visiting hours. Persons under
 "administrative detention" (i.e., political prisoners) are
 kept in special camps or prisons said to have more comfort-
 able, less crowded quarters and generally receive better
 treatment than other prisoners.
 There are no summary executions in Cameroon.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Suspects are commonly held in custody while their cases
 are under investigation. For example, the Douala prison
 was reported earlier to house about 1000 prisoners, of
 
 
 whom about half have been convicted while the remainder
 are awaiting trial. Cameroonian law limits preventive de-
 tention to a period of three months, but this can be ex-
 tended another three months at the discretion of the
 Minister of Territorial Administration. Habeas corpus is
 said to exist in the southwest and northwest province,
 areas which were under British control prior to independ-
 ence. It does not exist in the other five provinces of
 Cameroon, formerly controlled by France. The Government
 acknowledges holding political prisoners (figures vary be-
 tween 50 and 300) for a variety of reasons, mainly for
 having advocated or used violence. As of November 1979,
 Amnesty International reported that 200-300 political pri-
 soners remained in detention.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Cameroonian law guarantees defendants a fair public trial,
 including legal representation, at state expense if neces-
 sary. Lawyers have free private access to defendants and
 both lawyers and defendants are made fully aware of the
 charges and evidence. Courts are independent of executive
 and military control. Civilians can be tried by military
 courts if they commit a crime jointly with a soldier.
 Standards for military courts are the same as for civilian
 courts. With regard to judicial proceedings, the law does
 not distinguish between those accused of ordinary crimes
 and those accusea of political offenses. A defendant's
 social and financial standing may sometimes be more impor-
 tant than the evidence against him and tribal and family
 support may be exerted in favor of a member of the group,
 regardless of the merits of the case.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The Cameroonian Penal Code prohibits the entry into anoth-
 er's residence without permission unless such entry is
 made pursuant to a court order. In practice, there are
 occasional police sweeps of the poorer residential dis-
 tricts in searches for criminals during which indiscrim-
 inate and unauthorized entry into homes occurs.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Cameroon's economy is primarily agricultural. Cash crops,
 particularly cacao and coffee, account for aDout 55 per-
 cent of export earnings. Small rural farmers make up over
 75 percent of the population. Their land tenure is recog-
 nized as long as they continue to use the land. Much of
 the country's cacao and coffee is produced on small family
 farms. While per capita Gross Domestic Product reached
 $600 in 1978/79, distribution of income is highly skewed
 in favor of urban dwellers. Taxation falls more heavily
 on the urban high wage earner, as over 50 percent of gov-
 ernment revenues derive from customs duties, mainly on
 imports.
 Government economic policy is termed "planned liberalism,"
 which means state planning and participation, with ample
 scope for the private sector. The Government's main de-
 velopmental priority is agricultural and rural development
 
 
 30
 in order to increase small farm production, raise incomes,
 and meet the nation's food requirements from local pro-
 duction. The current development plan calls for substan-
 tial investment in agriculture, education, health and
 other social services (these Ministries are allocated near-
 ly one-third of the 1979/80 budget), as well as in trans-
 portation infrastructure (required because of the country's
 elongated and difficult topography).
 Public education is generally subsidized by the government
 through the university level, though a small fee is re-
 quired at all levels. Literacy is estimated at approxi-
 mately 44 percent (lower in the rural areas, especially the
 north), which the Government is trying to raise through a
 variety of educational programs. While shelter can be
 termed adequate according to minimum standards, the Govern-
 ment has initiated a program to deal with increasing needs,
 particularly for urban shelter. Health care is generally
 inadequate, but the Ministry of Health has begun planning
 to provide a program of national health care. To improve
 medical services, the existing health infrastructure is
 being strengthened, rural health centers are being con-
 structed, and a comprehensive program to expand training
 of paramedical personnel is planned. While corruption is
 present in Cameroon, it is not a major obstacle in meeting
 these needs.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The Cameroonian Constitution guarantees freedom of speech,
 press and religion, but in practice there are restrictions
 on these freedoms. Except for independent weeklies in
 Douala, Victoria and Bamenda, the Cameroonian press and
 radio is Government owned and controlled. Criticism of
 the Government is discouraged, and the media are used to
 support Government programs and institutions. All media
 elements are inhibited by the possibility of censorship,
 intimidation and harassment. As a result, self-censorship
 is widely practiced. On occasion, foreign magazines have
 been seized by the Government when articles have touched
 on areas considered sensitive. No newspapers have been
 closed.
 Professors and students at the University are strongly
 discouraged from writing or publishing works critical of
 the Cameroonian Government and its policies. The works of
 certain authors critical of the Government may not be im-
 ported or read in Cameroon. The Government encourages the
 expression and development of ethnic traditions within the
 framework of overall Cameroonian unity.
 Cameroon is a nation of Moslems, Christians and animists.
 Freedom of religion is protected by law and generally re-
 spected in practice. However, sects not accepting tempo-
 ral authority, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, are pro-
 scribed. Other religious groups have been arbitrarily
 denied official permission to function in Cameroon, but in
 general are permitted small private meetings as long as
 they do not disturb the peace. The practice of witchcraft
 
 
 31
 and sorcery is considered a crime under Cameroonian law
 and persons have been convicted and jailed under this
 statute.
 Freedom of association is guaranteed in principle, but in
 practice is restricted. The Cameroonian Penal Code pro-
 hibits participation in public meetings, demonstrations or
 processions without prior Government approval. Labor
 unions are incorporated into the Government-controlled sin-
 gle national party. Business groups are organized under
 the government-sponsored Chamber of Commerce. Other in-
 terest groups have not been effectively organized.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement within the country is not restricted
 by law. In practice, however, travelers are often stopped
 by the police for checks of identity, tax receipts and the
 like. These checks sometimes develop into incidents of
 petty harassment and bullying.
 Exit visas are required to leave the country. Often they
 are available only after long bureaucratic delays.  (In
 some cases, these delays may represent attempts by the
 Government to discourage or even prevent departure.)
 Women must have permission of their husbands to leave the
 country. Cameroonians leaving the country must deposit
 sums sufficient to buy a one-way return air ticket to re-
 patriate the traveler if stranded abroad.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 In practice Cameroon is a one-party state. Opposition par-
 ties are not tolerated and all political activities must
 take place under the umbrella of the Cameroon National
 Union (UNC). At the local level it is possible for almost
 any citizen to participate actively in party politics which
 often involve competition among factions representing dif-
 ferent political points of view. For the majority of the
 Cameroonians who are not party activists, however, the po-
 litical process involves little element of choice.
 In 1972, Cameroon's three labor federations were united to
 form the National Union of Cameroon Workers, an affiliate
 of the UNC. Labor unions have little political or eco-
 nomic strength because of the small size of the salaried
 work force and governmental control over union activities.
 Strikes are banned. Thirteen collective bargaining agre-
 ements are in force at present. The Government sets wages
 for these workers by decree after consultations with labor
 and management leaders.
 Women enjoy equal rights with men under the Constitution
 and are politically active in the Cameroon National Union.
 An affiliated group, the Organization of UNC Women, was
 created in 1966 to develop and implement social and educa-
 tional programs aimed at emancipating Cameroonian women.
 Women are Members of the Central Committee, comprise 10
 percent of the Deputies in the National Assembly, and hold
 memberships in the Cabinet as well as other senior posi-
 tions in the Government. Their participation and role in
 the government and society is growing.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigations of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Amnesty International regularly requests information from
 the Cameroonian Government on the status of persons alleg-
 edly detained without formal charges and without public
 trial. At first the Government recognized no obligation
 to respond to queries about specific individuals, but has
 recently stated that each such case is thoroughly inves-
 tigated. Amnesty International states that the only re-
 sponses received from the Cameroonian Government have been
 denials that the individuals in question are detained in
 Cameroon.
