 IRAQ
 Iraq is in effect a one-party state governed by the Arab
 Ba'ath Socialist Party (ABSP) through a Revolutionary Command
 Council (RCC) which has both executive and legislative
 authority under the provisional Constitution of 1968. Saddam
 Hussein holds decisive power as President of the Republic,
 Chairman of the Council, and Secretary General of the Regional
 Command of the ABSP. Two other legal parties are essentially
 support groups for the Government.
 Iraq's population comprises many disparate groups, most
 notably Shi'a and Sunni Muslim Arabs, Kurds, Turcomans, and
 various Christian sects, predominantly Assyrians and
 Chaldeans.
 Iraq's military is large and well trained, and parts of it
 have security responsibilities, notably the Fursan, or Kurdish
 tribal levies, which have responsibility for security within
 the Kurdish Autonomous Region. The national police is
 responsible for civil order. In addition, Iraq's intelligence
 services are widely feared, and have engaged in extensive
 surveillance and extralegal means to deal with antiregime
 activity, including torture and summary execution.
 The Government exerts a high level of control over the
 economy, which is dominated by the petroleum sector. The
 state owns all major industries, including petroleum and
 banking. In agriculture, tourism, the services industry, and
 light industry, the Government is engaged in a program of
 divestiture and privatization. Close government regulation of
 economic activity will be maintained, but the Government is
 trying to attract investor capital and expertise in the
 operation of the economy.
 Iraq's abysmal human rights record remained unacceptable in
 1988. Political and individual rights continued to be sharply
 limited, and the news media remained largely under government
 control and subject to censorship. In addition to repressive
 domestic controls that predate the war with Iran, tight wartime
 controls remained in effect after the cease-fire. These
 included a decree which prescribes the death penalty for anyone
 who damages the country's military, political, or economic
 position. -Wartime travel restrictions, which prevent most
 Iraqis from departing the country, also remained in force.
 Most significant in 1988 were the grave human rights violations
 that occurred when the Iraqi armed forces moved to crush a
 longstanding Kurdish rebellion after the August 20 cease-fire
 with Iran. The campaign was marked by the use of chemical
 weapons against guerrillas and civilians alike. It marked an
 intensification of the program begilp in 1987 to destroy
 villages and hamlets in Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, and to
 relocate approximately half a million Kurdish and Assyrian
 villagers to more easily controlled towns and cities. In
 addition, there are unconfirmed reports that tens of thousands
 of Kurds have been removed from their homes to camps located
 outside traditional Kurdish areas of northern Iraq.

 I RAQ
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Execution has for years been an established method for dealing
 with perceived political and military opponents of the
 Government, particularly members of the outlawed Da'wa
 Organization (an Iran-supported fundamentalist Shi'a Muslim
 group that has engaged in acts of international terrorism).
 The Government has been accused of murdering Iraqi political
 opponents in the United Kingdom and Sudan; in the case of
 Sudan, the victim was a leader of the opposition Supreme
 Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, based in Tehran
 and closely linked to the Da'wa Organization.
 The Government's intensified efforts to crush a Kurdish
 rebellion in northern Iraq resulted in approximately 8,000
 deaths, many of them civilians, according to Kurdish sources.
 The Iraqi armed forces made extensive unlawful use of chemical
 weapons against both military and civilian targets in Iran and
 Iraqi Kurdistan. In the course of a March 16 battle between
 Iraqi forces and Iranian Revolutionary Guards in and near the
 Kurdish city of Halabja in northern Iraq, an estimated 600 to
 3,000 civilians.were killed by Iraqi chemical weapons. The
 United States condemned Iraq's action as a particularly grave
 violation of the 1925 Geneva Protocol on chemical weapons, to
 which Iraq is a party, while noting that Iran also appears to
 have employed chemical weapons in the same battle. Several
 international teams, including a U.N. team and a team of
 Belgian doctors, confirmed the use of chemical weapons in this
 battle. Twice in 1988 the U.N. Security Council condemned use
 of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq War.
 With the cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq in
 August, the Iraqi armed forces launched an offensive against
 Kurdish rebel forces. Combat troops from the Iranian front
 carried the battle to villages, which they claimed rebels were
 using for sanctuary.
 On several days in August, chemical weapons were used in this
 campaign. Immediately thereafter, at least 60,000 Kurds fled
 across the border into Turkey. On September 8, the U.S.
 Department of State announced that it had conclusive evidence
 that Iraqi forces used chemical weapons unlawfully against
 Kurds and condemned its use. Since then, several groups,
 including a U.S. Senate staff delegation, Physicians for Human
 Rights, and a British laboratory that analyzed soil samples,
 confirmed Iraq's use of chemical weapons in this campaign.
 The Iraqis have denied using chemical weapons against Kurds.
 In its 1988 Report, covering 1987, Amnesty International (AI)
 noted that at least 17 Kurdish children aged 14 to 17 were
 executed in November and December 1987. AI also reported the
 poisoning of Kurdish opponents in November 1987 by security
 forces.
 b. Disappearance
 Iraqi emigrants have reported that some persons, particularly
 those detained by the security police for subversion, disappear
 following detention. Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq have
 occasionally kidnaped foreign workers and businessmen. In its
 
 
 1357
 IRAQ
 1988 Report, AI noted that the "disappearance" of large
 numbers of people continued to be widely reported, and that
 many of them were feared to have been executed.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and prescribes stiff
 punishment for it, and the Government rejects charges that it
 practices torture. Nevertheless, reliable reports make clear
 that both physical and psychological torture are used by the
 authorities, especially the security police. Given the rigid
 chain of command within the Government and security services,
 torture could not be practiced without the authorization of
 senior officials.
 According to emigre groups and former prisoners, persons
 detained by the security police for political or security-
 related matters are frequently tortured and mistreated.
 Treatment is reported to be worst immediately following arrest
 and during the period of interrogation and investigation,
 which can last for months. Torture and brutal treatment are
 not limited to political cases. Security-related offenses are
 broadly defined to include such routine criminal matters as
 currency violations.
 The security forces' methods of torture, often employed to
 extract confessions or information about the suspect and his
 colleagues, reportedly include beatings with fists and rubber
 truncheons, electrical shocks to the genitals and other parts
 of the body, and the extraction of fingernails and toenails,
 as well as psychological torture. AI has reported that over
 the years the Government had denied allegations of torture
 even when the allegations were supported by detailed medical
 evidence and that the Government had also failed to show that
 such allegations were ever investigated or that any
 perpetrators were brought to justice. In its 1988 Report, AI
 noted that the routine use of torture by the security forces
 continued to be widely reported. It said that the victims
 included political prisoners, and cited a report that the
 bodies of 29 youths--who allegedly had been tortured shortly
 before being executed without trial in January 1987--were
 returned to their families bearing marks of torture. They had
 been among 300 Kurdish children and young people arrested in
 1985.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution and legal code provide for the rights of
 citizens and place checks on police powers in such areas as
 arrest, detention, imprisonment, and search. These provisions
 are generally respected in ordinary criminal cases, but have
 little weight in political or national security cases.
 Security police not only make arbitrary arrests but also
 secretly detain suspects, whose fate sometimes becomes known
 only after they have been executed. Security charges have
 included espionage, treason, and conspiracy against Iraq,
 often in collaboration with unnamed foreign foes.
 As part of its campaign to eliminate the Kurdish rebellion and
 to clear a security zone along its northern border, the
 Government continued the policy of relocating, sometimes
 forcibly, several hundred thousand Kurds. While most were
 moved to or near Kurdish towns and cities south of the
 mountains, there are unconfirmed reports that others were
 
 
 1358
 IRAQ
 exiled to non-Kurdish parts of the country. The campaign
 involved widespread destruction of Kurdish villages, and some
 Turcoman and Christian villages near the front lines.
 In the past, Iraq has expelled to Iran large numbers of
 Iranians and Iraqis of supposed Iranian descent. These
 deportations ceased in the early 1980's; however, most of the
 few remaining Iranians have been imprisoned or live under the
 fear of deportation or incarceration. Spouses of Iraqis of
 Iranian origin are required to obtain a divorce or suffer the
 same consequences. Moreover, other Iraqis, whose grandparents
 are shown not to be of Iraqi origin, are subject to arbitrary
 detention and deportation. Assyrian religious groups in the
 United States alleged in 1987 that many Iraqi Assyrians were
 expelled to Turkey under this rule.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Iraq's legal system provides for investigation by police and
 then by an inquiry judge who may refer a case to the criminal
 court. A judge tries criminal cases; there is no jury.
 Convictions may be appealed to a court of cassation or, in the
 case of major crimes, the High Court of Appeals.
 trials of nonsecurity cases are held in civil, criminal, and
 re ligious courts and are open. Defendants are entitled to
 counsel. A lawyer is provided if a defendant cannot afford
 one. Charges and evidence are available for review.
 Appellate Courts hear cases not under the jurisdiction of the
 Revolutionary Courts. The Revolutionary Courts, which usually
 hold closed trials, deal with espionage, treason, smuggling,
 and drug trafficking. The right of defense in such courts is
 reportedly severely restricted.
 The "special courts" constituted by the RCC for specific
 incidents, such as the reported conspiracy against the regime
 in 1979, are also closed. These special tribunals are
 apparently exempt from constitutional safeguards of
 defendants' rights; defendants are held incommunicado, and
 confessions extracted by torture are used. Appeals can be
 taken only to the Chairman of the RCC. However, the practical
 availability of this appeal is open to question, since there
 are reports that executions take place shortly after trial.
 Political dissidence in Iraq is taken by the authorities to
 encompass a wide range of activities and, in an environment
 where public acknowledgment of arrest or imprisonment is rare,
 it is extremely difficult to estimate the number of political
 prisoners. In its 1988 Report, AI noted that "thousands of
 political prisoners" continued to be arbitrarily arrested and
 detained.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides protections for the inviolability of
 the home, and strong cultural values reinforce these
 protections. Police must obtain a search warrant before
 entering the home of a criminal suspect. However, warrants
 are not required for the arrest of security suspects.
 Although most arrests occur outside the home, there have been
 reports of forced entry and arrest by the security police,
 particularly of suspected members of the outlawed Da'wa
 
 
 1359
 IRAQ
 Organization. As their campaign against Kurdish rebels
 intensified, government forces conducted large-scale searches
 of homes in Kurdish towns, and arrested and relocated large
 numbers of people.
 There is no legal protection against the monitoring of
 telephones, which many Iraqis believe to be a common practice.
 All mail is believed subject to review by censors. The
 security services and the Ba'ath Party are generally assumed
 to maintain pervasive networks of informers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are not respected. The Constitution prohibits
 "any act aimed at undermining the national unity of the
 people, provoking racial, sectarian, and regional bigotry, or
 violating gains and achievements of the country," and the
 Government views political dissent as a security threat and
 strictly controls speech, all information media, and
 assembly. The Government owns and operates the press, radio,
 and television. The media do not criticize the Government,
 and news reporting is strongly biased. Opposition viewpoints
 are not heard. Few foreign periodicals reach Iraq, and
 Western newspapers are not sold. Foreign visitors' magazines,
 newspapers, cassettes, cameras, and video cassettes may be
 confiscated at the airport. To control the dissemination of
 political leaflets, typewriters and photocopying machines must
 be registered. Taking photographs of military installations,
 government buildings, or areas near sensitive locations is
 forbidden and punishable by imprisonment. Journalists and
 photographers visiting Iraq at the invitation of the
 Government are required to present film taken in Iraq for
 inspection by the authorities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are severely limited. Public meetings may only
 be organized under the auspices of the Government or the
 Ba'ath Party. Association for nonreligious purposes and
 demonstrations without government approval have met with
 severe repression. Professional organizations are subject to
 control by the Ba'ath Party Central Vocational Bureau.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Iraq is an ethnically and religiously-diverse society.
 However, many non-Muslims, principally Jews and Christians,
 left Iraq under previous regimes. Since its rise to power in
 1968, the Ba'athist Government, while carefully controlling
 religious groups, has enforced tolerance of religious
 diversity, seeking to submerge religious differences in the
 promotion of secular nationalism. A 1981 law gave the
 Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs the authority to
 promulgate laws and regulations governing places of worship,
 appointment of clergy, religious literature, and participation
 in religious councils and meetings. Muslim religious leaders
 operate under close government supervision, are considered
 government employees, and receive their salaries through the
 Government. The Government administers the principal Muslim
 shrines and mosques and has increased allotments to refurbish
 
 
 1360
 IRAQ
 and maintain them in an apparent attempt to win support from
 the devout.
 While the Government has assumed much greater authority in
 Islamic religious affairs since 1981, the law has not been
 invoked against Iraq's Christian sects. Iraq's Christians
 number more than 500,000 and constitute nearly 4 percent of
 the population. Their freedom of worship in churches of
 established denominations is legally protected, but they are
 not permitted to proselytize or to hold meetings outside
 church premises. Convents and monasteries exist, and some new
 churches have been constructed, in some cases with government
 financial support. The Jewish community is believed to have
 decreased from 150,000 following World War II to under 400.
 It was severely persecuted in the past, but there is no
 evidence of recent persecution. One synagogue in Baghdad still
 functions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iraqis are generally free to travel within the country and to
 change their residences or workplaces. However they are
 likely to be constrained by social, cultural, and religious
 traditions which define the areas occupied by the various
 ethnic and religious groups. Sensitive border and other
 security areas are off-limits. Civilian travel in the war
 zone is restricted. Curfews are in effect where Kurdish
 insurgents have been active. There are police checkpoints on
 highways and outside major towns, but most Iraqis and
 foreigners travel freely in nonrestricted areas.
 The Government's harsh campaign to suppress Kurdish rebels,
 involving mass relocations of Kurdish villagers, has nullified
 the right of hundreds of thousands of Kurds to choose their
 place of residence. An estimated 250,000 to 300,000 Kurdish
 villagers were forcibly relocated in 1988; since the
 Government began its program of forced relocation in 1987, an
 estimated 500,000 people have been uprooted. Since traditional
 Kurdish culture has been deeply embedded in the rural village,
 the forced removals and razing of villages has had a
 destructive impact on the lives of some half a million Kurds.
 All Iraqis and most foreigners who remain in the country for
 more than 2 weeks must obtain exit permission. Travel has
 been even further limited since September 1986 when severe
 restrictions on currency exchange were imposed. Because of
 the war's drain on the economy, permission to travel abroad is
 restricted to a few categories of Iraqis, including officials,
 government-approved students, and persons needing medical
 treatment. While permission for medical treatment abroad may
 be granted, permission to transfer hard currency abroad to pay
 for it usually is not. The Government seeks to limit the
 countries an Iraqi traveler may visit and, should the traveler
 visit a nonauthorized country, a small fine may be levied upon
 his return. Iraqis who have residences abroad may depart the
 country provided they originally had left before the war
 began. In general, a married woman must have the permission
 of her husband to travel abroad.
 The Government can require a prospective traveler to post a
 substantial bond to assure return. The RCC decreed in 1987
 that Iraqi students abroad who refuse to return to Iraq must
 reimburse the Government for all education received in Iraq or
 abroad at government expense. The resolution is applicable
 
 
 1361
 IRAQ
 retroactively to students who have refused to return since
 May 16, 1983, the day the Government began requiring those
 employees who left government jobs before completing the
 required 20 years of work to reimburse the State for the cost
 of their education. Amounts due can be recovered by
 confiscation; nonpayment may result in imprisonment. Each
 student must provide a guarantor before traveling abroad.
 This guarantor and the student's parents may be held liable if
 the student.fails to return.
 There is no specific ban on emigration or special restrictions
 for members of minority groups; however, emigration is
 discouraged. For the past several years, almost all of those
 given permission to emigrate have been spouses of foreign
 nationals; Prospective emigrants have had travel permission
 delayed and have been harassed. Many emigrants leave behind
 substantial property because of the difficulty of exporting
 assets. Currency exchange violations are considered national
 security offenses, and penalties can be severe.
 Alien spouses of Iraqi citizens who have resided in Iraq for
 at least 5 years are required to become naturalized or leave
 Iraq. Many people, including several Americans, have thus
 been obliged to accept Iraqi citizenship and are therefore
 subject to the present travel restrictions. In March 1984, a
 resolution by the RCC reduced the residency period before
 naturalization to 1 year for the spouses of Iraqi citizens
 employed in government offices. The Iraqi spouse faces
 penalties for noncompliance, including loss of job, a fine of
 approximately $10,000, and repayment of the costs of education.
 Iraq does not recognize the concept of dual nationality, and
 many Iraqi "dual nationals," especially the children of an
 Iraqi father and a mother of non-Iraqi birth, have been denied
 permission fo leave Iraq to visit the country of their other
 nationality.
 In recent years, the Government has instituted special
 programs to encourage the repatriation of qualified
 professionals. Aliens of Iraqi origin can apply for a
 document permitting them to enter and exit from Iraq without a
 visa. Former Iraqis can more easily obtain visitors' visas
 than can other aliens, who generally must have a sponsor.
 Other persons of Iraqi origin are permitted to return,
 including many persons who were admitted to other countries as
 refugees. A number of such people, especially Assyrian
 Christians, have returned on temporary visits. They are free
 to come and go, within the limits of the present travel
 restrictions, since they are not considered to have violated
 Iraqi laws. However, those who emigrated only after the
 beginning of the Iran-Iraq War, including several U.S.
 permanent resident aliens, have been unable to depart Iraq
 after returning. AI reports that in November 1987 the
 Government declared an amnesty 'for Iraqis living abroad who
 had been convicted or suspected of political or criminal
 offenses. It was not known whether anyone took advantage of
 it." In September the Government announced an amnesty for
 Kurds who fled the country during the August campaign.
 Approximately 1,400 returned from refugee camps in Turkey.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government in
 Iraq. The Ba'ath Party, whose limited membership is dominated
 
 
 1362
 IRAQ
 by the President and the party's Regional Command, rules
 Iraq. The party reportedly has some 1.5 million adherents,
 representing about 10 percent of the population; but only some
 50,000 "active" or full members, less than 0.33 percent of the
 population, participate influentially in party activities.
 There are two other legal political parties, both Kurdish.
 They and the Ba'ath Party constitute the Patriotic and
 Progressive National Front, essentially a vehicle of support
 for the Government. The two minor parties carry on only
 limited activity. Members of the military or security
 services may engage in political activities only within the
 Ba'ath Party. Association with the party is not required for
 appointment to senior government positions or military ranks
 or election to the National Assembly, but is normally
 necessary to attain political influence. Opposition groups,
 including various Kurdish groups and splinter parties, are
 severely repressed. The Communist Party was removed from the
 National Front and declared illegal in 1979. The Da'wa
 Organization, a violent dissident Shi'ite group, is still
 proscribed, and its members are subject to incarceration and
 execution, as are members of other parties believed to be
 cooperating with Iran. The Government announced in November
 plans to permit the legal formation of opposition parties.
 However, this development is unlikely to have a major effect
 on the nature of the regime.
 General elections were last held for the 250-seat National
 Assembly in 1984. The Government screened all the candidates
 for consonance with Ba'ath Party ideology. Though in theory
 possessing a wide range of official duties, the Assembly
 exercises little real authority. The most recent local
 elections were held in the Kurdish Autonomous Region in 1986.
 With the term of the National Assembly having expired,
 elections are scheduled for March 1, 1989.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Iraq denies charges that it violates human rights. Iraqi
 officials claim that the information on which At and other
 human rights groups base their charges comes from pro-Iranian
 and Kurdish Iraqi exile groups in London and Paris. In its
 1988 Report, At noted several instances in 1987 in which Iraqi
 authorities had commented on At reports or responded to At
 inquiries, but in each case these authorities had defended
 their actions as justifiable. Iraq refused to permit any
 independent investigation, including one under U.N. auspices,
 of charges related to the use of chemical weapons in its
 campaign to suppress Kurdish rebels. Iraq adamantly denied
 such use.
 There is no government office or official charged with
 investigating human rights and coordinating with other
 governments and international organizations on human rights.
 Iraq cooperates with the International Committee of the Red
 Cross in efforts to resettle Iranian civilian refugees in
 third countries. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) in previous years sent several representatives to Iraq
 for brief periods to register refugees and to work for
 theirresettlement. A UNHCR representative has been in Baghdad
 since April 1988.
 
 
 1363
 IRAQ
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Ba'ath Party has been committed to the equality of the
 sexes, and a series of laws since it came to power in 1968 has
 steadily improved the status of women. Such laws have
 protected women from exploitation in the workplace; granted
 subsidized maternity leave; permitted women to join the
 regular army, Popular Army, and police forces; and equalized
 women's rights on divorce, land ownership, taxation, suffrage,
 and election to the National Assembly. In the 1970's, the
 Government imposed legal penalties on families that opposed
 sending their women to literacy schools, and on men who were
 seen harassing women. However, women may still travel abroad
 only with-the permission of their husbands. School enrollment
 of females has been increasing in recent years, reaching 45
 percent in elementary schools and 36 percent in secondary
 schools in 1985-86:
 Women represent about 47 percent of agricultural workers and
 about 25 percent of the total work force. The war accelerated
 the Government's drive to elevate the status of women, and
 some Iraqis-believe it has permanently broken cultural barriers
 to the acceptance of women in traditional male roles. Women
 have become increasingly visible as architects, construction
 engineers, oil engineers, air traffic controllers, factory and
 farm managers, and Air Force pilots. Some 40,000 women were
 reportedly volunteers in the Popular Army in 1982.
 The use of minority languages is unrestricted. Kurdish, an
 official language, is used in schools and media in Kurdish
 areas. Turcomans publish in their dialect of Turkish. The
 Shi'a, who make up roughly 55 percent of the population, have
 historically been economically, politically, and socially
 disadvantaged throughout the Middle East. The Government has
 a declared policy to raise their living standards and equalize
 opportunities for their economic and professional advancement.
 For four centuries, political power in Iraq has been
 concentrated in the hands of the Sunni minority. Sunni Arabs,
 who comprise 20 to 25 percent of Iraq's population, dominate
 the RCC, the Regional Command of the Ba'ath Party, and the
 Cabinet. However, many Shi'as hold prominent positions, and
 the economic status of the Shi'a has improved. Nevertheless,
 the Government maintains a close watch against Iranian
 attempts to exploit dissatisfaction among the Iraqi Shi'a, who
 adhere to the branch of Islam prevalent in Iran.
 Although Christians sometime allege discrimination in education
 and jobs, adherence to their religion has not prevented many
 from obtaining wealth and professional advancement. The Deputy
 Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, a Chaldean Christian, has
 represented Iraq even at meetings of the foreign ministers of
 the Organization of the Islamic Conference. Other Christians
 hold important official and private positions. Citizens
 considered to be of Iranian origin carry special
 identification, and they are often precluded from desirable
 employment and their advancement may be impeded. Many
 "Iranian" families have been in Iraq for generations. Some
 say their forebears were not from Iran but claimed Iranian
 nationality to evade Ottoman military conscription.
 
 
 1364
 IRAQ
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Industrial workers do not constitute a significant part of the
 total work force, whose principal components are agricultural
 workers, shopkeepers, and government employees. Under the
 Trade Union Organization Law of June 2, 1987, a new single
 trade union structure was prescribed for organized labor.
 Workers in private and mixed enterprises and in cooperatives--
 but not public employees or workers in state enterprises--have
 the voluntary right to join a local trade union committee.
 The trade union committees form trade unions which in turn are
 part of provincial trade union federations. At the top is an
 umbrella organization, the Iraqi General Federation-of Trade
 Unions, which is organically linked to the Ba'ath Party and
 required to promote party principles and policies among union
 members. The General Federation is affiliated to the
 International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and to the
 Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions. It is
 also active in the tripartite Arab Labor Organization which is
 currently headquartered in Baghdad.
 Although workers legally have the right to strike, after
 providing notice to the Labor Ministry, no strikes have been
 reported for almost 20 years.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Even before the abolition of the Labor Federation, the right
 to bargain collectively was not recognized. Labor legislation
 and practice is uniform throughout the country. There are no
 export processing zones in Iraq.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Popular Army, the militia of the Ba'ath Party, employs
 press-gang methods to draft recruits. It sets up roadblocks
 and inducts eligible men on the spot; they are sometimes not
 allowed to contact their families for weeks afterwards.
 Popular Army personnel perform duties in rear areas, freeing
 regular army personnel for front line duty; they also perform
 many functions, such as reconstruction work, which would
 normally be done by the civilian labor force. However, on
 October 30 the Government announced that the Popular Army
 would cease recruiting drives and begin to release Popular
 Army inductees who were currently in training camps. There
 has been no evidence of recruiting into the Popular Army since
 this announcement, and measures are under way to significantly
 reduce its size.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children are frequently encouraged to work as necessary to
 support the family, a common social practice in the Middle
 East. The employment of children is forbidden in all
 enterprises other than small-scale family enterprises.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The workweek in urban areas is 6 days, 7 to 8 hours a day, for
 workers in the private sector. Hours for government employees
 are set by the head of the ministry for which the employee
 works. Many government employees routinely work longer than 8
 hours a day, some of them as much as 12 hours per day. Wages
 
 
 1365
 IRAQ
 are set by the Government for public sector workers (i.e., the
 bulk of the employed) and do not adhere to any fixed per hour
 or per day rate; salaries are generally deemed low but
 adequate. Wages in the small private sector are set by supply
 and demand. Occupational safety programs are in effect in
 state-run enterprises, and inspectors make irregular visits to
 private establishments; enforcement varies widely. A new
 government decree to extend occupational safety and health
 protection was issued and subsequently withdrawn in December
 1988, reportedly leading to the dismissal of the Labor
 Minister.
 
 
 1366
