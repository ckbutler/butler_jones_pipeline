 DOMINICA
 Independent since 1978, Dominica is a parliamentary democracy
 and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Prime Minister
 Eugenia Charles' Dominica Freedom Party, in office since 1980,
 was reelected in 1985 and again in 1990 in free and fair
 elections.
 The Defense Force was disbanded in 1981 following two violent
 coup attempts. Since then the police have been the only
 security force. The Commissioner of Police supervises the
 Special Services Unit (SSU), a small, paramilitary unit which
 was established in 1983 and which has been incorporated into
 the Regional Security System of the Eastern Caribbean States,
 and oversees a marine unit which functions as a coast guard.
 The police are controlled by and responsive to the
 democratically elected Government.
 Dominica's primarily agrarian economy is surviving on high
 earnings from banana exports to the United Kingdom under a
 generous quota, a situation which may change after the European
 Community's further integration in 1992. The Government is
 attempting to diversify agricultural production and is
 promoting exports of raw fruits, vegetables, and coconut
 products both within and outside the region. In addition,
 Dominica has begun to develop its tourist industry by
 advertising its unique natural attractions, with limited
 success to date. Dominica's mountainous terrain and periodic
 devastation by hurricanes have caused it to remain one of the
 least developed nations in the Eastern Caribbean. Several
 small industrial plants are operating, but unemployment and
 underemployment remain serious problems. Per capita gross
 domestic product at current prices was estimated at $2,102 in
 1990.
 Human rights continued to be respected in 1991, although there
 were credible allegations of prisoner mistreatment by police.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances or politically
 motivated abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture or other forms of cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, and there were
 no reports of such practices. However, in recent years there
 have been recurring credible allegations of harsh treatment by
 law enforcement officials of prisoners during incarceration.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Dominican law requires that persons arrested or detained be
 charged with a crime within 24 hours or be released from
 custody, and this is normally honored in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Dominican law provides for public trial before an independent,
 impartial court. Criminal defendants are presumed innocent
 until proven guilty; are allowed legal counsel, and have the
 right of appeal. Indigents are provided free legal counsel
 only in capital cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, and
 seizure. Search warrants are required by law. There were no
 reports in 1991 of arbitrary government intrusions into the
 private lives of individuals.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right of free expression is provided for by the
 Constitution and adhered to in practice. The political
 opposition openly criticizes the Government. Dominica's main
 radio station is state owned, and the other two stations
 confine their broadcasts to religious programming. However,
 Dominicans enjoy good access to independent news sources
 through cable television and radio reception from neighboring
 islands. The sole newspaper was founded by the Catholic
 Church. During 1990 the Church divested its interest in the
 newpaper ending an 81-year involvement as the company's
 principal shareholder. The editorial stance of the newspaper
 remains progovernment, but opposition viewpoints are
 prominently reported. Political parties publish their own
 "journals," and the opposition United Workers' Party (UWP)
 prints a weekly newsletter. In 1985 the Government
 discontinued live radio broadcasts of parliamentary sessions on
 its station and now tapes the debates for editing and later use
 on a regular program. The opposition party refused to engage
 in parliamentary debate for 18 months after live coverage
 ended, but now actively participates again. The Dominica Labor
 Party complains that the live broadcast ban, which continued in
 1991, is a form of censorship.
 b. -Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government respects the constitutionally mandated freedoms
 of association and assembly and does not hinder opposition
 groups from holding political meetings or public
 demonstrations. Such meetings and gatherings were held
 frequently throughout the year.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Roman-Catholicism is the predominant faith in Dominica, and
 there are various Protestant denominations. There are also
 small Muslim and Rastafarian communities. One Rastafarian
 spokesman complained in May that non-Dominican Rastafarians are
 banned from entering the country, contrary to the passport and
 immigration ordinance. In addition, the same spokesman charged
 
 
 569
 DOMINICA
 that authorities in Dominica cut off the "dreadlocks"
 (hairstyle) of Rastafarians sent to prison, decrying this as a
 violation of religious rights. There have been no other
 complaints of discrimination on the basis of religious faith or
 practice, and outside religious groups are not restricted in
 their activities in Dominica.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are provided for by law and respected in
 practice. The Government can revoke passports if subversion is
 suspected but has not done so in recent times.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Independent since 1978, Dominica has a much longer tradition of
 democracy and home rule. Power is exercised by a Cabinet
 appointed by the Prime Minister. Elections in 1980, 1985, and
 1990 were free and fair. The 1990 elections were contested by
 the incumbent Dominica Freedom Party, the opposition Dominica
 Labor Party (DLP), and the opposition United Workers Party
 (UWP). The Freedom Party won 11 of the 21 parliamentary seats,
 the UWP 6 and the DLP 4. In December 1990, the opposition
 tabled a vote of no confidence in Parliament, and in April 1991
 Prime Minister Charles defeated it by a one-vote margin.
 Elections are by secret ballot and are held every 5 years or
 earlier, at the discretion of the Prime Minister.
 Section 4 'Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no government restrictions on the formation of local
 human rights organizations, although no such groups exist at
 present. There were no requests for investigations of human
 rights abuses from international human rights groups during
 1991.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There are constitutional provisions, respected in practice,
 against racial or sexual discrimination in Dominica. Religious
 practice is not restricted, nor is it the basis for
 discrimination. Labor laws specify equal pay for equal work.
 According to officials of the Government's Ministry of
 Community Development, general assault against women is not
 widespread. While cases of rape and sexual assault do occur,
 both the police and the courts prosecute violators. There are
 no specific laws dealing with domestic violence, but the
 Government is aware of the problem and is investigating its
 effect on society. The Ministry of Community Development began
 a series of seminars on domestic violence in 1990, and in 1991
 the Government conducted a research project on the subject of
 violence against women, but the results had not been made
 public by year's end. Public awareness has been heightened
 concerning violence against women and children. Under the law,
 victims may report sexual and other violent abuse to the
 Welfare Department or to the police. While there is no shelter
 for battered women, the Welfare Department often provides
 assistance to victims of wife beating and child abuse by
 finding them temporary shelter, providing counseling to both
 
 
 570
 DOMINICA
 parties, or recommending police action. The Welfare Department
 reports all cases of abuse to the police. The police, however,
 are often reluctant to interfere in domestic quarrels.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the legal right to organize, to choose their
 representatives, and to strike. Only slightly over 10 percent
 of the work force is organized. Although there were virtually
 no strikes in 1991, there were occasional demonstrations by
 police and other civil servants in connection with ongoing
 salary negotiations and with the proposed Public Service Act of
 1991, which became law in November. Among other provisions,
 the bill sets a limit on the period for wage negotiations. In
 the past civil servants have traditionally received large back
 pay awards after marathon negotiations.
 There is no restriction on forming a national labor federation,
 and several of the major unions have joined together to form an
 umbrella grouping, called the "Joint Unions Steering
 Committee." All the unions are independent of the Government
 and political parties and are affiliated with various
 international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions have legally defined rights to organize workers and to
 bargain with employers. Collective bargaining is widespread in
 the nonagricultural sectors of the economy, including the
 government service, and there is also recourse to mediation and
 arbitration by the Government.
 Antiunion discrimination by employers is prohibited by law, and
 union rights are enforced by judicial and police authority.
 Enforcement mechanisms are the responsibility of the Department
 of Labor, whose inspectors operate under the supervision of the
 Labor Commissioner. However, the small Labor Inspection Office
 lacks qualified personnel to carry out its duties under
 existing labor legislation.
 Labor regulations and practice governing Dominica's three
 industrial estates (free trade zones) and its other export
 firms located outside the estates do not differ markedly from
 that prevailing in the rest of the economy. About half of the
 country's export firms have been organized by trade unions.
 However, it is not legally compulsory for employers to
 recognize legally constituted unions as bargaining agents.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited and does not exist in
 Dominica.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum legal age for employment is 15 years. In practice,
 employers generally observe this law without government
 enforcement.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages for various categories of workers are set by
 statute, and were last revised in November 1989. The minimum
 
 
 5'71
 DOMINICA
 wage rate for most categories of workers is not sufficient to
 provide a decent standard of living for a household. However,
 most workers earn more than the legislated minimum wage. The
 standard legal workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. The law
 provides for a minimum of 2 weeks' paid vacation. The
 Employment Safety Act, an occupational health and safety law,
 is considered to be consistent with international standards.
 The Advisory Committee on Safety and Health, which it
 established, however, has never met. The enforcement mechanism
 consists of inspections by the Department of Labor, which can
 and does prescribe specific compliance measures, impose fines,
 and prosecute offenders, but, in practice, inspections are
 rarely made.
