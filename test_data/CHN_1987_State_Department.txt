 CHINA
 The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rules the People's Republic
 of China (PRC). A small group of leaders in several key
 organizations, including the Politburo and its five-member
 Standing Committee, the Military Commission, and the
 Secretariat share power within the Party. Deng Xiaoping, the
 Chairman of the Party's Central Military Commission, is
 China's preeminent leader.
 Since achieving power in 1949, the CCP has continued China's
 long tradition of authoritarian rule. The CCP justifies its
 leading role by invoking Marxist-Leninist ideology. The party
 continues to place important restrictions on basic political
 rights and civil liberties such as freedom of speech, press,
 and association, although some of these controls have loosened
 in recent years. The Government does not tolerate fundamental
 criticism of the CCP or the Socialist system.
 Student demonstrations in December 1986 and January 1987
 highlighted a number of problems including the failure of
 communism to attract the allegiance of educated youth, the
 paucity of genuine communication between the CCP and the
 people, and the inability of some older leaders to cope with
 new situations. The Government reacted to student calls for
 greater democracy with the ouster of the reform-minded General
 Secretary of the CCP, Hu Yaobang, a campaign against
 "bourgeois liberalization," and the removal of a few outspoken
 liberals from the CCP. Yang Wei, a former student at the
 University of Arizona who was arrested during the
 demonstrations, was sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment in
 December.
 China remains one of the world's poorer developing countries.
 As modernization of China's economy has progressed in the
 post-Mao period, the leadership has repudiated much of the
 Soviet economic model, the basis on which it originally
 structured China's Socialist economy. Without changing the
 fundamental Socialist orientation of the economy or of the
 Government, individual and small collective enterprises have
 been allowed more leeway to operate, and many small
 state-owned enterprises and stores have been contracted out to
 individuals to manage. In addition, the rural commune system
 has been eliminated, and peasants now farm land leased from
 the Government under individually held contracts.
 The human rights situation in China in 1987 was characterized
 by some improvements, especially related to the economic
 reform program, but also by setbacks which served to clarify
 the limits to liberalization in this authoritarian society.
 The legal system, abandoned during the Cultural Revolution,
 has been resurrected and is being strengthened. During 1987
 the Government made further progress in the implementation of
 a 5-year program of legal education for everyone.
 Nonetheless, freedoms of speech, press, religion, and other
 basic human rights continue to be strictly circumscribed.
 Demonstrations in Tibet in September and October underscored
 the fact that resentment of Han Chinese economic and political
 dominance over minorities, even in their native regions, is a
 continuing problem.
 The Government maintains an extensive family planning program.
 Although official Chinese policy prohibits coercive family
 planning, in previous years, particularly before 1984, there
 were reliable reports of coercive practices at local levels.
 
 
 661
 CHINA
 More recently, government officials state that regulations
 calling for prosecution of those using coercive measures have
 been successfully implemented. A resurgence in birth rates in
 the past 2 years is evidence that'coercion may indeed have
 decreased. The Government relies more on strong economic
 pressures to encourage small families than on coercion.
 The general trend toward greater toleration of religious
 activities continued in 1987. The number of churches,
 monasteries, and mosques conducting religious services has
 increased, as has the-availability of religious training.
 However, the authorities suppress unofficial religious
 institutions and control ties to foreign religious
 organizations. In Tibet, government limits on the number of
 monks and controls on the activities of monasteries were among
 the factors which led to protests in September and October.
 The policy of.opening to the outside world and loosening
 internal controls has become an integral part of China's
 economic reform pxogram. The 13th Party Congress in October
 reiterated China's commitment to the open door and economic
 reform policies.
 RESPECT. FORHUMANRIGHTS
 Section i; Respec; for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political-Killing-
 No known-government-sanctioned politicaily motivated killings
 occurred, although there have been reports in the past of
 deaths resulting from unsanctioned actions by local officials.
 A crime suppression campaign launched in the fall of 1983
 continued in 1987,.but less intensively than in 1986. Sources
 estimate that between 7,000 and 14,000 persons were executed
 in 1983-86.
 b. -Disappearance
 There were no reports of persons being abducted or
 disappearing at the hands of the security services.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 China's code of criminal procedure specifically prohibits the
 use of torture..-However, according to official statistics, in
 the first 6 months of 1987, 65 cases of torture or physical
 punishment of criminals were reported, a 23.5 percent drop
 compared-to the same period in 1986. The Government continues
 to condemn and to publicize cases of such activity and to take
 action against the perpetrators. In December 1986, China
 signed the 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture and
 Other Cruel,,-Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment.
 To indoctrinate the public and deter crime, the authorities
 sometimes subject persons convicted of serious crimes-to
 public denunciation and humiliation at "mass sentencing
 rallies." At these rallies, often attended by thousands of
 people (including the families and neighbors of the convicted
 persons), the accused are denounced and their sentences
 revealed to the crowd. Policemen force prisoners to keep
 their heads bowed as a mark of contrition. Such "mass
 sentencing rallies" occurred in 1987. A July 1986 central
 
 
 662
 CHINA
 government order reportedly banned the practice of humiliating
 criminals by parading them through the streets. (Public
 executions should have ended with the promulgation of the Law
 of Criminal Procedure in January 1980. However, despite the
 provisions of Article 155 that "the execution of the death
 sentence should be announced, but the condemned should not be
 exposed to the public," there was at least one public
 execution in 1987.)
 There are credible reports that public security personnel
 sometimes use harsh treatment at the time of detention. For
 example, a number of reliable sources reported that People's
 Armed Police severely beat several monks who were detained
 during a demonstration in Lhasa on October 6.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Although Chinese law details a series of procedures to be
 observed in the handling of suspects, including use of arrest
 warrants and time limits for detention during investigation
 and trial, such safeguards frequently are ignored in practice.
 There have been press reports of officials being charged and
 sentenced for illegal detention of persons.' No provision
 exists for preventive detention. Other guarantees in the law
 include the right to counsel. However, a defense attorney
 does not enter a case until after the police and procurator
 have finished their investigations and have decided to
 recommend to the court that the accused be formally charged.
 Incommunicado detention of criminal suspects is a common
 practice. In 1987 the Chinese legal press argued for the
 participation of defense counsel at the investigation stage,
 but there has been no official response.
 In July 1984 the National People's Congress' (NPC) Standing
 Committee approved amendments extending the period of
 detention during investigation (after formal arrest) from 2 to
 4 months and the time limit for trials from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2
 months. In principle, these changes applied only to "serious"
 cases and required that extensions be approved by provincial
 procuratorates or courts. The NPC's action represented a
 probable reduction in the time limits earlier specified by the
 provinces. In practice, criminal cases in urban areas
 generally are processed well within the time limits. In
 remote areas, there are provisions to extend time limits if
 necessary due to poor communications. In principle, court and
 procuracy officials are to be held accountable if these time
 limits are violated. The 1984 regulations also authorized the
 use of bail for accused persons not considered "dangerous,"
 but to date no reports of its implementation are available.
 China is considering ratification of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) Convention on Forced Labor (105). China's
 longstanding practice is that "reform through labor" or
 .education through labor" entails participation in compulsory
 labor. Prison and labor reform camps are expected to be
 partially self-supporting, if not operating at a profit.
 Under "labor education" provisions, those who commit minor
 theft or fraud or who have been expelled from their work units
 may be deprived of their civil liberties and subjected to 1 to
 4 years of "reform" without trial. The program includes
 ideological indoctrination, academic instruction, vocational
 training, and compulsory labor. This nonjudicial sentencing
 procedure has been used frequently against political dissidents
 
 
 663
 CHINA
 in the past. Judgments are handed down by a Public Security
 Office in'consultation with representatives of local civil
 affairs Units.
 In addition, there are several forms of administrative
 detention. As noted in Amnesty International's 1987 report,
 "China: Torture and Ill-treatment of Prisoners," under public
 order regulations the police can detain people for a maximum
 of 15 days for minor public order offenses. This punishment
 is known as "administrative detention." Another form of
 administrative'detention imposed by the police is "shelter and
 investigation." Although the Amnesty International report
 cites 3 months as the maximum period for this type of
 detention, officials have said that there is no statutory time
 limit. Officials confirm Amnesty International's contention
 that those subject to this type of detention are people who
 commit minor offenses or whose identity, address, or
 background is unclear.
 "Reform through labor" is a court sentence imposed on those
 accused of more serious crimes than those which come under
 "education through labor" Provisions. Individuals can be
 sentenced to up to 15 years of "reform through labor."
 Offenders from prisons iii coastal areas are often transferred
 to labor camps in remote areas of Xinjiang and Qinghai
 provinces-in China's far west. Even after they complete their
 sentences, prisoners 6an be denied permission to return to
 their homes in eastern China. In what amounts to a form of
 internal exile, they can be assigned jobs and become permanent
 residents of these underpopulated regions.
 The Qinghai prisons are closed to foreigners; a U.S. Embassy
 request to visit a prison or labor camp in Qinghai in the fall
 of 1987 was denied.
 As noted in Amnesty International's 1984 report, "China:
 Violations of Human Rights," and as confirmed by Chinese'
 officials in 1987, the Law of Criminal Procedure in theory
 affords protection to Chinese citizens against arbitrary
 arrest or detention. Interrogation should take place within
 24 hours of detention, the detainee's family or work unit
 should be informed of the reasons for and the place of
 detention, and a decision as to whether to arrest the detainee
 should be made within 3 days. The detainee should be either
 formally arrested with the approval of a People's Procuratorate
 or released within 7 days after the initial detention (or a
 maximum 10 days in "special cases"). In addition, the criminal
 law strictly prohibits unlawful detention.
 In practice, however, people have been detained for long
 periods without being charged or told the reasons for their
 detention. Political dissident Yang Wei, for example, was
 held in detention for 11 months, apparently without formally
 being charged, before being brought to trial. Further, the
 provision.of the law requiring notification to families or
 work units when an individual is detained (Article 43, Law of
 Criminal Procedure) is often ignored. According to an official
 Chinese news service report quoted in Hong Kong's South China
 Morning Post, in 1986 there were 91 persons who died while
 illegally detained by public security officials. The report
 also stated that the incidence of illegal detention in 1986
 was 50 percent higher than in 1985.
 With regard to prolonged detention without trial, an
 unspecified time extension can be granted by the NPC Standing
 
 
 664
 CHINA
 Committee. U.S. Embassy requests for information about
 specific cases of alleged prolonged detention without trial
 have met with no official response.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 China's judiciary is nominally independent but in practice
 follows CCP policy. There are currently no standing special
 political or security courts.
 Most Chinese trials are essentially sentencing hearings at
 which defense representatives plead for clemency for their
 clients and, with few exceptions, do not contest their guilt.
 The trials are preceded by extensive pretrial investigation
 carried out by the Public Security Bureau and the Procurator.
 Courts assume the guilt of any person brought to trial. There
 have been instances, however, where accused persons have
 successfuly defended their innocence and been released. (This
 occurs in less than 2 percent of cases, according to one
 judge.) Defendants in criminal cases may appeal both verdicts
 and sentences to the next higher court. Appeals.have resulted
 in both stiffer and reduced sentences for the accused.
 The Criminal Procedure Code requires that all trials be held
 in public, except those involving state secrets, juveniles,
 and "personal secrets." In practice, attendance at public
 trials requires an admission ticket obtained from organizations
 selected by the authorities, and foreigners, including the
 press, are often barred. In the Yang Wei case, the tickets
 were reportedly limited to cadres and university
 administrators, rather than students or other colleagues.
 Yang's parents were allowed to attend the trial, but foreign
 observers were prohibited.
 No reliable figures exist for the number of political
 prisoners in China. Insufficient data make an accurate
 estimate impossible. The Government denies that it has any
 political prisoners and insists that it imprisons only
 criminals and "counterrevolutionaries." The latter group
 includes some who had no clear political motive in breaking
 the law, but whose offenses (such as jailbreak) the
 authorities nonetheless classified as "counterrevolutionary."
 Counterrevolutionary offenses are said to constitute about 1
 to 3 percent of the number of criminal offenses. Overall, the
 number of such prisoners has probably dropped since the late
 197Q's through natural attrition and the reversal of verdicts
 on hundreds of thousands of persons sentenced as
 "counterrevolutionaries" during the Cultural Revolution. In
 1986 cases of persons accused of being counterrevolutionaries
 or having committed crimes of a political nature before the
 Cultural Revolution were being reviewed. This reevaluation
 was scheduled to be completed before the fall of 1987, but
 there are as yet no statistics available on the progress of
 this inquiry, even though individual cases have been
 publicized.
 The total inmate population in labor camps and prisons may
 have increased since the advent of the 1983 anticrime campaign,
 given a report that by the end of 1986 over 1 million people
 had been sentenced as a result of the crackdown. Partial
 figures obtained in 1986 suggest a total prison/labor camp
 population of between 2 and 5 million, although, as the wide
 range of this estimate indicates, an accurate figure of the
 inmate population is unavailable.
 
 
 665
 CHINA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Individual and family life are extensively regulated in
 China. For most Chinese (particularly the 20 percent of the
 population who are urban residents), life revolves around the
 work unit, which-not only provides employment, but also often
 controls housing, ration coupons, permission to marry and have
 a child, and other aspects of ordinary life. The work unit,
 along with personnel in neighborhood committees, monitors a
 person's attitude and behavior And may report suspicious
 activity to the authorities. The unit-acts as the Party's
 enforcer at the local level, butits considerable autonomy may
 also bp used to ignore or obstruct directives from the top.
 Recent economic reforms and a central policy of relaxing social
 controls have weakened the unit's interference in many aspects
 of daily life, however. In rural areas, where political
 control has always been more lax, the shift to family farming
 from collective farming, for example, has markedly decreased
 opportunities for arbitrary interference in personal lives by
 local officials.
 The effect of the economic reforms and the central policy of
 relaxing social controls in the rural areas has influenced the
 implementation of the birth-planning policy. In February the
 State Statistical Bureau published the results of a population
 sampling which indicated that 3.12 million more babies were
 born in 1986 than in 1985, 1.6 million more'than the number
 planned for 1986. The increase was attributed to the rise in
 the number of multiple births and to the increased number of
 people of marriageable and childbearing age. According to the
 survey, in 1986 the crude birth rate rose to 20.7 per thousand
 compared to 17.8 per thousand in 1985. There was a slight
 decrease in the rate of abortions. The number of first births
 in 1986 was 51.2 percent of the total, second births were 31.5
 percent of the total, and third or more were 17.3 percent.
 Only 15 percent of all couples of childbearing age have signed
 a one-child pledge.
 After years of resisting the view held widely outside China
 that the PRC had to take steps to limit the growth of its
 population, now at 1.08 billion, the post-Mao reform
 leadership decided to institute family planning programs.
 During 1986-1987, China's leaders reiterated that family
 planning is a top national priority and expressed concern that
 the Government's policy has not been uniformly implemented in
 the past 12 months. The Government cited particular concern
 over the current unusually high number of females of
 childbearing age, increasing birth rates, and recent medical
 advances leading to longer life expectancies as reasons for
 renewed efforts to achieve its goal of limiting China's
 population to around 1.2 billion in the year 2000. Early in
 1986, authorities began a massive campaign to extend
 education, contraceptive counseling, free contraceptive
 devices, and economic and social incentives down to the
 grassroots level.
 The authorities have instituted various controls on marriage
 and childbearing. The minimum age for marriage is 22 for men
 and 20 for women, high by world standards but lower than
 previous CCP requirements. Special provisions enacted by
 local people's congresses govern family planning policy for
 minorities (e.g., the minimum age for marriage for most
 minorities is 20 for men and 18 for women). Each province
 sets guidelines (based on central government directions) for
 
 
 666
 CHINA
 the desired number of children to be born during the year.
 Increasingly, grounds for waiving the one-child rule have been
 expanded by provincial authorities, ranging from the birth of
 a handicapped baby and employment in particularly hazardous or
 undesirable occupations to the birth of a girl as the first
 born in some rural areas. In border regions and minority
 areas, where population densities are low, governmental
 control weak, and traditional attitudes strong, population
 growth guidelines are looser, allowing a second and sometimes
 a third child per family. Throughout the country, provinces
 are allowed to make their own regulations regarding
 implementation of the one-child policy as long as overall
 birth rates match the state-imposed goals.
 In general, minorities in nomadic herding areas are encouraged
 to limit their families to two children. This encouragement
 consists of verbal persuasion; no bonuses or other incentive
 measures are used. Minorities in agricultural areas are
 encouraged to limit themselves to one child and are allowed
 two (Han in these remote agricultural areas are also allowed
 two children). These regulations seem to hold for all the
 remote minority areas in the west and Tibet. In practice, the
 policy of relying on encouragement seems to be ineffective, as
 large families appear to be the norm among minorities in
 Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Gansu.
 In Han Chinese areas, particularly in urban locations, central
 guidelines appear to have been followed more vigorously.
 Couples who sign a pledge to have only one child receive a
 number of incentives: free health care for the child, a 5
 percent increase in their pensions, priority in housing,
 schooling, and medical treatment, and a monthly bonus of about
 $2. Couples who insist on having a second child have the
 right to do so in principle. However, in addition to losing
 their monthly bonuses, they may be required to repay money
 already received and, in some instances, give up or return
 other benefits as well. Economic pressure on families with
 more than two children can be severe, and can include loss of
 Communist party membership, loss of job, difficulty in
 purchasing state-supplied seed, fertilizer, and fuel, and
 other sanctions. The rise in rural incomes accompanying
 economic reforms has, however, reduced peasant responsiveness
 to economic sanctions. Moreover, employment in small
 collective or individual enterprises has further weakened the
 ability of agencies to enforce regulations. Local and central
 officials state that no permission is necessary for the first
 child.
 In the past, contrary to announced central government policy,
 local officials coerced significant numbers of women who became
 pregnant without permission into having abortions. In 1987
 the Government stressed repeatedly that it does not condone
 forced abortions or sterilizations. Chinese authorities have
 said that they take measures against local officials who
 violate the Government's policy in this regard. During 1986
 there was an unconfirmed report from the Wuhan area that
 couples with more than two children were being evicted from
 their homes. Allegations of such forceful measures were rare
 in 1986 and 1987. However, despite central government efforts
 to prevent the imposition of rigid quotas, local government
 officials and peers reportedly continue to exert pressure on
 some persons seeking to have second children. This peer
 pressure reportedly is often persuasive. Infanticide is
 illegal, and the press has published cases of persons punished
 
 
 667
 CHINA
 for this crime. No new cases of infanticide were reported in
 1987.
 Contacts between Chinese and foreigners have increased
 considerably in recent years. Whereas Chinese citizens whose
 work did not require or permit contact with foreigners have in
 the past been warned or detained and questioned if they
 persisted in meeting foreign acquaintances, such instances
 appear to be rare today. Chinese seem anxious to strike up
 conversations with foreigners and often volunteer unorthodox
 political views. "English corners," where Chinese and
 foreigners can meet to talk in English, attract large numbers
 of people. The authorities in principle permit marriages
 between foreigners and Chinese, but specifically prohibit
 Chinese citizens involved in confidential and other "important"
 work (e.g., diplomats and military personnel), as well as
 those serving prison sentences, from marrying foreigners.
 Sexual relationships between Chinese citizens and foreigners
 are strongly discouraged. The authorities have detained,
 interrogated, and fined foreigners for engaging in such
 activities. The Government reportedly sent Chinese
 participants to "reform through education" in some areas.
 The Criminal Procedure Code requires the use of search
 warrants for gathering evidence, and they have been presented
 in cases involving foreigners. No reliable information exists
 as to how strictly this provision is implemented among the
 general population. The Criminal Procedure Law allows the
 authorities wide latitude. If an "emergency situation"
 develops when the authorities are carrying out arrest or
 detention, they have the right to enter and search living
 premises without warrants or notification. Several years ago,
 there were credible reports of the use of electronic
 eavesdropping equipment to monitor suspected political
 dissidents. There is no evidence to suggest that the
 authorities have ceased using such measures.
 In December 1986, the NPC passed China's first Postal Service
 Law guaranteeing privacy in written communication and
 prohibiting tampering with mail except as permitted by law
 (i.e., as noted in Section 5, Article 86 of the Criminal
 Procedure Law, investigative personnel of the public security
 organs or the Procuracy are empowered to authorize the seizure
 of mail or telegrams).
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 of the press, authorities do not permit open criticism of the
 CCP or Chinese socialism. In general, restrictions on freedom
 of speech and of the press have relaxed in recent years,
 particularly since the Fourth National Writers' Conference of
 December 1984. Degrees of government control vary from
 absolute in the case of party organs such as the People's
 Daily, to loose for publications dealing with apolitical
 topics.
 The Government in 1986 appointed a new Minister of Culture
 known for his outspoken views in defense of freedom of
 expression. In 1986 he publicly defended the more liberal
 line calling for greater public debate. However, in January
 1987 the Minister joined other authorities in calling for
 
 
 668
 CHINA
 opposition to "bourgeois liberalization." This campaign
 followed student demonstrations calling for political reform
 and democratization and subsequent government actions which
 included the purge 6f prominent intellectuals from the party.
 An ideological chill, which limited freedom of expression in
 cultural and intellectual circles, was evident through the
 winter and part of the spring of 1987. Also during the spring
 a crackdown on "illegal publications," ostensibly aimed at
 pornography, began and quickly accelerated. A variety of
 cultural events were reportedly prevented from opening on
 orders from public security officials.
 Despite continued affirmation by some officials that the
 struggle against "bourgeois liberalization" is a long one,
 Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang affirmed in mid-May that
 "the corner has been turned on antibourgeois liberalization"
 and that the Government should focus on economic and political
 reform from that point on. Even though the Party took
 disciplinary action against five intellectuals in August, the
 atmosphere prior to and during the 13th Party Congress in
 October indicated a more relaxed political environment with
 regard to freedom of speech and the press. Zhao Ziyang, in
 his opening speech to the Congress, said that the Government
 should "put an end to abuses of rights and freedoms" and enact
 laws governing the press, publications, association, and
 assembly. He encouraged intellectuals to open new paths in
 practical work and to adhere to the policy of letting "a
 hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought
 contend" in theoretical work. This slogan provides an
 ideological underpinning for limited expression of differing
 opinions, while also serving to remind intellectuals of the
 pitfalls of taking criticism beyond permissible bounds. Signs
 in late 1987 suggest a resumption of the trend toward the
 limited cultural liberalization that was interrupted in early
 1987.
 The leadership has permitted greater, albeit still limited,
 access to various aspects of foreign culture. Foreign books
 and artistic works are still screened by authorities, but more
 are available now than in past years. Foreign films are shown
 more frequently, and visits by foreign artistic groups are
 more common. Selected BBC international news clips are
 included in the television evening news broadcasts. Selected
 subscribers in universities and other institutions receive
 foreign periodicals. Tens of millions of Chinese read "The
 Reference News," an offically published but privately
 circulated selection of largely uncensored translations from
 the foreign press. Coverage of foreign news in the open media
 has become more extensive and professional. Chinese listen
 freely to foreign broadcasts, and many universities use the
 Voice of America and other foreign radio broadcasts in their
 language courses. In its weekly programming, Chinese
 television includes some programs from Western and other
 countries.
 Recent government action with regard to foreign press activity
 in China has been contradictory. The authorities agreed to
 extensive coverage of China's domestic scene when NBC
 television broadcast its "Today" and "Nightly News"
 programming from Beijing for a week in September. In
 addition, the 13th Party Congress was the first to be open to
 foreign journalists and to permit live coverage on Chinese
 television. However, after initially allowing foreign
 journalists into Tibet to cover the demonstrations in Lhasa in
 September and October, the Government ordered them out on the
 
 
 669
 CHINA
 basis of a reinterpretation of existing foreign press
 regulations. This reinforced an atmosphere of concern among
 foreign journalists following the 1987 expulsions of Agence
 France Presse reporter Lawrence Macdonald and a Kyodo
 correspondent, and the 1986 expulsion of New York Times
 reporter John Burns.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of peaceful assembly and
 association; in practice, however, the authorities
 circumscribe these rights. In December 1986, the Beijing
 municipal government enacted new regulations circumscribing
 residents' rights to participate in marches and demonstrations
 by requiring application in advance and proscribing certain
 areas.
 China has .a wide variety and increasing number of professional
 and other mass associations, such as the All-China Youth
 Federation, the All-China Women's Federation, the Chinese
 Writers' Association, and the All-China Sports Federation.
 These groups operate under party control. The authorities
 attempt to suppress or coopt groups which attempt to function
 independently.
 China's trade unions are closely controlled by the CCP. The
 All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) is now drafting a
 new trade union law which reportedly will redefine the role of
 trade unions in China. In the workplace, virtually all
 state-sector Chinese workers--and about 75 percent of all
 urban sector workers--belong to branches of the ACFTU.
 Although not formally compulsory, membership in ACFTU is an
 expected part of life in the institution to which a worker is
 assigned. The ACFTU's primary function is to serve the
 State's interest by.promoting labor discipline, enhancing
 labor productivity, conducting political and ideological
 indoctrination, and improving workers' educational and
 technical skills. Unions also perform a variety of social and
 welfare functions such as. handling pensions and disability
 benefits, and operating clubs, eating facilities, nurseries,
 schools, and sanatoriums. While China remains unwilling to
 permit collective bargaining, it instituted in late 1986 a
 nationwide reform measure aimed at permitting workers to
 negotiate individually for salaries. Under the new labor
 contract system, which now covers about 6 million recently
 hired workers and will cover all new entrants into state-
 sector enterprises, a new employee can negotiate some terms,
 particularly the term of employment. In practice, it is
 mostly university graduates who are able to choose from among
 several offers and to negotiate on salary and fringe benefits.
 Chinese workers are not assured the right to strike, and only
 a few "wildcat" job actions have come to the attention of
 observers outside China. Included in the 1978 State
 Constitution, the right to strike was omitted in the 1982
 revision as well as in the 1983 Trade Union Constitution.
 However, a trade union spokesman said in 1983 that this
 omission did not necessarily mean that strikes were illegal.
 He described a narrow range of circumstances (e.g., risks to
 workers' safety) where strikes might be permitted for a brief
 time. There are no known instances of strikes on such issues,
 although there has been at least one instance of a strike over
 opposition to wage reform by workers protesting the linking of
 wages to productivity.
 
 
 670
 CHINA
 In the last several years, the ACFTU has actively expanded its
 international ties. Claiming to have contacts with trade
 unions in over 120 countries or regions, the Federation has
 stated its desire to establish links with foreign unions
 regardless of their af-filiation with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the Soviet-dominated World
 Federation of Trade Unions, or other organizations. The ACFTU
 conducts its busiest.bilateral program with the Japanese labor
 federations, Domei and Sohyo. Since China joined the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) in 1983, an ACFTU
 officia has served as China's workers' delegate to that body.
 This representative was elected to an alternate seat on the
 ILO governing body in 1984. The ILO opened a regional office
 in Beijing in January 1985. In September 1987, China agreed
 to sigd ILO Convention No. 159 on the vocational rehabilitation
 and employment-of disabled persons.
 Since 1981,Workers' Congresses have been established in most
 of China's-lafge and medium-sized enterprises. Created in
 principle to permit workers a role in enterprise management
 and selection'6f,.plant officials, the Congresses have to date
 been largely limited to social welfare issues. New regulations
 enumeratinrg the.role of Workers' Congresses were published in
 January 1987, and passage of a controversial national
 bankruptcy law was held up in part to assure adequate
 involvement of Workers' Congresses in the decisions about
 plant rp6rganizitlon or closure. Some 60 labor laws are now
 in effect n China,. Under labor reform regulations enacted in
 Octob r 1986, very.i6Trpkise must establish a "Workers'
 Council to represet wokers'.lhterests. As a practical
 matter, fa h6rymanasetsusuallyfirid it expedient to
 cooperate witk.Workers' Councils to ensure that workers
 actively support fpchory policy.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Reversing Cuitlal:'Revolution-era attempts to eliminate all
 religious prabtlce, Ching'srefotmist leadership initiate'd a
 policy of limited.religious toleration in 1978. According to
 official statements, the Goverhment's current' policy towards
 religion 'rests:pn.the assumption that "it will take patient,
 meticulous, and  e~eated education over a long period of time
 to weaken religibn"s influence. 'Religion cannot be completely
 abolished until the future, upon the attainment of a' certain
 stage in the development of' Communist society."
 The Constitutipn protectq freedom of religous belief and
 specifies tbatno organization or person may compel citizens
 to believe-or disbelieve in religion or discriminate against
 them becaute of relig'ious preference. The Constitution also
 prov.ides that" religious bodies must not be subject to foreign
 domination.. In the past, this provision has been directed at
 the Catholic'Church, but following the September and October
 disturbances in Lhasa the Chinese authorities have focused
 renewed attention-on the Dalai'Lama's influence on the Tibetan
 Buddhist community. In addition to these provisions, official
 policy forbids religious 'proselytizing other than at places of
 worship or believers-' homes. The Government seeks to prevent
 the conversion ol'those under 18 years of age. Government
 officials acknowledge that this is current policy, though they
 assert that the policy is only loosely implemented.
 The authorities have re-uired all religious bodies to
 affiliate with eight national organizations representing
 Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and Daoism. Of the five
 
 
 671
 CHINA
 Christian associations, two are Protestant and three are
 Catholic. Together, these five associations, with different
 functional responsibilities but overlapping leaderships,
 constitute the officially sanctioned national Protestant and
 Catholic churches. Although the Government required all
 Protestant denominations to merge in the 1950's, congregations
 and individuals may follow preferences on such matters as
 forms of baptism. Since its separation from Rome 30 years
 ago, the Chinese Catholic Church has developed its own
 theology and doctrines. For example, it rejects papal
 infallibility and supremacy, continues to conduct Services in
 Latin, and supports the State's policy on birth control,
 provided Church-approved methods are used. These five
 Christian associations and three organizations representing
 the other religions exist to ensure that religious bodies
 accept the leadership of the State and party.
 Within the limits of official policr, religious activities
 have expanded considerably in the last few years and appear to
 have been noticeably strengthened in the last 2 years. Many
 religious institutions which closed during the Cultural
 Revolution have reopened. In 1987 there were over 30,000
 churches, temples, monasteries, and mosques in service in the
 country. Many Buddhist and Daoist temples have reopened,
 often after restoration at government expense.
 Restoration of Tibetan monasteries is continuing. Only a
 fraction of the 2,700 monasteries open before _the Chinese
 suppression of the 1959 uprising were open in 1987.
 Government officials state that there are more than 200
 monasteries and over 700 sutra-reciting halls rebuilt and open
 as places of worship for 14,000 officially recognized monks
 and nuns and 400 living Buddhas. The Government plans to
 reopen more than 200 additional monasteries by the turn of the
 century. The Government imposes strict limits on the number
 of monks permitted to live and study at Buddhist temples.
 Since 198f the authorities have permitted the establishment of
 seminaries to train a limited number of young people in
 religious orders. The Chineze Catholic Church has 10
 seminaries in operation. The Protestant church also operates
 10 seminaries, including its National Theological Institute in
 Nanjing. The Islamic Association runs nine institutes
 throughout China to train imams and Islamic scholars. The
 Buddhist Association has approximately 20 institdtes
 nationwide, including facilities in Beijing, Suzhou, Nanjing,
 and Lhasa. In addition to these major institutes, individual
 mosques and temples run their own small education and training
 programs. The religious associations sponsor a variety of
 publications for believers, including scriptures, teaching
 material, theological journals, and hymn books. Since 1980,
 for example, the Protestant China Christian Council has
 printed and distributed well over 1 million Bibles. Religious
 publications are printed in all languages having religious
 significance in China. In addition to appropriating funds for
 extensive renovation of temples, the Government provides other
 forms of financial support for religious bodies (e.g., tax
 exemptions for rental income and cash subsidies to Muslims for
 observance of dietary law).
 The number of Christians has increased since 1978, with an
 official estimate of 3 million Catholics and almost 4 million
 Protestants in 1987. Officials state that there are 15
 million actively practicing Muslims, and there are well in
 excess of 10 million practitioners of Buddhism. Daoist
 
 
 672
 CHINA
 believers run into millions at a minimum. A pressing shortage
 of priests, ministers, monks, and imams exists because the
 older generation of religious leaders is dying off, and the
 Government limits the number of ndw clergy. Officials assert
 that there are a sufficient number of places of worship for
 all religious believers.
 Even though there has been an undeniable increase in the
 exercise of religious freedom in recent years, the authorities
 still react harshly to unsanctioned religious activity.
 Officials have repeatedly stressed that while it is government
 policy to protect "normal" religious practice, the Government
 will not tolerate "counterrevolutionary sabotage perpetrated
 in the.n~me of religion." A case in point is the imprisonment
 of Catholic priests in 1981-82 for refusing to relinquish
 their ties to the Vatican and to acknowledge the Catholic
 Patriotic Association. Although several priests reportedly
 remain in jail, Bishop Gong Pinmei (Ignatius Kung) was
 released from prison in 1985 and released from parole with
 full political rights restored in early January 1988. A more
 recent example is the imposition of tight security in Lhasa
 following disturbances which drew the active participation of
 Buddhist monks. The Government placed security personnel in
 the major temples in Lhasa after the October 1 riot occurred.
 There also are reports that public security authorities have
 harassed Christians who prefer to worship outside the
 officially recognized "patriotic" church system in what are
 termed "underground churches." The issue with regard to the
 underground'church is the degree of state control of Christian
 religious organizations; Beijing will permit only limited
 freedom from its strict control over the churches ift China.
 As one religious observer put it, "the cage may be wider, but
 it is still a cage."
 In 1983.the NPC Standing Committee authorized the death
 penalty for those organizing secret sects which spread 'feudal
 and superstitious ideas." This provision appears to be aimed
 at traditional animist and cult practices or criminal activity
 rather than at mainstream religious activities.
 Because of concern over divided loyalties, the authorities
 carefully monitor and control contacts between Chinese and
 foreign religious organizations through the national-level
 religious associations. Even so, the Government has
 encouraged Chinese religious leaders to participate in
 international exchange activities. Such international
 religious contacts have continued in 1987. For example, the
 Auxiliary Bishop of Shanghai Jin Luxian traveled to France for
 unofficial talks with French church officials in May 1987.
 Jin, who was arrested when Beijing broke with the Vatican in
 the 195P's, joined the state-sponsored church 2 years ago.
 In order to gain support from important minority groups and
 create good will with Islamic nations, China resumed giving
 permissiop to Muslim citizens to make the hajj in 1979. Since
 1985 over 2,000 Chinese have journeyed to Mecca every year.
 In addition, there are indications that Chinese religious
 organizations may be permitted to receive funds or gifts from
 foreign religious organizations, if no strings are perceived
 to be attached.
 The Government insists, however, that the country's religious
 bodies must be independent of foreign control and warns
 against foreign attempts to interfere in Chinese religious
 affairs. The Government prohibits missionaries from
 
 
 673
 CHINA
 practicing among Chinese citizens but has allowed some foreign
 clergymen to enter for brief periods to serve the resident
 foreign community. Before he canceled his trip for medical
 reasons, the Reverend Billy Graham was scheduled to preach and
 speak publicly in China in the fall of 1987. Foreigners with
 acknowledged ties to overseas religious institutions are
 permitted to work in China, often as English teachers,
 provided that they do not engage in open proselytizing. The
 Government seems to be willing to overlook minor infractions
 of this injunction, although those who have tested the limits
 of the Government's toleration in this regard have sparked
 official reaction (including denial of permission to extend a
 person's period of residence in China in one case).
 The authorities' concern over alleged foreign interference has
 been directed at the Vatican in the past, in part due to the
 Vatican's continued diplomatic ties to Taiwan. Chinese
 priests who publicly maintain their loyalty to the Pope are
 subject to arrest and imprisonment. In addition, the Chinese
 are disturbed by the Dalai Lama's political activity with
 regard to Tibetan independence. The Tibetan people's deep
 reverence for the Dalai Lama as a religious leader is
 tolerated in China, but individuals risk charges under the
 "special provisions" of the criminal law (crimes of
 counterrevolution and crimes of endangering the public
 security) if they participate in activities deemed to be
 politically motivated. The Tibetan exile community's
 religious ties to Tibetans in China are reportedly even more
 closely monitored by the Chinese authorities as a result of
 Chinese suspicion of the exiles' involvement in the September
 and October unrest in Lhasa.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Various formal and informal restrictions govern travel within
 China. Chinese citizens must have a written letter of
 introduction from their work unit to buy airplane tickets,
 secure hotel accommodations, or acquire ration coupons for
 purchase of basic food items in areas outside their places of
 residence. Those traveling by rail who plan to stay with
 relatives need not obtain letters of introduction but are
 still legally required to register with local police during
 their visits. In practice, however, many Chinese do not
 comply. With their higher income levels (particularly in the
 countryside), Chinese are traveling.more frequently within the
 country, often ignoring bureaucratic requirements without much
 difficulty. For instance, availability of grain and other
 food in free markets, combined with larger monetary incomes,
 means that lack of ration coupons no longer presents an
 effective barrier to travel. This increased mobility was no
 doubt one reason why the authorities announced in April 1985
 the adoption of the country's first nationwide identity-card
 system. The plan has not yet been implemented, though some
 areas have issued cards on a trial basis.
 Chinese citizens cannot freely change their locality of
 residence or workplace. They are registered as residents of a
 particular jurisdiction. The authorities normally grant
 permission to move to another locality only for a change in
 employment. Rigid personnel policies, most notably the
 unwillingness of units to sanction an employee's transfer,
 make it difficult to change jobs. However, the widening
 application of the labor contract system and accompanying
 pension reforms will increase labor mobility.
 
 
 674
 CHINA
 The contracts generally will run for 3 to 5 years, after which
 both parties may decide whether to renew. This will not
 immediately affect workers employed before October 1, 1986,
 who will continue to "enjoy" lifetime employment, without a
 stipulated right to change jobs. The authorities have called
 for and have taken steps towards reform of the personnel
 system, aiming at greater mobility among scientists,
 technicians, and certain other professionals. As part of
 efforts to develop commerce and industry in rural areas, the
 State Council issued a circular in 1984 which authorized
 peasants to establish businesses in rural towns. Significant
 numbers of farmers are moving into small and medium-sized
 cities. Strict policies discouraging rural migration to large
 cities.continue. It is also difficult for urban residents to
 move to other cities. Nevertheless, large numbers of
 unregistered-people reside in China's biggest cities, with
 estimates of as many as 1 million in Shanghai and 700,000 in
 Beijing.
 With the relaxation of controls on foreign travel and
 emigration since the late 1970's, tens of thousands of Chinese
 now go overseas every year to study, conduct business, or
 visit relatives. In November 1985, the Standing Committee of
 the NPC passed the "citizen's exit and entry control law,"
 which went into effect on February 1, 1986. The law provides
 for exit for personal reasons and denies exit to those
 involved in criminal or civil cases or those whose exit may
 harm China's national security or interests. China relaxed
 restrictions on internal travel by foreigners by increasing
 the number'of areas open'to foreign visitors without special
 permission. Although 474 cities or counties are open to
 visitors at present, large portions of China remain officially
 closed.
 China does not revoke the citizenship of political dissidents
 and is not known to have exiled any dissidents. The 7
 authorities have welcomed the return of Chinese who had fled
 their homeland earlier, the vast majority of whom are either
 residents of Hong Kong and Macao or "overseas" Chinese,
 including some former refugees. More than 285,000 refugees
 and displaced persons from Vietnam and Laos have resettled in
 China since 1978, most of them ethnic Chinese or persons
 married to ethnic Chinese. In the summer of 1987, more than
 7,000 ethnic Chinese,'nearly all refugees from Vietnam in the
 late 1970's and early 1980's, left southern China, Apparently
 discontented with conditions (primarily economic> on the state
 farms where they had been resettled, they took to small boats
 and landed in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong authorities sent them
 back to China, where officials promised that these attempts to
 emigrate would bring no reprisals. Ethnic Vietnamese refugees
 in China number a few hundred, housed in camps near the
 Vietnamese border. They have few opportunities for jobs or
 eduoation, and some Chinese officials have said that their
 resettlement in China is discouraged.
 China has also resettled over 2,000 ethnic Chinese permanent
 residents of the Mongolian People's Republic since 1983,
 following their expulsion by the Mongolian Government.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Chinese political leadership is chosen by the CCP, which
 is the paramount source of political authority in the
 country. Ordinary citizens have virtually no possibility to
 
 
 675
 CHINA
 effect changes in the leadership or the Marxist-Leninist
 system of government. Within the party, a group of top
 leaders in several key organizations, including the Politburo
 and its five-member Standing Committee, the Military
 Commission, and the Secretariat share power. Under the
 doctrine of "democratic centralism," leaders at the top, after
 consultation within the party, make policy decisions which all
 party members are expected to support. Political debate and
 disagreement usually take place only before a decision is
 made; once announced, all party members are expected to follow
 the party line. Nevertheless, there are means by which party
 members and others can debate established policies. These
 include the presentation of alternate points of view or
 criticism in the party-controlled press, the use of academic
 journals to present differing interpretations of supposedly
 theoretical matters, selective enforcement of policies,
 exploitation of policy ambiguities, manipulation of news
 coverage, and informal and unpublicized debate at party and
 government meetings.
 Student demonstrations in December 1986 and January 1987 in
 several Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing,
 and Tianjin called for greater democracy, including more
 participation in local elections, multicandidate slates, and
 open discussion of political development through wall posters
 and in the media. The Government responded to this outpouring
 of upwards of 50,000 students with restraint. Authorities
 generally avoided repressive policies; the limited numbers of
 activists arrested were identified as "nonstudents."
 Despite the ensuing ideological chill and subsequent party
 disciplinary action against intellectuals as part of the
 antibourgeois liberalization campaign, the political
 environment was considerably more relaxed by the late summer
 of 1987 in anticipation of the 13th Party Congress. Political
 reforms announced at the Congress aim to establish a stable
 political system capable of sustaining continued robust
 economic reform. During his opening speech to the Congress,
 Zhao Ziyang said that it is "necessary to respect the will of
 the voters and ensure that they have more options in
 elections." He also said that the long-term guiding
 principles for China include building "democracy" on the basis
 of stability and unity. These reforms, both economic and
 political, have an obvious limit: one must support the
 policies of the CCP.
 Over the past 6 years, the CCP has promoted a modest
 rejuvenation of eight "democratic" parties (formed before
 1949) as agents of its "united front" policy. Admittedly
 subservient to the CCP, the parties function as channels
 through which the authorities seek to mobilize support among
 the various constituencies the parties claifn to represent:
 intellectuals, former industrialists, returned overseas
 Chinese, former Kuomintang (Nationalist Party, the dominant
 party of Taiwan) military and civilian officials, and
 Taiwanese living on the mainland. As part of its efforts to
 give more visibility to these parties, the CCP increased their
 representation in the NPC and at the Chinese People's
 Political Consultative Conference in 1983, and they have been
 allowed to reestablish party newspapers and to recruit new
 members. Although the CCP periodically consults with the
 representatives of these minor parties on important issues,
 the parties, whose memberships total 239,000 and whose leaders
 are aged, have little effect on fundamental national policy
 issues.
 
 
 676
 CHINA
 The NPC meets once a year for about 2 weeks to debate and
 approve government policies and personnel changes determined
 in advance by the CCP. The NPC rarely rejects proposed
 government policies, although somd have been modified as a
 result of delegates' concerns expressed behind the scenes.
 More important than the NPC as a whole is its Standing
 Committee, which meets several times a year and has the power
 to approve laws. In 1986 the Standing Committee twice declined
 to pass a draft bankruptcy law proposed by the State Council,
 despite amendments and a last-minute plea by supporters for
 its adoption. This refusal to act occasioned unusual--though
 brief--press mention of the names of persons on each side of
 the debate. The law, in modified form, eventually passed
 toward.the end of the year. Similar, though less publicized,
 cases have also occurred.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known organizations within China which monitor or
 comment on human rights conditions. Several legal journals
 do, however, discuss questions having to do with the rights of
 the accused and of convicted prisoners. The Chinese regard
 their human rights record as an internal matter and generally
 concede no justification for foreign concern about it. In the
 past, Chinese authorities have not responded even to factual
 questions on particular cases such as the imprisoned Catholic
 priests. In October 1986, however, officials did provide
 information in answer to a U:S. Embassy inquiry regarding
 certain of these priests and others thought to be "political
 prisoners," and an official spokesman responded in late 1987
 to a press inquiry concerning an alleged Tibetan prisoner of
 conscience. Chinese officials have been willing to meet with
 U.S. government officials and members of professional groups
 to discuss birth control policies, have provided increasing
 amounts of statistical data, and have facilitated visits to
 localities. China participates in the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution endorses the principle that all citizens are
 equal. In the socioeconomic realm as in politics, however,
 women lag behind men despite progress in recent years. Female
 participation in the labor force has increased rapidly in the
 last few years, reaching 43.7 percent of total workers and
 staff in 1986, compared to 7.5 percent in 1950 and 36.4 percent
 in 1984. At the end of 1986, women accounted for 36.6 percent
 of the urban work force, but women are still concentrated in
 the lower paying and less prestigious jobs. The United Nations
 Development Fund for Women presented an award to China in
 October 1987 for promoting women's role in economic
 development.
 Although growth rates for the number of women in state
 positions, including scientific, engineering, and technical
 fields, have been higher for women than men since 1978,
 problems persist. At the end of 1987, 61.5 percent of youth
 "waiting for jobs" (i.e., unemployed) were women, up 1.3
 percent from the previous year. In rural areas, where most
 women.participate in agricultural production, underemployment
 is a seiious problem. Women do not seem to have turned to
 nonagricultural activities in the countryside (e.g.,
 
 
 677
 CHINA
 transportation or rural industry) in the same numbers as men,
 tending to stay with traditional occupations in the fields and
 homes.
 Women have scored few breakthroughs in the male-dominated
 political .establishment. In late 1987, none of the 17 members
 of the Politburo was female. In 1986 just 3 women served
 among the 45 ministers and commission directors in the
 Government. Twenty-eight and one-half percent of government
 cadres were women. About 20 percent of NPC delegates were
 female. One woman served as a provincial Governor and one as
 a provincial Party Secretary. Of the delegates to the 13th
 Party Congress in October 1987, 14.9 percent were women.
 Regarding women's education, a 1986 survey of 8,000 large and
 medium-sized enterprises showed that of 6 million women
 workers and staff, 4.5.percent had university educations, 82.1
 percent had graduated from middle school, 12.2 percent had
 primary school educations, and 1.2 percent were illiterate.
 In the July 1987 college entrance examinations, there were
 1,414,000 male participants and 861,000 female participants.
 Currently, approximately 28 percent of the students in
 universities across China are female. Of the 200 million
 illiterates in China, 70 percent are reportedly women.
 The party has taken a more liberal approach to minority policy
 since 1980. Minorities benefit from special treatment in
 marriage and family planning, employment, and university
 admission. Most of China's ethnic minorities live in one of
 the country's five Autonomous Regions, 32 Autonomous
 Prefectures, or 104 Autonomous Counties. The autonomous areas
 are now governed by the "Law on Regional Autonomy for
 Minorities" which went into effect in 1984. This law, like
 the Constitution, provides that government heads of Autonomous
 Regions, Prefectures, or Counties must be members of the
 locally prevalent minority. Although vague on the
 implementation of rights to political autonomy for minority
 areas, the law clearly sets forth rights to preserve and
 develop local minorities, cultural traditions, use local
 minorities' languages, and practice local minorities' religion
 within the autonomous areas. CCP policy is to increase
 minority representation in the Government and party in
 minority areas to levels reflecting the minority's share of
 the population, and to assign senior positions to minority
 persons. Minorities, effectively shut out from all but a few
 leadership positions in the Government and party, complain of
 discrimination by the Han majority, however, and there can be
 little doubt that key decisionmaking positions in the
 Autonomous Regions (e.g., of party secretaries) will continue
 to be held by Han Chinese. The standards of living of the
 vast majority of these minorities in China remain
 substantially below that of most Han Chinese.
 Uygur students demonstrated on minority issues in Urumqi,
 Beijing, and Shanghai in December 1985. Tibetans demonstrated
 and rioted in September and October of 1987, protesting Han
 doinination of their political and religious lives.
 These incidents in Lhasa were only the most recent venting of
 intensely felt alienation by the distinctive and devoutly
 religious Tibetan people. A large proportion of the Tibetan
 population strongly resents the economic and political
 dominance and military presence of the Han Chinese. According
 to official Chinese figures, Han Chi-nese constitute about 3
 percent of the population in the Tibetan Autonomous Region
 
 
 678
 CHINA
 (excluding the military), yet 40 percent of all government
 cadre ard Han, 40 percent of regional department heads are
 Han, 38percent of university students are Han, and 60 percent
 of factory managers are Han. The'authorities have declared
 that the liberalization of political, economic, and social
 policies towards Tibet which has been under way since 1980
 will continue despite the recent violence which left at least
 seven dead and score' injured.
 Tibetans'in China still hope for the return of the Dalai Lama,
 but there remains a wide gap between the Dalai Lama and
 Beijing ag to the conditions under which his return might be
 effected. In recent years, the Government has relaxed travel
 restrictions, allowing thousands of Tibetans to go to India to
 see the Dalai Lama and hundreds of exiles to return home to
 visit. The Government's declared policy aims at the steady
 acceptance of all minorities, including Tibetans, into the
 mainstream of China's political, economic, and social
 institutions. In the case of Tibet, this policy is motivated
 ;n politicaJltdrms by a desire to strengthen social stability
 in a large, sensitive border region with a long history of de
 facto autonomy ' In 1987, as earlier, Beijing made it clear
 that it will not'tolerate a Tibetan independence movement, and
 that the unity of the PRC takes unquestioned precedence over
 the liberalized policy towards minorities.
 Each person's "class background" is a matter of record and in
 the past has strongly influenced educational job opportunities.
 However, severe social and other discrimination against former
 opponents of the CCP, intellectual critics of Paity leadership,
 former capitalists, and the children of members of these groups
 has been significantly curtailed in iecent years.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Although no national legislation'exists to establish a minimum
 age foremployment; state enterp'rises restrict employment
 opportunilie  for anyone wfbo has not completed high school or
 lacks equivalent certification. In June 1987, the Shanghai
 municipal government passed the first local law in China
 prohibiting employment'of youths under 18 in various sectors.
 The "Regulations Regarding the Protection of Youth," which
 became effective October 1, prohibit any organization or
 individual from employing youths who should be participating
 in the compulsory 9 years of education. The educational
 authorities are trying to ensure that minimum standards are
 maintained in implementing this program. The NPC and the
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are
 considering national lgislation aimed at closing off
 full-tirde employment opportunities for those who have not'
 completed 9 years of school. The growth of lightly regulated
 private and collective rural industry is a factor running
 counter to attempts to insure 9 years schooling for all.
 Young semiskilled and unskilled workers compete vigorously for
 the rural industry jobs, thus causing vacancies in traditional
 agricultural work which are often filled by teenagers.
 Conditions of work vary widely. In some impoverished areas,
 long, toilsome hours do not return even a bare living, and
 subsidies are required for survival. Employment standards in
 the countryside are difficult to monitor and considerably more
 lax than in urban areas. Schools try to schedule some sort of
 "productive" activity as part of the curriculum, and children
 in rural areas often help out in agricultural activities.
 
 
 679
 CHINA
 Safety issues have figured prominently in bilateral contacts
 and agreements in nuclear power, mine safety, rail development,
 and civil aviation. In 1986 the Chinese approved legislation
 which required that a safety and health delegate be appointed
 to every production unit. The ILO has established a training
 program for these delegates.
 In terms of the legal structure for maintaining minimum
 conditions for the protection of safety and health of workers,
 China's procurators dealt with 3,642 cases of criminal
 negligence and 4,140 accidents involving criminal or civil
 liability between January 1985 and June 1987.
 China appears to be making a concerted effort to improve
 safety standards in some sectors of the economy, but
 antiquated equipment and technology (substandard in terms of
 safety) and the impetus for greater efficiency in accordance
 with China's determination to achieve economic reform goals
 work against this trend towards greater government attention
 to safety standards and medical, retirement, and unemployment
 benefits.
 China is considering reforms to reduce the average workweek to
 40 hours from the current official 48-hour workweek.
