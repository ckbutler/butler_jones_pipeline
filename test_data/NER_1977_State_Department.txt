 NIGER
 
 Niger is ruled by a military government. The armed
 forces seized power in April 1974 claiming.corruption
 was widespread in the civilian government and that
 emergency measures were necessary to deal with the
 critical food situation. The new military govern-
 ment has made economic development its first priority
 and has sought to improve the welfare of the average
 citizen, particularly the rural poor. However,
 since the military government has banned all political
 activity, restrictions exist on freedom of expression.
 Several members of the former government have been
 released from house arrest; a few of the former
 government's members remain under house arrest, but
 more releases are expected.. Many of the former
 detainees have been reinstated in the civil service.
 Niger's pre-independence French legal system and
 practices have been left largely intact; French
 legal safeguards are respected in civil and criminal
 cases. The military government still refers to
 itself.as "provisional", yet has announced-no
 schedule to return the country to civilian rule.
 Civilians now hold twelve of the nineteen cabinet
 positions in the government.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from
 a. Torture
 There are no reports of the use of torture in Niger.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are no reports of such treatment or punishment
 in Niger, nor do we have any evidence of arbitrary
 deprivation of life. There is no evidence of in-
 humane prison conditions in Niger.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Reported infringements have been rare, but incidents
 of arrest and imprisonment without due process have
 occurred, especially in cases involving members of
 the previous regime. Amnesty International reports
 that it is "handling" the cases of 18 persons ac-
 cused of plotting against the government who have
 been jailed without trial. There is no information
 on the exact number of political prisoners who have
 been detained without trial. The integrity of the
 person is not specifically guaranteed by law in
 Niger, since the military government has suspended
 the constitution and rules by decree.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public hearing and trial generally
 is observed in criminal and civil cases not in-
 volving political acts. Several plotters executed
 in connection with a March, 1976 attempted coup were
 tried by a specially constituted military court.
 Courts dealing with civil and criminal questions
 appear free from political influences and pressures.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The inviolability of the home generally is respected
 although the government's power to conduct searches
 is not limited by statute.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 The Government of Niger (GON) in cooperation with
 foreign assistance donors is an active participant
 in Niger's economic and social development. As a
 member of the Interstate Committee for the Struggle
 against the Sahelian Drought (CILSS), the Government
 of Niger has publicly committed itself to improving
 the standards of living of its citizens by raising
 per capita income, promoting development of the
 agricultural sector and improving social services
 
 
 87
 and education programs ahd promoting employment.
 The GON in its three years in power has shown a
 relentless dedication to these objectives. The
 military government's development efforts, inter-
 national assistance, and the return of good weather
 have all been key factors in Niger's economic
 recovery since 1974.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are restricted in Niger. Dissent is
 rarely voiced openly. Some forms of voluntary asso-
 ciations and expressions such as trade unions,
 churches and religious groups are, however, generally
 permitted. The trade unions are under the influence
 of the government. The press is government-controlled,
 but there is a certain degree of editorial indepen-
 dence. The government does not attempt to impose
 ideological conformity.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There have been no reports of restrictions on movement
 within the country, foreign travel, or emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The freedom to participate in the political process
 is restricted in Niger. Upon taking power in April
 1974, the new military government suspended the
 constitution; abolished the national assembly and
 banned all political activities. The executive
 branch is now directed by a Supreme Military Council
 (SMC) comprised of the army officers who organized
 the coup. The president of the SMC is also chief of
 state and president of the council of ministers.
 Civilians, named by the president, now hold a
 majority of the positions in the Council of Ministers.

 The military government has announced no schedule to
 return the country to civilian rule.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no proposals for an outside investi-
 gation of human rights in Niger. We do not know
 whether the Government of Niger would accept such a
 proposal.
