 MONGOLIA
 The Mongolian People's Republic (MPR) is a highly centralized
 Communist state, in which the Mongolian People's Revolutionary
 Party (MPRP), the Communist party, is the only political party
 permitted to function. Since achieving power in the 1920's,
 the MPRP has continued Mongolia's long tradition of
 authoritarian rule, though there are recent signs that the top
 leadership is sanctioning movement toward reform of the party
 and government. The Politburo of the MPRP Central Committee,
 headed by Jambyn Batmonkh, rules. Nominally, the People's
 Great Hural, or National Assembly, enacts laws, but it
 faithfully carries out the policies of the MPRP leadership.
 However, the Great Hural has recently shown signs of movement
 toward increased openness in criticizing government practices.
 It meets for 3 days once a year. Between sessions, the
 Presidium and the Council of Ministers (Cabinet) issue decrees
 and executive orders.
 The Mongolian State is modeled on the Soviet system, and the
 political influence of the U.S.S.R. is great. While two
 Soviet Army divisions were recently withdrawn, a significant
 military presence remains, as do thousands of civilian Soviet
 advisers and technicians. A Mongolian version of perestroika
 (restructuring) and glasnost (openness) has begun; changes
 along these lines have been noted. Consistent with this
 policy, Chairman Batmonkh and other leaders have publicly
 criticized political abuses of the past and called for
 political and economic reform. Contact with and interest in
 the non-Socialist countries is increasing.
 The Mongolian security apparatus functions under the direction
 of the Council of Ministers in accord with the Constitution.
 The primary body with responsibility for state and public
 security is the Ministry of Public Security (MPS). It
 oversees subordinate bodies, including the Central Militia
 Office and the network of local police departments. In
 addition, the MPS administers the State Security
 Administration, which is responsible for counterintelligence
 and internal political security. The MPS also oversees the
 Border and Internal Troop Administration, which performs
 customs and immigration control, and border security duties.
 In keeping with recent indications that a high-level political
 review is under way in the Government of past policies and
 practices, the MPS has stated publicly that it is reevaluating
 its responsibilities, which will now include "establishing
 reliable guarantees against permitting any kind of illegal
 encroachments on human rights in the future...." There is
 little information yet to assess MPS policy changes in this
 area.
 Mongolian economic life is dominated by the U.S.S.R. and
 shaped by its trade, approximately 95 percent of which is
 conducted with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Soviet
 involvement in the economy primarily focuses on the mining of
 nonferrous metals that are subsequently shipped to the.
 U.S.S.R. for processing. Mongolia is now making efforts to
 diversify international trade with non-Socialist nations.
 Despite increasing industrialization and urbanization, a
 majority of the population is engaged in agriculture, with an
 emphasis on livestock raising and associated light industry.
 The United States and Mongolia established diplomatic
 relations on January 27, 1987, and the U.S. Embassy opened
 formally in September 1988. At this stage, the body of
 reliable information concerning government control or

 MONGOLIA
 treatment of Mongolian citizens remains limited. Until
 recently, there were no known domestic opposition groups.
 However, on the eve of the Party's Seventh Plenum, a new group
 surfaced--the Mongolian Democratic Association, composed of
 students and intellectuals. Two demonstrations by this group
 which were critical of current and past government practices
 were permitted by the authorities; banners calling for
 multiparty elections, an end to bureaucratic privileges, and a
 more market-oriented economy were displayed.
 Individual civil and political liberties are highly
 restricted. Though the numbers are increasing, few Mongolians
 are authorized to travel outside of Socialist countries.
 Emigres from Mongolia are few. Political opposition to the
 MPRP has recently been permitted, though the extent of the
 party's control over this opposition remains unknown.
 Freedoms promised under the Constitution, including speech,
 religion, demonstration, and assembly, have been severely
 restricted in the past, but there are now signs that the
 authorities are relaxing these policies. The Party's officibl
 daily recently published a lead editorial calling for
 guarantees of human rights, including elections, and
 "large-scale renewal" to ensure rights and freedoms.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and-Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There are no indications in recent years of political or
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no indications in recent years of disappearance due
 to political persecution.
 c. Torture-and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 .Treatment or Punishment
 Information is unavailable on this subject.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government recently acknowledged that political arrests
 and detention occurred in the 193D!s and has published
 numerous official criticisms of those policies as violations
 of human rights. In keeping with recent signs of increased
 government openness in criticizing abuses of the 1930's and
 1940's, the Minister of Public Security stated publicly that
 his ministry is now "directing its activities at
 rehabilitating honest citizens repressed during that period,
 at establishing reliable guarantees against permitting any
 kind of- illegal encroachments on human rights in the future,
 and cooperating-with corresponding organizations in this
 matter." The current extent of arbitrary arrest, detention,
 or exile is unknown. There is little information available
 yet on the practical effect of these new policy directives on
 the Ministry of Public Security apparatus.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Current civil and criminal codes stipulate the right of the
 accused to judicial process, a legal defense, and public trial
 "except as stipulated by law." Closed proceedings are
 permitted in the case of crimes against the State. The civil
 code focuses on this category of crimes.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy of person, home, and correspondence is
 provided for in the Constitution, but little is known about
 the application of these rights by the authorities. Job and
 residence changes must be approved by the State. The State
 also plays a role in finding or assigning jobs.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms have been tightly circumscribed. The
 Constitution provides for freedom of speech but limits this
 freedom by specifying that the exercise of individual rights
 must be to "develop and consolidate the state system of the
 MPR." Actions deemed by the MPRP to fall outside this
 guideline may result in arrest and detention. Various party
 and government organizations, including the Ministry of Public
 Security and the local militia, control political and social
 conduct. Citizen volunteer committees work with the militia
 to monitor social and political conduct at the neighborhood
 level.
 Prior to the institution of Mongolian-style glasnost and
 perestroika, fundamental public criticism of the Government
 was not permitted. In late 1988, however, for the first time
 a limited amount of direct criticism of past and present party
 and government leaders, and of the Soviet Union, was carried
 in public media. Letters published in the official press are
 a form of managed criticism permitted by the Government. The
 government-approved press serves largely as a propaganda
 tool. Recent practice indicates that representatives of
 non-Communist foreign media are able to travel to Mongolia.
 Academic and artistic life also is controlled in accordance
 with government policy. Information flow is tightly
 monitored. Mongolian citizens have little access to books,
 periodicals, or newspapers not printed in Communist countries,
 but there are signs the Government is permitting more exposure
 to some Western plays and literature.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of demonstration and assembly are provided for in the
 Constitution, but, until recently, only government-authorized
 organizations were permitted. Demonstrations are generally
 carefully orchestrated by government authorities, but the
 extent of government involvement in two demonstrations by the
 new Mongolian Democratic Association in December 1989 is
 unknown. Demonstrators--mostly students and intellectuals--
 expressed criticism of past and current government practices,
 called for plural elections, a more market-oriented economy,
 intensification of perestroika and glasnost, and an end to
 special privileges for government officials.

 MONGOLIA
 For a discussion,of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government controls religious activity through the Office
 of Religious Affairs attached-to the Council of Ministers.
 This office works in close consultation with the showcase
 Gandan monastery--the only monastery permitted to function.
 The monastery houses approximately 200 monks. All other
 monasteries have been closed since the 1930's. As a result,
 Lamaist Buddhism, a central force in Mongolian life prior to
 the establishment of the Communist Government, no longer plays
 a significant part in the lives of most Mongolians. However,
 rural people reportedly retain many Buddhist beliefs
 privately. Vestiges of shamanism also remain.
 In addition to the 200 monks at Gandan monastery, there are
 reports of 10.0 itinerant monks--loosely affiliated with
 Gandan. Gandan also runs a nominal religious school on a
 small scale. Mongolians who regularly visit the Gandan
 Monastery bor worship are mostly of the older generation, but
 there-are signs of resurgent interest in religion among
 Mongolian youth. Two other monasteries are being restored as
 museums. During 1989 the traditional Mongolian script, long
 suppressed in favor of Cyrillic, has been revived and is
 taught in schools and on television. The destruction of
 lamaseries in the 1930's has been criticized for excessive
 brutality. Lunar New Year celebrations, carrying Buddhist
 associations, were permitted in the cities in 1989 for the
 first time in decades. Such developments appear to evidence a
 modestly increased toleration of Buddhist and other
 traditional practices. There are no mosques for the
 traditionally Islamic Kazakh minority of 80,000 in western
 Mongolia. This group has been permitted to retain cultural
 customs, such as dress, based on religious background.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within the country does not appear to be as restricted
 as in the-past, but residence changes must be approved by the
 authorities. All Mongolians over age 16 must have internal
 passports and must obtain permission from the Security Bureau
 In order to travel within the country. Changes of residence-
 -yr -employment must be approved by the Security-Bureau and must
 accotd with central planning goals.
 In general, few Mongoliansghave traveled abroadr even to the
 Soviet Union. In recent years, however, as many as several
 thousand Mongolian-yo ths have gone to various places-in the
 Soviet Union yearly for specialized programs. There has also
 been an increase in the number of-senior scholars pursuing
 extended study abroad. Most foreign travel remains restricted
 to the-Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Though overall
 figures remain small, increasing numbers of Mongolians are
 permitted travel to the West for official, academic, or
 cultural-purposes. There is no known routine emigration from
 Mongolia, but there are also no indications that many people
 wish to emigrate.
 Although the 1960 Constitution assures the right "to reside in
 the territory of the MPR"-to foreign -itizens, the Government
 in 19Z3 began a systematic expulsion of the 6,000 to 7,000
 ethnic Chinese. With the improvement of Sino-Mongolian
 
 
 932
 MONGOLIA
 relations in recent years, Mongolia stopped expelling ethnic
 Chinese in 1985; today the Chinese population numbers less
 than 2,000. Increasingly, Mongolians are permitted to visit
 and be visited by ethnic Mongolian relatives whose homes are
 in China. A bilateral consular treaty regarding treatment of
 their nationals was signed by Mongolia and China in July 1986.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government.
 The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) has a
 monopoly on political power, and there is no established
 mechanism by which the citizenry as a whole can effect
 transitions in leadership or changes in government. The MPRP
 is established on the Soviet model with a naxrow pyramid of
 power topped by Party General Secretary Batmonkh. Lower
 ranking members of the MPRP have had very limited ability to
 influence the decisions of their superiors, but recent signs
 indicate that the top leadership has sanctioned movement
 toward decentralization of decisionmaking within the party.
 People's Great Hural delegates, for example, are becoming more
 outspoken on party policies. During a December 1989 session,
 Great Hural delegates called for accelerated economic reform
 and criticized "bureaucratism" in the Government and the
 special privileges of high officials.
 Elections are held at regular intervals, but only one
 candidate has been listed for each office, so the choice has
 been to vote for the candidate or cross the name out. Many
 elections reportedly result in a 99.9 percent turnout, and the
 sole candidate regularly receives the entire vote. However,
 reforms announced in December 1988 called for the institution
 of some elections with multiple candidates at all levels.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No organization dedicated to the protection of human rights in
 Mongolia is known to exist. There has been no known request
 by an international human rights group to investigate alleged
 human rights violations in Mongolia.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There appears to be little discrimination in education on the
 basis of race, sex, or religion.
 Government policy is to promote equal rights for women.
 According to government statistics, the percentage of women in
 the work force rose from 30 to 48.5 percent between 1960 and
 1984. Women constitute about 30 percent of the MPRP
 membership and 49.8 percent of trade union membership, and
 some hold high professional positions in institutions such as
 schools, research centers, and hospitals.
 At present, there is no information to indicate a significant
 incidence of societal violence against women. The extent to
 which family violence, including wife beating, may occur is
 unknown. Article 84 of the Constitution expressly calls for
 equal rights for women in all sociopolitical spheres and
 prohibits the "impairment of women's equality in any form
 whatsoever." In particular, the law provides for specific
 protections for women with children and special assistance for
 
 
 933
 MONGOLIA
 women during pregnancy and after childbirth. Because Mongolia
 remains an underpopulated country with just over 2 million
 inhabitants, official desire to increase the population is
 strong.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers do not have the right to form and join unions of their
 own choosing. The right to organize professional associations
 and trade unions is provided for in the Constitution, but
 these are government controlled and directed. It is not knowp
 how such organizations work in practice, whether trade unions
 havd a right to strike, and-whether any strikes took place in
 1989. All worker committees are reportedly extensions of the
 MPRP. However, there have been confirmed cases of direct
 elections of plant or factory directors, and reports of labor
 resistance to overbearing party interference in technical
 matters of production. In the opinion of the International
 Labor Organization (ILO), constitutional provisions imply that
 no mass organizations, particularly trade unions, have any
 possibility of working outside the party framework. The ILO
 also notes that the Labor Code effectively prevents the
 formation of any independent trade union organizations. All
 unions are grouped in the Central Council of Mongolian Trade
 Unions (CCMTU), which itself is an extension of the MPRP. The
 CC4TU is affiliated with the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no specific provision for collective bargaining in
 the labor law. However, local worker committees and people's
 courts are empowered by the law to form "Commissions for Labor
 Disputes" to settle grievances. Trade union council
 representatives and enterprise managers are represented
 equally on these commissions. It is not known how these
 commissions function in actual practice. Information whether
 export processing zones exist is not available.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 It is not known if forced or compulsory labor is practiced or
 prohibited by law.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law proscribes work for children under age 16, although
 those aged 15 may work if allowed to by the local trade union
 committee. Those under 18 are statutorily prohibited from
 doing arduous work or from working in dangerous areas such as
 mining.
 e.. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Mongolian Labor Law sets maximum work hours for all
 workers and exhorts state enterprises to observe work safety
 requirements. The workday is prescribed as 8 hours for
 adults, 7 hours for those aged 16 to 18, and 6 hours for those
 aged 15. The Labor Law provides that "the monthly earnings of
 a worker or employee may not be lower than the minimum amount
 of earnings established by the State." No information is
 available on the implementation of labor law in this area or
 of the effectiveness of health and safety standards set by the
 Government.
