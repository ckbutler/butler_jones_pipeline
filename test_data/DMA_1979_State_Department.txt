 DOMINICA
 Upon becoming independent in November, 1978, Dominica
 deliberately broke its ties to the British crown by declar-
 ing the country a commonwealth rather than a dominion
 under the sovereignty of the Queen.
 Dominica's first year of independence has been a troubled
 one. A political crisis and general strike in June,
 1979, led to the fall of the Patrick John Government
 and the formation of an interim government. Then a disas-
 trous hurricane in August, 1979, turned the nation's
 attention almost entirely to basic survival and the re-
 building of a shattered economy. Throughout the turmoil,
 however, most of the population and the leading political
 actors have maintained respect for basic human rights
 and for democratic processes inherited from years of
 British rule. The new interim government, formed June
 22 at the end of the general strike, has expressed its
 clear intention to hold elections by what would have
 been the end of the John Government's term in early 1980.
 A revision of the electoral lists was underway before
 the hurricane. The interim government of Prime Minister
 James Oliver Seraphin, while retaining some of the per-
 sonalities of the previous government, has taken new
 initiatives, both in foreign policy and in human rights
 issues.
 Among the members of the interim government is human
 rights activist Brian Alleynet the Attorney-General.
 One of his first actions was to seek a pardon, subse-
 quently granted, for Desmond Trotter, an Amnesty Inter-
 national prisoner of conscience. Trotter had been con-
 victed of murdering an American tourist, but the chief
 prosecution witness later recanted her testimony.
 Alleyne is also seeking the repeal of Dominica's infamous
 "Dread Act", which outlaws the "Dread" Rastafarian sect
 (a religious cult) and provides virtual immunity from
 prosecution for those who assault or kill Rastafarians.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is expressly prohibited in the constitution and
 is not practiced in Dominica.
 
 
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Inhuman and degrading treatment is also constitutionally
 prohibited. There have been no reports of such treatment
 or other police abuses in Dominica.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is prohibited by the
 constitution. There have been no instances of persons
 detained without charge in Dominica. The constitution
 provides that anyone detained or arrested shall be brought
 before a court within 72 hours.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution provides that "any person charged with
 a criminal offense.., shall be afforded a fair hearing
 within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial
 court established by law". The constitution also provides
 for the presumption of innocence and for provision of
 legal counsel. These provisions are fully respected
 in practice. The court of appeal for Dominica is the
 West Indies Associated States Court, which has an excellent
 reputation for impartiality.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution prohibits arbitrary search or entry.
 This prohibition is respected in practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Since August 29, 1979, the basic needs of food and shelter
 have been almost a total preoccupation of the government
 of Dominica. Health care was a problem even before Hurri-
 cane David, with one international agency praising the
 government's strategy for health services but noting
 that its implementation was undermined by a lack of funds
 for salaries, drugs, and maintenance and by a shortage
 of trained staff. The hurricane seriously damaged the
 island's major hospital. The Health Minister has sought
 substantial foreign assistance in rebuilding the shattered
 health services and has reaffirmed the Government's commit-
 
 
 300
 ment to provide basic health services to all Dominicans.
 Education is compulsory for all Dominicans from the ages
 of five to fourteen, but World Bank figures indicate
 that about one-fifth of the students drop out before
 completing their compulsory education. Contributing
 .to this problem is the maldistribution of schools and
 a serious shortage of trained teachers.
 Hurricane David ravaged what was already a poor country.
 It destroyed or severely damaged much of the nation's
 infrastructure, as well as individual homes, factories,
 and the banana and citrus fields that provide much of
 the nation's livelihood. Much of the low and middle
 income subsidized housing built under the previous admini-
 stration was devastated. The long task of rebuilding
 is being carried on energetically by the present goverment.
 Adequate shelter for the population continues to be a
 very serious problem. Although there were charges of
 corruption against the preceding government, there have
 been no such charges against the Seraphin Government.
 Dom~nica's economy is currently in ruins. Pre-hurricane,
 it was rural and agriculture based with some small agricul-
 tural processing industries providing employment in the
 capital. It is basically a private sector economy in
 which the right to property is protected by the constitu-
 tion.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly
 The Dominica constitution provides for all of the above
 freedoms, and they have not been infringed in practice.
 Before the hurricane, there were three weekly newspapers,
 which consistently maintained their independence and
 which, during the John Administration, were consistently
 anti-government. The only radio station is government-
 owned and controlled but leavens government pronouncements
 with statements of other political leaders. With the
 exception of the Dread Act already mentioned, there are
 no restrictions on religious freedom.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, and Emigration
 These rights are all guaranteed in the constitution and
 are honored in practice. The present government has
 sought to lower barriers to foreign travel by agreeing
 with two neighboring countries to eliminate passport
 requirements for inter-island travel.

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are no impediments to free participation in the
 political process by all elements. Political parties
 range across the spectrum from conservative, free-enter-
 prise groups to Marxist splinters on the left. All operate
 freely. The present interim government is a coalition
 representing virtually all of those elements.
 Women participate without restriction in the political
 process, although participation in leadership positions
 is not nearly proportional to their percentage of the
 population. The leader of one of the major political
 parties is a woman. Labor unions are active and free
 and have full rights to organize, bargain collectively,
 and strike.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights:
 The only prominent violation cited in recent years by
 international organizations was the imprisonment of Desmond
 Trotter, an Amnesty International prisoner of conscience.
 His release in July 1979 was one of the first acts taken
 by the interim government, which has demonstrated its
 positive orientation toward human rights issues. Dominica
 has not yet signed the Inter-American Human Rights Conven-
 tion.
