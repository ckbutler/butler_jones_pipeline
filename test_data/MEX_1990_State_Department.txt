 MEXICO
 Mexico is a Federal Republic which has been dominated by the
 Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) since its founding in
 1929. Recent political reforms have expanded the opposition's
 role and stake in the political system. A diverse political
 opposition currently holds nearly half of the seats in
 Congress, a major governorship, and numerous mayoralties.
 Nevertheless, the PRI has maintained its predominant political
 control by a combination of voting strength, organizational
 power, access to governmental resources not enjoyed by other
 political parties, and, the principal opposition parties and
 other credible observers charge, electoral irregularities.
 The principal law enforcement organization in Mexico is the
 Federal Judicial Police (MFJP), which is controlled by the
 Attorney General. Elements of the MFJP, particularly its
 antinarcotics unit, have been involved in human rights
 abuses. State and local police forces have also sometimes
 been involved in such abuses. The Salinas administration is
 seeking to end such abuses and has responded by arresting and
 dismissing some officials, although to date there have been
 few prosecutions. It has also proposed important reforms in
 arrest and investigation procedures.
 Mexico has a mixed economy that combines elements of domestic
 market capitalism with state ownership of major industries.
 The current Government has moved to divest the State of
 ownership of-many public sector enterprises and to increase
 the role of the private sector in the economy, as well as to
 reduce trade barriers and some regulations on direct foreign
 investment.
 A wide range of individual freedoms is provided for by the
 Constitution and honored in practice, but there are abuses.
 These include use of torture and other abuse by elements of
 the police, instances of extrajudicial killings, and recurring
 credible charges by opposition parties, civic groups, and
 outside observers of election irregularities. The Salinas
 administration has made serious efforts to promote human
 rights. It has created a high-powered National Commission on
 Human Rights (CNDH) and appears to recognize that
 implementation of effective electoral reform remains a serious
 concern.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were killings of political and human rights activists
 during the year. Political motives-cannot, as yet, be
 ascribed with certainty to any of them, though some observers
 assert such was the case. The most notorious of these cases
 was the May 21 murder of Sinaloa human rights law professor
 Norma Corona Sapiens who had conducted a vigorous campaign
 against abuses by the MFJP. Following an exhaustive
 government and CNDH investigation, four suspects were arrested
 in early July on charges of murdering Dr. Corona. The Mexican
 Academy of Human Hights (AMDH) reports that Paulino Martinez
 Velia, a bilingual teacher who worked among the Triqui Indians
 of Oaxaca, was murdered on April 23, for reasons apparently
 related to his organizational activities. Two persons were
 
 
 687
 MEXICO
 :tbsequently arrested for his murder. The Mexican Commission
 for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights reported that
 Jose Antonio Simon Zamora, a National Union of Autonomous
 Campesino Regional Organizations (UNORCA) leader, was killed
 at home in Patzcuaro, Michoacan. Witnesses claimed his
 assailants were soldiers. No one has been arrested in the
 case.
 Electoral violence claimed the lives of several political
 party members. As many as eight militants of the Party of the
 Democratic Revolution (PRD) in Guerrero and six in Michaocan
 may have lost their lives in the first 2 months of 1990
 following municipal elections in both states. The PRI claims
 a lesser number of its militants also lost their lives.
 There were no arrests in 1990 of suspects involved in several
 prominent cases of alleged political killings, including those
 of presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' personal aides,
 Francisco Ovando Gil and Roman Gil Herladez. They were
 assassinated just days before the July 1988 presidential
 elections.
 In Mexico's rural states, violent disputes over land sometimes
 result in extrajudicial killings. Paramilitary bands and
 local police controlled by political bosses and landowners
 have threatened and sometimes killed peasant activists. Such
 charges have been made not only by independent peasant groups
 but also by the PRI-affiliated National Confederation of
 Peasants (CNC). At times, the quarrels are internecine within
 rural communities; thus five peasants are reported to have
 lost their lives in August in a dispute between the
 Independent Central of Agricultural Workers and Peasants
 (CIOAC) and the CNC in Bochil, Chiapas.
 There were several cases of beatings by MFJP agents which
 resulted in death.. On May 15, Salvadoran national Osmaro
 Majibar Flores reportedly died at the hands of the MFJP. On
 June 6, three local residents of Isla Mujeres, Carlos Argaez
 Perez, Jose Perez Guemes, and Amilcar Avallejos, were detained
 by the MFJP as suspected drug traffickers. Held incommunicado
 in Cancun for 2 days, they were subsequently released. All
 three had been severaly beaten; Argaez died on June 9 as a
 result of his injuries. An arrest warrant was issued for MFJP
 officer Alejandro San Pedro Garcia, Argaez' alleged killer,
 but he had not been apprehended by year's end.
 b. Disappearance
 According to the Committee in Defense of Prisoners, the
 Persecuted, Disappeared Persons and Political Exiles of
 Mexico, a prominent human rights group, there are 556
 disappeared persons in Mexico. The United Nations Human
 Rights Commission states that there are 270 disappeared
 persons in Mexico. Most of these are historic cases,
 occurring during the earlier presidential administrations of
 Luis Echeverria and Jose Lopez Portillo. The Committee claims
 13 people have disappeared during the Salinas administration,
 including 6 PRD activists (Andres de la Cruz Zacapala, Vicente
 de Jesus Santiago, Daniel Lopez Alvarez, and Miguel Esteban
 Silverio, all of Ometepec, Guerrero, as well as Feliciano
 Cleto Villa and Jose Catarino Salgado Martinez of Teloloapan,
 Guerrero).
 Of these 13 more recent cases, the CNDH and the Federal
 Attorney General have accounted for 5 people on the
 Committtee's list: 1 was murdered, possibly for political
 
 
 688
 MEXICO
 motives, and 4 people were located alive and well in
 Guadalajara, Jalisco.
 The case that received the greatest press attention in 1990
 involved Francisco Quijano Garcia, owner of the "La Habana"
 cafe in Mexico City. Quijano Garcia was reportedly abducted
 by the MFJP on June 21; his whereabouts remain unknown.
 Subsequently, other family members were apprehended and later
 killed by the police; they included Erick QuijanoSantoyo,
 Jaime Quijano, and Hector Quijano. There were no arrests
 reported in these cases as of year's end.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution. However, police
 agents continued to employ psychological and physical torture
 and other abuse, most often in the period immediately
 following arrest and especially during interrogation.
 Acknowledging the problem, the Government has undertaken
 considerable efforts at "housecleaning," with press reports
 indicating that as of September 408 officials of the Federal
 Attorney General's office and the MFJP have been fired as of
 September and arraigned on criminal charges; 306 of these
 served in the office of the Deputy Attorney General for
 Narcotics Matters. In October, President Salinas dismissed
 Javier Coello Trejo, Deputy Attorney General for Narcotics
 Matters. Also in October, the Salinas administration proposed
 significant reforms of arrest and investigation procedures
 which would prohibit police from interrogating detainees and
 restrict the use of confessions in criminal proceedings. The
 Government has intensified efforts to. recruit new personnel
 and to promote education and training of police in legitimate
 investigative skills.
 All U.S. Consulates reported cases of abuse of U S. citizens
 in 1990. A significant number of detainees alleged they were
 abused and tortured by law enforcement (and occasionally
 military) authorities, most often to obtain an admission of
 quilt. Overall there have been 97 complaints of police abuse
 by U S. citizens throughout Mexico (through the month of
 -September), an increase of 5 over the same period in 1989. In
 the majority of cases where victims have been able to identify
 those involved, MFJP agents have been implicated. The U.S.
 Government formally protested some 60 cases of alleged torture
 through diplomatic channels, but the Secretariat of Foreign
 Relations has not confirmed any wrongdoing by Mexican police
 or officials.
 The case of U.S. citizen Daniel-Mendoza Mason is
 characteristic of methods used by overzealous police. Mason
 was arrested in Oaxaca in connection with a large drug
 shipment. At the time, he claims to have been kicked,
 threatened with death, and to have had his hands stomped on.
 He was held in Oaxaca briefly and beaten. further; he was then
 transferred to Mexico City, where, he says, carbonated water
 laced with chili was forced up his nose (creating the
 sensation of drowning); he was again beaten, and subjected to
 electric shocks. When seen by consular officers, he had
 bruises and fresh wounds which appeared to have been inflicted
 by a stun gun.
 The torture/murder case of Mexican citizen Ricardo Lopez
 Juarez and the torture of his mother, Guadalupe Lopez Juarez,
 also received considerable press attention in Mexico City.
 
 
 689
 MEXICO
 Lopez had been arrested for child kidnaping in March. While
 in police custody he was tortured and, according to several
 reports, died of injuries sustained. Police officials
 initially claimed Lopez had committed suicide, then later
 ruled his death had been an accident. Finally, in early
 August, three ex-MFJP agents were arraigned on charges of
 having murdered Lopez. Obstruction of justice charges were
 also pending at year's end against Enrique Alvarez Palacios,
 former special prosecutor for Mexico City's Gustavo Madero
 district.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Article 19 of the Constitution and Article 161 of the federal
 code of criminal procedure require that a judge review the
 arrest of a detained suspect within 72 hours of his arrest.
 The police must bring the suspect before a judge within 48
 hours of his detention, at which time the suspect makes a
 statement, and the judge must determine within the following
 24 hours whether or not the detention shall continue. At
 times-, police and judges have failed to meet these
 constitutional and procedural deadlines.
 Incidents of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment occur
 frequently, usually in alleged criminal cases and in land
 tenure disputes. As an example of the former, the PRD Mayor
 of Aguililla, Michoacan, Salomon Mendoza Barajas, was arrested
 on drug trafficking and weapons charges. The CNDH later
 confirmed the mayor's arrest had been unjustified and he was
 released.
 Exile and extradition'-of Mexican citizens are not normally
 practiced in Mexico.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is divided into federal and state court
 systems, with the federal courts having jurisdiction over most
 civil cases and those involving major felonies, including drug
 trafficking. Under the Constitution, the trial must take
 place within 12 months of arrest for crimes that would carry
 at least a 2-year sentence. The trial itself, sentencing, and
 appeals can delay the imposition of a final sentence for
 significant periods of time, sometimes adding a year or more
 to the entire process. Trial is by judge, not jury, in nearly
 all criminal cases. Defendants have a right to counsel, and
 public defenders are available. Other rights include defense
 against self-7incrimination, the right to confront one's
 accusers, and the right to a public trial
 The political opposition alleges that the judiciary, with
 judges placed in office by renewable appointments, is
 dependent on the executive branch. The Government, in turn,
 denies that political beliefs have any bearing on the
 impartial administration of justice. Factors such as low pay
 for judges and law enforcement officials and high caseloads
 contribute to the existence of corruption within the judicial
 system.
 Two problems in particular in the Mexican criminal justice
 system contribute to abuses of the rights of defendants: the
 failure to provide legal counsel during the first 72 hours of
 police detention, and the acceptance of confessions as the
 reliable and preferred proof of guilt. President Salinas
 addressed these deficiences in October when he proposed that
 
 
 690
 MEXICO
 interrogations be carried out onlyby the public prosecutor,
 that a confession alone is insufficient grounds for an
 indictment, and that a confession be legally admissible in
 court only if given in the presence of the defendant's
 attorney or other confidant. If approved by Congress and
 rigorously implemented at all levels, these changes could
 significantly reduce police abuse.
 The National Front Against. Repression (FNCR) states there are
 currently 6 political prisoners in the country, down from 33
 reported in 1989. That number includes the three Preparatoria
 Popular Tacuba students arrested during the Lopez Portillo
 administration: Cuauhtemoc Sanchez, Jose de Jesus Garcia
 Ramon, and Antonio Orozco Michel. Historically, the FNCR has
 claimed that most political prisoners in Mexico were peasants
 and peasant activists arrested in land disputes. The
 Government disputes the appellation "political prisoner"
 altogether, charging that most of those listed over the years
 by the FNCR have been guilty of common crimes such as
 terrorism, criminal association, and damage to property. In
 those cases where the government has acknowledged that a
 person was unjustly or excessively punished, it has classified
 their crimes as being "of a social nature". The Government
 continues to maintain that there are no political prisoners in
 Mexican jails.
 The Government initiated a sweeping amnesty program in
 February 1989, under which a total of 1,400 prisoners accused
 of committing crimes "of a social nature" have been released
 from jail. While acknowledging the importance of the effort,
 human rights activists, including the Mexican Academy of Human
 Rights, have claimed that the amnesty program has distracted
 public attention from the problems of political prisoners and
 the disappeared. Critics complained that the program was
 really aimed at alleviating problems of overcrowding in
 Mexican prisons, particularly as the Government stepped up law
 enforcement activities against drug trafficking. A "national
 penitentiary program 1989-1994' was initiated in 1990 to
 replace the 1989 amnesty. According to press reports, the
 program facilitated the release of 1,293 prisoners in the
 month of August alone. An additional 780 prisoners were
 placed in prerelease status, and another 10,600 have their
 files under review. Various states have undertaken similar
 efforts to correct unjustified imprisonments and sentences as
 well as to relieve prison overcrowding.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Article 16 of the Constitution provides for the privacy of
 individuals. Although the Government generally does not
 intrude on this right, and search warrants are required by
 law, peasants and urban squatters involved in conflicts over
 land titles have charged that local landowners, accompanied by
 police, have entered their homes without appropriate judicial
 orders and sometimes have resorted to violence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press are provided for by the
 Constitution. In 1990 the Government moved to enhance freedom
 of the press when it decided to sell off its controlling
 interest in the state-owned newsprint company PIPSA.
 
 
 691
 MEXICO
 Newspapers and magazines theoretically became free to import
 newsprint from abroad. However, in order to make PIPSA's sale
 more attractive to potential buyers, the Government moved in
 June to modify its General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
 schedule of concessions on four categories of newsprint;
 modifications included withdrawal of duty-free bindings, and
 increased tariffs (of up to 20 percent) on newsprint imports.
 These modifications effectively limit the competitiveness of
 foreign suppliers, leaving PIPSA as the main supplier of the
 country's newsprint.
 The Government's role as sole newsprint supplier has long
 given rise to charges that it used its dominant position to
 pressure editors into quashing unfavorable reports, with some
 journalists avoiding confrontation by self-censorship. Many
 journalists are dependent upon receipt of "under-the-table"
 payments to supplement low wages. Considerable public debate
 took place in 1990 as to whether a minimum wage should be set
 for journalists. Opposition political parties have often
 charged that Mexico's two principal television networks, one
 government owned and the other privately owned but allegedly
 partial to the Government, accord the-PRI inordinate news
 coverage, part-icularly at election time. Article 52 of the
 federal electoral code provides opposition parties with 15
 minutes per month of television time and additional time
 during an electoral campaign. However, the opposition asserts
 that the PRI's advantage derives from its status as Mexico's
 "official" party. The opposition also asserts that PRI
 activities (including campaign events) are covered as if they
 constituted national news.
 Several reporters died violently or were wounded under
 suspicious circumstances in 1990. Excelsior and Unomasdos
 correspondent Alfredo Cordova Solorzano was shot on June 6 in
 Tapachula, Chiapas; Chiapas governor Gonzalez Garrido later
 ruled the incident accidental. Three police officers are
 accused of the murder of El Dia reporter Elvira Marcelo
 Esquivel. Jose Chable Ruiz, Excelsior correspondent and
 director of the Tabasco weekly El Fondo, was physically
 attacked on April 21 after earlier receiving death threats,
 reportedly from Tabasco state government representative to
 Mexico City Oscar Canton Zentina. On April 23, Mario Barajas
 Perez, editor of El Sol de Morelia, was reportedly detained
 and beaten by the MFJP when he attempted to photograph an
 incident in which the latter were involved.
 In a case that received considerable attention, two building
 guards for the prominent Mexico City daily La Jornada, were
 gunned down on April 2, purportedly by agents of the
 underground Clandestine Workers Revolutionary Party Union of
 the People/Party of the Poor" (PROCUP/PDLP). PROCUP is a
 self-proclaimed guerrilla organization. The former rector of
 the Benito Juarez Autonomous University of Oaxaca, Felipe
 Martinez Soriano, was accised by Federal District Attorney
 General Morales Lechuga of masterminding the attack on the
 newspaper. The subsequent investigation occasioned
 considerable controversy, with leftist government critics
 claiming that the intense search for and arrest of PROCUP
 militants, Martinez Soriano primary among them, smacked of
 "repression." Several noted Mexican journalists and
 academics, among them Jorge Castaneda, Adolfo Aguilar Zinser,
 and Lorenzo Meyer, repeatedly received death threats in
 mid-June; La Jornada founder Rodolfo Pena received similar
 threats in early July. The Government responded swiftly to
 
 
 692
 MEXICO
 the incidents, with President Salinas calling Castaneda from
 Tokyo to assure the latter of a full investigation
 President Salinas declared "impunity does not nor shall it
 obtain for those who would damage the right to free expression
 of ideas." A principal suspect in the 1988 assassination of
 Baja California Norte journalist Hector "El Gato" Felix, was
 arrested in May. The Attorney General's office reportedly
 opened a new investigation in March into the possible
 complicity of Joaquin Salvador Galvan, ex-MFJP commander in
 Ciudad Juarez, in the 1988 murder of local television
 personality Linda Bejarano. In the 1985 murder case of
 -Excelsior journalist Manuel Buendia, the presumed killer, Juan
 Rafael Moro Avil Camacho, was sentenced in April to a year in
 prison for arms possession. Similarly, the alleged
 intellectual author of the murder, Jose Antonio Zorrilla
 Perez, former Federal Security Directorate (DFS) head, was
 sentenced in September to a 30-year jail term for the 1985
 murder of a Secretariat of Government investigator Jose Luis
 Esqueda; he still faces other charges stemming from the
 Buendia case.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution grants the right of peaceful assembly for any
 lawful purpose. A government permit is generally required for
 major demonstrations. The Government, with few exceptions,
 permits demonstrations by a broad range of political groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution permits persons to practice the religion of
 their choice, but no religious body is granted legal standing,
 and the clergy is barred from participating in politics,
 voting, owning real estate, or wearing religious garb in
 public. Some of these prohibitions are not strictly enforced,
 nor is a constitutional restriction against preuniversity
 religious schools, many of which exist. Mexico is
 predominantly Roman Catholic, though Protestant, Mormon,
 Jewish, and other religious communities also exist
 unfettered. Protestant evangelists and Mormons, principally
 foreign-supported groups, are active and especially successful
 in certain rural and largely indigenous communities. The
 Mormons tend to draw criticism from both the Government and
 the Catholic Church for'their purported destabilizing effect
 upon indigenous communities.
 A significant rapprochement between the Catholic Church and
 the State, begun by President de la Madrid and carried forward
 by President Salinas, culminated in 1990 with the exchange of
 personal representatives between the President and Pope John
 Paul II. The Pope also made a successful and popular visit to
 Mexico in May which sparked considerable speculation as to
 whether or not anticlerical provisions of the Constitution
 would be amended. In the end, both Church and State appeared
 satisfied with tangible, de facto improvements to the
 relationship; neither appeared eager to tackle the sensitive
 issue of constitutional strictures.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within and outside the country is unrestricted.
 Mexico has traditionally followed a liberal asylum policy
 concerning Central American refugees and asylum seekers from
 other countries. The Government took a significant step
 
 
 MEXICO
 toward regularizing the status of refugees in Mexico with
 promulgation of a new "population law" which for the first
 time provides for the legal recognition of refugees.
 The Government has customarily admitted persons recognized by
 the UNHCR as refugees. Approximately 42,000 Guatemalan
 refugees reside in camps and resettlement areas in the
 southern Mexican states of Chiapas, Campeche, and Quintana
 Roo. The Government estimates that an additional 300,000
 Central Americans, most of them Guatemalans, are living
 illegally in Mexico, most of them in Chiapas, though as many
 as 100,000 may reside in the Federal District. Undocumented
 Central Americans lead a precarious existencq because they are
 subject to deportation if caught and they are often exploited
 by private Mexicans as a source of cheap labor. Some of these
 people will presumably be eligible for refugee status under
 the new population law.
 Also in 1990, the Government granted the 23,000 refugees in
 Chiapas the same permanent resident status already enjoyed by
 19,00& refugees in Campeche and Quintana Roo. Until 1990
 Guatemalan refugees in border states were restricted in their
 movements and opportunities for legal work in order to avoid
 friction with local residents and to discourage permanent
 settlement. Similarly, refugee children born in Mexico were
 not recorded or issued birth certificates and could not claim
 citizenship. This has changed; Guatemalan refugees are now
 permitted to accept work outside their camps and may travel
 freely in the five-state area of Chiapas, Campeche, Quintana
 Roo, Tabasco, and Yucatan.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since 1929, Mexico's government has been controlled by the
 PRI, which has won every presidential race and every
 gubernatorial race except for the 1989 Baja California Norte
 election. To secure its continuance in power, the PRI has
 over the years relied on extensive public patronage, the use
 of government and party organizational resources and,
 according to opposition parties and independent outside
 observers, extensive electoral fraud.
 Following federal elections in 1988, 6 political parties
 obtained legislative representation, with the combined
 opposition holding 327 out of 500 seats in the lower house of
 Congress and the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD)
 holding 4 seats in the 64-seat Senate. The opposition
 collectively made its weight felt on several important issues
 in 1990, including amendments to the Constitution dealing with
 "political-electoral" matters and the Government's bank
 privatization initiative. Increasingly, the opposition is
 taken into actual account in reaching decisions of national
 import. On constitutional amendments, which require the
 approval of two-thirds of the congressional membership, the
 vote of opposition members has been determinant.
 Charges of electoral fraud were heard frequently and
 vociferously throughout the 1988 presidential contest and in
 several major follow-on state elections, notably elections for
 municipal presidents (mayors) in Michoacan, Guerrero, and the
 state of Mexico. In November elections in the state of
 Mexico, an opposition stronghold in the 1988 federal
 elections, the Government claimed a sweeping victory, with
 majorities of up to 20-1, triggering widespread charges of
 vote fraud. Fraud occurs in Mexican elections, particularly
 
 
 694
 MEXICO
 in outlying areas, less so in urban areas where a more
 politically active and perceptive electorate exists. The PRI
 has consistently defended its victories by denying allegations
 of fraud while admitting only that the electoral system is an
 imperfect one which could and should be improved.
 Elections in both Michoacan and Guerrero on December 3, 1989,
 were marred by considerable strife, often violence, extending
 into 1990; postelectoral conflict in Tejupilco, state of
 Mexico, in late 1990 also ended badly with 5 deaths, mostly of
 riot police. In Michoacan and Guerrero, both PRD and PRI
 militants often engaged in battles for the control of town
 halls. A number of deaths were reported, with the Government
 ultimately compelled on April 5 to call in army units to
 Michoacan to quell the disorder. The Government's limited use
 of army troops in Michoacan received a mixed appaisal, though
 many observers agreed the action had a calming effect.
 Historically, electoral violence has been tied to many
 factors, among them electoral fraud, disputes for power among
 local "caciques," between "caciques" and peasants over land
 tenure, and, of late, among drug traffickers in both states.
 The intense political rivalry between PRI and PRD in this
 region exacerbated the situation. The PRD ultimately won 52
 of Michoacan's 113 town balls, including the state capital of
 Morelia, and a handful of Guerrero municipalities.
 The political system saw important new reforms in 1990,
 including the establishment of a new federal electoral code
 (COFIPE) which provided for same-day computation of election
 results, criminal penalties for electoral crimes, and new
 voters lists and identification cards. A new Federal
 Electoral Institute was also established to monitor the
 electoral process. Some opposition critics (PRD and PAN--the
 National Action Party) still believe, however, that the
 Institute as well as state and local electoral bodies remain
 in government hands and that these will continue to decide
 both procedural and substantive questions in the PRI's favor.
 They also allege that the new code will impede the formation
 of electoral alliances, important to the still-divided
 political left. A controversial December reform of the COFIPE
 may have the effect of diminishing opposition congressional
 representation. The true test of COFIPE will come with future
 elections, especially the midterm federal elections in August,
 1991.
 The PRI undertook to reform itself when it held its 14th
 National Assembly in September. The more than 9,500 delegates
 resolved to streamline the party bureaucracy, create a more
 representative 150-member National Political Council to
 supersede the National Executive Committee, and to
 decentralize and democratize the candidate selection process
 for federal, state, and local offices, as well as for party
 leadership positions. Similarly, the PRI declared itself a
 party of citizens affiliated as individuals and not as members
 of sectoral organizations (though dual memberships were left
 untouched).
 In May the Inter-American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC)
 issued its report to the Organization of American States (OAS)
 on a suit filed in 1987 by the National Action Party (PAN)
 charging electoral fraud in state and local elections in
 Durango and Chihuahua in 1985 and 1986. While not condemning
 Mexican elections, the report did say that state electoral
 codes were sufficiently flawed to violate civil and human
 rights. In a later decision, the IAHRC declared the Nuevo
 Leon electoral code in violation as well.
 
 
 695
 MEXICO
 Elections for mayor of Uruapan, Michoacan, were repeated in
 1990 because the first elections were unquestionably flawed.
 The second, held on June 2, also provoked considerable
 dissatisfaction, with three opposition parties (the Authentic
 Party of the Mexican Revolution, PAN, and PRD) charging that
 major alterations to official voter registration lists kept as
 many as 30,000 citizens from voting. The PAN and PRD
 indicated they might file suit with the IAHRC. The election
 results were eventually confirmed. However, the Secretariat
 of Government reportedly agreed, in response to opposition
 complaints, to revise Uruapan's voter lists.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government permits both domestic and international human
 rights groups to operate in Mexico without restrictions or
 harassment. Ranking-Mexican officials routinely meet with
 domestic and international human rights activists to discuss
 human rights problems. In June, President Salinas established
 the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) and appointed
 respected jurist Jorge Carpizo Macgregor as its president.
 The Commission enjoys considerable autonomy in investigating
 abuses, and President Salinas asked the Congress to grant the
 CNDH the authority to subpoena information from government
 officials.
 The CNDH acted effectively in a number of human rights
 complaints during the latter half of 1990. it assumed a major
 role in investigating the murder of Sinaloa human rights
 activist Norma Corona (see Section l.a.). In Tijuana, Baja
 California Norte, some 65 prisoners undertook a hunger strike
 in June at the La Mesa state penitentiary to protest alleged
 physical abuse, as well as to demand judicial review of their
 cases. At least 52 were ultimately placed in "preliberation"
 status after the CNDH intervened (and after the PAN mayor of
 Tijuana went on a sympathy hunger strike). The CNDH also
 recommended prosecution of policemen guilty of torturing La
 Meza inmate Ruben Oropeza Hurtado; Oropeza lost most of his-
 intestine as a result of injuries sustained and finally died
 on October 1. In late September, CNDH head Carpizo called
 upon Tamaulipas Governor Americo Villareal to fire the
 director and sub-director of the Tampico penitentiariy,
 stating that prison conditions had been allowed to deteriorate
 to the point where "flagrant".human rights abuses occurred.
 Also in September, Tabasco State Judicial Police Director Jose
 Conrado Garrido David resigned after the CNDH called upon the
 Governor, Salvador Neme Castillo, to fire him for the
 September 1989 torture and murder of Jesus Manuel Martinez
 Ruiz. The CNDH reported that after his death by drowning,
 Martinez's heart and lungs were removed to prevent
 determination by autopsy of the cause of death.
 In addition to the CNDH, there are four other well-known human
 rights organizations in Mexico. The Mexican Academy of Human
 Rights is composed of leading political and academic figures
 and serves primarily as an information clearinghouse on human
 rights abuses with occasional limited guidance provided to
 individual victims and complainants. The National Commission
 for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights was created in
 1990 by experts formerly associated with the Academy. This
 organization takes a much more direct role in advocating
 individual cases. The National Front Against Repression
 (FMCR) and the Committee in Defense of Prisoners, the
 Persecuted, Disappeared, and Political Exiles of Mexico both

 MEXICO
 take highly public stances on individual human rights cases,
 as well as on the general issues of political prisoners and
 the disappeared. Also, various states, among them
 Aguascalientes and Sinaloa, have moved to create human rights
 commissions at the state level of government.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Mexico takes pride in its Spanish and indigenous origins and
 in the success the country has achieved in fostering a climate
 of racial harmony. Indigenous groups, many of which do not
 speak Spanish, are encouraged to participate in political
 life, and the Government is respectful of the desire of these
 groups to retain elements of their traditional lifestyle.
 However, these groups remain largely outside the country's
 political and economic mainstream, a result not of restrictive
 governmental policy but rather of longstanding patterns of
 economic and social development.
 Historically, women in Mexico have played a subordinate role,
 economically, politically, and socially. However, women are
 becoming increasingly active economically and politically (two
 women are members of President Salinas' Cabinet). Legally,
 women are equal to men. They have the right to file for
 separation and divorce, and to own property in their own
 name. The Constitution provides for equal pay for equal work
 and for maternity leave.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, is not
 infrequent, but there are no reliable statistics on the extent
 to which it occurs. Domestic assault is a crime, but in
 practice-largely due to social tradition-women are often
 reluctant to file reports of abuse or to press charges.   /
 Police are reluctant to intervene in what is often considereZd
 a domestic affair. For the first time in recent history,
 violence against women became an issue of public policy in
 1990 when 61 Federal congresswomen of all political parties
 (PRI, PAN, PRD) undertook to amend the penal code with respect
 to sexual crimes. The bill also represented one of the few
 times the chamber of deputies had ever initiated a piece of
 draft legislation, rather than acting upon a bill handed down
 by the executive. Among its provisions was specialized
 medical and social assistance for rape victims as well as
 penalties for sexual harassment. The number of women's action
 groups is increasing throughout Mexico and they have begun to
 offer counseling and legal services for victims of sexual
 crimes. Notable among these are centers in Tlaxcala and
 Queretaro. In the Federal District, similar services are
 provided by the Attorney General's office, with specially
 trained police officers and counselors available to assist
 victims.
 In a widely publicized case, four MFJP agents serving as
 bodyguards to the Deputy Attorney General for Narcotics
 Matters, Javier Coello Trejo, were arraigned in January on
 rape and robbery charges.  Approximately 20 women in the
 Federal District filed complaints of rape against these MFJP
 agents.   Legal cases against the four were proceeding at
 year's end.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Article 123 of the Constitution provides workers and employers
 the right to form and join unions and professional associations
 of their own choosing without prior authorization. Unions
 must register with the Labor Secretariat, but registration
 requirements are not'onerous. These rights are widely
 exercised in Mexico where a diverse trade union movement
 exists. Approximately 30 percent of the total Mexican work
 force, estimated to be about 26 million, is organized into
 trade union confederations and independent unions. The public
 sector is highly organized in Mexico.
 The principal Mexican trade union organization is the
 Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), which is
 organizationally a major sector of the PRI. Many other union
 organizations are politically independent or support
 opposition parties. All PRI-affiliated federations and a
 number of the independents (a total of 36 organizations)
 belong to the Congress of Labor (CT), a trade union
 coordinating body which represents approximately 85 percent of
 Mexico's organized workers. Criticism of the Government's
 wage policy on the part of the CTM and the CT increased
 markedly during the course of 1990. While the Government's
 relationship with affiliated unions experienced strains during
 the year, the significant presence of union officers in the
 Government, especially in elected positions, and the continued
 heavy union influence in the nominating process for candidates
 at all levels of government, perpetuates a symbiotic
 relationship which limits the freedom of action of unions.
 There were allegations that during 1990 the Government
 initiated pressures, on at least two occasions, which affected
 the integrity of union structures.
 Mexican law grants workers the right to strike. However, the
 Federal Labor Law of 1931, as amended in 1971, sets forth
 lengthy and somewhat cumbersome procedures for calling a legal
 strike and strikes are relatively infrequent. Notice of the
 intent to strike must be filed 6 to 10 days in advance, and
 efforts at conciliation, mediation, and arbitration between
 the parties in dispute are required before a legal strike can
 take place. Local, state, and federal tripartite (labor,
 employer, and government representatives) conciliation and
 arbitration boards perform these functions. Article 123
 grants public sector workers the right to strike under
 specific conditions set by the labor law.
 Several highly publicized strikes occurred in 1990. After
 several months of labor controversy, dissident members of a
 CTM-affiliated union initiated a strike at the Ford Motor
 assembly plant in the state of Mexico on January 8. The
 dispute centered on wage/benefit issues and complaints of
 alleged union leadership-sponsored violence that resulted in
 the death of one worker during a confrontation between
 strikers and alleged strikebreakers. Armed men attacked Ford
 workers on January 8. Subsequently a CTM leader and his two
 sons, and nine associates were arrested and charged with
 responsibility in the attack. Soon after the beginning of the
 strike, it was ruled illegal by the Federal Labor Conciliation
 and Arbitration Board, and 570 workers were eventually fired.
 On July 26, the Ford Motor Company reached an agreement with
 dismissed workers over severance pay compensation, marking an
 end to the labor dispute. On February 15, workers at the
 
 
 698
 MEXICO
 Modelo brewery initiated a strike action over similar issues.
 Like the Ford strike, the Modelo labor dispute was also ruled
 illegal, and involved police intervention. Workers returned
 to their jobs after several months. Other strikes or labor
 disturbances of note occurred in the state university system,
 Coca Cola of Chihuahua state, Olivetti (Tlaxcala state), and
 Dina, among others.
 Mexican unions may, without prior authorization, freely form
 federations or associations and belong to international
 organizations. Early in 1990 a new federation, the
 Confederation of Service and Parastatal Unions (FESBES), made
 up of the Airlines Pilot's Union, Airline Stewardesses and
 Stewards union, Electricians, Telephone Workers, and several
 other smaller unions was formed.
 The CTM is affiliated with the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions and the latter's inter-American regional
 organization. One of the smaller independent unions belongs
 to the Latin American Confederation of Workers. The
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions has one
 minor Mexican affiliate.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Both the right to organize and to bargain collectively are
 provided for by labor law, and are generally respected in
 practice. There appear to be few, if any, restraints on union
 organizing. Collective bargaining is widespread, particularly
 in industry and commerce. The above mentioned tripartite
 boards of conciliation and arbitration promote voluntary
 worker-employer negotiations. The boards have additional,
 statutory responsibilities which include registering
 collective bargaining agreements reached between labor and
 management.
 Workers are legally protected against antiunion
 discrimination; the law is not effectively enforced by the
 Secretariat of Labor. There are no legal requirements for
 unionization in any industry or branch of commerce, but labor
 laws encourage unionization. Although government workers are
 almost fully unionized, collective bargaining in the
 government sector is much less common since bargaining does
 not cover wages and is limited to certain working conditions.
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is respected in
 the export processing or "mauila" zones, although workers in
 some 80 to 90 percent of the firms do not belong to unions,
 the pattern of union organization varying greatly from one
 zone to another. Some observers attribute the low percentage
 of organization to the fact that nonunion "maquila" firms
 provide benefits and working conditions that match or exceed
 those covered by union contracts. A 1990 study by the U.S.
 Department of Labor suggested that antiunion attitudes on the
 part of employers and the existence of "company unions"
 contributed to the low rate of organization in "maquiladora"
 areas. The report cited allegations, denied by the Government
 and the unions, that a tacit agreement was made between the
 Government and the CTM to avoid active organization in the
 "maquila" industries.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Mexico is a signatory to ILO Conventions 29 and 105 regarding
 the prohibition of forced labor, and such practices are also
 
 
 699
 MEXICO
 prohibited by Mexican law. There have been no reports for
 many years of forced labor in Mexico.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law sets the minimum age for employment at 14. Children
 over 14 years but under 16 years of age may work a maximum of
 6 hours per day and are provided additional legal protection.
 They may not be employed in certain hazardous jobs. Child
 labor laws are observed fairly strictly in large and
 medium-sized manufacturing and commercial establishments. This
 is less true in small shops and factories, and many street
 vendors are children. Enforcement of child labor laws is the
 responsibility of the Labor Secretariat and local, state, and
 federal boards of conciliation and arbitration. The above
 mentioned U.S. Department of Labor Study reached the
 conclusion that minimum age legislation is generally complied
 with in the "maqulila" industries.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Constitution provides for a minimum wage for workers, with
 variations for geographic zones and professional
 specializations. The National Minimum Wage Commission--
 another tripartite body--sets the minimum rate of pay,
 approving periodic increases. Since late 1987, successive
 tripartite economic pacts have restricted the frequency of
 wage increases. On December 5, 1989, the Government announced
 a 10-percent increase, bringing the minimum daily wage in
 Mexico City (the highest of the three geographic zones> to
 approximately $3.23. The next adjustment was scheduled for
 December 1990.
 Inflation and frequent devaluations have significantly eroded
 the peso's purchasing power, with the average worker suffering
 a 50-percent decline in real wages since 1982. Although
 inflation in 1990 still appeared to be under control, the
 incremental upward movement of inflation rates and the current,
 minimum wage provides for a barely acceptable standard of
 living for the substantial number of workers who receive it.
 With additional contract benefits, organized workers enjoy a
 somewhat better standard of living than the unorganized. The
 U.S. Labor Department study noted that the Government, in
 controlling the minimum wage (which serves as a benchmark) has
 not always been able to help workers keep up with inflation
 and the devaluations of the peso. It finds itself, according
 to the study, in the difficult position of trying to balance
 its desire to improve the social lot of workers with its
 desire to retain employers who might otherwise go elsewhere.
 The maximum legal workweek is 48 hours. In recent years, the
 average workweek has declined considerably, to a level of
 approximately 42 to 43 hours. The CTM and other Mexican
 unions are currently campaigning for legislation to reduce the
 legal maximum from 48 to 40 hours, and current tripartite
 negotiations have focused on this issue. In practice,
 however, many Mexicans work at more than one job and exceed
 the average 42 to 43 hours per week. The Constitution
 provides for required rest periods, stipulating that workers
 who do, in fact, put in more than 3 hours of overtime per day
 or work overtime more than 3 consecutive days must be paid
 triple his regular wage rate. Anecdotal evidence suggests
 that workers frequently exceed these work hours.

 MEXICO
 With respect to occupational health and safety, legislation is
 relatively advanced and provides substantial protection.
 Health and safety standards are better observed in large
 firms. There appears to be a higher incidence of industrial
 accidents in smaller firms and on construction sites. This
 does not reflect inadequate legislation, but rather too few
 inspection personnel to monitor adequately health and safety
 regulations. Mexican labor law requires the formation of
 mixed commissions of government, labor, and workers to oversee
 security and hygiene; it also sets conditions for compensation,
 due to work-related illness or injury.
