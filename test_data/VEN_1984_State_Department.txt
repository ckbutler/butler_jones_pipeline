 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a republic, with an active democratic multiparty
 system, energetic information media, strong unions, and an
 ardent commitment to democracy.
 In February 1984 control of the Government was peacefully
 transferred from the social Christian Copei party to the
 social democratic Accion Democratica (AD) party, as a result
 of the December 1983 presidential elections, won by Jaime
 Lusinchi, Accion Democratica's standard bearer. Municipal
 council elections also were held in May 1984. Venezuela has
 now enjoyed 26 years of unbroken civilian rule, Lusinchi's
 being the sixth democratically-elected administration.
 Venezuela has a mixed economy, with a large public sector.
 The state-owned petroleum industry accounts for some 20
 percent of the Gross National Product, more than any other
 industry. During the last few years, Venezuela has
 experienced economic problems resulting from a worldwide
 decrease in the demand for petroleum, a large foreign debt,
 and high government spending. Social benefits and supportive
 extended families have somewhat cushioned the impact of
 unemployment.
 Human rights violations, when they occur, tend to be well-
 publicized and investigated. Venezuela is one of the most
 active participants in international human rights forums and
 is noted within the hemisphere as a proponent of civil
 liberties and democratic rule. The principal focus of human
 rights debate within Venezuela is on deficiencies in the
 country's judicial system; delays in the trials of detainees
 are frequent, and there have been allegations of improper
 influence in the courts. Inadequate prison conditions have
 been the subject of recent official reports.
 Guerrilla activity has not been a major problem since the late
 1960s. Small nuclei of guerrilla activity exist, but they do
 not constitute a threat to the security situation of the
 country.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom Prom:
 a. Political Killing
 Authorities do not permit or engage in unlawful or arbitrary
 killing for political motives. There has been evidence,
 however, of a tendency by the police and security forces to
 shoot and kill criminal suspects on sight. Although not
 condoning these occurrences, the authorities have not acted
 effectively to stop them.
 b. Disappearance
 Police authorities do not abduct, secretly arrest, or hold
 people in clandestine confinement. The authorities have
 resorted to the use of checkpoints to induct young men who
 have evaded obligatory military service. The inductees are at
 times held incommunicado for a month with no word to family or
 friends as to their whereabouts or physical condition.

 VENEZUELA
 In April 1984 suspected Colombian National Liberation Army
 (ELN) guerrillas kidnapped a Venezuelan rancher and later
 released him after 42 days of captivity when his relatives
 paid a large ransom.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Venezuelan law prohibits the torture of prisoners; this
 prohibition is respected in practice. Guarantees for the
 integrity of the individual embodied in the Constitution
 are enforced.
 Laws prohibiting cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are generally respected. Some infractions occur,
 however, because of excesses on the part of local law
 enforcement officials or inadequate supervision of prison
 guards. Prison conditions are spartan, at times very poor;
 many prisons are seriously overcrowded, discipline is
 sometimes inadequate, and violence does occur, especially in
 the more crowded prisons. Those responsible for such violence
 are not known to be punished. A contributing factor is the
 low educational level and limited training of many prison
 guards.
 There were several protests by prisoners and their relatives
 against prison conditions in both civilian and military
 institutions in 1984. The authorities promised full
 investigations. The Attorney General's most recent report
 (1983) highlighted problems within the prison system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Habeas Corpus is a right guaranteed by law and is respected.
 Arrested persons legally cannot be held more than eight days
 without formal charges. The limits are frequently exceeded,
 however, usually because of inefficiencies in the legal
 system. According to the Attorney General's 1983 report,
 approximately 75 percent of the 24,000 persons in prison have
 not yet been brought to trial.
 The case of four individuals charged with the bombing of a
 Cuban airliner and detained since 1976 still has not been
 resolved. Following a ruling finding the earlier charges
 defective, the case is now being retried.
 The detention of undocumented foreign workers, mainly from
 Colombia, may have diminished as illegal immigration has
 declined. Once in police custody, undocumented foreign
 nationals are frequently held incommunicado for three to six
 months without trial before being deported.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is guaranteed by law and usually observed in
 practice. The accused is presumed innocent until guilt is
 proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
 The civilian judiciary is independent of any other authority.
 In response to the current administration's campaign against
 corruption, there has been increased public sensitivity to the
 qualificatons of judges, the quality of their work and their
 
 
 698
 VENEZUELA
 susceptibility to outside influence. The Judicial Council, an
 independent body responsible for the training, nomination and
 disciplining of judges, actively investigates allegations of
 inappropriate conduct, and has taken severe disciplinary
 action in a number of cases, including the recent dismissal of
 one senior judge. The administration is aware that further
 efforts are required.
 Civilians charged with armed subversion are tried by military
 courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution and laws provide safeguards against arbitrary
 interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 These safeguards are honored in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Venezuela boasts a free and vigorous daily press, 3 nationwide
 television networks, a regional television station, about 156
 radio stations, and numerous magazines; they are frequently
 highly critical of the authorities. The Government owns and
 operates two of the four television networks and two of the
 radio stations. Venezuela's print media is privately owned.
 Within the cultural and academic arenas, censorship or
 interference on political grounds rarely occur.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is respected.
 Public meetings, including those of all political parties, are
 held frequently, without interference. In the interest of
 public safety, permits are required for protest marches; they
 are routinely granted.
 An object of "special protection' under the Constitution,
 labor unions are free, independent, and powerful. The right
 to strike is exercised without official interference. Unions
 associate with the recognized public and private international
 bodies in their fields. The Confederacion de Trabajadores de
 Venezuela, an International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 affiliate, dominates organized labor in Venezuela, and has
 close ties to the ruling AD party. Other confederations
 occupy a lesser role on the labor scene, including two which
 are of Christian Democratic orientation and which are
 affiliated with the Latin American Confederation of Workers
 and have ties to the World Confederation of Labor.
 Professional and academic associations flourish without
 interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic. Most
 religious groups enjoy freedom of worship and are allowed to
 proselytize actively. A number of Protestant evangelical
 groups in-remote areas of Venezuela are performing
 humanitarian as well as missionary work among the local
 population.

 VENEZUELA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens of Venezuela generally have freedom of movement to
 travel within the country and abroad and to return. The one
 exception pertains to travel in the Amazon Region of the
 country, which requires a special permit for security
 reasons.
 Venezuelans may emigrate without restriction. Citizenship can
 be renounced. The Constitution provides for the revocation of
 citizenship for naturalized citizens on limited legal
 grounds. Recovery of nationality requires a residence period
 of two years for Venezuelan-born repatriates.
 Venezuela has traditionally been a haven for refugees and
 displaced persons from many European and Latin American
 countries. As Venezuela does not recognize a "refugee status'
 for entry, refugees are given normal residence status and once
 within the country are expelled only for criminal activities.
 A special *family reunification program' exists for Cuban
 refugees living in Venezuela.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is freely elected by its people. As a
 multiparty democracy, the political process is open to all;
 opposition views are freely expressed and persons from the
 entire political spectrum contend for positions ranging from
 municipal council seats to the nation's presidency.
 Some of the minor parties are outgrowths of former guerrilla
 organizations, and they currently hold about 7 percent of the
 seats in the national legislature. Their participation in the
 political process is encouraged and supported by the two major
 centrist parties, social Christian and social democrat,
 reflecting a widespread desire to have radical elements
 participate in the electoral process rather than engage in
 armed insurrection.
 Section 4' Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Venezuela is a frequent and vocal critic of governments in
 Latin America and elsewhere that commit or tolerate widespread
 human rights violations. It similarly supports international
 human rights organizations. Venezuela accepts the
 jurisdiction of the Inter-American Human Rights Commission.
 An Amnesty International office and the Latin American
 Foundation for Human Rights and Social Development operate
 freely in Caracas. Venezuela in 1984 was the site of numerous
 international forums dealing with the issue of human rights.
 Venezuela is a member of the UN Human Rights Commission.
 Amnesty International did not include Venezuela in its 1984
 report. Freedom House describes Venezuela as 'free.'

 VENEZUELA
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 In 1984 Venezuela continued to experience economic
 difficulties that required retrenchment of public sector
 spending and an upward adjustment of prices to reflect real
 costs. The country continues in economic recession
 accompanied by unemployment, variously estimated to be between
 13 and 25 percent, and an increase in business bankruptcies.
 There has been a considerable ecrease in general purchasing
 power. Although the Government has sought to cushion the
 social effects, the poorest strata of the population live a
 marginal existence worsened by these adverse economic
 conditions. Despite austerity, the Government continues
 efforts to improve education, housing, and public health
 services for poorer Venezuelans. It has adopted a series of
 compensatory measures to offset the impact of decreased buying
 power on poorer workers and is actively seeking to create new
 jobs and combat inflation.
 Restrictions on property rights based on sex, religion or
 social status do not exist, but there are some restrictons on
 ownership of business property based on nationality.
 Women are increasingly active in all political parties,
 professions, public administration, and the judiciary. Two
 women occupy positions in the current cabinet as heads of the
 education and youth ministries. About a dozen are members of
 the Chamber of Deputies, including one who is the assistant
 leader of the AD parliamentary faction and another who is a
 vice president of a permanent committee. Both major political
 parties have women members on the national executive
 committees.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex,
 and accords women and children *special protection' in the
 workplace. Women workers receive extensive maternity leave
 benefits, and laws limit their amount of involuntary overtime.
 Women are heavily represented in many of the professions but
 continue to be underrepresented in the political and economic
 sectors and differences still exist in wage and employment
 opportunities. Overall there is a firm trend toward greater
 equality for women. Recent reforms in Venezuelan laws have
 been designed to promote greater economic rights for women.
 In 1984, the population was 17,279,000 with a growth rate of
 3 percent. Life expectancy at birth is 68.5 years and the
 infant mortality rate is 35.7 per 1,000 live births. The
 ratio of calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirements was 102 per cent in 1977. The
 adjusted primary school enrollment ratio was 102 per cent in
 1981 and the adult literacy rate, 77 per cent in 1971.
