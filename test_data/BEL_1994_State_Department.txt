 BELGIUM
 Belgium is a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarch who plays
 a maly symbolic role. The Council of Ministers (Cabinet), led by the Prime Min-
 ister, holds office as long as it retains the confidence of the bicameral Parliament.
 Constitutional reforms enacted in 1993 transformed Belgium into a federal state.
 The next general elections, to be held by the end of 1995 will replace regional coun-
 cils with directly elected legislatures in Duth-speaking Flanders and French-speak-
 ing Wallonia.
 Civilian authorities are in effective command of the national, municipal, and judi-
 cial police forces.
 Belgium is a highly industrialized state with a vigorous private sector and govern-
 ment participation in certain industries. An extensive social welfare system sup-
 ports a high standard of living for most Belgians.
 The Constitution and laws contain provisions safeguarding human rights, and the
 Government enforces them. In 1994 Parliament broadened existing antiracism legis-
 lation and passed a new law giving children a voice in judicial proceedings that af-
 fect them. A parliamentary commission published the results of its 15-month in-
 quiry into human trafficking in Belgium, and the police and judiciary cracked down
 on prostitution rings. Applications for political asylum dropped dramatically due to
 strict policies adopted late in 1993.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reports of such kill-
 in. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of such treatment or punishment.
 Allegations of human rights abuses by Belgian forces serving in the U.N. oper-
 ations in Somalia in 1992 and 1993 led to in-depth investigations by the Military
 Prosecutor's Office, covering 265 complaints; it concluded that in most cases the sol-
 diers took appropriate action, but that 5 cases involving 8 paracommandos war-
 ranted prosecution. In December three of the eight were acquitted. In January 1995
 four were given short prison terms and/or fines, and one was sentenced to 5 years
 in prison for the murder of a Somali. The Ministry of Defense conducted an inquest
 into the experience in Somalia which led to recommendations for the conduct of fu-
 ture operations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Freedom from arbitrary arrest and im-
 prisonment is provided for by law and the Government respects these rights. Ar-
 rested persons must be brought belore a judge within 24 hours. Pretrial confinement
 is allowed only under certain legally specified circumstances. The premise for such
 confinement is subject to monthly review by a panel of judges, which may extend
 pretrial detention based on carefully circumscribed criteria (e.g., whether, in the
 court's view, the arrested person would be likely to commit further crimes or at-
 tempt to flee the jurisdiction if released). Arrested persons are allowed prompt ac-
 cess to a lawyer of their choosing or, if they cannot afford one, an attorney ap-
 pointed by the State. Bail exists in principle under Belgian law but is rarely grant-
 ed.
 Exile is not permitted by law and does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law ensures a fair public trial, and the au-
 thorities honor this in practice. When a preliminary judicial investigatory phase is
 completed, a suspect is formally charged if the evidence so warrants. Charges are
 clearly and formally stated, and there is a presumption of innocence.
 Defendants have the rights to be present, to have counsel (at public expense if
 needed), to confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to appeal. The Constitution
 provides for the judiciary's independence, and the Government respects this. Mili-
 taW tribunals try military personnel for common-law as well as military crimes. All
 military tribunals consist of four officers and a civilian judge; at the appellate level,
 
 
 751
 
 the civilian judge presides. The accused has the right of appeal to a higher military
 court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home or Correspondene.a-Free-
 doam from arbitrary state interference with privacy is guaranteed by law and re-
 spected in practice. Search warrants issued by a judge are required unless the in-
 habitants of a domicile agree to a search.
 In 1994 Parliament passed legislation under which law enforcement officials may
 apply to a magistrate for permission to use wiretaps. Permission is generally grant-
 ed only for limited periods of time and only for the investigation of major crimes.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for these freedoms, and the
 Government respects them. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a func-
 tioning democratic political system combine to ensure there are no unwarranted re-
 strictions.
 The Government operates several radio and television networks but does not con-
 trol program content. Programs are supervised by boards of directors which rep-
 resent the main political, linguistic, and opinion groups. A government representa-
 tive sits on each board but has no veto power. Private radio and television stations
 operate with government licenses. Almost all homes have access by cable to tele-
 vision from other Western European countries and elsewhere abroad.
 There are restrictions on the press regarding libel, slander, and the advocacy of
 racial or ethnic discrimination, hate, or violence. In two much-publicized cases,
 members of far-right political parties were tried for publishing materials deemed
 racist; none were found guilty.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peacefzd Assembly and Association.-Public assembly is unrestricted
 except for restrictions on blocking some major thoroughfares and on entering a
 small zone near the Royal Palace and Parliament. The Government requires spon-
 sors of open-air assemblies to obtain permits, but these are granted routinely. Citi-
 zens are free to form organizations and establish ties to international bodies, but
 the Antiracism Law (see Section 5) prohibits membership in organizations that prac-
 tice discrimination overtly and repeatedly.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government does not hinder the teaching or practice
 of any faith. The law accords "recognized" status to Roman Catholicism, Protestant-
 ism, Judaism, Anglicanism, Islam, and Greek and Russian Orthodoxy, and these re-
 ceive subsidies drawn from general government revenues; objecting taxpayers have
 no recourse against contributing to religious subsidies. By law, each "recognized" re-
 ligion has the right to provide teachers for religious instruction in the schools, but
 not all avail themselves of this right.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Belgians are free to travel both within the country and abroad, to re-
 turn, and to emigrate.
 All asylum-seekers in Belgium can plead their cases before immigration authori-
 ties. In 1994 the Interior Ministry cleared a backlog of applications that in 1993
 numbered in the thousands. The Ministry now usually makes its initial decision
 within a week of receipt. The law requires that rejected applicants be deported with-
 in 2 months, but it grants them the right to appeal. There have been no reports
 of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Applications for political asylum fell by about 60 percent in 1994 owing to tight-
 ened policies introduced in September 1993, which include denying work permits to
 asylum-seekers awaiting decision, and fingerprinting all applicants (to prevent them
 from obtaining social benefits in more than one municipality). Also, the law now
 permits rejected applicants to be detained in special centers while awaiting deporta-
 tion; three centers opened in 1994.
 Parliament approved legislation in April creating a system of centralized registra-
 tion, which should be in place in 1995, to replace the current one which calls for
 asylum-seekers to register in their chosen municipality of residence. In theory, those
 whose cases are pending would still be able to choose the municipality where they
 would reside and receive social benefits; but in practice, their choice might be lim-
 ited by the Government's initiative to distribute asylum-seekers more equitably
 around the country. Currently, certain municipalities with large foreign-born popu-
 lations have permission from the Government to refuse until 1995 legal residence
 to any foreigners from outside the European Union.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Direct popular elections for parliamentary seats (excluding some senators elected
 by provincial councils and others elected by Senate members) are held at least every
 4 years under a system of universal, secret, and compulsory (under penalty of fine)
 suffrage for all citizens age 18 and over.
 Opposition parties operate without repression. A four-party coalition constitutes
 the current Government.
 There are no restrictions, in law or practice, on the participation of women or mi-
 norities in government or politics. Two of 16 federal ministers are women. In the
 federal Parliament, 9 percent (18 of 212) of House members and 11 percent (19 of
 184) of the senators are women. The law requires a minimum level of representation
 of 25 percent for each sex on electoral tickets. The figure will rise to 33 percent after
 the next national elections in 1995.
 The existence of communities speaking Dutch, French, and German engenders
 significant complexities for the State. All major institutions, including political par-
 ties, are divided along lingistic lines. There are specific previsions for Dutch-,
 French-, and German-speaking councils at the regional level. National decisions
 take into account the needs of regional and linguistic groups.
 A package of constitutional reforms passed in 1993 is intended to decentralize au-
 thority. Beginning with the next general elections, to be held no later than Decem-
 ber 1995, the regional ouncils will beome directly eleted assemblies which in turn
 will each elect from among its members the respective regional government's mem-
 bers. The number of seats in both houses of the federal Parliament will be sharply
 reduced.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several active independent human rights groups operate freely without govern-
 ment interference. No requests have been made for outside investigation of the
 human rights situation in Belgium.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The Government actively promotes women's rights. In 1992 the Ministry
 of Labor created a Division of Equal Opportunity (EOD), whose priorities include
 combating violence against women and sexual harassment, encouraging women to
 participate in the political process and to run for elected office, and monitoring af-
 firmative action programs.
 In 1994 the EOD placed considerable emphasis on fighting sexual harassment.
 Having created in 1993 a Dutch-language telephone hot-line through which victims
 of sexual harassment could anonymously obtain information and guidance, free of
 charge, in 1994 the EOD started a French-language one. The usefulness of these
 hot-lines will be evaluated officially in early 1995. In addition, a recent law requires
 each private-sector workplace with at least 50 employees to have a sexual-harass-
 ment ombudsman, and so far an estimated 80 percent of these workplaces have
 complied. The EOD is seeking to expand this program to the public sector.
 The law prohibits organizing prostitution or assisting immigration for prostitu-
 tion. In March the parliamentary Commission on Human Trafficking (CHT) re-
 leased the findings of its 15-month investigations of such activities in several Bel-
 gian cities and of police responses to them. It concluded that the activities were
 widespread and that police action was often insufficient, occasionally due to corrup-
 tion but more often to inadequate training and poor coordination. The CRT's report
 made several recommendations for overcoming these problems. The police succeeded
 in closing down several clubs employing foreign women as prostitutes, and at year's
 end an alleged major figure in this trade was in pretrial detention.
 The law prohibits physical abuse of women, and the Government enforces this
 ban. Available data do not indicate that abuse of women is widespread in Belgium.
 A government-sponsored study estimated that 6.5 percent of women had experi-
 enced rape or attempted rape and 5.2 percent had suffered serious physical or sex-
 ual violence from their partners. Legislation on sexual abuse was last amended in
 1989, when the definition of rape was broadened and penalties made more severe.
 The Justice Ministry provides comprehensive training materials to police, medical
 workers, and others who deal with victims of sexual abuse.
 In August the Army dropped all distinctions between men and women in its regu-
 lations. Women are now eligible to apply for any position in the armed forces, ut
 they are required to meet physical standards that are the same for both sexes.
 
 
 753
 Children.-Belgium has comprehensive child-protection laws, which the Govern-
 ment enforces effectively. The Francophone and Flemish communities have agencies
 dealing with children's needs.
 On October 1, a new law took effect giving children the right to a voice in court
 cases that affect them, such as divorce proceedings. The law states that a minor "ca-
 pable of understanding" can request permission to be heard by a judge, or a judge
 can request an interview with a child.
 Child prostitution is of limited scope in Belgium. The CHT's report in March rec-
 ommended stronger government action to combat it. The Government issues printed
 materials and videos aimed at raising public awareness of child abuse.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Belgium is a pluralistic society in which in-
 dividual differences in general are respected and linguistic rights in particular are
 protected. Some 60 percent of citizens are native Dutch-speakers; about 40 percent
 French-speakers; and a small minority, German-speakers.
 In April the 1981 Antiracism Law was amended to increase penalties for incite-
 ment of discrimination, hate, or violence based on the race, ethnicity, or nationality.
 The amendments also made it specifically illegal for providers of goods or services
 (including housing) to discriminate on the basis of any of these factors, and for em-
 ployers to consider these factors in their decisions to hire, train, or dismiss person-
 nel.
 The Center for Equal Opportunity and Against Racism (CEOAR), charged by Par-
 liament with promoting integration and interethnic dialog, initiated legal proceed-
 ings against certain members of the Front National and Agir, two major
 Francophone far-right political parties, under the 1981 law. This law, however, has
 only rarely been applied successfully.
 In the European Parliament elections in June and the provincial and municipal
 elections in October, the far-right, openly anti-immigrant parties (the Flemish
 Vlaams Blok and Walloon Front National and AGIR) received somewhat stronger
 support than had generally been foreseen, but their backing was concentrated in a
 few urban areas. Following the elections, Belgium's mainstream political parties
 honored pledges not to form government coalitions with the far right.
 Although immigration policy continues to be controversial, there have been no
 overt campaigns of violence against immigrants. In May arsonists attacked an unoc-
 cupied hostel for asylum-seekers which was under construction in Wallonia. In June
 a Moroccan was wounded by gunfire in Verviers in skirmishes provoked by a Bel-
 gium-Morocco World Cup soccer match. Tensions in several imigrant neighbor-
 hoods decreased due to outreach programs by local police and to the construction
 of various youth-oriented facilities.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government mandates that public buildings erect-
 ed since 1970 be accessible to the disabled, and for other buildings it offers subsidies
 to induce owners to make such modifications.
 The Government provides financial assistance for the disabled. It offers special
 aid for parents of disabled children and for disabled parents. Regional and commu-
 nity programs provide other assistance for the handicapped, such as job training.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to associate freely and to
 strike; the Government does not hamper such activities. The law prohibits actions
 against a union that is seeking to be legally registered. Unions are independent of
 the Government but have important informal links with major political parties. Bel-
 gian unions are affiliated with international labor organizations.
 There were a number of strikes in 1994. For some public employees, such as those
 who provide essential public services, the right to strike is not explicitly recognized;
 but they often do strike. Laws and regulations prohibit retribution against strikers
 and union leaders, and the Government effectively enforces these provisions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize and
 bargain collectively is recognized and exercised freely. The Belgian business federa-
 tions and unions negotiate every other year a nationwide collective bargaining
 agreement covering the 2.4 million private-sector workers, which establishes the
 framework for negotiations at plants and branches.
 The law prohibits discrimination against organizers and members of unions, and
 protects against termination of contracts of members of workers' councils, members
 of health or safety committees, and shop stewards. Employers found guilty of
 antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 Effective mechanisms exist for adjudicating disputes between labor and manage-
 ment.
 Belgium has no export processing zones.
 
 
 754
 
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of children is 15, but schooling is compulsory until the age of 18. Youth between
 the ages of 15 and 18 may participate in part-time work/part-time study programs.
 Students may also sign summer-labor contracts of up to 30 days. During that pe-
 riod, they can work the same number of hours as adults. The labor courts effectively
 monitor compliance with national laws and standards.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In June the monthly national minimum wage
 rate for workers age 21 and over was set at $1,333 (42,469 Belgian francs); 18-year-
 olds can be paid 82 percent of the minimum, 19-year-olds 88 percent, and 20-year-
 olds 94 percent. The minimum wage rate coupled with Belgium's generous social
 benefits, provides workers with a standard of living appropriate to a developed na-
 tion.
 Minimum wages in the private sector are set in biennial nationwide collective bar-
 gaining (see Secion 6.b.), Which leads to a formal agreement signed by the National
 Labor Council and made mandatory for the entire private sector by royal decree.
 In the public sector, the minimum wage is determined in negotiations between the
 Government and the public-service unions. The Ministry of Labor effectively en-
 forces the law regarding minimum wages.
 By law the standard workweek cannot exceed 40 hours and must have at least
 one 24-hour rest period. Many collective bargaining agreements set standard work-
 weeks of 36 to 39 hours. The law requires overtime pay for hours worked in excess
 of the standard. Work done from the 9th to the 11th hour per day or from the 40th
 to the 50th hour per week is considered allowable overtime. In special cases work-
 days of up to 12 hours and workweeks of up to 52 hours are permitted. Work beyond
 12 hours per day or 52 hours per week is not permitted.
 Collective bargaining agreements include provisions for worker safety in addition
 to the comprehensive ones mandated by law. Workers have the right to remove
 themselves from situations that endanger their safety or health, without jeopardy
 to their continued employment, and the law protects workers who file complaints
 about such situations. The Labor Ministry implements health and safety legislation
 through a team of inspectors and determines whether workers qualif for disability
 and medical benefits. Health and safety committees are mandated by law in compa-
 nies with more than 50 employees and by works councils in companies with more
 than 100 employees. Labor courts monitor effectively compliance with national
 health and safety laws and standards.
