 ZIMBABWE
 Zimbabwe is governed by an executive president, Robert Mugabe,
 and his Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front),
 ZANU(PF), which has dominated the legislative and executive
 branches of government since independence in 1980. The
 National Assembly was last elected by secret popular vote in
 the 1985 general elections. The only other major political
 party, the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU), served until
 recently as the parliamentary opposition. In December 1987,
 the leadership of ZANU and ZAPU signed an agreement to unify
 the two parties. This agreement was subsequently ratified at
 separate party congresses held in the spring of 1988. The
 unity process was expected to be completed in 1989.
 The security forces are divided into three branches. The
 Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) is responsible for maintaining
 law and order. The Central Intelligence Organization (CIO),
 attached to the President's office, has both intelligence and
 counterintelligence functions. The armed forces, particularly
 the army, are involved in major external operations in
 Mozambique in support of that country's Government and also in
 internal security operations, particularly with regard to
 securing the eastern border against infiltration by bands of
 the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) guerrillas
 operating from Mozambique. The army was also previously
 active in antidissident operations in North and South
 Matabeleland, the western provinces of Zimbabwe. During the
 period 1982-85, the security forces were deployed in these
 provinces to put down antigovernment dissidents. These
 operations resulted in serious human rights abuses.
 Zimbabwe has a mixed economy that features well-developed
 agricultural and industrial private sectors. Economic growth
 is constrained, however, by a chronic shortage of foreign
 exchange to purchase needed commodities from overseas. In an
 effort to reduce dependency on South African transportation
 links (the greater portion of Zimbabwean foreign trade moves
 through South African ports), the Government deployed a
 significant portion of its-armed forces inside Mozambique to
 safeguard road and rail links connecting Mozambican ports to
 Zimbabwean cities while at the same time supporting the
 Government of Mozambique against the RENAMO insurgency.
 Overall the economy improved moderately in 1988 due to the
 mining sector's recovery and heavy rains which helped
 agriculture rebound from serious drought.
 The ZANU/ZAPU unity agreement in December 1987 contributed
 significantly in 1988 to a trend towards decreased human
 rights abuses by government security forces. Prior to the
 agreement, security forces in the western provinces persecuted
 ZAPU members and curtailed ZAPU party activity. Since the
 formation of a new cabinet in January, political tensions in
 western Zimbabwe have relaxed remarkably. At the same time,
 dissident violence came to an end with the announcement of an
 amnesty program in April. The Government used threats of
 raids by RENAMO guerrillas across the eastern border and
 infiltration by agents of the South African Government as
 justification for once again eztending the state of emergency
 in July, which permits long-term detention without charge or
 trial. The civil war in Mozambique caused over 100,000
 Mozambicans to seek refuge in Zimbabwe. Although the
 Government provided above-average relief assistance to refugee
 camp residents, there were credible reports that Mozambican
 refugees were on occasion refused entry into Zimbabwe by
 
 
 422
 ZIMBABWE
 security forces on the border and that at least 8,000
 Mozambicans were forcibly repatriated, without the benefit of
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 protection, by Zimbabwean authorities in 1988.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known reports of political killings by
 government security forces in 1988. The murder of unarmed
 civilians by armed "dissidents" operating in North and South
 Matabeleland and Midland provinces continued until April 19,
 when President Mugabe announced the Government's amnesty
 program. The final attack by dissidents took place on that
 date when a missionary was killed and another seriously
 wounded. There were no further significant attacks by
 dissidents after the April amnesty announcement, and 113
 dissidents surrendered to security forces. This amnesty was
 part of a wider program of reconciliation between the
 ZANU-dominated Government and the erstwhile ZAPU opposition.
 The Government pardoned 88 members of the police, army, CIO,
 and ZANU Youth League, who were convicted or accused of crimes
 in connection with antidissident activities.  A CIO officer,
 condemned to death in 1988 for the shooting death of a
 prisoner whom the officer was interrogating, was also pardoned.
 In the eastern border areas, RENAMO guerrillas continued
 brutally to attack and kidnap unarmed civilians. One white
 commercial farmer was shot and wounded by RENAMO, but the vast
 majority of RENAMO attacks have been on peasants in the
 communal farming areas. RENAMO purports to be attacking
 Zimbabwean targets in retaliation for Zimbabwe's military
 support for the Government of Mozambique. Reports of some of
 these cross-border attacks appeared in the local press, and
 while the total number of these killings by RENAMO guerrillas
 is not publicly available, it is thought to number in the
 hundreds.
 b. Disappearance
 Human rights observers reported no new cases of disappearances
 attributable to the Government. However, no progress was made
 in locating those persons, most of whom were from
 Matabeleland, who disappeared during the security forces'
 crackdown in 1982-85. A group of relatives of some of those
 who disappeared from the Silobela Communal Lands continued to
 pursue their lawsuit against government officials who they
 allege failed to investigate adequately the disappearances.
 RENAMO guerrillas, attacking civilian targets in the eastern
 border areas, continued to abduct people, forcing them to
 serve as porters for looted goods to be carried back into
 Mozambique. The Government has not disclosed the number of
 Zimbabweans who were kidnaped by RENAMO, but relatives of
 these kidnaped persons have reported that many of them never
 returned home and are presumed dead.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The leading human rights organization in Zimbabwe did not
 receive any complaints of torture by security forces in 1988,
 
 
 423
 ZIMBABWE
 and the local press published only one allegation of torture
 by security officials. This allegation was made by Odile
 Harrington, a South African national who was then on trial
 (and subsequently convicted) for spying for the South African
 intelligence service. The Chief Justice, in reviewing the
 trial and sentence, noted the failure of the prosecution and
 trial judge to respond to these allegations, and reduced the
 sentence from 25 to 12 years for extenuating circumstances.
 There have also been unpublicized allegations, which were not
 reported to local human rights groups, of torture or
 mistreatment of persons arrested in 1988 by the security
 forces investigating South African espionage and infiltration
 activities. One such prisoner, Philip Conjwayo, one of the
 three "Trenance Bombers," alleged that the police had applied
 electric shocks and held his head under water during his
 interrogation. Evidence presented by physicians during his
 trial was inconclusive. There have been few, if any,
 instances of police or security officials being tried and
 punished for such abuses in recent years. Although there is
 no pattern of official police mistreatment, brutality by
 police officers did occasionally occur, and police used
 excessive force in putting down student demonstrations in
 September. 'In July the local press gave prominent attention
 to a complaint by a woman that she and her baby were kicked
 and beaten by a policeman during a disagreement over a
 hospital bill.
 In January the Supreme Court ruled that corporal punishment is
 unconstitutional. The practice has since stopped.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Zimbabwean criminal law, in theory and practice, requires that
 a person arrested on a criminal charge must have a preliminary
 hearing before a magistrate within 48 hours. At that hearing,
 the magistrate decides whether the arrested person should be
 released on bail or held in custody until trial. However, the
 Minister of Home Affairs can issue a certificate which denies
 bail to a person under arrest even if the court has approved
 it. The Government has often used this prerogative in
 security-related or exchange control violations.
 The state of emergency empowers security officers to detain
 persons without charge for up to 30 days; after 7 days they
 must be informed of the reasons for detention which may be
 quite vague. The great majority of detainees are held only
 for a short time. It is impossible to estimate the number of
 short-term detainees at any one time.
 There are, however, a few cases of detainees who are held
 beyond the 30-day limit. Any person held in detention over 30
 days is entitled to a review of the grounds for the detention
 order by a special tribunal, which may recommend continued
 detention or release. The President may order the Ministry of
 Home Affairs to overrule the tribunal's decision, as was done
 in 1987 in the case of John Austin and Neil Harper, who had
 been detained since 1986 on suspicion of spying. In January
 1988, however, Austin and Harper were released from detention
 on the recommendation of the review tribunal.
 The Government has made extensive use of its emergency powers
 regulations -in vaguely defined security cases, particularly in
 the absence of solid evidence of wrongdoing. In 1988 these
 regulations were invoked primarily in the Government's
 
 
 424
 ZIMBABWE
 campaign against RENAMO and South African infiltrators. For
 example, the local press reported on August 2 that the
 Government dropped charges against six persons who were facing
 trial on accusations of contravening the Official Secrets
 Act. Nevertheless, the Government still considers these
 persons to be serious threats to public security and continued
 to detain them under the state of emergency regulations. They
 were arrested in September 1987 on suspicion of spying for the
 South African Government. It is unlikely that the Government
 will allow the state of emergency to lapse in the near future.
 Detainees are not held incommunicado. They are permitted
 private consultations with legal counsel "without delay."
 Persons are also provided with the reasons for their detention
 so that they can make meaningful representations before the
 review tribunal. Human rights groups observed a significant
 decrease in 1988 of the number of persons held in long-term
 detention, but no one outside the Government is certain of the
 exact number of long-term detainees. Informed estimates range
 from 5 to 20. One RENAMO operative was tried and convicted in
 Zimbabwe for terrorism and murder, but there are credible
 reports that very few, if any, RENAMO forces are detained in
 Zimbabwe.
 In most security or political cases, the Government orders the
 arrest and prosecution of persons under the Law and Order
 (Maintenance) Act,. which provides sanctions for illegal acts
 of a political nature, and occasionally under the Official
 Secrets Act. Such cases are handled as part of the criminal
 judicial process, including recourse to public trial.
 Exile is not employed by the Government as a means of
 politically controlling dissidents. With regard to forced or
 compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Zimbabwe's legal system is based on a mixture of Roman-Dutch
 law and English common law practices and procedures which
 presume the innocence of a person on trial. The judicial
 system is divided into three levels: magisterial (set up in
 ascending tiers of district, provincial, and regional courts),
 the High Court to hear cases of capital crimes, and the
 Supreme Court for appeal. There is also a system of customary
 courts that adjudicate a very limited range of civil
 complaints at the community level. In November the Government
 announced that it would be restoring to traditional chiefs
 some of the judicial powers and functions that had been taken
 away at independence. Decisions by the chiefs would be
 appealable in the regular court system.
 The judicial system is independent of government control and
 does exercise its freedom to decide against the Government,
 even in controversial cases. While some magistrates lack
 thorough training and are inexperienced, many judges,
 particularly those on the High Court and the Supreme Court,
 have good judicial reputations. According to statute, the
 executive branch is not obliged to award damages to
 plaintiffs, even if so ordered by the courts.
 All trials are open to the public, except in very rare cases
 in which the Government orders the proceedings be held in
 camera. The Government has resorted to in camera proceedings,
 sometimes held in prison, in certain security cases. The
 Government was particularly concerned about the security of
 
 
 425
 ZIMBABWE
 alleged South African agents in custody because of an abortive
 attempt in June by presumed South African operatives to
 intercept and free the accused on their way to the courthouse
 for trial.
 Defendants must in most cases retain their own counsel in view
 of the dearth of public defenders. Public defenders are only
 available to persons accused of capital crimes. There is a
 serious shortage of practicing attorneys (estimated to number
 fewer than 500, most of whom are concentrated in the principal
 urban areas). Because of the relatively prohibitive cost for
 most people to engage a private attorney, the vast majority of
 civil and criminal trials are heard without the presence of
 defense counsel. The right to appeal exists for all cases.
 A substantial case backlog resulted in considerable delays in
 bringing many cases to trial. The backlog is, to a large
 extent, due to the lack of resources and trained personnel.
 The police are often slow in assembling the case docket, which
 must be completed and transferred to the prosecutor's office
 before a trial date can be set. Delays of more than a year
 are common. The court reviews every 2 weeks the cases of all
 persons awaiting trial. In a few cases of prolonged delay,
 magistrates have threatened to release the accused if the
 police did not complete the case docket forthwith.
 With the advent of ZANU-ZAPU unity'and amnesty, there are no
 political prisoners as such in Zimbabwe. A sizable number of
 erstwhile ZAPU members or supporters are still in prison for
 dissident-related criminal acts, such as desertion from the
 army or armed robbery, which may have been politically
 motivated. These persons were tried in open court, duly
 convicted, and sentenced according to law. They have not,
 however, benefited from the presidential amnesty granted to
 dissidents who were still at large on April 19, nor have they
 benefited from the pardon which was extended to some members
 of the security forces and ZANU organizations who had been
 convicted of similar crimes.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution formally protects citizens from arbitrary
 search or entry. Under emergency powers regulations, however,
 a police officer may stop and search any person, or enter any
 area, without a warrant when the officer has "reasonable
 grounds" for believing evidence of a crime may exist.
 Since the signing of the unity agreement, the government party
 (ZANU) has employed persuasion rather than intimidation to
 recruit new party members. Some observers believe that there
 are social and professional advantages to ZANU party
 membership.
 It is widely believed that the Government monitors private
 correspondence and telephones, particularly in overseas
 connections. However, no cases or public complaints were
 filed with the courts in 1988.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression but allows
 for legislation limiting this freedom when the "interests of
 
 
 426
 ZIMBABWE
 defense, public safety, public order, state economic
 interests, public morality, and public health" are involved.
 The Government tends to interpret broadly its power to
 discourage free speech.
 It is generally assumed that speakers at public events are
 under surveillance and may be subject to police action if
 their remarks are judged too controversial. The Law and Order
 (Maintenance) Act provides for the prosecution of persons who
 make racially inflammatory remarks. These few dases are
 usually considered misdemeanors punishable by fines. The most
 recent such case was that of Gerald Ernest Brits, who was
 arrested and released on $15 bail in September for allegedly
 writing a document containing abusive references to the
 President.
 With the exception of the Financial Gazette, Zimbabwe's major
 print media (five English-language newspapers and one
 vernacular broadsheet) are controlled by the state enterprise,
 Mass Media Trust. Other smaller, privately owned print media
 are, however, allowed to operate. Television and radio are
 wholly government owned. During a July 31 television
 broadcast, the Minister of Information, Posts, and
 Telecommunications stated that he meets regularly with editors
 of the print media and makes suggestions on editorial
 content. Senior media officials tend to follow closely the
 official government/ruling party line, and they practice a
 high degree of self-censorship. Editorials which contradict
 the main tenets of government policy, criticize the ruling
 party, or question the actions of senior government or party
 officials are rare but not unknown.
 In 1988 there were initially signs that the unity agreement,
 by relaxing political tensicns, may have benefited free speech
 and press. Parliamentary debate was franker, perhaps because
 those who made statements critical of the Government could no
 longer be charged with "aiding and comforting the opposing
 party." Some frank press reports appeared, on such topics as
 government corruption, the country's economic problems, and
 criticism of suggestions that Zimbabwe should move toward a
 one-party state. However, in October the ruling party
 expelled Edgar Tekere, an outspoken Member of Parliament,
 because he had publicly criticized the party, and because his
 statements about corruption and the threat posed to democracy
 in Zimbabwe by a one-party system were supposedly "false." He
 remains a Member of Parliament. In November the Government
 reportedly told the local press not to report news concerning
 Tekere. This resulted in a noticeable blackout of news
 concerning the politician. Shortly after Tekere's expulsion,
 the CIO reportedly detained an editor of one of the more
 candid newspapers and questioned him for several days before
 releasing him.
 A number of scholarly journals are published in Zimbabwe, and
 university professors regularly participate in public
 conferences and seminars. While much academic criticism is
 directed at political and economic problems allegedly
 generated by the South Af.rican Government's destabilization
 policies, professors did on occasion criticize the policies of
 the Zimbabwean Government and some cabinet ministers. Police
 reacted harshly to university demonstrations in September
 against corruption, which appeared to lend support to
 gevernment critics in Parliament. Two law professors were
 questioned about allegations that they helped organize the
 demonstrations, and one of the professors, an expatriate, was
 
 
 427
 ZIMBABWE
 deported on 48 hours' notice. The law faculty protested the
 deportation, particularly the fact that no reasons were given
 for the deportation order, and therefore the professor had no
 opportunity to refute allegations against him. Many students
 and faculty members felt that the deportation was intended to
 warn the university against opposition to the Government and
 feared that it would undermine academic freedom in Zimbabwe.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution formally provides for the right of assembly
 and association for political and nonpolitical organizations.
 These organizations include a broad spectrum of economic,
 professional, social, and recreational activities. In
 practice, however, there are certain restrictions to the full
 exercise of this right with regard to political associations,
 particularly those advocating racially or socially divisive
 programs.
 Police permits are required for public meetings and political
 rallies. In 1988 these permits were routinely issued. While
 ZAPU was effectively banned during part of 1987, in 1988 the
 Government encouraged ZAPU to meet and organize to promote the
 integration of ZANU and ZAPU structures and cadres under the
 unity agreement.
 Several university student demonstrations were dispersed by
 police in 1988. In March a demonstration on the campus of the
 University of Zimbabwe was dispersed by police after a
 day-long confrontation. Police also dispersed with tear gas
 and truncheons three demonstrations in September by university
 and polytechnic students. Students complained of the brutal
 police reaction to the latter demonstrations in which over 400
 students were arrested and an undetermined number of
 demonstrators and police were injured. Eight students were
 charged with participation in an unauthorized demonstration;
 the remaining students were released after 24 hours in
 detention.
 There are numerous business and employers organizations,
 professional associations, trade unions, and recreational and
 sporting clubs that are free of governmental interference. It
 is widely accepted, however, that the Government would
 intervene in the affairs of an organization which espoused a
 political program (such as racism, tribalism, support for
 apartheid or for the previous regime) that is considered
 antithetical to the tenets of the Constitution.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government respects freedom of religion. There is no
 state-established or state-sanctioned religion. Denominations
 are permitted to worship openly, pursue social and charitable
 activities, proselytize, instruct, and maintain ties to
 affiliates and coreligionists abroad. Religious observance is
 neither a handicap nor an advantage in terms of professional
 or political advancement. Many government and party leaders
 received their education in Christian mission schools, and
 some are in fact clergymen. Elective courses in religious
 studies are part of the secondary school curriculum. The Pope
 visited Zimbabwe in September. In addition to Christian
 denominations, there are small communities of Jews and Muslims.
 
 
 ZIMBABWE
 The Government, in a few isolated cases, intervened in
 previous years to settle disputes within smaller religious
 groups. There were no reports of such interventions in 1988.
 The Government also expressed concern about conservative
 evangelical organizations which are suspected of having ties
 with RENAMO guerrillas.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is no government policy or practice to restrict or limit
 domestic or foreign travel (including travel to South
 Africa). Government controls on the export of currency are,
 however, a serious practical obstacle to foreign travel.
 Citizens are free to emigrate but are not guaranteed the right
 of return if they were not born in Zimbabwe. Repatriates from
 South Africa are always suspect, and they are also considered
 economic competition for Zimbabweans. The Government
 encouraged, however, the repatriation of Zimbabweans who
 sought refuge in Botswana either during the war of
 independence or during the 1982-85 troubles in Matabeleland.
 In 1988 some 2,600 Zimbabweans were repatriated under the
 protection of the UNHCR from the Dukwe refugee camp in
 Botswana, and most 6f the 900 remaining are expected to return
 in 1989-90.
 Zimbabwe has in the last few years provided first asylum to an
 estimated 100,000 Mozambicans who fled civil war and economic
 deprivation in Mozambique. About 70,000 of these displaced
 Mozambicans are registered with the UNHCR as refugees; they
 are accommodated in four refugee camps located in eastern
 Zimbabwe. These camps, though well-run and providing
 above-average assistance, are overcrowded; the Government is
 planning to open two additional camps for refugees.
 There are credible reports that security forces are preventing
 some Mozambican refugees from entering Zimbabwe. These
 reports contradict the Government's statements that it
 supports the right of Mozambicans to seek first asylum in
 Zimbabwe. It appears that the majority of Mozambicans who
 entered refugee camps in the latter part of 1988 were formerly
 long-time residents of Zimbabwe rather than recent arrivals
 from Mozambique. Also, at least 8,000-10,000 Mozambican
 refugees were forcibly repatriated in 1988 by local army
 commanders or civil authorities, but it is unclear if the
 Government authorized these repatriations or whether they were
 solely the result of arbitrary actions by local commanders.
 Section I Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 ,c Change Their Government
 In 1988 Zimbabwe was officially a pluralist parliamentary
 democracy with a popularly elected house of assembly, and
 citizens still had the right to change their government
 through democratic means. Local elections held in the latter
 part of 1988 were contested by multiple candidates from both
 ZANU and ZAPU as well as by some independents. However, in
 1988, with the ZANU-ZAPU unity agreement, Zimbabwe was
 effectively becoming a de facto one-party state.
 President Mugabe and his Cabinet are the preeminent political
 figures, and the ruling party, ZANU (soon to be fully unified
 with the former ZAPU opposition party), is the overwhelmingly
 dominant political organization in the country. Following the
 amendment of the Constitution in 1987 to create an executive
 
 
 429
 ZIMBABWE
 presidency, the President became in 1988 both the Head of
 State and Head of Government. Robert Mugabe, who previously
 served as Prime Minister, was elected by an electoral college
 (made up of the two houses of Parliament) as Zimbabwe's first
 executive President. In the future, the executive President
 is to be selected by popular election to a term of 6 years.
 The debate over Zimbabwe's future political course continued
 in 1988. President Mugabe and some other senior ZANU
 officials have indicated a desire for a one-party state.
 Although the unity agreement was credited with promoting more
 open political debate and a decrease in human rights abuses in
 1988, there were misgivings in some quarters as to the
 long-term consequences of creating a de jure one-party state.
 Some Members of Parliament publicly opposed the constitutional
 establishment of a one-party state, charging it would lead to
 an authoritarian state and to the end of political pluralism
 in Zimbabwe.
 Nationwide parliamentary elections, largely contested between
 candidates for ZANU and ZAPU, were held in 1980 and 1985, and
 there have been numerous local contests which, despite some
 episodes of voter intimidation, were generally considered to
 have been free elections. Balloting is secret. Parliament
 has two chambers. Eighty of the 100 members of the lower
 house (the House of Assembly) are popularly elected from
 specific constitutencies to 5-year terms. Twenty Members of
 Parliament were nominated by the ruling party and elected by
 the House of Assembly. The members of the upper house (the
 Senate) are appointed by the President.
 Women are active in both party politics and in the national
 and local government. A number of women sit in the House of
 Assembly, and President Mugabe appointed other women to the
 Senate in 1987. Six women serve in cabinet-level positions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights'
 The Government in previous years reacted negatively to charges
 by international nongovernmental organizations of human rights
 abuses. It has not permitted Amnesty International (AI) to
 operate in Zimbabwe since 1986. Zimbabwe was host to an AI-
 sponsored rock concert in October, held to promote respect for
 human rights, which received widespread publicity in the
 government-operated media. The International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) has an office in Harare, but ICRC delegates
 have not been permitted to conduct prison visits. The ICRC
 has a program--now winding down--in Matabeleland to support
 the families of persons who have been held in detention. The
 UNHCR also has an office in Harare that worked to protect
 displaced Mozambicans and South Africans who sought refuge in
 Zimbabwe as well as to help in the repatriation of Zimbabwean
 refugees from Botswana.
 Several private human and legal rights organizations have
 held two major international conferences in Harare in
 1988.effective local operations in Zimbabwe and have operated
 without hindrance, including in producing their own
 publications and in holding meetings. The Catholic Commission
 for Justice and Peace (CCJP) investigates complaints from
 private persons about human rights abuses in Zimbabwe and
 conveys its findings to the Government, which in the past
 sometimes resulted in remedial action. In 1988 the CCJP did
 
 
 430
 ZIMBABWE
 not complain to the Government about human rights abuses.
 Several law firms and legal clinics and foundations also
 continued to be active in human rights education and
 representation of victims of abuse.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Government services are provided on a nondiscriminatory
 basis. The Government integrated the previous "whites only"
 infrastructure in the urban areas to provide health care and
 other social services to all. The Government maintains a
 heavy budgetary commitment to health and education spending
 despite severe fiscal constraints.
 In social terms, Zimbabwe remains a somewhat racially
 stratified society despite bans against official
 discrimination. Although schools, churches, and clubs are all
 integrated, there continues to be only limited social
 interaction between racial groups. The "colored" (mixed race)
 and Asian community have been discriminated against in the
 allocation of civil service jobs, but the new Cabinet
 installed by President Mugabe in January 1988 includes a
 "colored" minister, a "colored" deputy minister, and an Asian
 minister. The white population is active in the private
 sector, including large-scale farming, and there are whites
 who are active in Government as Members of Parliament, local
 officials, and civil servants.
 The status of women in Zimbabwe has advanced steadily, even
 though traditional attitudes and practices persist, especially
 in rural areas. In 1988 women are prominent in a number of
 business, civil service, and professional occupations,
 including the military and labor organizations. A woman was
 elected in July to serve as a vice president of the Zimbabwe
 Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), which has campaigned to
 enlist more women workers in the trade union movement. Women
 make up approximately 40 percent of the student body at the
 University of Zimbabwe, and there are a large number of women
 on the university faculty. Nonetheless, women are less
 frequently found in such traditionally male occupations as
 construction, transportation, heavy industry, and mining. The
 Government's statistical office estimates that women account
 for approximately 16 percent of the paid labor force. There
 have not been any thorough surveys to compare the wages of
 women to those of men.
 The executive, legislative, and judicial branches have all
 been involved in protecting and enforcing laws affecting
 women's-rights. Under government leadership, the Parliament
 has legislated a number of progressive laws to counter certain
 traditional practices, some of which are based on the view of
 women as dependents or minors. For example, the Legal Age of
 Majority Act and the Matrimonial Causes Act recognizes the
 capacity of women to act independently of their husbands or
 fathers and to own property. Parliament is also debating a
 bill which establishes certain rights for women with regard to
 the inheritance of property in the event that her deceased
 husband did not leave a valid-will. This bill has generated
 considerable debate because it is at variance with
 long-standing customary law. Judges on the high courts have
 adjudicated cases upholding women's rights, including the
 right of women to inherit property.
 
 
 ZIMBABWE
 The press has also been an important factor in disseminating
 information on the changing status of women. In 1988 the
 local press gave considerable attention to allegations of
 sexual harassment of women in the workplace, and newspapers
 featured a series of articles describing and debating measures
 to eliminate this problem.
 Notwithstanding the progress, women are still considered
 vulnerable to customary practices that operate against their
 personal rights. Zimbabwean law prohibits "kuzvarira," the
 practice of pledging a young woman to marriage with a partner
 not of her choosing. However, unless the woman is well
 educated and outspoken, marriages based on "kuzvarira" still
 take place. The Matrimonial Causes Act has removed the
 customary obligation of a groom to pay "lobola" (a bride
 price) to the parents of his would-be wife, but the practice
 of lobola continues to be widespread.
 The Child Protection Society of Zimbabwe challenged the
 customary practice of offering a young girl as compensatory
 payment in interfamily disputes. In September the Society
 gained court custody of a preteen girl pledged as restitution
 to the family of a man who was murdered by a member of the
 young girl's'family. Newspapers featured articles that
 decried a variety of "bad customs" and a strong editorial that
 praised the actions of the Child Protection Society.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Under the Labor Relations Act, workers enjoy freedom of
 association, have the right to elect their representatives,
 publish newsletters, and set programs and policies which
 reflect the political and economic interests of labor. The
 Labor Relations Act specifies that workers may constitute
 workers' committees in each plant and a trade union in each
 industrial sector and elect appropriate officers. The Act
 specifies that workers' committees and trade unions must be
 registered with the Ministry of Labor, but it also seeks to
 protect workers' organizations from arbitrary government
 interference. The Government does not control or restrict
 labor, but it has powerful levers affecting labor, notably in
 the handling of strikes and setting wages (see below).
 Since independence, the Government has encouraged trade unions
 in the same industry to amalgamate. The process of
 amalgamation was completed in 1987. Seventeen percent of the
 salaried work force is organized.in 22 trade unions which are
 members of the ZCTU, the umbrella confederation of the trade
 union movement. The ZCTU is the voice of organized labor, and
 its officers and members frequently speak or comment on social
 issues in public forums. ZCTU officers are elected by the
 delegates of affiliated trade unions at biennial conventions,
 most recently in July 1988. Neither the Government nor any
 political party nor any ethnic or tribal group has a
 preponderant influence in the trade union movement. Most
 trade unions suffer from meager budgets which prevent them
 from conducting a greater range of organizing and educational
 activities.
 Workers have the right to strike providing that the trade
 union advises the Government 2 weeks in advance of its
 intention to do so. The right of unions to strike is further
 limited by the right of the Government to declare a specific

 ZIMBABWE
 industry to be "essential" and therefore not subject to strike
 action. In practice, the Government has employed a very broad
 interpretation of what "essential" industries are, and strikes
 in Zimbabwe have been few and unsuccessful. Nonetheless,
 trade union officials continue to press the Government in
 public statements calling for the amendment of the Labor
 Relations Act to provide for a more liberal strike policy.
 The ZCTU and its officers are active in the international
 labor movement and have affiliated with the Southern African
 Trade Union Coordinating Council and the Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity. The ZCTU maintains a nonaligned
 posture and has fraternal links with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the World Federation of
 Trade Unions. A resident representative of the African-
 American Labor Center maintains links between the ZCTU and the
 AFL-CIO. Zimbabwe is a member of the International Labor
 Organization, which held two major international conferences
 in Harare in 1988.
 Employers are also organized. They have formed industrywide
 associations to meet with the representatives of a particular
 trade union for industrywide collective bargaining. The
 various employers associations have confederated to form the
 Employers Confederation of Zimbabwe (EMCOZ). The president of
 EMCOZ meets with the ZCTU president and the Minister of Labor
 for tripartite discussions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under the Labor Relations Act, workers have the right to
 organize. Workers' committees are empowered to negotiate with
 the management of a particular plant the conditions of labor
 in the workplace. Wages are negotiated on an industrywide
 basis but are effectively limited by the Government's minimum
 wage system (see below). In the case of a union-organized
 industry, the employers' association meets directly with a
 particular trade union. In certain cases when there is no
 trade union representing a specific industry, representatives
 of the unorganized workers meet with the employers'
 association under the mediation of labor relations officers
 from the Ministry of Labor. Perceiving that workers are at a
 disadvantage in negotiations with better-financed and
 better-educated managers, the Government believes that it is
 responsible for assisting workers with legislation and
 intervention with employers. Some trade unionists would
 prefer, however, that the Government allow workers to
 negotiate on their own and learn from their own mistakes
 rather than become dependent on the Government for negotiating
 assistance. All collective bargaining agreements must be
 ratified by the Ministry of Labor.
 The Government sets minimum wages and has the capacity to
 impose wage and price freezes. A wage/price freeze imposed in
 July 1987 was removed in March 1988, and minimum wages were
 adjusted upward. Though the Government does not formally set
 a maximum wage, the Government has refused to ratify
 collective bargaining wage settlements which exceed the
 minimum wage with the argument that such settlements are
 inflationary. In such cases, employers and trade unionists
 revise their settlement, usually to conform with government
 guidelines.
 The Government does not promote or support antitrade union
 discrimination, and labor laws are applied uniformly
 
 
 ZIMBABWE
 throughout the country. There are no economic zones where
 trade union organization is impeded or discouraged.
 c. Prohibitions of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor is prohibited by law in Zimbabwe and is not
 practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under Zimbabwean labor regulations, the minimum age for the
 formal sector is 18, but it is possible to begin an
 apprenticeship at 16. Children are employed in household
 enterprises, e.g., family farms, which the Government does not
 attempt-.to regulate.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Conditions of labor are regulated by the Government according
 to industry. Based on collective bargaining agreements, the
 Government publishes labor regulations for each of 22
 industrial sectors. These regulations specify wages, hours,
 holiday schemes, and required safety measures. The average
 workweek is 44 hours, and the law prescribes a minimum of one
 24-hour rest period per week. The minimum wage for the
 agroindustrial sector is $91 a month. The employer also
 usually provides housing, food, and medical care to workers.
 On commercial farms, the employer may provide schooling to the
 children of workers. The minimum wage for commercial and
 industrial workers is $101 a month. The ZCTU continues to
 lobby for a higher minimum wage based on a 1981 report on
 incomes and wages that sets the minimum poverty line at $153 a
 month. The ZCTU uses this line as the basis for its "living
 wage standard." The Labor Relations Act provides considerable
 job security for workers. Under the Act, a worker may not be
 fired without Ministry of Labor concurrence that the dismissal
 is justified.
 Labor relations officers from the Ministry of Labor are
 assigned to monitor developments in each plant to ensure that
 Government minimum wage policy, and occupational and safety
 regulations are being observed. Labor relations officers are
 authorized to handle worker grievances within the plant.
 Their decisions may be appealed to the regional hearing
 officer of the Ministry of Labor, and finally, to a special
 Labor Relations Tribunal, over which the Chief Justice
 presides.
