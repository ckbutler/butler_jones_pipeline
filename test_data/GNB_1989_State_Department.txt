 GUINEA-BISSAU
 The Republic of Guinea-Bissau is a one-party state with former
 or present military leaders in key positions. General Joao
 Bernardo Vieira serves as President of the Council of State
 and Head of State, Commander-in-Chief, and General Secretary
 of Guinea-Bissau's sole political party, the African Party for
 the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC). In
 elections held in June 1989, Vieira, the only candidate, was
 elected for a second 5-year term as President. According to
 the 1984 Constitution, the National Assembly decides
 fundamental questions-of internal and external policy, but
 effective power and dayto-day decisions rest in the hands of
 the President and the Council of State. Although the
 President is the most powerful Member of the Council,
 decisionmaking is collegial. The party selects all candidates
 for office.
 The Armed Forces (FARP) are responsible for state security,
 both external and internal. FARP leaders are usually members
 of the PAIGC and often hold key positions in the Political
 Bureau or Central Committee. Security forces are under the
 full control of the Government. Persons accused of political
 crimes are tried by military tribunals.
 Guinea-Bissau remains one of the least developed nations, and
 most of the 974,000 population is engaged in subsistence
 agriculture. The-Government's postindependence efforts to
 exercise central control over the economy failed to stimulate
 agricultural production and resulted in chronic shortages of
 most Isic commodities, inefficient state-owned enterprises,
 high unemployment, and a weak national currency. Beginning in
 late 1986, the Government launched a series of reforms to
 promote l0ng-term economic growth by shifting from a state-run
 centralized economy to a free-market system. While the
 reforms spurred private commercial activity and improved
 agricultural production, in 1989 inflation remained high, and
 urban residents continued to witness a drop in their standard
 of living.
 The Government marked the 40th anniversary of the Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights by granting amnesty on December
 13, 1988, to four prisoners imprisoned for involvement in a
 1985 coup plot. However, most human rights remained tightly
 restricted. Major human rights problems were abuse of
 detainees in security-cases, arbitrary arrest, lack of fair
 trial, and limits on freedoms of association, speech, and
 press, the right of citizens to change their government, and
 worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of premeditated politically motivated
 killing. (Also see Section l.c.)
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of disappearance.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits cruel and inhuman punishment.
 However, security authorities employ severe interrogation
 methods, especially severe beatings. Amnesty International
 (AI) stressed in its 1989 Report (covering 1988) that it
 continued to receive allegations of the use of torture in
 security cases and deaths in custody due to mistreatment,
 noting in particular the detention center ("COP-2") in
 Bissau. AI asked the Government in 1987 to establish an
 independent commission of inquiry into these and other
 allegations, but the Government never responded.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrests in Guinea-Bissau are frequently arbitrary, as arrest
 procedures are undefined, and the use of arrest warrants is
 the exception rather than the rule. The legal system,
 inherited from the Portuguese but modified by the
 Constitution, includes important procedural rights, such as
 the right to counsel and the right to a judicial determination
 of the legality of detention (habeas corpus). Bail procedures
 are observed erratically.
 The Government has held persons without charge or trial,
 sometimes for extended periods of time, including in
 incommunicado detention. The number of political detainees
 held at the end of 1989, if any, was unknown. The Government
 has the legal right to exile prisoners but has not done so in
 recent years.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Traditional law still prevails in most rural areas, and many
 urban dwellers continue to bring judicial disputes to
 recognized traditional counselors. Several traditional
 counselors from a village in the Farim sector were reportedly
 arrested in 1989 for their role in punishing, by death, two
 persons accused of witchcraft.
 With some exceptions, the official judicial system is based on
 the Portuguese model. Intervals between arrest and trial are
 often lengthy. All defense lawyers are court appointed, as
 private legal practice is prohibited. The judiciary is a part
 of the executive branch. Trials involving state security
 usually are not open to outside observers and are conducted by
 military tribunals. FARP members are tried by military courts
 for all offenses. The Supreme Court is the final court of
 appeal for both civilian and military cases, except those
 involving national security matters. In this instance the
 Council of State reviews all decisions.
 The number of political prisoners at the end of 1989 was
 unknown. However, approximately one-half of those convicted
 in treason trials in 1986 have been released upon the
 completion of their sentences or upon grants of amnesty. The
 remaining prisoners, some of whom have been voluntarily joined
 by their families, are confined to islands in the Bijagos
 Archipelago. In 1988 the Government released Raphael Barbosa,
 cofounder of the PAIGC, from a prison camp on the island of
 Formosa.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Constitutional guarantees of the inviolability of domicile,
 person, and correspondence are not always respected in cases
 of serious crimes or state security. International and
 domestic mail is subject to surveillance and censorship.
 Membership in the PAIGC is not forced, although individuals
 with political aspirations realize the importance of belonging
 to Guinea-Bissa's sole political party.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a., Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of intellectual,
 artistic, and scieiutific-expression, with the significant
 .exception o- cases-Aï¿½n which these rights are exercised in a
 manner "contrary to the promotion of-social progress." In
 fact, these freedoms are restricted. The Government controls
 all information media and views the press as a vehicle of the
 party. Journalists are government employees and must practice
 self-censorship to maintain their positions. The media are
 permitted to criticize and question some policies, although
 they may not criticize individual officials.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association, and government approval is not required for
 peaceful, nonpolitical assemblies and demonstrations.
 However, all existing organizations are linked to the
 Government or-the party, including the sole labor union, the
 National Union of the Workers of Guinea-Bissau.
 Antigovernment meetings are not tolerated.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is provided for in the Constitution and has
 been respected in practice. Christians, Muslims, and animists
 worship freely, and proselytizing'is permitted. However,
 religious groups must be licensed by the Government. In 1989
 there were-no reports of groups being refused licenses.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, 8nd Repatriation-
 Citizens are allowed to move freely throughout Guinea-Bissau.
 Foreign travel is not restricted, nor is citizenship revoked
 for political reasons. Thousands of persons have emigrated
 for economic reasons. The return of expatriates is
 ecouraged, although the death in 1986 of one opposition
 member in a-car accident during a forced repatriation from
 Senegal convinced some government opponents that they would
 not be welcomed back to Guinea-Bissau. In May 1989, several
 hundred Mauritanian refugees fleeing ethnic violence in
 Senegal entered Guinea-Bissau. Most of the refugees were
 quickly repatriated to Mauritania, but some remained in
 Guinea-Bissau and were integrated into the Mauritanian
 community residing in Guinea-Bissau. While sympathetic to the
 principle of asylum, Guinea-Bissau does not host significant
 numbers of refugees.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right or the ability peacefully and
 legally to change the government or the form of government.
 Guinea-Bissau is led by the PAIGC Party and military elite,
 headed by President Joao Bernardo Vieira. By the terms of the
 1984 Constitution, all political activity takes place within
 the party/state structure. The 1989 electoral slates for the
 National Popular Assembly at the district, regional, and
 national levels were party-approved lists, although not all
 candidates were members of the PAIGC. Affirmative or negative
 votes on the proposed slates were cast by secret ballot. The
 President, members of the Council of State, and deputies of
 the National Popular Assembly are elected to 5-year terms.
 There are provisions for constitutional amendments and
 national referendums initiated by the National Popular
 Assembly, but the Assembly has never taken such initiatives,
 and it meets infrequently. No single ethnic group dominates
 party/government positions, but Papel and Creole (mixed-race)
 groups, predominantly located in and around the capital of
 Bissau, are disproportionately represented in the Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although international human rights groups have visited
 Guinea-Bissau, these visits have been tightly controlled. An
 AI mission held discussions in June 1986 with President Vieira
 and other key officials and attended one session of the
 treason trial. However, the Government has not responded to
 AI's 1987 request that an independent commission examine
 various human rights issues. There are no local human rights
 groups in Guinea-Bissau.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The population of Guinea-Bissau is composed of diverse tribal
 groups, each with its own language, customs, and social
 organization. The Balanta, Fula, Mandinka, Manjaco, and Papel
 are important groups. Creoles enjoy an advantageous position
 within the society due to their generally higher level of
 education and their links abroad. Although the President and
 other influential leaders regularly urge the nation to
 overcome ethnic differences, the economic dominance of Creoles
 (and to a lesser extent Mandinkas and Fulas) has created
 resentment among other ethnic communities. Most of the
 defendants in the 1986 coup trial were members of the Balanta,
 the largest ethnic group (30 percent).
 While officially prohibited, discrimination against women
 persists within certain ethnic groups, especially the Muslim
 Fulas and Mandinkas of the north and east. The practice of
 female circumcision is still widespread among these groups
 despite official prohibition and educational campaigns against
 this custom. Women enjoy higher status in the societies of
 the Balanta, Papel, and Bijagos groups living mainly in the
 southern coastal region. Physical violence as a means of
 settling domestic disputes occurs among all ethnic groups.
 While police will intervene in domestic disputes if requested,
 the Government has not undertaken specific measures to raise
 the public consciousness of women or to reduce violence
 against them.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Approximately one-half of the population of Guinea-Bissau is
 of working age. While the Constitution provides for freedom
 of association, only one labor union, the National Union of
 the.Workers of Guinea-Bissau (UNTG), exists in Guinea-Bissau.
 With strong ties to the PAIGC, the UNTG more closely resembles
 a mass party organization than an independent union. The UNTG
 is neither aggressive nor effective in promoting worker
 rights.--While not specifically forbidden, strikes do not
 occur. Since the Government's use of force to disperse
 students attempting to strike in 1981, the public's perception
 has bean that strikes, like antigovernment meetings, would not
 be tolerated. The UNTG is affiliated with the
 Communist.contxolled World Federation of Trade Unions and is a
 member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Of the estimated 28,000 salaried workers in the country,
 approximately 50 percent are employees of the Government.
 Guinea-Bissau's small manufacturing sector employs fewer than
 5,000 persons. The scarcity of salaried jobs has forced
 employees to focus on obtaining and keeping employment rather
 than on organizing and bargaining. Public employees are
 permitted to join the UNTG, but the union's activities have
 not emphasized organizing employees (whether private or
 public) for the purpose of collective bargaining. The
 Constitution does not provide and protect the right to
 organize and bargain collectively, but the General Labor Law
 of 1986 contains limited provisions addressing collective
 bargaining. In practice, from the worker's perspective, the
 right is neither protected nor practiced.
 While expressing satisfaction with various provisions of the
 1986 labor law, the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Committee of Experts noted in both 1987 abd 1988 that the
 Government's provision for the protection of-workers against
 antiunion discrimination does not appear to be accompanied by
 penal sanctions against employers and that the General Labor
 Act is not applicable to workers in the public service. The
 Committee pointed out that public'servants who are not engaged
 in the administration of the State should be able to enjoy the
 right of collective bargaining. There are no export
 processing zones in Guinea-Bissau, and labor laws are
 applicable throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is not permitted by law and is not
 known to exist. There are no penal sanctions for offenders,
 however, and the Government lacks the means to provide
 adequate labor inspections.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The General Labor Act of 1986 established a minimum age of 14
 for general factory labor and of 18 for heavy or dangerous
 labor, including all labor in mines. In an overwhelmingly
 rural and agricultural society, the traditional division of
 labor practices both between sexes and age groups continues to
 prevail. Children in rural communities do domestic and field
 work for no pay. The Government does not attempt to
 
 
 158
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 discourage this practice and, in fact, delays the opening of
 schools until the rice season has ended.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Even in the small wage sector, labor laws are unevenly
 enforced due primarily to the extreme economic
 underdevelopment of the country and the vagaries of the legal
 system. However, there are government regulations governing
 such matters as job-related disabilities and vacation rights.
 The maximum number of hours permitted in a normal workweek is
 45 hours. Although not consistently enforced, a iinimum wage
 of approximately $13 a month is mandated by the Ministry of
 Civil Service. The wage is inadequate to maintain even a
 minimum standard of living, and workers must supplement their
 income through reliance on the extended family and subsistence
 agriculture. Existing legal, health, and safety standards for
 workers are not enforced in a uniform and comprehensive manner.
