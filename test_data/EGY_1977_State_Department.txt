 EGYPT
 The trend in Egypt continues to be one of gradual increase
 in political and economic freedom for all its people. The
 1972 "freedom law" and the 1971 constitution are the major
 instruments for promoting this trend. In contrast to the
 later years of the Nasser regime, the new structure of
 constitutional and statutory law is respected by the se-
 curity authorities, who since 1972. are subject to criminal
 charges if they infringe upon guaranteed liberties.
 The power of the judiciary was reduced by Nasser in 1969.
 A number of judges fled or went into exile at that time.
 Under President Sadat, they have returned to the courts
 and the legal system accordingly has gained in prestige
 and credibility. Wrongs of the Nasser period are being
 redressed in the civilian courts--sequestered propurtics
 returned, compensation awarded for nationalization, fines
 and jail sentences levied on police and military authori-
 ties who ordered torture and illegal detention. Egyptians
 today are enjoying civil and political freedoms to an un-
 precedented degree.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is now strictly forbidden under Egyptian law. An
 individual who claims to have been tortured or mistreated
 after arrest has an effective right of redress in the
 courts. Several individuals have filed suit against police
 officials of the former Nasser Government accused of tor-
 turing prisoners. Some of these officials have been con-
 victed and imprisoned. Amnesty International in late 1977
 reported the complaint of one alleged victim of torture
 under the Sadat Government. This first report has not been
 substantiated.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Punishment
 The death penalty is reserved for a limited number of crimes
 (e.g. treason and murder) but is rarely carried out in prac-
 tice; lengthy imprisonment is the general rule for serious
 crimes. The penal code provides for lengthy sentences for
 a wide variety of other crimes, including disrupting the
 public order, though actual sentences generally are less than
 the maximum.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are forbidden by law
 and apparently have ceased in Egypt. Government officials
 who violate these laws are subject to criminal charges.
 After the January 1977 riots, more than 1,000 individuals
 were detained on charges of participating in or inciting
 the demonstrations. The majority (many of whom were juve-
 niles) were released immediately. The remainder are now
 undergoing public trial and several of those whose trials
 have been completed were acquitted and released. While
 it is impossible to say that abuses of police power have
 been entirely stopped, they are in direct violation of
 state policy.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All Egyptians are guaranteed by law the right of due pro-
 cess and equal treatment including fair trial. To the
 best of our knowledge, these guarantees pertain. Those
 accused of espionage or military security crimes are tried
 by military court. Other defendants have the right to
 public trial. In some cases, military trials also have
 been open to the public.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Arbitrary home search and seizure and telephone tapping are
 now forbidden and a court order is required. Government
 officials who violate this law are subject to criminal pe-
 nalties.
 2. Recent Trends in Government Policies Relating to the
 Fulfillment of Basic Needs for Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 The Egyptian Government's policies and programs reflect a
 concern for the needs of its people. Delivery of such
 basic services as health care, education and social wel-
 fare extends out from urban areas to remote villages and,
 in relation to Egypt's state of development, compares favor-
 ably with most other developing countries. The "economic
 open door" policy announced in 1974 has worked in its ini-
 tial stages to the pr6fit of a small elite of traders, whose
 conspi cuous consumption (arter years of wealth-concealment
 
 
 343
 under the nationalization-minded Nasser) has exacerbated
 tensions among social classes. Such was'not, however,,
 the intent of the enabling legislation, which has re-
 cently been revised to eliminate tax evasion and other
 abuses.
 Responding to the appeals of the millions of poor and
 lower middle-class Egyptians, whose living standards are
 declining, Sadat has emphasized that food and housing
 are the two highest priorities of his administration. The
 Egyptian Government heavily subsidizes basic foods and
 other commodities. These and other heavy government ex-
 penditures in the areas of defense and social services
 led the IMF and other donors to urge the government to
 reduce its subsidies. The government attempted such re-
 ductions in January 1977. The urban poor, already se-
 riously affected by economic adversities, rioted. Faced
 with this challenge, the government concluded that it was
 politically infeasible at that time to reduce the subsi-
 dies and consequently rescinded the decision.
 There remains much room for improvement of basic services.
 Given Egypt's poverty and its balance of payments situa-
 tion, Egypt's ability to improve these services will be
 heavily influenced by the continuation of foreign finan-
 cial assistance for the country's general development. In
 this context, our aid program is an important tool. The
 aid program is designed to buoy up the economy, to build
 up basic infrastructure and to lay the base for economic
 growth. As this goal is realized, our assistance should
 increasingly address questions of equity and basic needs
 of the poor majority. Our food assistance, population,
 health, agriculture and other related efforts are impor-
 tant steps in this direction.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 Under President Sadat, the police state atmosphere of the
 previous regime has virtually disappeared. Dissent is per-
 mitted to an unprecedented degree, although there are
 generally understood proscriptions which apply largely to
 the media. We know of no cases in which an individual has
 been arrested merely for criticizing the government.
 
 
 344
 The press in Egypt is largely owned by the Arab Socialist
 Union, a mass organization under the control of the Egyp-
 tian Government. Televisi6n and radio are state-controlled.
 Editors are expected to exercisd self-censorship, espe-
 cially on sensitive matters (e.g. military preparedness).
 Leftist journalists who oppose GOE internal and foreign
 policies rarely see their articles in print. Legally con-
 stituted political parties are permitted to publish their
 own journals.
 Egypt is a multi-racial society. By constitution it is
 an Islamic state which guarantees freedom of religious
 expression. A large Coptic minority participates fully
 in the life of the country. There have occasionally been
 allegations from outside of Egypt that the government dis-
 criminates against its Coptic citizens. There is, how-
 ever, no available evidence of officially inspired acts
 of religious discrimination. President Sadat and other
 senior Egyptian Government officials have publicly empha-
 sized the need for religious tolerance. Recently there
 has been concern in the Coptic community about draft legis-
 lation designed to bring the Egyptian legal code in line
 with strict adherence to Islamic religious law. The govern-
 ment has assured the Copts that the bills would not be put
 to a vote this. year. President Sadat has reiterated his
 strong belief in religious freedom, thereby calming Coptic
 concerns.
 Since establishment of the state of Israel, the Jewish popu-
 lation in Egypt has declined from about 80,000 to about
 1,200, mostly elderly people. The Egyptian Government does
 not restrict Jewish emigration, and relations between the
 Jewish community and the government are good. Egypt permits
 non-Israeli citizens who are members of the Jewish faith to
 travel freely in Egypt.
 Women enjoy relatively high status in Egypt. The right to
 vote, to volunteer for non-combat duty 5n the armed forces,
 to enter into economic activity outside the home, and to
 exercise other rights of citizenship is assured. Women are
 especially well represented in medicine and education. In
 1969, the first woman was named to a cabinet position. At
 present, the Minister of Social Affairs and the chairperson
 of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the People's Assembly
 are women.
 
 
 345
 Despite such positive indicators concerning their status
 in Egyptian society, women generally con:inue to be edu-
 cationally disadvantaged. Particularly in the rural
 areas, and within more traditional and conservative Muslim
 communities, women are still expected to accept a sub-
 ordinate role centered largely on the hane.
 The organized trade union movement represents about seven
 and one-half million members. While unions are tech-
 nically under the auspices of the Arab Socialist Union,
 their independence and freedom of actior have steadily
 increased in recent years. Most industry in Egypt is at
 least partially government-owned, and consequently trade
 union influence in the Egyptian Government has helped
 union leaders in negotiating with these industries and in
 influencing labor and other economic legislation in the
 People's Assembly. Conversely, the government has a con-
 siderable say in identifying acceptable candidates for
 positions of leadership in the labor movement although
 final selection among such candidates is determined by
 free election. Workers do not enjoy the right to strike,
 but there have been occasional wildcat strikes. The
 government has generally not taken action against these
 illegal strikes.
 The sole tangible setback to the gradual political li-
 beralization under Sadat has been his decision, taken in
 the wake of the January 1977 riots, to limit the right
 of assembly and lay down severe penalties for those who
 strike or demonstrate against the national interest. These
 new penalties have not been applied to those indicted for
 participation in the riots, although the trial of 176 sus-
 pected communists accused of incitement is not yet concluded.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Immigration
 Egyptians are free to travel anywhere in Egypt and are free
 to travel abroad except to Israel, with which Egypt is in
 a state of war. They are free-to emigrate. The present
 Egyptian Government, in contrast to past ones, now fre-
 quently honors requests for refugee treatment by nationals
 of other nations.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Egypt has universal suffrage. The parliamentary campaign
 of 1976 under Sadat was free and hotly contested. Accord-
 ing to the constitution, the president is elected in the
 
 22-145 0 - 78 - 23
 
 
 346
 parliament, and the Assembly's choice is submitted to the
 people for a yes-no referendum.
 President Sadat has publicly affirmed his commitment to a
 liberalized political system. In early 1977, the People's
 Assembly legalized a political party system for the first
 time since the revolution in 1952. Any twenty members of
 the Assembly may apply for permission to form a political
 party if their platform is distinguishable from the exist-
 ing three parties and falls within the broad constitutional
 description of the state as democratic and socialist. In-
 dependents may also run for seats in the Assembly and a
 wide range of opinion from Marxist left to religious right
 is represented there. Debates are free and frequently
 quite lively. Political organizations based on religious
 lines are not permitted to form parties. President Sadat
 has spoken repeatedly about the danger to the republic
 inherent in the philosophy of Egyptian Marxists, but at
 the same time, he has reiterated that every citizen must
 have the right to participate in the political process.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigations of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 The government is willing to permit visits by international
 groups wishing to investigate human rights concerns in
 Egypt and has allowed such investigations in the past, most
 recently by Amnesty International in May 1977.
