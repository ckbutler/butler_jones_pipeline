 BHUTAN*
 Bhutan has been ruled by the Wangchuck dynasty of hereditary
 monarchs since 1907. Isolated in the Himalayas between India
 and Tibet, the people of Bhutan have been able to escape
 domination by any external power since the 10th century. It was
 not until the reign of King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck (1952-72) that
 a Bhutanese leader tried to move the Kingdom out of its
 centuries of medieval seclusion toward a more representative
 political system and better integrated, more productive
 economy. Although he retained strong executive powers, he
 created several important institutions such as the National
 Assembly (1953), the Royal Advisory Council (1965), and the
 Council of Ministers (1968) to provide broader participation in
 the Government. Serfdom was abolished, land reform introduced,
 codification of laws begun, and the judiciary separated from the
 executive.
 The present monarch, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, has continued
 Bhutan's social and political evolution, although progress has
 been slow due to serious limitations in Bhutan's administrative
 capacity and resources. Bhutan is the poorest country in South
 Asia and one of the most traditional and least developed
 countries in the world. The vast majority of the population is
 illiterate and rural, following traditional agricultural and
 pastoral pursuits in a largely barter economy.
 The human rights situation in Bhutan is changing only very
 slowly. Most observers agree that it suffers few of the
 problems of disaffection and repression that afflict many
 Third World countries in the throes of rapid change.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known political killings in 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no evidence of cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment
 or treatment. Serious crimes are a rarity, although there has
 been a trend toward more criminal activity in recent years with
 the introduction of a large foreign labor force with no ties to
 Bhutanese society. Most crimes are punished by fines or
 imprisonment. Mutilation was outlawed in 1965, and capital
 punishment was retained only for treason.
 *Bhutan and the U.S. do not maintain formal diplomatic
 relations, and U.S. officials rarely travel there. Information
 on Bhutanese practices in connection with human rights matters
 is, therefore, neither readily available nor complete.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no special or preventive detention, and arrests can be
 made only under legal authority. As far as is known, neither
 exile nor forced labor are employed as forms of punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Bhutan has no written constitution or bill of rights. Criminal
 cases and a variety of civil matters are adjudicated under an
 18th century legal code which has been revised in recent years.
 Familial questions are governed by the traditional religious
 norms of the two major groups in the country: Buddhist law
 governs the majority of Bhutanese, and Hindu law is applied in
 areas where individuals of Nepali ethnic origin are
 predominant.
 Although the Kingdom's legal system does not provide for juries,
 the right to be represented by legal counsel, or due process in
 the Western sense, trials are generally expeditious and public.
 There is no prosecutor and no defense attorney because there are
 insufficient lawyers in the country to serve in these
 capacities. Judges, appointed by and accountable to the King,
 are responsible for all aspects of a case, including
 investigation, filing of charges, prosecution, and judgment of
 the defendant. Qualified observers report that the system
 conforms to the local population's concept of impartiality and
 justice.
 In 1968-69, a separate judiciary was established which provides
 for local, district, and national courts with original and
 appellate jurisdiction. Final appeals may be made to the King.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There are no written guarantees of privacy in the Bhutanese
 system, but tradition has bolstered the concept. In practice,
 the Government does not intervene arbitrarily or unreasonably in
 the lives of the people.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 With a literacy rate around 5 percent, Bhutan's adult population
 is relatively unaffected by the print media. The only
 publications currently produced are a weekly and a monthly
 government journal and a weekly private newspaper. Indian and
 other foreign newspapers and publications are also distributed
 in Bhutan without apparent government control. There is a
 single national radio station, built a decade ago by the
 National Youth Association. Criticism of the King is permitted
 in the National Assembly.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 No written guarantees of these freedoms exist, but Bhutanese
 generally enjoy the freedom of peaceful asssembly and
 association. There are no private voluntary social, communal,
 or economic associations, and no professional or trade
 organizations.
 
 
 1202
 BHUTAN
 Bhutan has no labor unions, and hence no collective bargaining,
 and no legislation addressing labor-related issues.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Buddhism is the state religion of Bhutan. Not only does the
 Government directly subsidize monasteries and shrines, but the
 Buddhist monastic establishment enjoys statutory representation
 in the National Assembly and the Royal Advisory Council and an
 influential voice on public policy. Citizens of other faiths,
 who are mainly Hindus of Nepali origin, enjoy freedom of
 worship. Foreign missionaries are not permitted to proselytize
 in the Kingdom.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Bhutan for Bhutanese
 citizens and no bar on emigration or foreign travel. Permanent
 residence for Nepalis and Indians in Bhutan (except those in
 government service) is restricted to the southern hill region.
 A policy introduced in the 1950's, which prevented the exiled
 leaders of an outlawed Nepali Bhutanese political party from
 returning to the country, has been liberalized to allow them to
 return at their own request.
 Bhutan traditionally has welcomed refugees and exiles from other
 countries in the region. Some 6,000 Tibetan refugees sought
 refuge in Bhutan after 1959, joining approximately 4,000
 Tibetans already in the country. Because it perceived threats
 to national security resulting from the Tibetan refugees' lack
 of allegiance to Bhutan, the Government in 1979-1980 required
 that they either accept Bhutanese citizenship or face
 expulsion. When India and other countries initially refused to
 accept them, Bhutan's policy raised the possibility of forcible
 repatriation. However, the Government decided not to carry out
 its threat. Although most Tibetans in Bhutan have accepted
 Bhutanese citizenship, they have been assured by the Bhutanese
 Government that they will always be free to return to their
 homeland.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Bhutanese political system is a traditional monarchy, with
 sovereign and wide-ranging power vested in the King. In this
 highly elitist system, decisionmaking is very narrowly
 based--centered in the palace and involving only a small number
 of officials in the civil and religious establishments.
 Political parties do not exist and their formation is
 discouraged. Local administration is carried out by centrally
 appointed government officials. Villages, however, have the
 traditional right to elect by consensus their own headmen, who
 form the lowest rung of the administrative hierarchy.
 The 150-member National Assembly is composed of 110 members
 elected by limited franchise (heads of family in Hindu areas,
 village headmen in Buddhist regions), 10 members representing
 the monastic establishment, and 30 high-level officials of the
 government administration. Its principal functions are to enact
 laws, approve senior appointments in the Government, and advise
 on all matters of national importance. Voting is by secret
 ballot and only a simple majority is needed for passage of a
 
 
 1203
 BHUTAN
 measure. Government officials may be interpellated by the body,
 and ministers can be forced to resign by a two-thirds vote of
 no-confidence. The.King cannot formally veto legislation passed
 by the Assembly, but he can refer bills back to it for further
 consideration. The Assembly occasionally has rejected royal
 recommendations or delayed their implementation, but the King
 undoubtedly could persuade the Assembly to approve any
 legislation he considers essential or withdraw any proposed
 legislation he opposes.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international agency or group is known to have sought entry
 into Bhutan to investigate human rights conditions. Amnesty
 International does not report on Bhutan; Freedom House calls the
 country "partly free." No nongovernmental human rights groups
 are known to exist in Bhutan, nor do human rights appear to be a
 subject of domestic political debate.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 On its land area of about 18,000 square miles, Bhutan has a
 population of about 1,400,000 which is growing at a rate of 2
 percent a year. By all standard indices Bhutan is one of the
 poorest, least developed countries of the world. Its per capita
 gross national product in 1982 was only $132. Given the low
 level of monetization of the economy, however, such statistics
 can be misleading. Bhutan enjoys a relatively favorable
 land/population ratio by South Asian standards. The
 traditional, essentially feudal landholding system has undergone
 great changes in the last few decades. Although the size of
 landholdings still varies considerably from family to family,
 and tenancy still exists, most families who rent land are also
 landholders in their own right. Most (except perhaps those in
 southern Bhutan) have about as much land at their disposal as
 they can cultivate, using traditional production. In 1970 the
 Government abolished traditional payments in kind by the
 populace to the monasteries and set land taxes in cash low
 enough not to burden even small landholders.
 Within the limits set by the traditional character of Bhutanese
 society, the influence of the Buddhist clergy, and the
 underdevelopment of the Bhutanese economy, the monarchy has been
 promoting modernization. Under a series of five-year
 development plans begun in 1961, Bhutan has improved its
 agriculture, internal transport and communications,
 hydroelectric power supply, education, and public health. The
 amount of money allocated to these development plans has grown
 exponentially as Bhutan has established assistance relationships
 with increasing numbers of foreign countries and international
 organizations. Life expectancy at birth has risen from 36 years
 in 1960 to over 44 years. The infant mortality rate is 122 per
 1,000 live births. Programs have been launched to control
 malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, and goiter.
 Adult literacy stood at only 5 percent in 1970 and may not be
 much higher today. Mass education became an official objective
 of the Government as early as 1952, but progress has been slow
 due to deficiencies in basic infrastructure (a lack of trained
 teachers, for example) and limited public resources. Although
 primary education is free and enrollment quadrupled between 1960
 
 
 1204
 BHUTAN
 and 1979, the ratio to the primary school-age population was
 still only 22 percent in 1983. A new education policy was
 introduced in 1975, with "self-sufficiency" in-the supply of
 qualified personnel for key administrative and economic
 positions as one of its priority objectives. Recognizing that
 it will be decades before indigenous institutions of higher
 education attain the necessary quality, the Government plans to
 send a relatively small number of students abroad for advanced
 training. This strategy does not make it possible for every
 young Bhutanese who aspires to join the country's technically
 educated elite to receive a higher education, but it is
 consistent with the Government's determination to avoid the
 social disruptions caused by educating youth for jobs which do
 not exist. Although access to state scholarships for foreign
 education is still strongly influenced by family background,
 admission to the prestigious civil bureaucracy is now more based
 on merit than it has ever been before.
 Bhutan has no minimum wage laws or other labor legislation
 governing its very small industrial labor force. The shortage
 of labor in Bhutan is such that the larger industrial
 establishments, all of which were established relatively
 recently, are organized along modern lines and incorporate a
 considerable amount of labor-saving technology. No industrial
 plant employs more than 60-70 workers, and most of these are
 guest workers from Nepal. Apart from the few large plants, the
 entire industrial sector of Bhutan consists of home-based
 handicrafts and some 60 privately owned small or medium-scale
 factories producing consumer goods. Children are not employed
 in industrial labor.
 There are few social and economic indicators available on the
 status of women. Boys tend to outnumber girls by about two to
 one in primary schools, but no distinction is made between the
 status of men and women in Bhutanese law. As compared with some
 of its neighbors, Bhutan has not developed a rigid caste system
 or customs which sequester or disenfranchise women. Official
 Bhutanese policy is to discourage the observance of caste
 distinctions among the Hindu population.
 The potentially most divisive issue in Bhutan is how to
 accommodate the large (estimated at 20-30 percent) segment of
 the population of Nepali Hindu origin. The country's ethnic
 Tibetan majority has long been concerned about being overwhelmed
 by immigrants from Nepal. In the past, the central Government
 responded to this concern by tightly limiting immigration and by
 restricting residence and employment of the Nepali population to
 the southern part of the country. The Government did not try to
 impose its official language on the minority but neither did it
 try to facilitate interaction between the two ethnic
 communities. More recently, however, Thimpu's policy toward the
 Nepali minority has been liberalized. Intermarriage between the
 communities is officially encouraged, southerners are allowed to
 own property and establish businesses in the north, and
 vice-versa. Nepali Bhutanese also are being absorbed into the
 administration at a much higher rate than in the past. More
 liberal policies with respect to land ownership and taxation in
 southern Bhutan have also been introduced, modifying the
 discriminatory system which sometimes led Nepali Bhutanese to
 describe themselves as second-class citizens.
