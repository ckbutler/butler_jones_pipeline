 BELIZE
 Belize is a functioning parliamentary democracy organized
 under a Constitution enacted in 1981 upon independence from
 the United Kingdom. It is governed by a prime minister, a
 cabinet of ministers, and a legislative assembly. A Governor
 General represents Queen Elizabeth II, but has a largely
 ceremonial role. Both local and national elections are
 scheduled on a regular, constitutionally prescribed basis, and
 the two main political parties--the United Democratic Party
 (UDP) and the People's United Party (PUP) field competing
 slates of candidates. The UDP has controlled the National
 Assembly since 1984.
 The security forces of Belize consist of the Belize National
 Police (BNP), the Belize Defence Force (BDF), and the Security
 and Intelligence Service (SIS). The 500 member BNP is
 responsible for law enforcement and maintenance of order. The
 principal duty of the-l,000 active and reserve members of the
 BDF is defense of Belize City and the International airport,
 but it also assists the police in antinarcotics operations.
 The British maintain a garrison of approximately 1,800 troops
 responsible for external defense. Closely modeled upon the
 British M15, the SIS is charged with intelligence gathering
 and safeguarding the country from internal and external
 subversion. Only the BNP has arrest powers. During 1988
 narcotics traffickers in Belize, both producers and
 transshippers, increasingly taxed the resources of the
 security apparatus.
 A developing nation with a population of less than 200,000,
 Belize has an open market economy. The Government favors free
 enterprise and actively encourages increased investment, both
 foreign and domestic. In 1987 the gross domestic product
 increased by 5.8 percent in real terms, and per capita gross
 national product was estimated at $1,413.
 Constitutional protections for the fundamental rights and
 freedoms of the individual, including women and all ethnic
 groups, are upheld by an independent judiciary. Persons may
 freely associate, hold private property, speak freely, and
 pursue private interests. An active and unconstrained press
 buttresses these civil and political rights. The country's
 overall human rights record remains good.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the.Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Such treatment is expressly forbidden by the Constitution and
 is not condoned by the Government. However, there were
 occasional allegations of unnecessary use of force by the
 security services, including the rough handling and occasional
 
 
 456
 BELIZE
 beating of arrested suspects. In one case, both Belizeans and
 foreigners accused by the police of drug trafficking in the
 southern town of Stann Creek alleged that they were harassed,
 stripped, and beaten by arresting officers. There were
 several press reports of police officials using deadly force
 in the apprehension of suspected criminals, leading to one
 fatal shooting and several woundings.
 The Government reacted promptly to these charges, investigating
 and clearing all officers involved in the shootings. In other
 cases of proven misbehavior, the guilty officers were
 disciplined or dismissed. The Government also has increased
 police training programs to try to improve professionalism and
 discipline.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest or detention, and
 these provisions are respected in practice. A person must be
 informed of the cause of detention within 48 hours of arrest
 and must be brought before a court within 72 hours. Bail is
 granted in all but the most serious cases. Exile is forbidden
 by the Constitution and does not occur.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons accused of civil or criminal action have constitutional
 rights to presumption of innocence, protection against
 self-incrimination, defense by counsel, public trial, and
 appeal. Trial by jury is mandatory in criminal cases. Those
 convicted by either a magistrate's court or the Supreme Court
 of Belize may appeal to the Court of Appeal. In some cases,
 including those resulting in a capital sentence the convicted
 party may make a final appeal to the Queen's Privy Council in
 the United Kingdom. In 1988 these constitutional guarantees
 were respected by a judiciary which is independent of the
 executive and is an effective guarantor of an equitable system
 of justice. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Constitutional provisions for the protection of personal
 property, privacy of home and person, and recognition of human
 dignity are generally honored by the Government. Search of
 private premises may be undertaken only if a warrant is
 obtained in advance, except in the case of suspected possession
 of illegal firearms, and search of the person may be made only
 with just cause.
 Sedtion 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are protected under the
 Constitution and by local custom. In practice, all viewpoints
 are publicly presented without government interference. Five
 privately owned weekly newspapers, three of them fiercely
 partisan, engage in lively debate on a broad range of
 political, social, and economic issues. The opposition press
 is a frequent critic of government officials and policies.
 All newspapers are subject to the legal constraints of libel
 laws, and in 1988 three libel suits were brought against the
 
 
 457
 BELIZE
 press by government officials. The Supreme Court ruled on one
 of these cases, awarding minor punitive damages; one case is
 still pending and one has been withdrawn.
 Fourteen privately owned television broadcasting stations,
 including two cable networks, operate throughout Belize under
 the authority and regulation of the Belize Broadcasting
 Authority (BBA). The BBA bans such programming as
 pornography, requires that a minimum of 2 percent of air time
 be devoted to locally produced programming, and must authorize
 certain broadcasts, such as those with political content. A
 BBA decision in 1988 to ban a program featuring a former
 opposition minister was widely criticized, but no official
 explanation of this action was offered.
 The BBA has a de facto monopoly on radio broadcasting,
 although a licensing application for a privately owned
 commercial station is currently under consideration. Before
 the March 1988 town board elections, the PUP strongly
 criticized the Government for limiting PUP access to the
 national radio stations. The BBA denied these charges,
 pointing out that the PUP refused seven segments of free air
 time, the same as offered to the UDP, because the BBA insisted
 upon its right to edit any defamatory or personally libelous
 material from the political broadcasts of both parties before
 these were aired.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is constitutionally assured and honored in
 practice. Political parties and other groups with political
 objectives freely held demonstrations, seminars, and mass
 meetings, especially before the March elections. The
 intelligence service is known at times unobtrusively to
 observe and monitor public political meetings, but no instance
 of harassment or interference has been reported. Under the
 Constitution, Belizeans are free to form and join associations
 of their choice, both political and nonpolitical. The
 Government officially charters those associations which wish
 to benefit from legal provisions, such as tax-free status for
 charitiable and nonprofit organizations, but less formal,
 unchartered associations also exist. The organizors of public
 meetings must obtain a permit 36 hours in advance of the
 meetings, and such permits are rarely denied.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Belize. All groups may worship
 as they choose, and all groups and churches may establish
 places of worship, train clergy, and maintain contact
 with coreligionists abroad. There is an active missionary
 presence. In church publications and from the pulpit, church
 leaders comment upon government and political policies as
 these affect the social welfare of the country. A broad based
 partnership of the Government and several different churches
 active in education successfully operates and administers most
 of Belize's primary and secondary schools. No political party
 *is affiliated with any particular church or religion, and no
 church or religious affiliation gives political advantage or
 disadvantage to its adherents.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the
 country. Foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation are
 unrestricted, although the Constitution mandates forfeiture of
 Belizean citizenship for those who knowingly and willingly
 accept citizenship of another country.
 While emigration is widely accepted, a wave of immigration
 from neighboring Central American countries has proven
 controversial. As many as 40,000 aliens have arrived in
 Belize since 1980, often entering illegally and residing in
 country without documentation. The original government
 enthusiasm for, and assistance to, the new arrivals waned as
 public resentment of their increasing presence spread. In
 1987 the Government suspended both registration of refugees
 and additional resettlement assistance efforts until a special
 immigration commission could prepare recommendations for
 revamping and codifying immigration law. This process is not
 yet complete. but the Government resumed refugee registration
 in 1988 and has worked closely with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in planning a wide variety
 of future assistance projects which will benefit both
 Belizeans and aliens, thereby defusing potential resentment
 toward the aliens and helping to assure that they will not
 suffer discrimination. In 1988 no refugees were either forced
 or pressured to return to their countries of origin. The
 UNHCR maintains an office in Belize, but the Government has
 not ratified the United Nations Convention on Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 Belize is a functioning democracy governed by a fairly elected
 legislative assembly, with executive direction coming from a
 cabinet of ministers headed by Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel.
 By constitutional mandate, the Governor General instructs the
 leader of the majority party of the.National Assembly to form
 a government following nationil elections, which must be held
 at least once every 5 years. Municipal and town board
 officials are elected in local contests at 3-year intervals.
 In the national elections of 1984 and local elections of 1985
 and 1986, Belize experienced a peaceful and orderly transfer
 of power from the PUP to the UDP. In March 1988, local
 elections, the UDP successly regained control of several town
 boards.
 All elections are by secret ballot, and suffrage is universal
 for Belizean citizens 18 years and older. Although the two
 main parties dominate Belizean political life, a number of
 splinter groups have formed to contest various elections.
 Their candidates have won individual seats and in one case an
 entire town board. The main political parties cut across all
 segments of Belize's diverse ethnic groupings. The ruling
 party's current parliamentary majority gives it broad latitude
 in setting policy, but the forces of public opinion, an
 independent judiciary, and a free press ensure that public
 policymaking remains open. In 1987 and 1q88, the 6overnment
 withdrew from consideration certain legislative measures,
 including a revised criminal libel bill, following public
 debate.
 Women are active in politics and in government. Both the
 Governor General and the President of the Senate are women.
 
 
 459
 BELIZE
 Women hold other important posts in the executive branch of
 government and serve in the police and armed forces.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no known requests by international human rights
 organizations to investigate human rights violations in
 Belize, and no international human rights organization
 maintained an office in Belize. Senior government officials
 state that the Government would cooperate with any reputable,
 internationally recognized human rights organization which
 wished to establish an office in-Belize.
 One organization, the Human Rights Commission of Belize
 (HRCB), opened offices in late 1987. Most Belizeans consider
 this to be a partisan organization. The HRCB was publicly
 identified with leftist causes throughout the region and
 frequently dealt with unsubstantiated innuendo, for example,
 insinuating that. Belizean babies might be secretly exported
 for organ transplants or that Belize may soon see the emergence
 of death squads. The HRCB presented no factual basis for
 either charge. Although the HRCB was frequently critical of
 the Government, it was permitted to maintain a public office,
 publish advertisements, sponsor meetings, and address the
 internal situation in Belize without government interference.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Despite constitutional provisions of equality, Belizean women
 face some prejudices rooted in social and economic practice.
 The Government worked to overcome this problem by funding a
 Women's Bureau charged with developing programs to improve the
 status of women in Belize. Founded in 1981, the Women's Bureau
 was upgraded in 1986 to a' government department, a subunit of
 the Ministry of Labor and Social Services. A number of
 officially registered women's groups work closely with various
 government ministries in promoting social awareness programs.
 Women have access to education and are active in all spheres
 of national life. The private sector includes many women,
 such as the president of the powerful Chamber of Commerce.
 Women generally receive the same wage as men for similar work
 but many women are employed in jobs which traditionally have
 been lower paying than most jobs held by men. There is no
 discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds. All Belizeans
 have equal protection under the law.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 By statute and in practice Belizean workers and employers are
 free to establish and join together in their own
 organizations, and the labor union movement is a significant
 factor in Belize's economy. Eleven active unions, with an
 estimated 30 per cent of the labor force on their rolls,
 effectively represent a broad cross section of white-collar,
 blue-collar, and professional workers, including most civil
 service employees.   The unions are considered official by the
 Ministry of Labor when they have filed with the Office of
 Registry. Members are empowered to draft the bylaws and
 constitutions of their unions, and they are free to elect
 officers from among the membership at large. Unions which
 
 
 460
 BELIZE
 choose not to hold elections can act as representatives for
 their membership, but only unions which hold free and annual
 elections of officers are permitted to join the national
 Trades Union Congress of Belize (TUC), which is affiliated
 with the Caribbean Congress of Labor and, through
 the Inter-American Organization of Workers, with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). By
 both law and precedent, unions are effectively protected
 against dissolution or suspension by administrative authority.
 Unions are legally permitted to strike, but unions
 representing essential services may strike only after giving
 21 days' notice to the ministry concerned. In practice, the
 Labor Commissioner acts as a conciliator in deadlocked
 collective bargaining negotiations between labor and
 management, offering nonbinding counsel to both sides.
 Historically, the Commissioner's guidance has been
 voluntarily accepted. However, should either union or
 management choose not to accept the c6nciliator's decision,
 both are empowered to a legal hearing of the case, provided
 that it is linked to some valid provision of civil or criminal
 law. No union is officially affiliated with any political
 party, although several unions are clearly allied to one or the
 other of the two main parties.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Theoretically, all unions may freely organize. In practice,
 however, some employers attempt to block union organization by
 terminating the employment of key union sympathizers, usually
 on grounds purportedly unrelated to union activities. Despite
 such employer resistance, virtually every sector of the
 economy but the garment industry has been unionized to some
 degree. Established unions are effectively protected from
 antiunion interference by both precedent and law, and union
 officials and membership rarely, if ever, encounter
 discrimination. Collective bargaining is the rule rather than
 the exception in most labor negotiations, and workers are
 fully represented in negotiations for the prevention or
 settlement of disputes with employers.
 Labor laws and regulations are applied uniformly throughout
 Belize.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is forbidden by the Constitution and does not
 occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age of employment in Belize is 14, or 17 for
 employment near hazardous machinery. Inspectors of the
 Ministries of Labor and Education enforce this regulation,
 although in recent years school truancy officers, who have
 historically borne the brunt of the enforcement burden, have
 been less active.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 No set minimum wage covers all Belizeans, but some categories
 of service employment, such as retail, restaurant, domestic,
 and health care jobs have minimum hourly wage standards
 ranging from $0.55 to $0.75 per hour. No worker is obliged to
 work more than 6 days or 45 hours per week. Payment of
 
 
 461
 BELIZE
 overtime work is obligatory, as is an annual paid holiday of 2
 weeks. A patchwork of health and safety regulations covers
 numerous industries, and these are enforced to varying degrees
 by the Ministries of Labor and Public Health. Enforcement is-,
 not universal countrywide, and in 1988 limited inspection and
 investigative resources were committed principally to urban
 and the more accessible rural areas where labor, health, and
 safety complaints had been registered. Although unemployment
 was widespread, for employed workers the conjunction of wage
 rates and hours worked was normally sufficient to provide them
 and their families with an adequate standard of living.
