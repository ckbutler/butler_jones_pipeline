 PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
 
 The United States does not maintain a diplomatic mission in
 Aden because the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in
 1969 severed diplomatic relations and expelled all U. S.
 personnel. In view of the closed nature of the regime, it
 is very difficult to obtain precise information on the human
 rights situation.
 The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) is
 dominated by a Marxist political party dedicated to
 restructuring the economic and social order. The ruling
 Yemeni Socialist Party is derived from the National
 Liberation Front which came to power with independence in
 1967. President Ahmed Al-Fatah Ismail came to office in
 1978 as a result of fighting within the ruling party. The
 former President, Salim Rubay'i Ali, was executed.
 South Yemeni society in recent years has experienced
 profound and traumatic changes. Aden's leaders have sought
 to eliminate the traditionally dominant classes and to
 subject tribal groups to party and central government
 control. Large numbers of South Yemenis have migrated to
 the Yemen Arab Republic and elsewhere in the region.
 There are reports that hundreds either have been taken into
 custody and held without charge or trial or have disappeared.
 Some have been jailed for criticizing government policy.
 Amnesty International has expressed concern over prison
 conditions in the PDRY, including serious deficiencies in
 "hygiene, food, medical service, and the overall treatment of
 prisoners. It says there have been a number of reports of
 ill treatment in prison "ranging from frequent and arbitrary
 harassment of prisoners by prison guards to the most severe
 and brutal torture, known in some cases to have resulted in
 paralysis or even death." Outside observers are usually
 barred from visiting PDRY prisons.
