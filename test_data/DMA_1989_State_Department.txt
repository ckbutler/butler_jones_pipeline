 DOMINICA
 A parliamentary democracy and a member of the Commonwealth of
 Nations, Dominica has been independent since 1978. Prime
 Minister Eugenia Charles' Dominica Freedom Party, in office
 since 1980, was reelected in 1985. The opposition Democratic
 Labour Party won 43 percent of the popular vote in the 1985
 elections. A third party, the Dominica United Workers Party,
 was formed in 1988.
 The police have been the only security force in Dominica since
 1981. The Commissioner of Police supervises a small Special
 Services Unit (SSU), which has been incorporated into the
 Regional Security System of the Eastern Caribbean States, and
 oversees a marine unit which functions as a coast guard. The
 police are controlled by and responsive to the democratically
 elected Government.
 Dominica's economy is based extensively on agriculture. Per
 capita gross domestic product is $1,480. Although rugged
 terrain and periodic devastation from hurricanes have tended
 to hamper development, the economy grew at an impressive rate
 for the previous 3 years before slowing down in early 1989.
 Affected by a drop in prices, banana exports fell by
 approximately 28 percent from the 1988 level. Meanwhile both
 the construction and tourism sectors contracted significantly.
 In September Hurricane Hugo struck parts of the island,
 damaging the banana crop and sections of the country's
 infrastructure. The Government's promotion of agricultural
 diversification, and a number of new manufacturing and
 agricultural ventures (e.g., aloe vera production and a
 cardboard box factory) should help offset the adverse effects
 of these developments.
 The country's human rights record remained good during
 1989.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no reports of torture or other forms of cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. These are
 prohibited by the Constitution.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, or
 exile, and the Government respects these constitutional
 provisions. According to Dominican law, persons arrested or
 detained must be charged with a crime within 24 hours or be
 released from custody. This requirement is honored in

 practice. There were no cases of arbitrary arrest or exile in
 1989.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Dominican law provides for public trial before an independent,
 impartial court. Criminal defendants are presumed innocent
 until proven guilty, are allowed legal counsel, and have the
 right of appeal. Indigents are provided free legal Counsel
 only in capital cases.
 f.. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reports in 1989 of arbitrary government
 interference in the private lives of individuals. Arbitrary
 entry, search, and seizure are prohibited by the Constitution;
 search warrants are required by law.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and- Press
 The right of free expression is provided for by the
 Constitution and adhered to in practice. The political
 opposition openly criticizes the Government. Although the one
 major weekly newspaper is church supported and generally pro-
 Government, it does include opposition viewpoints. Similarly,
 while the main radio station is state-owned, Dominicans enjoy
 access to independent news sources via cable television and
 radio reception from neighboring islands. Opposition groups
 sporadically publish their own "journals."
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government respects the constitutionally mandated freedoms
 of association and assembly and does not hinder opposition
 groups from holding political meetings or public
 demonstrations. Such meetings and gatherings were held
 periodically throughout the year.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholicism is the predominant faith in Dominica, and
 there are various Protestant denominations. There are also
 small Muslim and Rastafarian communities. There is no
 discrimination on the basis of religious faith or practice,
 and outside religious groups are not restricted in their
 activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are provided for by law and respected in
 practice. The Government may revoke passports if subversion
 is suspected, but has not done so in recent times.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Although independent only since 1978, Dominica has a much
 longer tradition of democracy and home rule. Power is
 exercised by a Cabinet appointed by the Prime Minister.
 Elections in 1980 and 1985 were free and fair, and were
 contested by the incumbent Dominica Freedom Party and the
 opposition Labour Party, which won four of 21 seats in the
 latter contest. Elections to be held in 1990 will also be
 contested by a third party, the United Workers Party.
 Elections are by secret ballot and held every 5 years, or
 earlier, at the discretion of the Prime Minister.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Dominica has not been accused of any human rights violatiofts
 by international groups. There are no government restrictions
 on the formation of local human rights organizatians, although
 none exist at present.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There are constitutional provisions, respected in practice,
 against racial or sexual discrimination in Dominica.
 Religious practice is not restricted nor is it the basis for
 discrimination. Labor laws specify equal pay for equal work.
 Officials of the Government's Women's Desk and the Community
 Welfare Desk state that violence against women, including
 domestic violence such as wife beating, is not characteristic
 of Dominican society. Nevertheless, the Government in 1989
 concluded a research project on the subject of violence
 against women. Interviews were conducted with government and
 church officials, with the public, and with victims of abuse.
 The survey touched on such issues as which acts are defined as
 domestic violence, the number of instances of domestic
 violence, and the laws protecting women against violence.
 While there are no specific laws dealing with domestic
 violence, the Government is aware of the problem and is
 investigating its effect on society.
 Section 6   Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the legal right to organize, to choose their
 representatives, and to strike. Approximately 20 percent of
 the work force is organized. Unions are historically more
 closely associated with the opposition than with the current
 governing party. While there were no major strikes in 1989,
 one union used secondary boycotts effectively against two
 employers to force negotiation of pending demands. Unions can
 and do associate with confederations and international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Antiunion discrimination by employers is prohibited by law,
 and union rights are enforced by judicial and police
 authority. Enforcement mechanisms are the responsibility of
 the Department of Labor, whose inspectors carry out
 investigations under the supervision of the Commissioner of
 Labor. Unions have legally defined rights to organize workers
 
 
 550
 and to bargain with employers. Collective bargaining is
 widespread in the nonagricultural sectors of the economy,
 including the government service, and there is also recourse
 to mediation and arbitration by the Government. Labor
 regulations and practice governing Dominica's three industrial
 estates and its other export firms located outside the estates
 do not differ markedly from that prevailing in the rest of the
 economy. About half of the country's export firms have been
 organized by trade unions. However, it is not legally
 compulsory for employers to recognize legally constituted
 unions as bargaining agents. Moreover, as most of the work
 force is female and there is no minimum age for industry, wage
 rates tend to be lower than in the economy generally. Also,
 the small labor inspection office lacks qualified personnel to
 carry but its duties under existing labor legislation.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for-Employment of Children
 The minimum working age is 14 years; this provision is
 generally observed-in practice.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage for agricultural workers is $3.80 per day,
 which is barely sufficient to provide them a minimally decent
 standard of living.- The minimum salary for civil service
 workers is $337 per month. There is no minimum wage law for
 industrial workers. The standard workweek is 40 hours in 5
 days. The law provides for a minimum of 2 weeks' paid
 vacation. The Employment Safety Act, an occupational health
 and safety law, is considered to be consistent with
 international standards. The enforcement mechanism consists
 of inspections by the Department of Labor, which can and does
 prescribe specific compliance measures, impose fines, and
 prosecute offenders.
