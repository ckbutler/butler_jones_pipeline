 ANGOLA
 The Republic of Angola's transition from a single-party state to a multiparty de-
 mocracy and its recovery from 24 years of civil conflict were hindered by delays in
 the implementation of the 1994 Lusaka Protocol between the Government and the
 National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and a renewal of
 fi hting between government and UNITA forces at the end of the year. The Popular
 ovement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) has ruled the country since its inde-
 pendence from Portugal in 1976. The country's competing independence movements
 began a civil war immediately after independence, which lasted until the signing of
 the Bicesse Accords in 1991. Under the Bicesse Accords, one-party rule enddwth
 the passage of a new Constitution that legalized opposition parties and called for
 United Nation (U.N.)-monitored elections that were held in 1992. President Jose
 Eduardo dos Santos of the MPLA won a plurality of the votes cast in an election
 that U.N. observers considered free and fair. UNITA rejected the results of the vote
 and resumed the civil war. The second round of the elections, a runoff between the
 two leading candidates, has yet to take place.
 In 1994 the Government and UNITA signed the Lusaka Protocol in an effort to
 end the civil war. The Lusaka Protocol called for the demilitarization of UNITA, the
 creation of a national army, the seating of a government of national unity and rec-
 onciliation, and the extension of state administration to areas formerly under
 UNITA control. The Government generally complied with its obligations under the
 protocol, although the conduct of the police and, to a lesser extent, military units
 in former UNITA areas drew widespread criticism. UNITA failed to comply with
 several fundamental aspects of the protocol. It maintained a potent military capabil-
 ity and refused to surrender the territory it held. A national unity Government was
 formed in April 1997, and although its existence was threatened when the ruling
 party suspended UNITA's ministers, vice-ministers, and parliamentarians in Sep-
 tember, all those suspended were reinstated by year's end. U.N.-mediated discus-
 sions between the Government and the portion of UNITA loyal to longtime party
 President Jonas Savimbi broke down on September 1, with the Government backing
 a group of party dissidents in a leadership challenge to Savimbi. The cessation of
 direct negotiations led to a resumption of armed conflict in 10 of the country's 18
 provinces. By year's end, UNITA had retaken substantial areas of the country and
 increased its military pressure on government areas. The judiciary, where it func-
 tions, is not independent of the President and the MPLA.
 The Ministry of Interior is responsible for internal security, a function that it ex-
 ercises through the Angolan National Police (ANP), the Rapid Intervention Police
 (PIR), and other organs of state security. The PIR was created in 1992 as an elite
 paramilitary force; it was restricted to its barracks in 1994, but that restriction was
 lifted in October 1997. The Armed Forces of Angola (FAA) are responsible for pro-
 tecting the State against external threats and intervened in foreign conflicts in
 1996, 1997, and 1998. In 1997 the FAA integrated some 10,000 UNITA soldiers.
 However, with the resumption of localized hostilities inside the country the FAA be-
 came involved in counterinsurgency operations against UNITA. The FAA also is in-
 volved in similar operations, although on a smaller scale, against separatists calling
 for the independence of Cabinda province. The Government's security forces are
 firmly under civilian leadership but committed numerous, serious human rights
 abuses.
 The security factors that inhibited the country's transition to full multiparty de-
 mocracy had a similar effect on the country's transition from a directed, state-domi-
 nated economic system to one based on market principles. The Government's eco-
 nomic policies remained geared towards war, creating an environment that enabled
 the Government to resist calls for greater transparency in public accounting. Angola
 produces 750,000 barrels of oil per day, a total that is expected to rise to over a
 
 
 2
 million within the next decade. It produces an estimated $850 million ($574 trillion
 kwanzas) per year in diamonds and has lucrative untapped mineral, agricultural,
 and hydro-electrical resources. However, corruption and mismanagement are perva-
 sive in the public sector and widespread in the private sector. The Government thus
 far has failed to liberalize its import regimes or control its regulatory agencies to
 the extent needed to allow the importation of the goods and services on which the
 economy depends. Annual per capita Gross Domestic Product was approximately
 $450 (303 million kwanzas). Although the country's wealth continued to be con-
 centrated in the hands of a small elite who used government positions for massive
 personal enrichment, the average monthly salary of urban wage earners (a minority
 of the labor force) was far below what is required for basic subsistence. Rural wages
 are even lower as the majority of the rural economy is dependent on subsistence
 agriculture and is highly vulnerable to political unrest. Civilians residing in UNITA-
 held areas live under a primitive and brutal form of economic feudalism, their crops
 and other goods are subject to arbitrary seizure by armed UNITA elements, and
 they are vulnerable to forced labor, including military service. They suffer from ex-
 treme scarcities of consumer goods, basic medical supplies, and other necessities.
 The Government's hmnan rights record continued to be poor, and it continued to
 commit numerous serious abuses. Citizens have no effective means to change their
 government. The second round of the 1992 presidential elections are on hold pend-
 ing the resolution of the peace process; the Government is prepared to hold elections
 subject to a U.N. determination that proper conditions exist. Members of the secu-
 rity forces committed numerous extrajudicial killings, were responsible for dis-
 appearances and tortured, beat, raped and otherwise abused persons. The Govern-
 ment was unable to pay the salaries of the majority of its security service personnel.
 The poor discipline andpoor working conditions of the police force made it the worst
 offender-, military units generally have better discipline and a more effective chain
 of command. Other than those personnel assigned to elite units, the Government
 gives tacit permission for security personnel to pay themselves through the extortion
 of the civilian population. Prison conditions were life-threatening. The Government
 routinely used arbitrary arrest and detention, and 1engthy pretrial detention is a
 problem. The Governent was unable or unwilling to punish those in the security
 services who were responsible for abuses. The judiciary is subject to executive influ-
 ence, only functions in parts of the country, and does not ensure due process. The
 Government infringed on citizen's privacy rights and forcibly recruited military-age
 males. The Government at times restricted freedom of speech and of the press, and
 intimidated journalists int practicing self-censorship. The Government restricted
 freedom of assembly, association, and movement. The Government continued to
 limit independent investigations of human rights abuses, although it allowed inter-
 national human rights organizations, including Human Rights Wateh and Amnesty
 International, to conduct research in the country. Discrimination and violence
 against women were common; adult and child prostitution is a problem; and chil-
 dren and the disabled continued to suffer as result of the ongoing conflict and poor
 economic conditions. The Government continues to dominate the labor movement
 and restricts workers' rights although there were improvements in the independent
 labor sector. Forced labor and child labor are problems.
 UNITA was also responsible for numerous, serious abuses. UNITA forces were re-
 sponsible for killings, disappearances and torture, rape and other abuse. UNITA
 militars units reportedly pillaged rural areas; depopulated large parts of the coun-
 ed traditional leaders, and eliminated all opposition, real or potential.
 UNITA tightiy restricted freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, and
 movement. UNITA refused all attempts to conduct investigations in areas under its
 control. UNITA continues forced military recruitment, including underaged males,
 and uses forced labor for a large part of its local-level logistics. The sexual abuse
 of women conscripted to work as porters is reportedly common in UNITA areas.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kllling.-Incidents of politically motivated
 killings increased during the year as the political situation deteriorated. Security
 forces were responsible for numerous extrjudicial killings. Senior officials of the
 Government told the Joint Commission (the peace monitoring body set up under the
 Lusaka Protocol) that their security forces were incapable of conducting counter-in-
 surgency operations without committing human rights abuses.
 Three UNITA members were shot and killed in Ndalatando on August 27 atier
 being abducted dun the night by men in FAA uniforms. A UNITA member in
 Quibaxe died of gunshot wounds while in police custody on August 25. A UNITA
 
 
 3
 supporter died in police custody in Saurimo on September 5. On July 26 in the
 Luanda neighborhood of Kampao, masked policemen took several young men from
 their homes. The police shot and killed five of the men. The others were taken away
 in a government truck and executed at a later time, according to credible informa-
 tion. In July the Government allegedly killed 10 army personnel, who were former
 UNITA soldiers, in their Luanda barracks. There are credible reports that suspected
 UNITA sympathizers were executed during forced recruitment campaigns during
 the year. A UNITA municipal secretary and over 12 other UNITA officials report-
 edly were executed publicly in April. On April 21 in Albuquerque, ANP officers tor-
 tured to death a UNITA member accused of keeping illegal weapons. On the same
 day, military personnel killed a pregnant woman and her son in Kafifi Kimbu. On-
 April 27, the UNITA provincial secretary in Xa-Cassau was detained, tortured, and
 possibly killed. Army-elisted personnel killed two civilians after they refused to
 provide them cigarettes in Maquela do Zombo on March 30; the soldiers were not
 disciplined. Police officers detained and beat to death a UNITA supporter in
 Ussoque on April 3 on suspicion of keeping illegal arms. Police officers shot and
 killed a civilian on May 21 in Mbaya and tortured to death a demobilized UNITA
 soldier in Quimbele on May 27. Army personnel killed a civilian in Quibaxe in June
 and a policeman stabbed to death a demobilized UNITA soldier in Negage on June
 7. Police officers killed the UNITA communal secretary of Quibaxe on June 9. Police
 officers tortured and killed a UNITA member in Ngola Luigi on March 2. The police
 killed the local UNITA secretary of Cangundu on March 9. None of the above inci-
 dents were investigated, nor was action taken against the persons responsible.
 There were credible reports that the Government and the Front for the Liberation
 of the Cabinda Enclave (FLEG) were responsible for numerous extrajudicial killings
 and torture in Cabinda. There were reports that the FAA and the national police
 engaged in widespread killing, fighting, and looting in Huambo. The Government
 did not take any effective action to punish or deter abusers.
 Prison conditions are life-threatening due to inadequate food, medicine, and sani-
 tation and many prisoners died in official custody (see Section 1.c.).
 A government investigation into the 1997 death of 10 UNITA members in
 Malange concluded that no one was at fault. The Government failed to investigate
 credibly charges that security forces killed 10 former UNITA members who were in-
 tegrated into the armed forces. The killings of senior UNITA officials in Luanda fol-
 lowing the resumption of hostilities also have never been investigated. The Govern-
 ment also has refused to return the bodies of UNITA Vice President Jeremias
 Chitunda and Secretary General Salupeto Pena to their families.
 A number of extrajudicial killings remain unsolved, including the 1996 murders
 of independent journalist Ricardo de Mello and state-television reporter Antonio
 Casimiro and the 1994 murder of the vice governor of Malange province. The results
 of the investigation of the 1993 death of opposition politician Carlos Simea were
 never released.
 Up to 200 localities changed hands during the year, a process that often involved
 the extrajudicial killing of government or UNITA administrators and persons ac-
 cused of collaboration. Internally displaced persons and refugees risked their lives
 to flee to government-held areas or neighboring countries. Undocumented Congolese
 workers in diamond fields were targeted by government or UNITA forces seeking
 to take control of alluvial diamond mining operations. Civilians died in the course
 of engagements between the security services and insurgents, particularly in the
 Central Highlands. Government aircraft bombed military targets in UNITA-held
 towns, which resulted in civilian casualties.
 Despite massive evidence to the contrary, UNITA continued to deny that it still
 maintained military forces. UNITA claimed that actions attributed to its forces
 were, in fact, the work of errant bands of former party loyalists operating on their
 own. Interviews with refugees indicated that UNITA committed abuses, including
 public extrajudicial killings, as a deliberate policy.
 UNITA has never accounted for the deaths of numerous senior party officials, in-
 cluding Wilson dos Santos and Tito Chingji. A number of former high-ranking
 UNITA officials who have defected revealed the extent of extrajudicial killings in
 UNITA-held areas. Two former UNITA secretary generals, a former head of UNITA
 intelligence, and others report that Savimbi personally ordered extrajudicial killings
 of opponents and, in some cases, personally carried out the executions. UNITA also
 has never allowed the U.N. to investigate any claims of human rights abuses in
 areas of the country under its control unless those abuses were thought to be the
 work of government forces.
 Traditional leaders, known as sobas, were frequent targets of UNITA attacks, al-
 though government forces allegedly killed a smaller number. The U.N. Observer
 Mission in Angola (MONUA) reported confirmation that at least 20 sobas were
 
 
 4
 killed in a 4-month period. UNITA killed the Soba of Caninguil on June 27 in a
 public execution that also resulted in the deaths of 14 males between the ages of
 25 and 27. Soba Albert Tome- was killed on August 26 in Njimbo when UNITA
 forces kidnaped 16 military-aged males. UNITA forces killed the soba of Chimbili
 Luciano Cagnala, on July 17. Sobas in Chimbaca, Yeyele, Cassoma, and Camaue
 also were killed, reportedly by UNITA forces, in the same period. The Soba of Cota
 was killed on June 12, allegedly by the local UNITA military commander who forced
 him to lie on the ground and shot him nine times. Four civilians were abducted fol-
 lowing the execution; one of whom escaped and reported that the killing was an act
 of revenge for the soba's disarming of local UNITA sympathizers in December 1997.
 The sobas of Poluesseque, Kitumba, Samba Lucala, Lomaun, and Santa Teresa re-
 portedly were abducted and killed between June and August.
 UNITA attacked the village of Caombo on April 20, killing a father and his son.
 UNITA killed two persons and kidnaped eight persons on April 20 in Guild Pombo.
 On March 28, UNITA killed 14 policemen in Base Porto, possibly as part of a cam-
 aign that resulted in approximately 200 known cases of police officers being killed
 y   TA   forces, including 1 incident near Cuito Cuanavale in which 15 officers
 were executed. Five persons were killed in a UNITA attack on Tschiponga on April
 7 and a man was executed after being tortured in public on May 6 in Cunhinga.
 UNITA forces attacked a village near Chongoroi on.March 15, killing 1 person and
 kidnaping 2 others before burning 35 houses and all the areas under cultivation.
 UNITA forces attacked Santa Ana on March 16 and killed five persons, stole live-
 stock and destroyed thes village's crops. On March 18, UNITA forces killed 1 person
 and stle 400 head of cattle in Catata. UNITA forces kidnaped and subsequently
 killed 3 persons in Sepalanga on March 27. On May 27, UNITA killed two men and
 kidnaped three young girls in Bela Horizonte. UNITA killed one man and kidnaped
 four others (only one of whom returned) on June 3 in Cassoco.
 UNITA attacked the villages of Tchicc and Lussoloe on February 28, killing four
 policemen, three of whom were burned alive in their grass huts. UNITA killed 1 ci-
 vilian and stole 48 head of cattle during an attack on Tchilata on March 4. UNITA
 attacked Cussava on March 7, killing two soldiers and two civilians. At least 105
 rsons werekilled in an attack on Nina Bula, Lunda Norte province, on July 21.
 that the attack took place but had insufficient evidence to assign
 responsibility, although survivors interviewed" by state-run medla sald that the
 attackers were UNA/ members. Many of the victims were Congolese migrant work-
 ers who came to the country to work in the diamond fields. In December UNITA
 A        briefly occupied the town of Cunje and killed approximately 20 civil-
 san   d wh tkrefuge in the town's rain  arch I18   UNITA forces    began
 occupation of the towns of Camapuca, Catabola and Chiguar and reportedly killed
 numerous governent officials and suspected collaborators, in some cases by driving
 over them with tanks. UNITA artillery fire also resulted in deaths and injuries (see
 Section 1.g.). UNITA also laid mines on roads, and on approaches to towns and vil-
 lages, which have led to an unknown, but large number of fatalities (see Section
 2.d.).
 b. Disappearance.-The Government and UNITA continued to accuse each other
 of abductions and dlsappearances of civilians, including government officials, party
 activists, and tradtional leaders. The number of allegations and the prevailing con-
 dtions ofinsecurity made it impossible for the U.N. to investigate all of these alle-
 gations.
 Persons taken into police custody often disappeared without a trace, particularly
 in rural areas. Suspects accused of illegal weapons ownership or collaboration with
 UNITA dlsappeared, as dld UNITA party officials in areas that reverted to govern-
 ment control. MONUA's ability to investigate UNITA allegations of dlsappearances
 and other human rights abuses was diminished by a series of false allegations
 against the Government that tied up investigative assets. However, MONeA deter-
 mined that there were sufficient grounds to accuse the Government of conducting
 extrajudicial abductions and executions. Al army platoon occupied a civilian's house
 in Pira on February 13; the owner and his family disappeared and have not been
 found. There were reports that nine demobilized UNITA soldiers arrested in Janu-
 ary in the Kuando-Kubanyo area disappeared while in custody.
 ivilians abducted by UNITA generally either were recruited forcibly as soldiers
 or support personnel, or were considered government collaborators. UNITA forces
 kidnaped S persons on April 20, and 16 military-aged males on August 16. The soba
 of Saemba was kidnaped by armed men believed to have been UNITA forces on Au-
 gust 20 and has not been seen since. In March UNITA forces kidnaped eight per-
 sons and killed two others in Guild Pombo and attacked a village near Chongoroi,
 killing one person and kidnaping two others (see Section l.a.). In May UNTA forces
 kidnaped three young girls and killed two men in Bela Horizont and in June,
 
 
 UNITA forces killed one man and kidnaped four others in Cassaco (see Section L.a.).
 The frequent discovery of dead bodies in the aftermath of attacks suggested that
 suspected collaborators were summarily executed. Those who escaped UNITA cus-
 tdy and were able to return to government-held areas reported that they were sub-
 jected to torture, beatings, and sexual abuse (see Section I.c.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution and the Penal Code explicitly prohibit all forms of mistreatment
 of suspects, detainees, or prisoners; however, security forces do not respect these
 regulations in practice. The U.N. and human rights organizations report that there
 is widespread government abuse of suspects.
 Security service personnel regularly employed torture and other forms of cruel
 and degrading treatment including rape. Police torture and induced confessions are
 acceptable forms of investigation and are rarely, if ever, punished. Those suspected
 of ties to UNITA regularly are incarcerated under inhuman conditions and-are sub-
 jected to primitive and brutal forms of interrogation. In March police officers tor-
 tured and killed a UNITA member in Ngola Luigi (see Section l.a.). In April in
 Alburquerque and Ussaque, police officers tortured to death two UNITA members
 accused of suspected of keeping illegal weapons (see Section L.a.). Also in April, po-
 lice officers tortured to death a UNITA provincial secretary in Xa-Cassan. In May
 police officers tortured to death a demobilized UNITA soldier in Negage (see Section
 l.a.). There have been no cases in which an army or police official has been dis-
 ciplined for use of excessive force on a UNITA suspect. Police also extorted money
 from travelers at checkpoints (see Section 2.d.).
 Government forces and FLEC forces tortured and killed civilians in the Cabinda
 region (see Section l.a.).
 The U.N. and human rights organizations report that abuse of suspects is univer-
 sal in areas under UNITA control. Interviews with persons who have fled UNITA-
 held areas revealed that UNITA uses cruel and inhuman practices, including public
 torture, to punish dissent and deter further acts of disloyalty. For example, in April
 UNITA forces executed a man after publicly torturing him in Cuninga (see Section
 L.a.). The soba of Muenho was detained and tortured by UNITA personnel on Feb-
 ruary 27. Both of his ears were cut off by attackers who reportedly were enraged
 that he had allowed the government flag to fly over his village. The use of torture
 is not confined to the lower ranks of UNITA forces. There have been repeated credi-
 ble allegations that UNITA President Jonas Savimbi has ordered suspects tortured
 and executed in his presence.
 Prison conditions constituted a serious threat to the health and lives of prisoners.
 The Government and the National Assembly Committee on Human Rights have ac-
 knowledged that conditions are inhuman. Cells are overcrowded and lack basic sani-
 tary facilities. The prison system holds approximately five times the number of pris-
 oners it was built to hold. Many prisons, lacking financial support from the Govern-
 ment, were unable to supply prisoners with adequate food and health care. There
 were credible reports that many prisoners died of malnutrition and disease. Several
 officials in the security forces were arrested for abusing prisoners, but it is not
 known if they were tried.
 Prison officials routinely beat detainees. Prisoners depend on families, friends, or
 international relief organizations for basic support. Prison officials, who are chron-
 ically unpaid, support themselves by stealing from their prisoners and extorting
 family members. Juveniles, often incarcerated for petty theft, are housed with
 adults and suffer abuse by guards and inmates.
 The Government permitted local and international human rights monitors to visit
 prisons during the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention are seri-
 ous ongoing problems. Under the law, a person caught in the act of committing a
 crime may be arrested and detained immediately. Otherwise, the law requires that
 an arrest warrant be issued by a judge or a provincial magistrate. Arrest warrants
 also may be signed by members of the judicial police and confirmed within 5 days
 by a magistrate. The Constitution provides for the right to prompt judicial deter-
 mination of the legality of the detention. Under the law, the prosecution and defense
 have 90 days before a trial to prepare their case, although attorneys generally have
 the right to extend this deadline under extenuating circumstances. The Constitution
 also provides prisoners with the right to receive visits by family members. However,
 none of these rights exist in practice; there is a scarcity of personnel and resources,
 and a lack of official determination to ensure these rights. Although the Ministry
 of Justice is nominally in charge of the prison system, the Ministry of the Interior
 continued to systematically, arbitrarily, and secretly arrest and detain persons for
 all categories of crimes and for indefinite periods, often with no apparent intent to
 bring the detainees to trial.
 
 
 Under the law a person may not be held for over 135 days without trial. In re-
 ality, over 90 percent of inmates in Luanda are still awaiting trial, and it is believed
 that the national average is over 50 percent, It is common to find inmates who have
 been awaiting trial for 2 or 3 years. In many cases, police beat and then release
 detainees rather than make any effort to prepare a formal court case.
 The Government holds a number of political detainees. Government officials regu-
 larly arrested and detained UNITA officials and supporters in areas that had re-
 cently reverted back to state administration. The Government invariably accused
 these persons of illegal weapons possession or collaboration with UNITA, although
 formal charges rarely were ified...
 UNITA continues to detain persons agalnst their will. The number of such per-
 sons is unknown, though a number of confirmed cases exist: Eugenio Manuvakola
 (former UNITA Secretary General and signer of the Lusaka Protocol), Germana
 Malaquias, Linda Arthur Chipuku, Shita Nkongo Artur Danda, Carlos Emerson
 Artur Danda, and Telma Nunda. Manuvakola was kept under house arrest for 3
 years, escaping to Luanda in August 1997, where he recounted the harsh conditions
 of his illegal detention and torture, and gave credible reports of substantial numbers
 of persons under UNITA house arrest.
 The Lusaka Protocol provides for the release, under International Committee of
 the Red Cross (ICRC) auspices, of persons detained for war-related reasons. With
 the resurgence in government-UNITA fighting in several areas of the country, pris-
 oners of war (POW's) already may have been taken by both sides. Neither the Gov-
 ernment nor UNITA has made any efforts to notif te ICRC or any other institu-
 tion that it has POW's in custody. Strong anecdotal information suggests that
 POW's are routinely and summarily executed by both sides.
 The Government did not use forced exile as a form of punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but in practice the court system lacked the means, experience, training, and
 political backing to assert its independence from the President and the ruling MPLA
 party. The President has strong ap ointive powers, including the power to appoint
 Supreme Court justices without con rm ation by the National Assembly. The judcial
 system largely was destroyed during the civil war and did not function in large
 areas of the country. A constitutional court mandated by the 1991 Constitution had
 yet to be established at year's end.
 The court system consists of the Supreme Court at the appellate level plus munic-
 ipal and provincial courts of original jurisdiction under the nominal authority of the
 Supreme Cot. Only 9 of the 12 seats on the Supreme Court were filled by year's
 end. The Supreme Cor serves as the appellate division for questions of law and
 fact but does not have the authority to interret the Constitution. The Constitution
 reserves that role for a constitutional court, but that entity had not yet been estab-
 lished by year's end. The government attempt to suspendthe UNITA members of
 the National Assembly on September 1 (see Section 3) was referred to the Supreme
 Court, which declined to issue a ruling, thereby missing an opportunity to establish
 the competence of the courts to rule on the constitutionality of executive actions.
 Trials for political and security crimes are supposed to be handled exclusively by
 the Supreme Court, but there were no known cases of such trials.
 The Constitution provides defendants with the presumption of innocence, the
 right to a defense, and the right to appeal. Legal reform in 1991 established the
 right to public trials, established a system of bail, and recognized the accused's right
 to counsel. However, the Government does not respect these rights in practice.
 Judges are usually lay persons, not licensed lawyers. The judge and two lay persons
 elected by the full court act as- the jury.
 UNITA has established a nominal military and civilian court system in territories
 under its control and claims that its civil code is equivalent to the Portuguese civil
 code currently used by the Government. UNITA President Jonas Savimbi appoints
 judges personally, and UNITA trials are not open to the public. Juries consist of
 male elders chosen from the community. The accused reportedly has the right to a
 lawyer. However, areas of the country under UNITA control remain under strict
 martial law.
 There are credible reports that the Government holds political prisoners; however,
 the number is unknown. The Government denies that it holds political prisoners.
 There are numerous confirmed cases of UNITA-held political prisoners. It is un-
 known if persons detained by UNITA have been convicted by some judicial proce-
 dure. Even if they were, decisions made by self-styled UNITA courts have no stand-
 ingunder the legal system of the Republic of Angola or other protections of the rule
 of law.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government infringed on citizens' privacy rights. The Government maintained a so-
 
 
 7
 phisticated security apparatus dedicated to the surveillance, monitoring, and wire-
 tapping of certain groups, including opposition party leaders, journalists, members
 of theNational Assembly and foreign diplomats. Legal requirements for search war-
 rants routinely are disregarded. In an attempt to enforce mandatory military service
 laws that had not been enforced for 4 years, the military and police conducted forced
 recruiting in many of the areas under the control of the Government, including the
 poorer neighborhoods of Luanda. Although some minors were caught up in forced
 recruitment operations, the Government did not actively attempt to conscript under-
 age soldiers. Under the law, military service is obligatory, but the pattern of the
 forced recruitment indicated a policy of preying on poor communities and unem-
 ployed young men. Those who could prove that they had jobs usually were released,
 and those with financial means could buy their way out of the military. The Govern-
 ment denied that forced recruiting was taking place, stating that it was conducting
 mass arrests of petty criminals. Church groups, civil society institutions, and foreign
 embassies contradicted these claims.
 UNITA continued to conscript civilians forcibly for military duty (see Section 1.g.).
 In addition, there were credible reports that military-aged Rwandan refugees, in-
 cluding minor children, were conscripted forcibly into UNITA's forces.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-MONUA concluded that the escalation in military operations by both the
 Government and UNITA resulted in a dramatic increase in the number and severity
 of human rights violations. MONUA found that the impact of increased military op-
 erations on civilian populations has been enormous; in addition to 270,000 new in-
 ternally displaced persons, military attacks have resulted in indiscriminate and
 summary killings, torture, abductions, destruction of property, and theft. The prov-
 inces most affected were Lunda Nortet, Lunda Sul, Malange, Bie, Uige, and
 Huambo. Congolese diamond miners were victims in numerous attacks on alluvial
 mining operations in Lunda Norte province.
 The Government's security forces often were accused of behaving like an occupy-
 ing army in areas of the country that previously had been under UNITA control.
 UNITA alleged that its party officials and structures were expelled from 212 of the
 270 sites that it allowed to revert to state administration. Although UNITA unilat-
 erally abandoned most of the sites, frequently in advance of attacks on government
 positions, UNITA party structures claim they were harassed and driven out of ap-
 proximately 30 to 40 localities. These included major towns, where there were nu-
 merous confirmed cases in which UNITA officials were killed, tortured, abducted,
 or harassed.
 The Government's inability or unwillingness to pay the majority of its army and
 police personnel resulted in widespread extortion and theft. Government personnel
 frequently confiscated food, including donated relief supplies, livestock, andpersonal
 property, often after forcibly depopulating areas and robbing the displaced persons.
 The Government and UNITA continue to use land mines to strengthen defensive
 position, and in the case of UNITA, prevent residents within its own areas from
 fleeing to government-held areas (see Section 2.d.).
 UNITA forces routinely violated citizen's rights in pursuit of military objectives.
 The nature of attacks, most of which involve small groups operating in rural areas
 at night, make it difficult to assign responsibility. However, MONUA reported that
 collected evidence suggests UNITA is responsible for a substantial number of at-
 tacks on rural communities. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1190 of August 13 de-
 manded that "UNITA cease its re-occupation of localities where state administration
 was established and stop attacks by its members on civilians." In December UNITA
 forces used artillery to shell the town of Kuito, Huambo and Malange killing hun-
 dreds of persons and wounding many others.
 UNITA conducted forced recruiting, including minors, throughout all of the coun-
 try's disputed territory. Recruits were taken to isolated military camps and sub-
 jected to psychological stress and extreme hardships; those who attempted to desert
 were executed. Women, many as young as 13 years old, were recruited forcibly to
 serve as porters and camp followers, and reports of sexual assault were widespread
 and credible.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion and of the press and specifically provides that the media cannot be subject to
 ideological, political, or artistic censorship; however, the Government does not al-
 ways respect this right in practice. Although the Governments performance in this
 area improved, problems remained. The Government continued to intimidate and
 threaten journalists into practicing self-censorship. There were reports that the Gov-
 ernment pays journalists to publish progovernment stories. The majority of the
 
 
 8
 media is state-run and carries very little criticism of the Government. Semi-inde-
 pendent newspapers and private radio stations grew increasingly bold in their criti-
 cism of government policies and actions- Three private weekly publications and five
 commercial radio stations openly criticize aspects of government policies and high-
 light poor socioeconomic conditions.
 Nonetheless, journalists acknowledge that there are boundaries they cannot cross
 and that they exercise self-censorship when it comes to reporting on the military
 situation, internal security, or other highly sensitive matters. However, there was
 increasing private media attention to corruption and economic mismanagement. The
 state-run media briefly carried live footage from debates in the National Assembly
 in which: the Government came under strong criticism from opposition parties and
 even some MPLA deputies. The Government halted live television broadcasts of the
 National Assembly stating that the cost was prohibitive; UNITA and other opposi-
 tion parties claimed that this was a form of censorship.
 Media policy and censorship are controlled by a committee composed of the Min-
 ister of Social Communication, the Spokesman of the Presidency, and the directors
 of state-run media organizations. The MPLA's parliamentary leader is also an influ-
 ential figure on the content and tone of state-run media-reporting. The Government
 used its control of the media to engage in a hostile propaganda campaign be  g
 in July. Hostile propaganda was prohibited by the Lusaka Protocol, but the Govern-
 ment broadcast a series of unfounded and unconfirmed allegations of UNITA mas-
 sacres as a means of influencing local and international public opinion.
 The Government did not restrict the activities of foreign media, including the
 British Broadcasting Corporation and Voice of America, although it continued to
 refuse to allow direct retransmission. Foreign journalists require authorization from
 the Ministry of the Interior in order to obtain access to government officials or to
 travel within the country. The Government placed no abnormal visa restrictions on
 foreign journalists and allowed them freedom to report on all aspects of society. The
 Government allowed the U.N. to contribute to broadcast content but denied it the
 ability to open its own radio station.
 UNITA ceased broadcasting over its shortwave station, Radio Vorgan, as part of
 its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol UNITA was granted a license to run a
 FM station but chose not to begin operations. No media organizations can function
 in UNITA-controlled areas except under the absolute control of party officials.
 UNITA sporadically published a newspaper, which could not be found in govern-
 ment areas, and no media personnel were allowed free access to UNITA areas.
 Academic life has been severely circumscribed by the civil war, but there is aca-
 demic freedom, and academics do not practice self-censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly;, however, the Government strictly controls this right in prac-
 tice. The law requires a minimum of 3 days' prior notice before public or private
 assemblies are held and makes participants liable for "offenses against the honor
 and consideration due to persons and to organs of sovereignty." Applications for
 progovernment assemblies are granted routinely without delay; however, applica-
 tions for protest assemblies are rarely granted.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association; however, the Government
 strictly controls this right in practice. Legislation allows the Government to deny
 registration to private associations on security grounds, and the Government arbi-
 trarily limits organized activities deemed adverse to its interests.
 There is no freedom of assembly or association in areas of the country under
 UNITA control.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, includ-
 ing the separation of church and state, and the Government respects this right in
 practice. Members of the clergy in government-held areas regularly use their pulpits
 to criticize government policies. In 1996 a German clergyman was charged with sub-
 versive activities for speaking out on social issues, but there were no reported cases
 of such charges during the year.
 While in general UNITA permits freedom of religion, interviews with persons who
 left UNITA-controlled areas reveal that the clergy does not enjoy the right to criti-
 cize UNITA policies.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement and residence, and
 freedom of exit from and entry into the country, however, the Government does not
 respect these rights in practice. A network of overnment checkpoints throughout
 the country interfered with the right to travel. Such checkpoints serve as the prin-
 cipal source of income for many of the country's security service personnel. Extortion
 at checkpoints is routine in the center of Luanda and pervasive on major commer-
 cial routes. While it rarely reaches the level of an absolute prohibition on travel,
 
 
 9
 it does seriously restrict the movement of persons and goods in areas of the country
 under government control. The Government routinely cuts off access to areas of the
 country that are deemed insecure or beyond the administrative authority of the
 State. Transportation links between government and UNITA-held territory were re-
 duced sharply as a result of increased conflict. The Government prohibited the for-
 eign travel of four UNITA officials: two members of the National Assembly and two
 representatives to the Joint Commission. The Government did not place restrictions
 on emigration and repatriation; however, there were reports that immigration offi-
 cials harassed and extorted money from foreign businessmen.
 Human rights and relief workers who interviewed Angolan refugees and displaced
 persons reported that UNITA actively seeks to prevent civilian populations from
 fleeing to areas of government control. The pattern that emerged from the discus-
 sions suggested that UNITA uses military patrols, checkpoints, and land mines to
 keep persons from leaving their home areas. Refugees who fled Angola and who
 were not part of the Ovimbundu majority within UNITA said that arbitrary public
 punishment, including death by firing squad or by immolation, were used to deter
 persons from leaving.
 The greatest impediment to the freedom of internal circulation were mines laid
 by UNITA forces on roads, many of which were demined at considerable expense
 by the international community. According to the U.N. and nongovermental orga-
 nization (NGO) reporting, UNITA uses antipersonnel and antivehicle mines to pre-
 vent government personnel from entering areas under its control and to prevent its
 persons within its areas from fleeing to government towns. UNITA also used new
 land mines to make areas unsuitable for cultivation and to deny hostile populations
 access to water supplies and other necessities. Government mining generally was
 confined to defensive positions around towns that came under threat of UNITA at-
 tack. Late in the year, UNITA began a major land mine campaign and planted new
 mines indiscriminately along roads and on approaches to towns and villages. It is
 impossible to estimate the number of land mines in the country, but the fear of in-
 jury and death from land mines effectively imprisoned and impoverished entire com-
 munities. There are 80,000 survivors of land mine explosions, and an unknown
 number of fatalities (both totals continue to rise).
 The law provides for the granting of refugee and asylee status in accordance with
 the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR). The Government provides first asylum to refugees. An eligibility commit-
 tee to evaluate asylum claims was established on paper in 1990, was first staffed
 in 1995, and now meets regularly to evaluate asylum requests. There are approxi-
 mately 9,600 refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo, at least 1,000 of
 whom officially have been granted refugee status. There were no reports of the
 forced expulsion of persons with valid claims to refugee status. The majority of
 Rwandan refugees in Luau, Moxico province, an area that reverted to government
 control in September 1997, had left the country for camps in Zambia at year's end.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides all adult citizens with the right to vote by secret ballot
 in direct multiparty elections to choose the President of the Republic and Deputies
 in the 220-seat National Assembly; however, inpractice, citizens have no effective
 means to change their government. The Lusaka Protocol establishes the mechanism
 for returning the country to an electoral calendar, but noncompliance, particularly
 by UNITA, has indefinitely postponed any new elections. Opposition parties com-
 lain of harassment and intimidation by government security forces.
 The President is elected by absolute majority. If no candidate wins such a major-
 ity, there is a runoff between the two candidates with the most votes. Of the 220
 deputies in the National Assembly, 130 are elected on a national ballot, and 90 are
 elected to represent the provinces. The Electoral Law also calls for the election of
 three additional deputies to represent Angolans living abroad; however, those posi-
 tions were not filledin the 1992 elections.
 Ruling power is concentrated in the President who appoints the Prime Minister
 and other members of the Council of Ministers, through which the President exer-
 cises executive power. The Council can enact decree-laws, decrees, and resolutions,
 thereby controlling most functions normally associated with the legislative branch.
 The National Assembly has, since its inception, served as a rubber stamp for the
 Council of Ministers. The seating of 70 UNITA deputies in April 1997 fostered sub-
 stantive debates for the first time on issues ranging from the peace process to the
 Government's budgeting priorities and accountability. In February the National As-
 sembly conducted a highly critical debate of the Government's budget proposal and
 
 
 10
 continued to serve as a growing forum for discussion. However, an attempt to sus-
 pend the UNITA members of the National Assembly and the Government's recogni-
 tion of a dissident UNITA group as the only legitimate UNITA group resulted in
 the fragmentation of the opposition within the Assembly and a corresponding de-
 cline in national debate.
 The 1992 elections'were the first multiparty democratic elections in the country's
 history and were conducted with U.N. supervision and financial support. MPLA
 President Jose Eduardo dos Santos won a plurality of votes cast in the presidential
 election (49 percent) and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi finished second (40 percent).
 Although local and international observers declared the election to be generally free
 and fair and called on UNITA to accept the results, UNITA claimed that the elec-
 tions were fraudulent, rejected the results, and returned the country to civil war.
 The runoff electiont between dos Santos and Savimbi was never held. The Lusaka
 Protocol stated that it would take place following a U.N. determination that req-
 uisite conditions exist, but that remains a distant prospect.
 In April 1997, UNITA and 10 smaller opposition parties joined the ruling MPLA
 in a government of national unity and reconciliation. UNITA officials assumed 4
 ministerial and 7 vice-ministerial positions, and 70 UNITA deputies took their
 seats. UNITA governors, vice governors, and local administrators were nominated
 but had not taken up their positions by the end of the year. These positions were
 filled by members of a dissident UNITA group, UNITA-renovada, which is recog-
 nized and assisted by the Government. The National Assembly promulgated a spe-
 cial status for Savimbi, declaring him the leader of the largest opposition party and
 providing him with 5 official residences and a bodyguard contingent of 400 person-
 nel. The National Assembly revoked Savimbi's status on October 27, for abrogating
 his duties under the Lusaka Protocol.
 On September 1, the Government announced the suspension of the 11 UNITA
 cabinet officials and 70 deputies, citing UNITA's failure to demilitarize and to sur-
 render the territory that it occupied, both of which were in contravention of the
 Lusaka Protocol. The Government backed the creation of a dissident faction of
 UNITA, UNITA-renovada, led by Minister of Hotels and Tourism Jorge Valentin. It
 reinstated 9. of the 11 cabinet officials once they either stated their support for the
 dissident faction UNITA-renovada or renounced their party affiliation. The Govern-
 ment asked the- Supreme Court to back-the suspension of UNITA deputies who re-
 fused to join the dissident faction, but the Court failed to issue a ruling. The Presi-
 dent of the National Assembly gave UNITA-renovada the right to change the party's
 representation in the National Assembly, a right that dissident leader Valentin used
 in an attempt to replace 15 of the 70 deputies. However, all UNITA deputies
 present in Luanda, regardless of their position regarding the dissident faction, were
 reinstated and seated when the legislaturexeconvened on October 20.
 There are no legal barridrs to the participation of women in the political process;
 however, they were underrepresented. Women occupy only 10 of 83 cabinet posi-
 tions, 35 of 220 seats in -the National Assembly, and none of the 9 places on the
 Supreme Court.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and Nongovernmental
 Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not absolutely prohibit independent investigations of its
 himan rights record, but it fails to cooperate and often uses false security conditions
 as a justification to deny access to affected areas.
 The Constitution provides for the creation of an office of the Provider of Justice,
 or ombudsman, designated by the National Assembly for a 4-year-term, to defend
 citizens' rights and liberties. However, this office had not yet been constituted at
 year's end.
 The September 7 report of the U.N., Secretary General stated that MONUA's
 human rights investigations took place "despite a lack of cooperation on the ground"
 and restrictions imposed by government officials. The MONUA Human Rights Mon-
 itoring Group, established in 1997 to conduct human rights training for U.N. forces
 and investigate individual cases of human rights abuses, had a countrywide pres-
 ence prior to the outbreak of hostilities late in the year.
 UNITA consistently refused to allow MONUA access to areas under its control,
 usually by failing to provide liaison officers to MONUA patrols. Since no MONUA
 investigation can take place without a liaison officer, the U.N. considers that this
 constitutes denial-of access. State-run and private media in government controlled
 areas gave extensive coverage to alleged abuses in UNITA areas, but the reporting
 usually had an obvious political bias and did not appear credible.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Under the Constitution all citizens are equal before the law and enjoy the same
 rights and responsibilities regardless of color, race, ethnicity, sex, place of birth, reli-
 gion, ideology, degree of education, or economic or social condition. The Government
 does not have the ability to enforce these provisions effectively.
 Women.-Violence against women was widespread. Credible evidence indicated
 that a significant proportion of homicides was perpetrated against women, usually
 by their spouses. In 1997 a Ministry of Women was created to deal specifically with
 violence agst women. A series of national conferences on women's rights, par-
 tially funded by foreign donors, continued to produce calls for the Government to
 amend the Civil Code to end women's legal inequality, create a social welfare pro-
 gram, and strengthen enforcement mechanisms for existing legislation.
 The Constitution and Family Code provide for equal rights without regard to gen-
 der. However, a portion of the Civil Code dates back to colonial times and includes
 discriminatory provisions against women in the areas of inheritance, property sales,
 and participation in commercial activities.
 The maternal mortality rate in 1996 was estimated at 1,500 deaths per 100,000
 live births. There are no effective mechanisms to enforce child support laws, and
 women carry the majority of responsibilities in raising children. Due to poor eco-
 nomic conditions, an increasing number of women engaged in prostitution.
 Despite constitutional protections, women suffer from discrimination. The law pro-
 vides for equal pay for equal work, but in practice, women rarely are compensated
 equally. Some women hold senior positions in the military (primarily in the medical
 field) and civil service, but women mostly are relegated to low-level positions in
 state-run industries and in the small private sector. In much of the country, women
 constituted a growing percentage of the disabled, as they were most likely to become
 victims of land mines while foraging for food and firewood in agrcultual areas.
 Under the law, adult women may open bank     bac     cept employment and own
 property without interference from their spouses. Upon the death of a male head
 of household, the widow automatically is entitled to 50 percent of the estate with
 the remainder divided equally among legitimate children.
 Children.-The Government gave only marginal attention to children's rights and
 welfare even though some 50 percent of the population is believed to be under the
 age of 15. The Ministry of Education barely functions due to lack of resources. Pri-
 vate religious, community, or corporate groups have been unable to fill the vacuum.
 Teachers are chronically unpaid and the net enrollment rate of school age children
 is 40 percent, with an 18 percent gap favoring boys over girls. Almost 1 million chil-
 dren are estimated to be out of school, with no prospect of integrating them into
 the education system. Most educational infrastructures are partially or totally dam-
 aged and lack basic equipment and teaching materials.
 UNITA and the Government allowed 8,000 child soldiers to be demobilized in
 1996-1997. The Government has not brought any significant numbers of children
 back into the armed forces, although some children have been caught up in forced
 recruitment campaigns (see Section 1.f.). There are credible reports that UNTA has
 forcibly recruited children into its armed forces.
 UNICEF estimates that ther   ae approximately 5,000 street children in Luanda;
 some are orphans or abandoned while others ran away from their families or gov-
 ernment facilities that were unable to support them. Living conditions in govern-
 ment youth hostels is so poor that the majority of homeless children preferred to
 sleep on city streets. Street children shine shoes, wash c  ars andiarry water, but
 many resort topetty crime, begging, and prostitution in order to survive. One inter-
 national NGO that works with street children estimated that there are 500 to 1,000
 underage prostitutes in Luanda.
 The government-sponsored National Institute for Children is a well-intentioned
 organization, but it lacks the capacity to adequately assist efforts by international
 nongovernmental organizations to assist dispossessed youth. There are no active pri-
 vate children's rights advocacy groups.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM) is widely condemned by international health ex-
 ertsnas damaging to both physical and psychological health. There has been very
 ittle evidene of the practice of FGM. It had reportediy occurred rarely in remote
 areas of Moxico province, bordering the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zam-
 bia in past years. However, information from local and international health workers,
 including midwives, indicated that FGM is not practiced by indigenous groups
 People With Disabilities.-The number of the physically disabled persons includes
 an estimated 80,000 disabled land mine survivors. While there is no institutional
 discrimination against the disabled, the Government is doing little to improve their
 physical, financial, or social conditions. There is no legislation mandating accessibil-
 
 
 ity for the disabled in public or private facilities, and, in view of the degradation
 of the country's infrastructure and high unemployment rate, it is difficut for the
 disabled to find employment or participate in the education system.
 National/RacialEthnic Minorities.-The population includes 1 to 2 percent of
 Khoisan and other linguistically distinct hunter-gatherer tribes scattered through
 the provinces of Namibe, Cunene, and Cuando Cubango. There is no evidence that
 they suffer from official discrimination or harassment, but they do not participate
 actively in the political or economic life of the country and have no ability to influ-
 ence government decisions concerning their interests.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-The Constitution provides for the right to form and
 join trade unions, engage in union activities, and strike; however, the Government
 does not consistently respect these rights in practice. The Government dominated
 the National Union of Angolan workers (UNTA), which is the labor movement affili-
 ated with the ruling MPLA party;, however, the General Center of Independent and
 Free Labor Unions of Angola (CGSILA) is independent. The law requires that labor
 unions be recognized by the Government. Restrictions on civil liberties potentially
 prevent any labor activities not approved by the-Government. However, the major
 impediment to labor's ability to advocate on behalf of workers is the 80 -percent for-
 mal sector unemployment rate.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike. Legislation passed in 1991 pro-
 vides the legal framework for, and strictly regulates, that right. The law prohibits
 lockouts and worker occupation of places of employment, and provides protection for
 nonstriking workers. It prohibits strikes by military and police personnel, prison
 workers, and fire fighters. The law does not prohibit employer retribution against
 strikers effectively.
 A CGSILA-affiliated union, which organized nonfaculty employees at Agostinho
 Neto University, staged a successful strike demanding back wages and salary in-
 creases. A countrywide teachers' union, -the SIMPROF, also staged strikes demand-
 ing better pay and working conditions. Unions have the right to affiliate inter-
 nationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to organize and for collective bargaining; however, the Government gen-
 erally does not respect those- rights in practice. The Government dominates the
 economy through state-run enterprises. The Ministry of Public Administration, Em-
 ployment, and Social Security sets wages and benefits on an annual basis. Legisla-
 tion prohibits discrimination against union members and calls for worker com-
 plaints to be adjudicated in regular civil courts. Under the law, employers found
 guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers who have been
 or union activities. In practice, neither the Labor Code nor the judicial system
 are capable of defending these rights.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law permits the Government
 to force workers back to work for breaches of worker discipline and participation in
 strikes, and has been cited by the International Labor Organization as an example
 of forced labor in violation of ILO Conventions. The law prohibits forced or bonded
 child labor, and there are no reports that such labor occurs in government-held
 areas; however, the Government does not have the capacity to enforce this legisla-
 tion in nongovernment-held areas.
 UNITA forces regularly abduct children for military service and other forms of
 forced labor, UNITA depends on forced labor for much of its logistics. Refugees and
 internally displaced persons reported that rural women frequently are forced to
 work as porters for UNITA military units and kept in life-threatening conditions of
 servitude. There were also credible reports of sexual assault.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 minimum age for employment is 14 years. Children between the ages of 14 and 18
 may not work at night, in dangerous conditions, or in occupations requiring great
 physical effort. However, these provisions generally are not enforced. The Inspector
 General of the Ministry of Public Administration, Employment, and Social Security
 is responsible for enforcing labor laws. The Ministry maintains employment centers
 where prospective employees register, and the center screens out applicants under
 the age of 14. However, many younger children work on family farms as domestic
 servants, and in the informal sector. Family-based child labor in subsistence agri-
 culture is common. Poverty and social upheavals have brought large numbers of or-
 phaned and abandoned children, as well as runaways, into unregulated urban em-
 ployment in the informal sector. The law' prohibits forced or bonded child labor, but
 the Government is unable to enforce these provisions (see Section 6.c.).
 
 
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage set by the Ministry of
 Public Administration, Employment, and Social Security was approximately $30 (20
 million kwanzas) per month prior to the rapid devaluation of the kwanza in the
 mid-1990's. Currently the minimum wage is set at approximately $3 (2 million
 kwanzas) per month. However, the Government does not enforce this standard. Nei-
 ther the minimum wage nor the average monthly salary, which are estimated at $75
 (49 million kwanzas) to $200 (135 million kwanzas) per month, are sufficient to pro-
 vide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. As a result, most wage
 earners depend on the informal sector, subsistence agriculture, corruption, or sup-
 port from abroad to augment their incomes.
 A 1994 government decree established a 37-hour workweek. However, the Min-
 istry of Public Administration was unable to enforce this standard, just as it was
 unable to enforce existing occupational safety and health standards. Workers cannot
 remove themselves for dangerous work situation without jeopardizing their contin-
 ued employment.
