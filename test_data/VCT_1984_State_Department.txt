 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines retains the multi-party
 parliamentary system of government which it inherited when it
 became independent from the United Kingdom in 1979. Democratic
 traditions and respect for the rights of the individual have
 continued since then. On July 25, 1984, the ruling St. Vincent
 Labor Party of Prime Minister Milton Cato was defeated by the
 New Democratic Party led by James F. Mitchell, who assumed
 office.
 St. Vincent is a poor country with a very young population,
 half of which is under 15 years of age. Unemployment,
 especially among the young, is a serious problem. The economy
 of St. Vincent remained sluggish in 1984 mainly because of a
 slow recovery from the world-wide recession and exchange rate
 reductions which affected the vital banana industry.
 Although the Royal St. Vincent Police are the only security
 force in the country, a special service unit has been
 established within the police. In addition, a marine wing has
 been created under police command, although some members of the
 wing are not from the police force. The force maintains
 British traditions of professionalism which place a high value
 on respect for human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killing in 1984
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports of torture or cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment in 1984.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides for legal representation of the
 detained and for periodic review of their cases. The
 Government assiduously follows these provisions. There were no
 reports of arbitrary arrests, other forms of detention, or
 summary exile in 1984.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for public trials before an
 independent and impartial court, a presumption of innocence,
 and right to legal counsel. Appeals can be made ultimately to
 the British Privy Council.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There have been no reports of the arbitrary intrusion of the
 state into the private life of the individual. The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry and search, and this
 prohibition is honored by the authorities.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and of the press,
 and the Government respects these rights. There is no
 censorship or interference in the operation of newspapers,
 which may openly and freely criticize the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to assemble peaceably is respected in practice.
 Public meetings and demonstrations opposing the Government took
 place during 1984. The Government has adhered to the
 International Labor Organization's Convention on Freedom of
 Association. Unions enjoy the right of collective bargaining.
 They represent approximately 7,000 workers, or slightly more
 than 10 percent of the labor force.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All religions are free to practice and proselytize in St.
 Vincent and the Grenadines.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are guaranteed in law and honored in practice.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 St. Vincent has a freely elected parliamentary system of
 government in which citizens have a genuine choice of parties.
 In the 1984 general elections the New Democratic Party enjoyed
 an overwhelming electoral victory by winning nine of the
 thirteen seats in Parliament and gaining control of the office
 of Prime Minister. Another general election must occur by 1989.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no branches of international human rights
 organizations in St. Vincent. There is no local body which
 publicly monitors human rights violations, although opposition
 political groups occasionally comment on human rights
 practices. The Government is responsive to public and private
 inquiries on its human rights practices. Amnesty International
 did not report on St. Vincent and the Grenadines in 1984;
 Freedom House listed the country as 'free'.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines with a population of 101,000
 inhabitants is a small, poor country with a moderately growing
 population (1.4 percent growth in 1984). Per capita GNP in
 1982 was estimated at $616. The country relies heavily on its
 ailing agriculture sector; bananas are the principal export
 crop.

 ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
 The new Mitchell Government has identified an international
 airport, assistance to the outlying Grenadine islands, and
 tourist development as essential to economic progress. Growth
 of the economy also depends on the inflow of external public
 assistance.
 The Governmentemphasizes education in its development
 policies. It has a ten-year compulsory education system. The
 adult literacy rate is about 95.6 percent.
 The provision of health care is seriously hampered by a
 shortage of funds, facilities, and personnel. The improvement
 of physical facilities has occurred, but many trained personnel
 migrate each year because of low wages. St. Vincent has a
 rather high infant mortality rate of 51 per thousand live
 births. There is an ongoing family planning program.
 The role of women in society is not restricted legally,
 although most women still center their lives around the home.
 Women are expected to take a greater part in other sectors of
 society in the future as they take greater advantage of public
 education programs, health facilities, and family planning.
