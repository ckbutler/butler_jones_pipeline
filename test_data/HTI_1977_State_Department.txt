 HAITI
 Haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere.
 It has a long tradition of authoritarian rule. Human
 rights violations were widespread during the regime
 of the late Francois Duvalier in the 1960's. The present
 Government is led by President-for-Life Jean-Claude
 Duvalier. Organized political opposition is not permitted.
 However, in 1977 the Government released a large number
 of political prisoners. The Government also adhered to
 the American Convention on Human Rights, and declared
 its intention to respect legal norms in the treatment
 of all future security offenders.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Incidents of severe brutal treatment, verging on torture,
 have occurred in Haitian prisons in the recent past (see
 lb below), but torture does not appear to be practiced
 or condoned at present.
 b. Cruel; Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Brutality as opposed to deliberate torture has been
 used both-as punishment for minor criminal infractions
 to extract confessions and to impose discipline in prison.
 This practice has been a part of the Haitian penal tradi-
 tion. Several exile opponents of the Government released
 in September 1977 claim that torture and deplorable
 prison conditions continue unabated. Most prisoners
 released in 1977, however, report less frequent use
 of brutality. Stricter control over prison guards' conduct
 has apparently been instituted.
 Sanitary conditions in prisons remain deficient but are
 being improved. The Fort Dimanche prison, which is
 reportedly being replaced by a modern facility, had
 a very high rate of mortality. The new prison is reported
 to have adequate cells, a hospital, and a visitor's
 room.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 During the 1960s arbitrary arrest and imprisonment were
 practiced on a large scale. Since the early 1970s Presi-
 dent Jean-Claude Duvalier has proclaimed a policy of

 national reconciliation" between the present Government
 and its opponents. Arrests for security or political
 reasons have declined substantially. Following the release
 of 290 prisoners in three amnesties in December 1976 and
 February and September 1977, the Government declared.
 there were no longer any political prisoners.  However,
 a few of those released in September 1977 claim there
 are at least eight remaining. After the December 1976
 releases Amnesty International expressed some doubt
 as to the authenticity of the names of people the Haitian
 Government claimed it had released, their status as pol-
 itical prisoners, and whether they had been actually
 freed. Subsequently, all 105 of the persons freed in
 September 1977 were presented to the press and repre-
 sentatives of the diplomatic corps at the time of their
 release.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Civil cases are handled publicly under formal court
 procedures, although the case backlog is large. Criminal
 assizes open to the public resumed in 1975 after a lapse
 of many years and have been held regularly since then.
 When public trials are held, defendants can be repre-
 sented by-counsel and the proceedings are usually fair.
 The criminal trials of 1976 and 1977 resulted in a number
 of acquittals. News media cover such trials freely. A
 "State Security Tribunal" has been established with the
 stated purpose of ensuring trials for all future security
 offenders.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Since 1971 the Government has made increasing efforts,
 to improve the condition of life in Haiti, focusing on
 agriculture, public health, infrastructure, and light
 industry. Among the policies and measures undertaken
 in response to the needs of the poor are: the preparation
 of a second five year development plan (1976-1981); a
 134% increase in the Government's development budget from
 1971 to 1975; better mobilization of resources, e.g.,
 by channeling 50% of the profits from the Tobacco and
 Match monopoly, which are not included in the general
 revenue of the Government for accounting purposes, to
 
 
 174
 development purposes; increased government investment in
 the agricultural sector; a gradual modification of the
 tax structure to shift taxes from domestically produced
 commodities toward imports of luxury items and toward
 non-essential foods, income, and property; and a greater
 commitment to family planning and to the development of
 a rural health delivery system designed to provide basic
 preventive medical services to isolated rural areas.
 However, implementation remains hampered by weak adminis-
 trative structures and by such historical constraints as:
 a highly fragmented land tenure system conducive to sub-
 sistence agriculture; extremely high population density
 on limited arable land; a rigid class structure; a psycho-
 logical schism between the urban and rural sectors; a
 high level of illiteracy (about 80%); the difficulty of
 devising a rural education system adaptable to the needs
 of the Creole-speaking majority; and the absence of any
 significant mineral wealth to fund development programs.
 Progress toward effective improvement the condition of
 the rural majority remains painfully slow. The differ-
 ential between the living standards of rural Haitians and
 those in the urban Port-au-Prince area has widened in the
 last five years as real incomes in the capital have
 increased.
 The country is very poor and the Government's resources
 very limited. Government employees have received only one
 salary raise in the last 19 years (in October 1977). For
 these reasons and others, corruption has been endemic,
 but the Government is beginning to address itself to the
 problem of eradicating corruption; for example, in June
 1977 President Duvalier dismissed over 40 officials in
 various ministries on charges of corruption. As a con-
 sequence of these efforts resources are gradually reaching
 the people who most need help.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 Roman Catholicism is the established religion in Haiti,
 but freedom to worship is not restricted in any way.
 Freedom of expression has been growing but there are
 still government restrictions on freedom of the press.
 
 
 In the past two years the Haitian news media have been
 increasingly outspoken in demanding better performance
 from government agencies. In late 1977, however, this
 trend was interrupted after members of the paramilitary
 militia assaulted and beat up the publisher of an
 independent weekly which had accused the militia of
 abuses. This paper has since suspended publication,
 and another small weekly was refused permission to
 publish.
 Haitians are free to join non-political associations.
 Opposition political parties and political organizations
 are forbidden.
 The few labor unions which exist in Haiti have been per-
 mitted little freedom of maneuver. Several strikes in late
 1977, however, may presage greater labor activity. In most
 cases, the workers won the demands for which they were
 striking. Labor disputes are expected to be settled
 through the arbitration procedures of the Ministry of
 Social Affairs.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement in Haiti is not restricted except for
 security reasons near border areas. There are no controls
 on foreign travel for most Haitians, although the Govern-
 ment denies exit and re-entry for a small number of
 individuals. In September 1977 this number was further
 reduced and application procedures eased for all travel-
 lers. The Government has recently exiled certain
 individuals it considers serious threats to its security.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the political process is severely
 restricted. Haiti is a one-party authoritarian state,
 and the President has tenure for life. Elections for mem-
 bership in the unicameral Legislative Chamber are held
 every six years under universal suffrage. Since the late
 1950s all members of the Chamber have belonged to the
 Duvalier political movement.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights.
 
 
 176
 In September 1977 the Haitian Government adhered to
 the American Convention on Human Rights, and it has taken
 a more forthcoming attitude toward international human
 rights investigations. For example, the Government has
 publicly indicated that it intends to invite the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission to visit the
 country and that it would respond to an inquiry from the
 Commission regarding a political prisoner believed to
 have died in prison. The Government has also established
 legal procedures to account for prisoners who have died.
