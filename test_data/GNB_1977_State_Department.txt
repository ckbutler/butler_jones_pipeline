 GUINEA-BISSAU
 Guinea-Bissau is a single party state whose constitution
 guarantees fundamental rights in acotdance with the
 principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
 The Guinea-Bissau government appears-to be committed to
 upholding the human rights guarantees butlined in the
 constitution, and it does not sanction-violations. The
 origin of hte Guinea-bissau government--a clandestine
 state operating as an army of liberation whose principal
 goal was expulsion of the Portuguese--is still reflected
 in occasional overzealous actions by the state security
 apparatus. Guinea-Bissau declared its independence only
 in 1973, and the government is concerned about the
 security of its borders and about small and disorganized
 groups opposed to the current regime and operating outside
 the country. As these perceived threats to security
 decrease, as they appear to be doing, respect for human
 rights should be further enhanced.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 There are no reports of torture in Guinea-Bissau.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such actions are not countenanced in Guinea-Bissau.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The constitution guarantees the right not to be detained,
 arrested or condemned other than according to the law
 in force. However, the constitution also contains a -
 provision which can be used to deny rights and liberties
 to those who "encourage colonialism, imperialism, racism,
 or tribalism." The current regime in Guinea-Bissau
 fought a 13-year war with Portugal to gain independence,
 and a number of those detained in the period following
 independence were in the employ of the colonial regime.
 In recent months the Guinea-Bissau government has granted
 amnesty to a number of political prisoners and reduced
 
 
 the sentence of others. While the number of persons
 serving sentences for political offenses is not
 known, it is thought to be small.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of defense is recognized and guaranteed to
 the defendant and the accused by the constitution.
 In the early days after independence a number of indi-
 viduals arrested for political offenses did not receive
 public trials. In recent years, however, there have
 been no reported instances where defendants have been
 denied fair public trials.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The constitution guarantees the inviolability of domicile
 and this guarantee is reportedly respected in practice.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Guinea-Bissau government has instituted development
 plans to decentralize at the regional level a number
 of economic programs. This decentralization of a
 planned economy is designed to be more responsive to
 local conditions, to promote rural development, and
 fulfill basic human needs. As the Guinea-Bissau govern-
 ment began as a liberation movement based in the rural
 areas, the aspirations of the rural poor and the improve-
 ment of their living standards have always been prime
 concerns of the regime. Agricultural development is the
 top priority of the government. The results of the new
 decentralization approach have been limited so far, but
 positive. Local participation in the planning process
 is genuine and working.
 3.   Respect for Civl and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of expression, thought,
 assembly, demonstration, and religion. The freedoms of
 
 
 52
 thought, speech and assembly are generally respected.
 However, where they involve criticism and opposition
 to the current government and party, they are limited.
 Guinea-Bissau's media is controlled by the government.
 A mass trade union organization is being created, and
 about one-half of the nation's 4,000 salaried workers
 are members. Freedom of religion is respected.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Foreign travel is limited, except to neighboring
 countries, because of difficulties in obtaining hard
 currency. Exit visas for foreign residents are re-
 quired and are sometimes difficult to obtain. We
 know of no bars to emigration.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Guinea-Bissau is a single-party state and opposition
 parties are not permitted. However, one need not be
 a member of the ruling party, the African Party for
 the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde
 (PAIGC), in order to hold elected or appointed office.
 Any citizen over 15 years of age is allowed to Uote.
 In December 1976, local referendums on single slates
 proposed by the PAIGC were held to elect representatives
 who would choose the deputies for the National Assembly.
 In districts where the slates were rejected by the
 voters, new slates were proposed and approved.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no requests for outside investigations;
 Guinea-Bissau's response to such requests in the future
 would likely depend on the nature of the allegations
 and the reputation of the organization requesting the
 investigation.
