 BRAZIL
 Brazil is a constitutional federal republic composed of 26 states and the federal
 district. In 1994 voters elected a new President, two-thirds of the Senate, 513 fed-
 eral deputies, 27 governors, and members of state legislatures. It was the second
 time since the end of military rule in 1985 that Brazilians freely chose their Presi-
 dent and elected the legislative bodies in accordance with the 1988 Constitution.
 Fernando Henrique Cardoso became President on January 1 and will serve a 4-year
 term, reduced from 5 years by a 1994 constitutional amendment.
 Police forces in Brazil fall primarily under the control of the states. State police
 are divided into two forces: the civil police, who have an investigative role, and the
 uniformed, "military" police, who are responsible for maintaining public order. Ac-
 cording to the Constitution, the states' military police serve as army reserves; they
 maintain some residual military privileges, including separate judicial systems. The
 federal police force is very small and plays little role in maintaining internal secu-
 rity. The state police are charged with serious human rights abuses.
 Brazil has a market-based economy, although governments traditionally played a
 dominant role in shaping economic development. The Government is encouraging
 greater private sector participation in the economy through privatization of state en-
 terprises, deregulation, and removal of impediments to competition. Industrial pro-
 duction, including mining operations, and a large and diversified capital goods sec-
 tor, accounts for approximately 35 percent of gross domestic product (GDP); agri-
 culture contributes a ut 12 percent. Brazil exports both manufactured and primary
 goods. Among the principal exports are coffee, soybeans, textiles, leather, metallur-
 gical products, and transportation equipment. GDP was $565 billion in 1994, and
 the economy grew at a rate of 5.7 percent. Large disparities in income distribution
 continue to exist, with the poorest fifth of the population earning only 2 percent of
 national income, while the richest tenth receive 51 percent.
 The most serious human rights abuses continuea to be extrajudicial killings and
 torture. Justice is slow and often-unreliable, especially in rural areas where power-
 ful landowners use violence to settle land disputes and influence the local judiciary.
 In urban areas, the police are frequently implicated in killings and abuse of pris-
 oners, but the special military police courts are overloaded, rarely investigate effec-
 tively or bring fellow officers to trial, and rarely convict abusers. The separate sys-
 tem of state military police courts contributes to a climate of impunity for police ele-
 ments involved in extrajudicial killings or abuse of prisoners and is thought to be
 the single largest obstacle to eliminating such abuses by police. The poor bear the
 brunt of most violence, whether committed by the police orby criminals. Prisons are
 severely overcrowded. Violence against women and discrimination against women
 and minorities are problems. Despite constitutional guarantees, indigenous people
 continue to be victimized by outsiders who encroach on Indian lands and to be ne-
 glected by governmental authorities. Laws against forced labor are not adequately
 enforced, and children are exploited in the sugar and charcoal industries. A free
 press and active human rights organizations expose abuses and demand action to
 stop them.
 Bral was one of two nations which assumed lead responsibility for coordinating
 the implementation of the human rights plank of the Declaration of Principles pro-
 clamea at the December 1994 Summit of the Americas. The Government took steps
 to address its human rights abuses. President Cardso called for an end to impunity
 and harsh punishments for violators. He criticized Congress for its failure to pass
 legislation defining torture, despite the constitutional requirement to do so, and for
 not strengthening the Council for the Defense of Human Rights located in the Min-
 istry of Justice.
 The Government released its own report on human rights problems, appointed a
 ministerial-level task force on forced labor, and created roving inspection teams to
 clamp down on those using forced labor. The Foreign Ministry created its own
 human rights department, while the federal police formed a special division to in-
 
 
 vestigate human rights abuses and added a human rights component to the training
 curriculum for new agents. The Chamber of Deputies created a standing human
 rights committee. Both houses of Congress passed legislation to indemnify the fami-
 lies of political activists who disappeared during the military regime, and the Presi-
 dent signed this law on December 4. However, the increased commitment by politi-
 cians at the national level has yet to have a significant impact in states where
 human rights violations are most common.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Extrajudicial killings continued to
 be a serious problem throughout the country. There are no reliable statistics on the
 number of people murdered by police, vigilante groups, or hired gunmen since city
 morgue statistics frequently fail to distinguish between murder and accident vic-
 tims. However, a loaI human rights group in the northeastern state of Pernambuco
 attributed 10 percent of that state's homicides to the police. The group speculates
 that the actual number may be higher since no suspects have been found in one-
 third of these cases. According to a recent study in Rio de Janeiro by the Advanced
 Institute for Studies of Religion USER), police investigations in 90 percent of 3,236
 probable homicide cases produced insufficient evidence for any trials.
 Civilian deaths at the hands of the Sao Paulo police have risen steadily during
 the past 2 years from an average 34.1 per month in 1993 to 43.5 in 1994 and 56
 per month in the first half of 1995. These figures do not include civilians who are
 wounded and die later in a hospital. At the same time the Sao Paulo police have
 lowered their ratio of persons killed to wounded from police action, from 3 to 1 prior
 to 1995 to approximately 0.8 to 1 during the first 8 months of 1995.
 The trial of the 121 military police accused of the 1992 Carandiru Prison mas-
 sacre remained mired in the special police courts. Only 65 of the 96 victims and wit-
 nesses for the prosecution have testified. Since every defendant has the right to call
 six witnesses, the trial could last into the next century. In another high profile case
 in Sao Paulo-the "42nd delegacia--military and civil police were accused of the
 1989 murder of 18 prisoners asphyxiated when police crammed 51 prisoners into a
 tiny, unventilated cell as punishment. Although the civil police defendants have
 been tried and sentenced in civil court, the 6-year-old case against military police-
 men continues to languish in the police tribunal. (Police courts are special courts
 with jurisdiction over the state police; see Section I.e.).
 In the first 11 months of 1995, there were 49 instances of "mass murder" in Sao
 Paulo, with a total of 158 victims. In 17 of the mass murder cases, police have been
 unable to find any suspects and have no leads. Human rights activists and public
 prosecutors believe that military police are responsible for many of these unresolved
 cases, which often result from police involvement in drug deals gone awry or from
 retaliation for witnesses' cooperation with prosecutors or investigators. A Sao Paulo
 state assembly investigative committee uncovered numerous instances of police in-
 volvement in drug trafficking and robbery.
 One of the poorest municipalities in Sao Paulo state, Franco da Rocha, has been
 used as a clandestine dumping site for the victims of death squads. Since 1993 at
 least 212 bodies have been encountered there, 50 killed with a bullet to the head
 and thought to be victims of extermination squads. The arms and heads of some
 of the bodies had been removed in an apparent attempt to conceal the victims' iden-
 tities. Only half the victims have been identified, but 80 percent of them are linked
 to petty crime. The principal suspects for the murders are military policemen; all
 the bodies were found in, and all identified victims lived in, the area served by the
 26th military police battalion. According to civil police investigators, there is cir-
 cumstantial evidence linking police to eight killings, but insufficient evidence for
 prosecution.
 In Rio de Janeiro, execution-style killing of street children continued, according
 to reliable reports from organizations aiding the youths. Three policemen, indicte
 for the July 1993 killings of eight street children in downtown Candelari Square,
 were still in jail awaiting trial by regular courts at the end of the year. Their case
 was kept out of special poi  ourts because they were not on duty at the time they
 allegedly killed the      and apparently did not use police equipment in the
 crime. Wagner dos Santos, a key witness in the Candelaria case, was shot twice in
 the head in December 1994 by two men he said he recognized as civil policemen.
 Dos Santos recovered and is under the protection of a local nongovernmental organi-
 zation (NGO) at an unidentified location.
 The regular court system tried the cases of police gang members accused of mur-
 dering 21 Vigario Geral residents in 1993. A plethora of both new accusations and
 
 
 342
 accused individuals (at last count 35 people may stand trial) complicated the case
 and effectively guaranteed postponement of a trial date. In May seven individuals
 in Rio de Janeiro were arrested at the request of the state Attorney General on sus-
 picion of being members of a death squad. Three of the suspects were military po-
 licemen three were firemen, and one was a civil policeman. The group was accused
 of 10 killings, 9 of them in 1995. Five of the victims were themselves police officers,
 including a military police major responsible for investigating corruption and death
 squad activities within the military police.
 On March 17, a group of 15 hooded individuals entered the citygjail in the border
 city of Uruguaiana in Rio Grande do Sul. They removed Everaldo Silva Santos from
 his cell and executed him in front of the jail by a dozen gunshots. Santos had been
 jailed the day before for the fatal stabbing of a military police officer. The same
 group is suspected of killing Francisco Goncalves Filho 2 days earlier in the mis-
 taken belief that he was Silva Santos. Twelve members of the Uruguaiana police
 were arrested for suspected involvement in the two murders and are awaiting trial.
 Sao Paulo's new State Secretary for Public Security took steps to curb abuses by
 the military police. In May he reassigned to administrative billets the 200 military
 policemen with the most civilian deaths on their records in what many human
 rights observers welcomed as an attempt to get "killers" off the streets. Sao Paulo's
 first civilian Ombudsman took office on November 20; he will have the power to con-
 duct spe cial investigations of poie, order disciplinary action, and forward specific
 cases of police abuse to the Attorney general for prosecution.
 Rio de Janeir State Secrectary for Security Nilton Cerqueira threatened in a
 pubic statement on August 2 to get rid of the civil polie if the force did not regain
 the pubic's confidence by year's end. (erqueira reported that he had begun 261 in-
 vestigations of policemen allegedly involved in irregularities, but indicated that
 more would be required. According to a report produced by the civil police's own In-
 spector General, at least 20 percent of policemen hired in the last 3 years have
 criminal records, involving crimes ranging from car theft to murder.
 Throughout Brazil, local human rights organizations point to excessive use of
 force by police. In March Rio de Janeiro military policemen apprehended Cristiano
 Moura Mesquita in front of the popular Rio Sul Shopping Center as he fled after
 robbing a pharmacy. As a crowd of people watched, Mesquita was dragged behind
 a police van and summarily executed with three gunshots. The incident was photo-
 graphed by a television crew which happened to be in the area and was featured
 on news broadcasts around the world. A military police court convicted a military
 police corporal of the murder of Mesquita on September 15 and sentenced him to
 20 years. Poulls taken immediately after the incident showed that a majority of Rio
 de Janeiro residents approved of the summary execution, a reflection of the frustra-
 tion felt by the city's residents with the rising levels of violence and the inefficiency
 of the judicial system.
 A high crime rate, a failure to apprehend most criminals, and an inept criminal
 justice system all contribute to public acquiescence in police brutality and killings
 of criminal suspects. Acts of intimidation often hindered investigation into these in-
 cidents, including death threats against witnesses, prosecutors, judges, and human
 rights monitors. Military police Prosecutor Stella Kuhlmann, who is prosecuting the
 Carandiru case, and two of her colleagues, continued to receive telephone death
 threats. Although Kuhlmann has shared tapes of the threats with the State Sec-
 retary for Public Security, police claim to be unable to identify the perpetrators de-
 spite more than 2 years of investigation. Similarly, Sao Paulo civil police delegates
 Luis Helmeister, Edelcio Vieira, and Henriqueta Caruso received death threats
 warning them to stop investigating a group of military policemen for involvement
 in murders and extortions. Cristma Leonardo, who head   an NGO serving street
 children and who has been sheltering Wagner dos Santos, the witness in the
 Candelaria case, has received a number of death threats. Investigators in the
 Vigaro-Geral case uncovered a plot to murder the presiding judge, Maria Lucia
 Capiberibe.
 In rural areas in the north and northeast, landowners often intimidated judges,
 lawyers, and police with violence and threats of violence. New conflicts between
 rural landowners and the landless intensified in 1995, in part because of the slow
 progress of the Federal Government toward reaching its goal of granting land ten-
 ure certifications to hundreds of thousands of and ess families. In an attempt to
 p rod the Government to step up its agricultural resettlement program, 12,820 fami-
 lies illegally occupied 40 plots of land identified as unproductive, raising tensions
 and increasing confrontations with landowners, their gunmen, and, in many cases,
 policemen.
 The August 9 massacre of 10 landless workers by military police in the western
 state of Rondonia illustrates the tensions created by the land i vasions and the ex-
 
 
 343
 cessive violence often used by policemen in dealing with the squatters. Acting on
 a judicial order, 187 military policemen went on August 9 to the Santa Elina Farm
 in the town of Corumbiara to evict the 500 families who had been squatting there
 since July 14. In the ensuing firefight, 9 squatters, including a 7-year-old girl, and
 2 policemen were killed, and 130 squatters were injured. Nine squatters are still
 unaccounted for. _Acording to the medical examiner's report, most of the squatters
 killed had been shot in the back at short range, and many of the bullets had trav-
 eled from the to p of the body downward, indicating that the victims had been killed
 from behind while kneeling. Fifteen days after the massacre, the body of one of the
 squatters, Sergio Rodrigues Comes, was found floating in a nearby river with a frac-
 tured skull, The day of the massacre, a city councilman and the mayor of
 Corumbiara had seen Gomes handcuffed in the custody of several military police-
 men. When Gomes had tried to speak to the city councilman, a policeman kicked
 him in the back, ut him in a vehicle, and drove off with him.
 After visiting the site as head of a special congressional committee to investigate
 the massacre, Nilmario Miranda, President of the Chamber of Deputies Human
 Rights Committee, cited the clear evidence of excessive police violence. His report
 blamed the Federal Government, first and foremost, for not having an adequate
 agrarian reform policy. He also singled out the judge who ordered the eviction de-
 spite a high level of tension in the area and the state of Rondonia for not exercising
 better control over its military police. Several days after the massacre, Rondonia
 Governor Valdir Raupp removed from command positions the commandant of the
 state's military olice and the battalion commander of the unit which carried out
 the operation. However, although Raupp acknowledged excessive violence by the po-
 lice, he insisted that the squatters were to blame because they had fired first. Inves-
 tigations of the massacre by the military and civil police are progressing slowly; in
 the interim all of the policemen involved remain on active duty.
 Manoel Ribeiro, a city councilman in Corumbiara who supported the landless
 workers' occupation of land, was fatally shot outside his home on December 16.
 Ribeiro had been gathering information on alleged malfeasance by the mayor just
 before he was killed.
 On August 31, the Para state court upheld the December 1994 conviction of a
 gunman, and the ranch foreman who hired him, for killing union leader Expedite
 deSouza in 1991. The gunman was sentenced to 25 years in prison and the ranch
 foreman to 21 years. However, the ranch owner-also accused of the crime-remains
 at large (see Section I.e.), and the Catholic Church's Pastoral Land Commission
 (CPT) -as received reports that he circulates freely and openly in southern Para.
 The case of the 1985 murder of Joao Canuto, the first president of the Rural Work-
 ers Union in Rio Maria, Para, has been in the state prosecutoi's office awaiting a
 trial date since August 1993, 8 years after the beginning of the investigation. No
 one has been charged in the case.
 The CPT reported that land disputes resulted in the murders of 47 persons in
 1994, and 26 such murders and 23 disappearances in the first 8 months of 1995,
 including the victims of the Rondonia massacre. A typical example of the conflicts
 which occur in rural areas is the case of Oseas Jose de Oliveira and Jose Candido
 Oliveira, who were shot to death in Riacho de Santana, Bahia, an area where the
 ownership of land has been in dispute for more than 50 years. A farmer reportedly
 was angered by the Oliveiras' athering of wood from an area he claimed was his
 and by their refusal to leave. Two employees of the farmer have been charged with
 the murder.
 Human rights groups cite the high level of crime and the failings of the judicial
 system as contributing factors to public telerance of vigilante lynchings of suspected
 criminals. The most recent year for which reliable comprehensive statistics on
 lynchings are available is 1993. According to the University of Sao .Paulo-affiliated
 Nucleus for the Studies of Violence, 14 people were lynched in all regions of Brazil
 in 1993, down from 40 in 1991 and 18 in 1992. No suspects were arrested in any
 of the 1993 lynchings.
 The case of a military policeman convicted in Sao Paulo, in both military and ci-
 vilian courts, of killing transvestites provides a basis for comparing decisions of the
 two judicial systems. In military police court the soldier was convicted in March
 1994 of killing one transvestite and sentenced to 12 years in prison. In October
 1994, the military appeals court reduced the sentence to 6 years, noting that being
 a transvestite was a "high risk" activity. Although he had vowed to do so, the pros-
 ecutor never appealed the decision. In March a civilian court convicted the same sol-
 dier for killing three other transvestites and sentenced him to 44 years in prison.
 In August indictments were brought against a military police sergeant and two sol-
 diers for the grisly August 1993 murder of Renildo Jose dos Santos, a city council-
 man in Coqueiro Seco, Alagoas. Although an open homosexual, Dos Santos' murder
 
 
 was more likely a result of his outspoken criticisms of the mayor, whom he had ac-
 cused of corruption. The mayor's son was also indicted in the case.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated abductions.
 However, human rights groups often blamed the police or vigilante groups for the
 disappearance of street children or persons believed to be criminals.
 Sergeant Idalessio Costa Rodrigues of the 19th military police battalion in
 Preidente Prudente, Sao Paulo, was accused of the disappearance of Mauricio
 Borges Ribeiro dos Santos, after he arrested him in April. During the subsequent
 investigation, police discovered that Rodrigues had a notebook with the names of
 505 people whom he considered to be crimninals along with photographs, birthdates,
 addresses, parents' names, and the alleged crimes. Rodrigues had written "dead"
 next to 16 of the names, along with a date and a red cross. Police are investigating
 the circumstances of the deaths of these 16 persons.
 In March 1994, Roslvo Jose da Silva disappeared from the northeastern state of
 Alagoas. Da Silva had alleged he would sue the landowner who wanted to expel him
 and-his family from land in Colonia de Leopoldina, where they had lived for 10
 years. Da Silva's wife, who has been very public in her demands or an investigation
 of her husband's disappearance, received death threats from the landowner as well
 as from a soldier who was the last person seen talking with her husband.
 After a woman claimed to have seen him badly beaten and lying on the floor of
 the civil police antikidnaping division, authorities reopened the August 1993 dis-
 appearance case of Jorge Antonio Carelli, an employee of the Oswaldo Cruz Founda-
 tion. The woman, who is currently serving a prison sentence on kidnaping charges
 told authorities that Carelli managed to tell her his name and say that he worked
 for the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation efore civil policemen took her to another room.
 The civil police Inspector General's office considered the woman's testimony suffi-
 ciently credible to reopen the investigation of the 22 policemen who were formerly
 exonerated of all charges in this case.
 In Rio de Janeiro there was an alarming rise in kidnaping most of which ap-
 peared to be economically motivated. In the first 7 months of the year, there were
 62 kidnapings, in contrast to 82 cases in all of 1994. Policemen, including members
 of the civil police antikidnaping division, have been implicated in several of the
 cases. Two cases in particular reflect both police complicity and incompetence. In
 the first, 13-year-old Juliana Lutterbach was kidnaped on April 18 as she left her
 home in the Santa Teresa district. In the process of negotiating with her family, the
 kidnapers made more than 20 telephone calls, including one that was tracedto a
 public telephone booth near the offices of the civil police antikidnaping division. The
 civil police initially claimed that there was no way they could identify the telephone
 booth in question. After the family provided police with a map of telephone booths
 obtained from the telephone company, the police took action-identifying the tele-
 phone booth and arresting one of the kidnapers-a miitary policeman-as he was
 calling the girr's family.
 In the second case, 13-year-old Pala Zamboni was kidnaped on April 24 in the
 Minas Gerai town of Alem Paraiba, on the boundary with Rio de Janeiro state.
 After monitoring telephone calls made to the girl's family, Minas Gerais police de-
 tormined that she was being held in a Rio de Janeiro suburb. A squad of Minas
 Gerais policemen crossed state lines to raid the house where Zamboni was being
 held, freeing Zamboni and arresting three of her captors: two active duty Rio de Ja-
 neiro military policemen and one former military policeman. These two high-profile
 cases prompted public outrage, and led Rio de Janeiro Governor Marcello Alencar
 to declare a crackdown on the state police, vowing publicly to abolish the anti-
 kidnaping division if it did not improve its performance.
 In a move praised by many human rights advocates, President Cardoso submitted
 to Congress on August 29 a bill recognizing, and assuming government responsibil-
 ity for the deaths of 136 political activists who disappeared during the military re-
 gime. both houses of Congress passed legislation signed by the President on Decem-
 her 4 which obligates the Government to pay indemnities of between $110,000 to
 $160,000 (100-150,000 reais) to each of the families. President Cardoso stated that
 it was the State's responsibility to recognize and make restitution for excesses com-
 mitted during the military regime. He dismissed, however, any possibility of the
 Government investigating the circumstances of those who disappeared, saying that
 would violate the August 28, 1979, Amnesty Law.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and contains severe legal penalties for torture or
 acquiescence in it, but the Penal Code fails to define torture. In June 19194, a di-
 vided Supreme Court ruled on a torture case; five justices voted to absolve a police-
 man, based on the argument that Congress had failed to incorporate torture into
 the Penal Code, but six justices prevailed, convicting the defendant based on the
 
 
 345
 statutes defining norms of juvenile justice, which do specify penalties for torture.
 The victim was a minor when he was beaten into confessing to a crime in 1991.
 There are frequent credible reports that police beat and torture criminal suspects
 to extract information, confessions, or money. The Government estimated in its 1994
 Report on the Internal Human Rights Situation that fewer than 10 percent of cases
 of mistreatment by police are reported. Victims are generally poor, uneducated
 about their rights, and-most of all-afraid to come forward for fear of reprisals.
 In late 1994, the Government sent in the armed forces to control crime in Rio de
 Janeiro, placing civil and military police forces under the command of a general.
 "Operation Rio,  the joint mii _taxy-poie operation to seize arms and illegal drugs
 in Rio's slums was popular with the city's residents, although there were credible
 reports that slum occupants were harassed and beaten. Slum resident Francisco
 Jose Reis de Oliveira complained of having been beaten, suffocated, and subjected
 to electric shocks. An examination performed by the police medical service found
 marks on Oiveira's body but no conclusive proof of torture. A Catholic priest, Olinto
 Pergoraro, complained that his chapel in Borel, where the army established an oper-
 ational base, was used as a place to torture residents, but the army vigorously de-
 nied any involvement in torture.
 The reopening of the investigation into the disappearance of Jorge Antonio Carelli
 (see Section 1.b.) led the chief of the civil police in Rio de Janeiro, Helio Luz, to
 lament publicly that torture has long been a common practice of the Brazilian po-
 lice, declaring that society had accepted torture as a just punishment for common
 criminals and a legitimate means of obtaining information. Luz added, however,
 that he thought that society was gradually coming to reject torture as a legitimate
 police practice.
 Reflecting sensitivity to the country's image abroad on the torture issue, President
 Cardoso ordered that the Brazilian military attache in London, whom human rights
 groups accused of having tortured political prisoners during the military regime, be
 removed from his post.
 According to the Government's 1995 penitentiary census, Brazil's overcrowded
 prisons he d 129,169 inmates in space designed for 59,954. There are often six to
 eight prisoners in a cell meant for three; some prisoners force others to pay for the
 use of a bed. The Ministry of Justice reported that 33 prison rebellions occurred in
 1994, while attempted or successful escapes averaged almost 9 per day. Due to the
 severe overcrowding in prisons, police precincts are often used as prisons, where
 sentenced prisoners share cells with detainees. Sao Paulo's prison system in particu-
 lar suffers from chronic overcrowding, corrupt and abusive local prison manage-
 ment, and prisoner access to weapons and drugs. The state's 43 penitentiaries-the
 majority of them dilapidated and dirty-house 34,000 prisoners in facilities designed
 to hold less than 24,000. In the first 7 months of 1995, there were 19 revolts in Sao
 Paulo state penitentiaries. All but one were resolved peacefully; however, in one in-
 cident, when it appeared that 22 hostages taken by the prisoners were in danger,
 the State Secretary for Justice and Penitentiary Administration ordered military po-
 lice to storm the prison. In contrast to the 111 prisoners killed at Carandiru, only
 3 prisoners died in this incident. Human rights activists praised State Secretary of
 Justice dos Santos for leading the military police invasion and videotaping the en-
 tire procedure to promote the transparency of police actions.
 Prisoners at Recife's maximum security prison staged a hunger strike in June to
 protest conditions in the prison, which holds 906 prisoners in space designed for
 534.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution limits arrests to those
 caught in the act of committing a crime or those arrested by order of a judicial au-
 thority. The authorities usually respect the constitutional provision for a judicial de-
 termination of the legality of detention, although some convicted inmates are held
 beyond their sentences due to poor record keeping. The law permits provisional de-
 tention for up to 5 days under specified conditions during a police investigation, but
 a judge may extend this period. However, the police sometimes detain street youths
 illegally without a judicial order or hold them incommunicado.
 The Constitution prohibits forced exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is an independent branch of govern-
 ment, but in many instances it is unable to ensure the right to fair trial. The judi-
 cial system, with the Federal Supreme Court at its apex, includes courts of first in-
 stance and appeals courts. States organize their own judicial systems but must ad-
 here to the basic principles in the Federal Constitution. Brazil also has a system
 of specialized courts dealing with police, labor, elections, juveniles, and family mat-
 ters.
 Special police courts have jurisdiction over the state military police; the record of
 these courts shows that punishment is the exception rather than the rule. A human
 
 
 rights group in the northeast, studying plice crimes against civilians tried in police
 courts from 1970 to 1991, found that only 8 percent of the cases resulted in convic-
 tions. In Sao Paulo, another study found that only 5 percent resulted in convictions.
 The courts (which are separate from the courts-martial of the armed forces, except
 for the final appeals court) are composed of four ranking military police officials and
 one civilian judge. With too few judges for the caseload there are backlogs, and
 human rights groups note a lack of zeal among police charged with investigating
 fellow officers. An attempt in Congress to pass a law giving ordinary courts jurisdic-
 tion over police crimes against civilians remained stalled.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel and must be made fully aware of the charges
 against them. According to the Ministry of Justice, approximately 85 percent of pris-
 oners cannot afford an attorney. In cases in which a defendant cannot afford an at-
 torney, the court must provide one at public expense; courts are supposed to appoint
 private attorneys to represent poor defendants when public defenders are unavail-
 able, but often no effective defense is provided. Juries try only cases of willful crimes
 against life; judges try all others.
 The right to a fair public trial as provided by law is generally respected in prac-
 tice, although in rural areas the judiciary is less capable and more subject to the
 influence of local landowners, particularly in cases related to indigenous people and
 rural union activists. Similarly, local police are less zealous in investigating, pros-
 ecutors are reluctant to initiate proceedings, and judges find reasons to delay when
 cases involve gunmen contracted by landowners to eliminate squatters or rural
 union activists.
 The need for judicial reform is widely recognized because the current system is
 inefficient, with backlogs of cases and shortages of judges. Lawyers often drag out
 cases as long as possible in the hope that an appeal court might render a favorable
 opinion, and because they are paid according to the amount of time they spend on
 a case. According to the Institute of Economic, Social, and Political Studies of Sao
 Paulo, however, 90 percent of appeals court decisions confirm decisions made in
 lower courts. Low pay, combined with exacting competitive examinations that in
 some years eliminate 90 percent of the applicants, make it difficult to fill vacancies
 on the bench. Due to the backlog of cases, under the Brazilian system where a trial
 must be held within a certain period of time from the date of the crime (similar to
 a statute of limitations), old cases are frequently dismissed. According to a former
 judge, this encourages corrupt judges purposely to delay certain cases, so that they
 can be dismissed.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary intrusion into the home, although
 wiretaps authorized by judicial authority are permitted. There were no reports of
 illegal entry for political reasons, but illegal entry into homes without a warrant oc-
 curs in searches for criminal suspects. Those conducting military searches during
 Operation Rio were accompanied by a policeman with arrest authority, along with
 a search warrant. According to the Brazilian Bar Association, search teams obtained
 generic search warrants, which were used to enter houses at will. The inviolability
 of private correspondence is resp  d.
 Wiretaps are unconstitational except when authorized by a judicial authority for
 purposes of criminal investigation and prosecution, and provided implementing leg-
 islation exists regulating the conditions under which wiretaps may be used. Wire-
 tapping was a common police practice until an incident targeting a presidential aide
 led Justice Minister Jobim to forbid further wiretapping until passage of the con-
 stitutionally required implementing legislation, which was awaiting Congressional
 approval at the end of 1995.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The 1988 Constitution abolished all forms of
 censorship and provides for freedom of speech and a free press. The authorities re-
 spect these rights in practice. Newspapers and magazines, which are privately
 owned, vigorously report and comment on government performance. Both the press
 and broadcast media routinely discuss controversial social and political issues and
 enga ge in investigative reporting.
 Most radio and television stations are privately owned; but the Government has
 licensing authority, and politicians frequently obtain the licenses. Eighteen tele-
 vision and 115 radio stations are owned by current or former congressmen, some
 of whom are or were members of the committee overseeing communications. It is
 difficult to determine how many media are indirectly controlled by politicians since
 concessions are often registered in the names of family members or friends linked
 to them. In addition, concessions are regularly transferred to other names, with lit-
 
 
 tle oversight by the Government. Stating his intention to put an end to the distribu-
 tion of television and radio concessions based on political considerations, President
 Cardoso submitted a proposal to Congress setting out strict requirements, based ex-
 clusively on technical criteria, that must be met by applicants for television and
 radio concessions.
 A report by the Brazilian National Association of Newspapers (ANJ) claimed four
 journalists were murdered. In May a policeman allegedly shot Marcos Borges
 Ribeiro owner of the Rio Verde (Goias state) newspaper, The Independent, in his
 sleep. nknown assailants killed Aristeu Guida da Silva, owner of the Gazeta de
 SaoFidelis newspaper in the state of Rio de Janeiro, after his paperpublished arti-
 cles on city government irregularities. No suspects have been charged in this crime.
 The penalty for libel under the 1967 Press Law-a prison term-is considered ex-
 treme by judges. Press criticism has described it as an archaic and authoritarian
 law inherited from the military regime. The 1994 Inter-American Press Association
 report on freedom of the press inrBrazil said, "there has been increasing recourse
 to the (1967) Press Law, especially by the executive and the judiciary, against jour-
 nalists." According to the ANJ report, two journalists were convicted in July of hbel
 and defamation of character, and sentenced to 4 months and 20 days' imprisonment.
 The two had published a 1993 article in the now-defunct Jornal Brasil Central in-
 volving a legal case.aainst the family ofthe Tocantins state governor. The two are
 appealing the conviction. Lucio Flavi Pinto, an independent journalist in Belem,
 Par state, had to close his weekly newsletter in 1994 to defend himself against law-
 suits brought by the owners of the city's major newspaper for libel and defamation
 under the 1967 Press Law. He is currently appealing his conviction on libel charges.
 Congress has considered, but has not yet eliminated, the Press Law's provisions for
 prison terms.
 There were reports of harassment against journalists. A photographer for the
 daily Jornal do Brasil lodged a complaint against three soldiers for seizing his cam-
 era and beating him while he was photographing an army operation during"Oper-
 ation Rio". Antonio Bonfim and Cesar Gomes Gains, journalists in Aracaju Sergipe,
 have been harassed and have received death threats since writing an article in July
 1994 for the weekly Cinform, charging that a death squad operation in the area was
 composed of military policemen. Seven potential witnesses have been killed since
 the investigation of the death squad began. Bonfim and Gama are accompanied by
 armed bodyguards 24 hours a day.
 Foreign publications are widely distributed in Brazil; prior review of films, plays,
 and radio and television programming is practiced only to determine a suitable
 viewing age.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assemble peacefully, and this right is respected in practice. Permits are
 not required for outdoor political or labor meetings, and such meetings occur fre-
 quently.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. There
 is no favored or state religion. All faiths are free to establish places of worship, train
 clergy, and proselytize, although the Government controls entr into Indian lands.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on movement within Brazil, except for the
 protected Indian areas, nor are there any restrictions on emigration or return.
 Women, however, are not allowed to leave the country with children without the
 permission of the children's father. Brazil has admitted few immigrants recently, is
 selective in granting asylum, and does not formally accept refugees for resettlement.
 However, in 1995 the Government did agree to accept 200 Bosnian refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change their government
 through free elections, and citizens most recently exercised this right in 1994, filling
 executive and legislative offices throughout the country. Voting is secret and manda-
 tory for all literate Brazilian citizens age 18 to 70, except military conscripts who
 may not vote. It is voluntary for minors age 16 to 18, for the illiterate, and for those
 age 70 and over.
 Women have full political rights under the Constitution and are becoming active
 in politics and government. However, they comprise only 6.5 percent of the National
 Congress; 33 women serve in the Chamber of Deputies (out of 513 seats), and 5
 serve in the Senate (out of 81 members). In the 1994 elections, voters elected one
 female governor. To boost the participation of women in government, Congress
 passed legislation requiring that 20 percent of each party's candidates in the 1996
 
 
 municipal elections be women. The 1988 Constitution gave Indians the franchise,
 but their ability to protect their own interests is severely limited (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental organizations actively investigate allegations of human rights
 violations and often initiate legal proceedings. Government officials are generally co-
 operative with them.
 Several international NGO's either maintain offices in Brazil or visit periodically.
 In April the Secretary General of Amnesty International made a well-publicized 2-
 week visit to Brazil where he met with President Cardoso, several state governors,
 and the Deputy Minister of Justice, and addressed the Chamber of Deputies. The
 visit by the executive director of Human Rights Watch also received widespread
 media coverage. Government offices such as the Ministry of Justice's Secretaries for
 Citizenship and Human Rights and the federal prosecutor's office respond readily
 to inquiries about human rights cases and launch their own investigations.
 The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) visited Brazil, at the
 government's invitation, for the first time since Brazil ratified the American Con-
 vention on Human Rights in 1993. Although the IACHR identified a number of
 areas of concern, the team was impressed with the openness of officials in discuss-
 ing Brazil's human rights problems and by their commitment to find solutions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, and nationality is unconstitu-
 tional, yet women, blacks, and indigenous people continued to experience discrimi-
 nation. The International Labor Organization (ILO) notes that important differences
 in wages continue to exist to the detriment of women and blacks, particularly in
 rural areas.
 There continued to be reports of violence against homosexuals, although com-
 prehensive data were not available. In February a group of Rio de Janeiro military
 policemen assaulted a group of transvestites working as prostitutes along the Mem
 de Sa Avenue. Several gay rights groups organized a protest several days later in
 front of the 13th military police battalion. None of the policemen allegedly involved
 in the incident has been charged. In May, Luis Mott, an anthropologist and leader
 of the gay community in Salvador, Bahia, alleged in two newspaper interviews that
 Zumbi, a legendary black freedom fighter of the 17th century, was a homosexual.
 Mott's allegation led to an exchange of insults and threats between gay rights and
 black rights groups, who were outraged by Mott's remarks. Mott hired bodyguards
 after he was threatened, and vandals damaged his house and car with graffiti.
 Women.-There is a high incidence of physical abuse of women, and 125 cities
 have established special police offices to deal with crimes against women. Sao Paulo,
 which has 128 special police stations dedicated to preventing crimes against women
 (up from 120 in 1994), registered an 18.4 percent increase in complaints of violence
 against women during the first 6 months of 1995 over 1994 levels. An estimated
 80 percent of complaints involved abuse by a spouse or former spouse. Police and
 social workers attribute the increase in reported complaints not to a rising level of
 violence against women, but to greater awareness by women of their rights and less
 willingness to tolerate abuse than in the past. In the 7 years they have been in ex-
 istence, Rio's special police units have registered 13,000 complaints of violence
 against women, involving 24,000 victims. The women who made complaints gen-
 erally asked police to reprimand their husbands, rather than take legal action.
 In rural areas, abused women have little recourse since there are no specialized
 police offices available to them. Men who commit crimes against women, including
 sexual assault and murder, are unlikely to be brought to trial. Although the Su-
 preme Court in 1991 struck down the archaic concept of "defense of honor" as a jus-
 tification for wife murder, courts are still reluctant to prosecute and convict men
 who attack their wives.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex in employment or pay and
 provides for 120 days of paid maternity leave. However, the provision against wage
 discrimination is rarely enforced. According to the most recent official statistics,
 women earn, on average, 54 percent of the salaries earned by men. A recent study
 by a Brazilian sociologist showed that women who started working in positions in
 which they earned twice the minimum wage advanced in pay after 10 years to a
 wage of seven times the minimum wage. Men starting in the same positions earned
 2.6 times the minimum wage and advanced to a wage of 10.9 times the minimum
 wage after 10 years.
 
 
 349
 In response to the maternity leave law, some employers seek sterilization certifi-
 cates from female job applicants or try to avoid hiring women of childbearing age.
 Hoping to clamp down on such employers, President Cardoso signed a law in April
 prohibiting employers from requiring applicants or employees to take pregnancy
 tests or present sterilization certificates. mployers who violate the law are subject
 to a jail term ranging from 1 to 2 years, while the company must pay a fine equal
 to 10 times the salary of its highest-paid employee. In July employees of three Rio
 de Janeiro companies filed complaints with the State Council for the Rights of
 Women charging the companies with discrimination. A complaint was filed against
 Generi Electric for allegedly limiting the times female employees were permitted
 to go to the bathroom; against FAET, an electric appliance company, for requiring
 applicants to take a pregnancy test; and against Fabrimar, a produer of bathom
 products, for subjecting female employees to inappropriately intimate searches at
 the end of each working day.
 Children.-Despite progressive laws to protect children and a growing awareness
 of their plight through media and NGO campaigns, the Government still has not
 been able to help miflions of children who fail to get an education, who must work
 to survive, and who suffer from the poverty afflicting their families. A 1994 report
 issued by the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics indicated that as
 many as 2 million children between 10 and 13 years of age work, many of them
 together with their parents, under conditions approximating forced labor or debt
 bondage (see Section 6.d.). Many other children beg on the streets of cities.
 There are no reliable figures on the number of street children, some of whom are
 homeless, but the majority of whom return home at night. In Rio de Janeiro, an
 organization aiding street children estimated that 30,000 frequent the streets by
 day, but probablyless than 1,000 sleep there. NGO's have made enough shelters
 available for homeless children, but some prefer the freedom and drugs that street
 life offers. In Sao Paulo, government and NGO officials estimate that between 4,500
 and 20,000 children spend their days in the streets of greater Sao Paulo, but return
 home at night. Approximately 900 to 1,800 lack access to shelter and sleep in the
 street.
 Because street children have a high rate of drug use and have been involved in
 assaults and robberies, a significant portion of the public supports harsh police
 measures against them, viewing the issue as one of crime and security, not human
 rights. Of the 562 reported homicides in the northeastern state of Pernambuco in
 the first 8 months of 1995, 10 percent of the victims were under 18 years of age.
 A local human rights group suspects that many of these minors are killed by off-
 duty policemen and private security guards hired by area businessmen to rid their
 areas of street children. Federal, state, and local governments devote insufficient re-
 sources to street children. NGO's sponsor relief efforts, but demand far outstrips
 available resources.
 The report of a congressional investigating committee on child prostitution, pub-
 lished in 1994, called for more targeted social programs, changes in the Penal Code,
 and enforcement of existing laws to protect children, noting police complicity in
 child prostitution in most states. The committee concluded that there was no evi-
 dence to back the claim that an estimated 500,000 minors are involved in prostitu-
 tion in Brazil, but they found cases in all 10 states visited. In Rio de Janeiro, a
 study cited by the committee found 500 girls between the ages of 8 and 15 involved
 in prostitution, all of them glue sniffers or drug users, and most first raped before
 age 10. In October the Ministry of Justice launched a national 3-month media cam-
 paign to educate the population about the significant problem of child prostitution
 and to encourage people to report individuals they observed engaging in, or solicit-
 ing, child prostitution. The media campaign targeted Brazil's principal tourist cities,
 where child prostitution is most prevalent.
 People With Disabilities.-The 1988 Constitution contains several provisions for
 the disabled, stipulating a minimum wage, educational opportunities, and access to
 public buildings and public transportation. Groups that work with the disabled,
 however, report that state governments completely failed to meet the legally man-
 dated targets for educational opportunities and work placement. In January Sao
 Paulo Governor Mario Covas vetoed a bill that would have implemented a special
 education program for the state's disabled population, citing insufficient funds.
 There was little progress in the elimination of architectural barriers to the dis-
 abled. However, the city government in Recife (the country's sixth largest city) made
 some efforts to eliminate architectural barriers by cutting access ramps into some
 street curbs. In addition, several local transportation companies began to install ac-
 cess lifts on public buses. A Rio de Janeiro court ordered each of the city's 34 trans-
 portation companies to equip at least one bus serving each route with an access lift.
 
 
 By the end of August, 14 buses had been equipped with such lifts, and the number
 was expected to rise to 200.
 Indigenous People.-Brazil's approximately 320,000 Indians, who speak 170 dif-
 ferentlanguages, have a constitutional right to their traditional lands. In practice,
 however, the authorities allow most indigenous people only limited participation in
 decisions affecting their lands cultures traditions, and the allocation of natural re-
 sources. The 1988 Constitution charged the Federal Government with demarcating
 519 indigenous areas within 5 years, but the authorities have yet to complete more
 than half the demarcations and entitling decrees. The Government announced its
 intention to change the way Indian lands are demarcated, to allow for the right of
 non-Indian current occupants to dispute proposed demarcations, despite the fact
 that the Constitution allows the Federal Government to expropriate land with just
 compensation. Indian rights groups and the federal prosecutor's office were con-
 cerned that such a change in the demarcation process would reopen land claims in
 previously demarcated Indian reserves, and encourage land invasions by non-Indi-
 ans hoping to stake new claims, resulting in increased violence.
 The Constitution provides Indians with the exclusive use of the soil, waters, and
 minerals found in their lands, subject to congressional authorization. The regula-
 tions necessary for economic exploitation are still pending before the Congress as
 part of the bill known as the Statute of Indigenous Societies. Illegal mining, logging,
 and ranching are a constant problem on Indian lands, as an estimated 84 percent
 of these lands have been occupied by non-Indians. Approximately 200 gold miners
 remained in the Yanomami Reserve at the end of 1995, in the state of Roraima,
 causing another surge in the number of Indians dying from malaria. At least 22
 Yanomami died from malaria, and 78 from other diseases, in part due to the Fed-
 eral Government's failure to provide adequate medical care for indigenous people.
 The 1993 case against the Brazilian gold miners who killed 16 Yanomami on the
 Venezuelan side of-the border remains mired in legal problems. None of the accused
 miners is in custody. Yanomami witnesses failed to recognize two of the accused,
 and other witnesses have disappeared. Indigenous rights groups expressed concern
 that the process was completely paralyzed and that those responsible for the mas-
 sacre may never be brought to justice.
 The order to demarcate the Raposa-Serra do Sol area in Roraima remained stalled
 in the Justice Minister's office for the second year in a row, as tensions in the area
 increased. In January a group of Macuxi and Wapixana Indians built huts and
 cleared fields in an area Where the state government intended to build a hydro-
 electric dam, a project that would have flooded 3,700 hectares of indigenous terri-
 tory. The state government sent in 70 military policemen, who destroyed the huts
 and beat a number of the Indians. In retaliation, the Indians set fire to %ridges and
 telephone towers in three nearby villages. The Minister of Justice used the army
 to maintain order, but soldiers were soon accused of harassing Indians in the area
 and taking the side of non-Indian occupants. In March a federal judge in Roraima
 ordered the state electric company to halt plans to build the hydroelectric dam, rul-
 ing that the electric company had to obtain congressional permission to build the
 dam since the area had been identified as traditional Indian land. In May a federal
 judge ordered the army to withdraw from the area, ruling that the federal police
 bore responsibility for maintaining order in cases involving indigenous groups. The
 federal police have been able to maintain an uneasy peace between Indians, on one
 side, and non-Indian occupants of the land on the ot er.
 The Catholic Church's Indigenist Council reported in 1995 that more than 7,000
 Indians were trapped into forced labor (see Section 6.c.). The majority were Guarani
 Indians in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, where a high rate of suicide (54 among
 the Guarani through mid-December) was reported.
 In the absence of government action indigenous groups have begun to take mat-
 ters into their own hands. Guajajara Indians in the state of Maranhao threatened
 to force out 75 families living on their demarcated land. Partly as a response to that
 threat, the Government began gradually to resettle each of the 75 families. In Au-
 gust approximately 50 Ful-ni-o Indians occupied the headquarters of FUNAI, Bra-
 zil's Indian Affairs Agency, in Garanhuns, Pernambuco, to demand better medical
 treatment on their reservation and to insist that the state FUNAI administrator be
 fired. Also in August, Kaiapo Indians occupied a company guest house near their
 reserve in Alto Xingu, on the border of Para and Mato Grosso, and threatened to
 burn it down. Frustrated by what he said was 3 years of government inaction,
 Raoni, a well-known leader of the Kaiapo, demanded that FUNAI forbid fishing ex-
 peditions along the river, charging that they were depleting the Kaiap fishing sup-
 plies, and put a stop to hunting expeditions into the Kaiapo reserve. Several months
 earlier, three American citizens on a fishing expedition on the Xingu river were
 briefly held hostage by Kakramoro Indians, who demanded that the Americans re-
 
 
 351
 linquish their boat and 8,000 reais (approximately $8,500); they settled for
 confiscation of the boat only. It is unclear whether the kidnaping was motivated by
 anger at the depletion of the fishing supply, or common robbery.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although racial discrimination has been ille-
 al since 1951, darker-skinned citizens frequently encounter discrimination. Most
 blacks are found among the poorer sectors of society. Even though nearly half of the
 population has some African ancestry, very few senior officials in Government, the
 armed forces, or the private sector are black. Black consciousness organizations
 challenge the view that Brazil is a racial democracy with equality for all regardless
 of skin color. They assert that racial discrimination becomes most evident when
 blacks seek employment, housing, or educational opportunities. According to govern-
 ment statistics, the monthly per capita income for white males is 6.3 times the mini-
 mum wage; for white women, 3.6 times the minimum wage; for black men, 2.9; and
 for black women, 1.7.
 An April survey conducted by a prominent polling service provided insight into
 the perceptions of different segments of the population about the problem of racism.
 The survey showed that 89 percent of the population believes that whites are preju-
 died against blacks. Ten percent of nonblacks admtted that they were prejudiced
 against blacks, and, according to the pollsters, 87 percent of whites displayed signs
 of racism in their answers to at least 1 of 12 questions asked in the poll.
 The news magazine Veja reported in 1994 that whites in the predominantly black
 city of Salvador, Bahia, earn on average three times more than blacks, while in the
 southern city of Curitiba, whites earned 1.5 times the black average. The magazine
 attributed the difference between the two cities to better public education in the
 south.
 Blacks are often the victims of violence at a level disproportionate to their per-
 centage in the population. For instance, the well-respected human rights NGO ac-
 tive in the northeast, the Luiz Freire Cultural Center, reported that, of the 1,378
 murder victims in Recife in 1994, 87 percent were black.
 Racism, as a crime, is difficult to prove in courts, although both Sao Paulo and
 Rio de Janeiro have designated special police units to investigate it. In a com-
 prehensive story on the problem of racism, the daily newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo
 reported that in Florianopolis, in the southern state of Santa Catarina, a labor court
 ordered the state-owned firm Eletrosul to reinstate electrical technician Vicente do
 Espirito Santo after finding that Santo's charges that he had been fired in 1992 be-
 cause he was black were well-founded.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Code provides for union representation
 of all workers (except for military, military police, and firemen) but imposes a hier-
 archical, unitary system, funded by a manatory "union tax on workers and em-
 ployers. Under a restriction known as "unicidade" (one per city), the Code prohibits
 multiple unions of the same professional category in a given geographical area. The
 1988 Constitution freed workers to organize new unions out of old ones without
 prior authorization by the Government but retained other provisions of the old labor
 code. Elements of the labor movement and the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions (ICFTU) criticize the retention of unicidade and the union tax.
 In practice, unicidade has proven less restrictive in recent years, as more liberal
 interpretations of its restrictions permitted new unions to form and-in many
 cases-to compete with unions and federations that had already enjoyed official rec-
 ognition. The sole bureaucratic requirement for new unions is to register with the
 Ministry of Labor which, by judicial decision, is bound to receive and record their
 registration. The primary source of continuing restriction is the system of labor
 courts, which retain the right to review the registration of new unions and to adju-
 dicate conflicts over their formation. Otherwise, unions are independent of the Gov-
 ernment and of political parties.
 Approximately 20 to 30 percent of the work force is organized, with well over half
 of this number affiliated with an independent labor central. Intimidation of rural
 labor union organizers by landowners and their agents continues to be a problem
 (see Section L.a.).
 The Constitution provides workers with the right to strike, including civil serv-
 ants (except again, for military, police, and firemen). Enabling legislation passed in
 1989 stipulates that essential services must remain in operation during a strike and
 that workers must notify employers at least 48 hours before beginning a walkout.
 The Constitution prohibits government interference in labor unions but provides
 that "abuse" of the right to strike (such as not maintaining essential services or fail-
 ure to end a strike after a labor court decision) is punishable by law.
 
 
 The Constitution specifies the right of public employees to strike, subject to condi-
 tions enacted by the Congress. Since the Congress has yet to pass the complemen-
 tary legislation, labor law attorneys continue to debate the limits on the right to
 strike of public employees. In practice, the Government has not interfered with their
 right to strike. A month-long strike by Petrobras (the public oil monopoly) employ-
 ees in May was judged abusive by the Supreme Labor Court. A majority approved
 of the firm handling of the strike by President Cardoso, who used soidiers to ensure
 that those who wanted to return to work were able to do so. The strike, which great-
 ly inconvenienced the public, led many-including some labor leaders-to call for
 limits on public employees' right to strike.
 Autoworkers, teachers, university professors, health workers, train and municipal
 transit workers, dock workers, and post office, telephone, and electrical generating
 authority employees also went on strike. Formerly, the courts ruled almost auto-
 matically that strikes were abusive; in recent years, however, the courts have ap-
 plied the law with more discretion. The 1989 Strike Law prohibits dismissals or the
 hiring of substitute workers during a strike, with certain exceptions, provided the
 strike is not ruled abusive.
 Although the law makes no provision for a central labor organization, three majcr
 grups have emerged: the Sole Workers Central (CUT), the General Workers Con-
 ederation, and Forca Sindical. The centrals do not have legal standing to represent
 professional categories of workers, but all three centrals can effectively acquire such
 standing by affiliating with existing statewide federations or nationwide confed-
 erations or by forming new federations and confederations. Unions and centrals
 freely affiliate with international trade union organizations. All three major confed-
 erations are affiliated with the ICFTU.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to organize. With government assistance, businesses and unions are work-
 ing to expand and improve mechanisms of collective bargaining. The scope of issues
 legally susceptible to collective bargaining is narrow, however, and the labor court
 system exercises normative powers with regard to the settlement of labor disputes,
 thus discouraging direct negotiation. The Cardoso Government has made expansion
 of collective bargaining one of its major objectives in the labor sector. On June 30,
 the Government promulgated a provisional measure which ended the indexing of
 wages to inflation, reduced the role of labor courts in wage negotiations, allowed for
 mediation if the parties involved requested it, and provided greater latitude for col-
 lective bargaining. Unions welcomed this reduction in the power of labor courts to
 set wages, since previously labor courts and the Labor Ministry had mediation re-
 sponsibility in the preliminary stages of dispute settlement. In many cases, free ne-
 gotiations set wages; labor court decisions set them in others. Under the terms of
 the provisional measure, parties may now freely choose mediation.
 The Constitution incorporates a provision from the Labor Code which prohibits
 the dismissal of employees who are candidates for or holders of union leadership po-
 sitions. Nonetheless, dismissals take place, with those dismissed required to resort
 to a usually lengthy court process for relief. In general, the authorities do not effec-
 tively enforce laws protecting union members from discrimination. Union officials
 estimate that only 5percent of such cases reaching the labor court system are re-
 solved within days through a preliminary judicial order. The other 95 percent gen-
 erally take 5 to 10 years (and sometimes more) to resolve.
 Labor law applies equally in the free trade zones. However, the unions in the
 Manaus Free Trade Zone, like rural unions and many unions in smaller cities, are
 relatively weaker vis-a-vis industry compared to unions in the major industrial cen-
 ters.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although the Constitution pro-
 hibits forced labor there were credible reports of forced labor in many parts of
 Brazil. The Federal Government admits that existing enforcement resources are in-
 adequate. In 1995 the CPT denounced 28 cases of forced labor, involving a total of
 25,193 workers in 9 states, an increase from the 19,940 reported in the previous
 year. Forced labor is common on farms producing charcoal for use in the iron found-
 nes and steel industries and in the sugar industry (see also Section 6.d.).
 Local police admitted that overseers or owners of many farms withhold pay from
 migrant laborers and use force to retain and intimidate them, but such violations
 fall within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Labor, which has only 2,300 inspectors
 for the entire country. Labor organizations allege that in mining and the rural econ-
 omy thousands of workers, including minors, are hired on the basis of false prom-
 ises, subjected to debt bondage and forced prostitution, with violence used to retain
 or punish workers who attempt to escape.
 Despite no increase in financial resources to fight the problem, the Federal Gov-
 ernment has made attempts to clamp down on forced labor. The new Secretary for
 
 
 353
 the Labor Ministry department responsible for enforcing labor laws has taken an
 activist approach. She created roving inspection teams (starting with three and later
 increasing to six), which in a number of surprise inspections well-publicized after
 the fact, freed hundreds of workers subjected to forced labor. The people responsible
 for exploiting forced labor usually go unpunished because freed workers are often
 afraid to testify against those who recruited and oversaw them, and because au-
 thorities have found it difficult to identify and locate the owners of farms or busi-
 nesses that exploit forced labor.
 In mid-1995 the largest trade union confederation, CUT, initiated a 24-hour hot-
 line with a toll-free number for reporting instances of forced labor. CUT President
 Vicente Paulo da Silva inaugurated the campaign by personally inspecting charcoal
 refineries in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Shortly after the CUT initiative, Presi-
 dent Cardoso delivered a radio address condemning the practice of forced labor and
 announced the formation of an interministerial task force to devise a comprehensive
 government approach to combat the problem. Cardoso said that the Government
 would no longer provide loans, subsidies, or rollover of outstanding debt to farms
 or companies found to employ forced labor and that they would be ineligible to bid
 on public contracts.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum working age under
 the Constitution is 14 years, except for apprentices. Judges can authorize employ-
 ment for children under 14 years of age when they feel it appropriate. The authori-
 ties rarely enforce legal restrictions intended to protect working minors under age
 18, however, and the problem is widespread. The law requires permission of the par-
 ents or guardians for minors to work, and they must attend school through the pri-
 mary grades. The law bars all minors from night work, work that constitutes a
 physical strain, and employment in unhealthful, dangerous, or morally harmful con-
 ditions.
 Despite these legal restrictions, official figures state that nearly 3 million 10- to
 14-year-old children (or 4.6 percent of the work force) were employed. Many children
 work alongside their parents in cane fields, cutting hemp, or feeding wood into char-
 coal ovens; accidents, unhealthy working conditions, and squalor are common in
 these workplaces. According to a comprehensive report in the weekly news magazine
 Ve'a on the problem of child labor, it is common to find children in the interior of
 Bahia who have lost fingers and forearms feeding sisal into grinding machines. Car-
 los Silva de Jesus, age 14, for instance, has been blind since the age of 8 when,
 while working in a sisal field in Retirolandia, Bahia, he stabbed his left eye with
 a sisal leaf and shortly afterward punctured his right eye with a knife because he
 could not see very well.
 Independent shoe manufacturers in Franca (Sao Paulo) continue to purchase
 products from cottage industry subcontractors who employ thousands of children
 under age 14, in violation of the law. Public prosecutors brought two suits in late
 1994 against two groups of major Franca shoe manufacturers for illegally sub-
 contracting work which led to the exploitation of child labor. In March the regional
 labor court found the first group of five manufacturers guilty of using child labor,
 ordered the practice stopped immediately, and specified daily fines to be paid by the
 companies if the practice continued. The case of the second group of five manufac-
 turers remained under consideration by the court, which requested additional evi-
 dence. A third suit was brought in mid-1995 against another group of five compa-
 nies.
 According to a recent 2-year study carried out by an NGO based in Pernambuco,
 the Centro Josue de Castro, the use of child labor is common on sugar cane planta-
 tions. The study estimated that 54,000 minors work on sugar cane plantations in
 Pernambuco, and 40,000 in Sao Paulo. In 40 percent of the families the researchers
 interviewed, children contributed 30 to 50 percent of the family income. In the sugar
 cane industry in Pernambuco, 25 percent of the workers are younger than 18 years,
 90 percent of whom began working on the plantations between the ages of 7 and
 13. CUT, the nationwide labor confederation, reported that child labor is common
 among orange pickers in Sa Paulo. The CPT received reports of child labor in the
 charcoal production industry in Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso, Mate Grosso do Sul,
 and Para; on sisal plantations in Bahia and Paraiba; on cotton plantations in
 Parana; and in the area of reforestation, where children are used principally to put
 toxic chemicals on trees and anthills, in Minas Gerais, Bahia, and Espirito Santo.
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcement of child labor laws, but it
 has too few inspectors to do so effectively. The widely held view that it is better
 for minors to work than to be involved in street crime also hampers enforcement
 efforts.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Prior to July 1994, the Government adjusted
 the national minimum wage every month. Upon introduction of the economic sta-
 
 
 354
 bilization plan in 1995, it set the minimum wage at $83 (70 reais) per month. In
 May President Cardoso raised the minimum wage to $111 (100 reais) per month.
 The Interunion Department for Socioeconomic Studies and Statistics estimates that
 the minimum wage is less than one-fourth that necessary to support a family of four
 (the standard set by the 1988 Constitution). The most recent national survey (for
 1990) showed that 35 percent of economically active individuals, including minors
 from 10 to 14 years of age, earned no more than the minimum wage. Many workers
 particularly outside the regulated economy and in the northeast, reportedly earned
 less than the minimum wage.
 The 1988 Constitution limits the workweek to 44 hours and specifies a weekly
 rest period of 24 consecutive hours, preferably on Sundays. The Constitution ex-
 panded pay and fringe benefits and established new protections for agricultural and
 domestic workers, although not all of these provisions are enforced.
 Unsafe working conditions are prevalent throughout the country. Incomplete fig-
 ures from the Government's Social Security Administration for workplace accidents
 and fatalities in 1994 showed 350,210 reported accidents, of which 3,129 were fatal
 and 5,962 caused permanent disabilities. Fundacentro, part of the Ministry of
 Labor, sets occupational health and safety standards. However, the Ministry has in-
 sufficient resources for adequate inspection and enforcement of these standards.
 There were also credible allegations of corruption within the enforcement system.
 If a worker has a problem in the workplace and has trouble getting relief directly
 from his employer, he or his union can file a claim with the regional labor court,
 although in practice this is frequently a cumbersome, protracted process.
 The law requires employers to establish internal commissions Ior accident preven-
 tion in workplaces. The law protects employee members of these commissions from
 being fired for their activities. Such firings, however, do occur, and legal recourse
 usually requires years for resolution.
