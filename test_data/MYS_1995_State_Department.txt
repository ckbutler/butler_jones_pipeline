 MALAYSTA
 Malaysia is a federation of 13 states with a parliamentary system of government
 based on periodic multiparty elections but in which the ruling National Front coali-
 tion has held power since 1957. The ruling coalition increased its majority in a gen-
 
 
 660
 
 eral election held this year. Opposition parties actively contest elections, although
 they now hold only 18 percent of the seats in the Federal Parliament; an opposition
 party currently controls one state government. There is political competition within
 the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), the major party in the coalition.
 The Government asserts that internal security laws allowing preventive detention
 (and arrests under such laws) are required owing to Malaysia's "sensitive social bal-
 ance," the need to ensure that the peace and stability of the country are protected,
 and concern about endemic narcotics trafficking problems. However, the Govern-
 ment also has used these laws more broadly to detain persons when available evi-
 dence is insufficient to bring formal charges under the Criminal Code, as well as
 to detain political opponents. The existence of these laws serves to inhibit effective
 opposition to government policies.
 The Royal Malaysian Police has primary responsibility for internal security mat-
 ters; it reports to the Minister of Home Affairs. Prime Minister Mahathir bin
 Mohamad also holds the Home Affairs portfolio. There continued to be some credible
 reports of mistreatment of prisoners and detainees by the police and prison officials.
 Rapidly expanding exports of manufactured goods, especially in the electronics
 sector, account for much of the country's economic growth. Crude oil exports and
 traditional commodities (tropical timber, palm oil, rubber) add to Malaysia's trade
 revenues. Strong economic performance in recent years has led to significant reduc-
 tions in poverty, improved standards of living, and more equal income distribution.
 While there is an efficient system of justice based on common law principles, the
 Government continues arbitrarily to arrest, and detain citizens without trial and to
 impose long-term restrictions on movement without due process hearings. The Gov-
 ernment also limits judicial independence and effectively restricts freedom of assem-
 bly and association and of speech and the press. These restrictions make it very dif-
 ficult for opposition parties to compete on equal terms with the long-ruling govern-
 ig coalition. Religious minorities are subject to some restrictions. Public awareness
 of serious problems such as domestic violence against women and child abuse in in-
 creasing and the Government i taking concrete steps to address them.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiiing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 At least one person died while being investigated in police custody during 1995.
 The deceased, who was a suspect in aburglary case, died from injuries while in p-
 lice detention. Although an official autopsy report was not released, the suspect's
 death certificate listed the cause of death as "hemorrhage caused by blunt trauma
 in most parts of his body, raising suspicions of police brutality. The police Inspector
 General ordered a full investigation of the case and promised to punish those re-
 sponsible for the death. He said he would take appropriate measures even if the cul-
 prits were police officers. However, any action that may have been taken was not
 made known to t    he blic he Attorney General rejeted the findings of the police
 investigation and ordered a judicial inquiry. While human rights groups applauded
 the AttorneyGeneral's decision as a positive step in combating a possible police
 coverup, the deceased's attorney questioned the effectiveness of a magistrates in-
 quiry which must to a large extent depend on the fndings of the plice investigo-
 lceetion. heoug judoficial inquiry fonr1 oieor wcriminainvolved",i the duseath
 o th]e detainee.a TheAon ey Genera~lis currently rnevwngth ?findngs ofthfein-
 quiry to determine whether there i sufficient evidence to bring criminal charge
 against the officers.
 Approximately 50 illegal aliens died from malnutrition and illness in government
 detention centers during the year. The Government denies that they were tortured,
 denied medical treatment, or held in inhumane conditions (see Sections 1.c., 1.d.
 and i.e.). The Government is investati  veng these deaths.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearanes.
 cTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punws"hment.-
 There continue to be instances of police officers abusing criminal suspects during
 interrogation, including strong psychological pressure and sometimes physical
 abuse, i n some cases, government authorities have investigated police officials for
 such abuses, but because they refuse to release information on the results of the
 investigations, it cannot be determined whether those responsible for such abuses
 are punished. There were no known instances in 1995 (or in recent years) of police
 officials being tried, convicted, and sentenced for abuse of prisoners. The Govern-
 ment is investigating the 1995 death in custody of a person who died due to "blunt
 
 
 661
 trauma in most parts of his body," which caused suspicions of police abuse (see Sec-
 tion l.a.).
 A number of law enforcement officials were arrested on narcotics related charges.
 The Prisons Department revealed in the fall that at least 29 prisons officers were
 arrested for drug related activities during 1995. Most recently, two officers were ar-
 rested in September for supplying narcotics to inmates. The suspects are detained
 under the special preventive measures section of the Dangerous Drugs Act and will
 be "banshe for 2years (see Section 1.d).
 Malaysian criminal law prscribes caning as an additional punishment to impris-
 onment for those convicted of crimes such as narcotics possession as well as some
 nonviolent crimes such as criminal breach of trust. Judges routinely include caning
 in sentencing those convicted of such crimes as kidnapping, rape, and robbery. The
 caning, which is normally carried out with a  -inch tlick wooden cane, commonly
 causes welts and sometimes scarring.
 Prison conditions generally meet international standards. Basic human needs, in-
 cluding medical care, sanitation, nutrition, and family access, are met. Overcrowd-
 ing is a problem in some of the large prisons, especially the Pudu prison in Kuala
 Lumpur. One large prison is under construction in Kuala Lumpur, and additional
 prisons are contemplated for other parts of the country. Prison guards have been
 accused and convicted of criminal wrongdoing, mostly in nonviolent narcotics related
 cases. However, there were no allegations of physical mistreatment of prisoners by
 prisn guards. "Security" prisners detainees under the ISA) are detained in a sep-
 arate detention center. Conditions there are not siguificantly different from those
 of the regular prison population. The Government does not permit visits by human
 rights monitors.
 Approximately 50 illegal aliens died from malnutrition and illness in government
 detention centers during the year. The Government denies that they are kept in in-
 humane conditions (see-Sections l.a., 1.d., and i.e.).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Three laws permit the Government to de-
 tain suspects without judicial review or filing formal charges: the 1960 Internal Se-
 curity Act (ISA), the Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance
 of 1969, and the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1985. The Government continued to use
 long-term detentions without trial in cases alleged to involve national security, as
 well as in narcotics trafficking and other cases. According to the Home Affairs Min-
 istry, there are currently 2,291 people being detained without trial; most of those
 detainees are being held under the Dangerous Drugs Act.
 Passed more than 30 years ago when there was an active Communist insurgency,
 the ISA empowers the plice to hold any person who may act "in a manner preju-
 dicial to the security of-Malaysia" for up to 60 days. According to the Government,
 the goal of the ISA is to control internal subversion, although there is now no seri-
 ous threat to national stability in Malaysia. The Government also uses the ISA
 against passport and identity card forgers. According to the Home Affairs Ministry,
 most of the detainees currently in custody under the ISA are forgers. In 1995, 35
 suspects, including three members of the UMNO and two civil servants, were ar-
 rested under the &A for allegedly issuing Malaysian identity cards to illegal immi-
 grants. Ten of the 35 suspects have been placed in detention under the ISA. Others
 are still under investigation.
 Security authorities sometimes wait several days after a detention before inform-
 ing the detainee's family. The Minister of Home Affairs may authorize, in writing,
 further indefinite detention for periods of up to 2 years. Even when there are no
 formal charges, the authorities must inform detainees of the accusations against
 them and permit them to appeal to an advisory board for review every 6 months.
 Advisory beard decisions and recommendations, however, are not binding on the
 Home Affairs Minister, are not made public, and are often not shown to the de-
 tainee. A number of ISA detainees have refused to participate in the review process
 under these circumstances.
 According to the Home Affairs Ministry, there were 34 ISA detainees at year's
 end, up from 27 as of December 1994. Those released are subject to "imposed re-
 stricted conditions," which will be in effect for the balance of their detention periods.
 These conditions limit their rights to freedom of speech, association, and travel out-
 side the country.
 Amendments to the ISA severely limit judicial review of detentions, contravening
 international standards of due process. Opposition leaders and human rights organi-
 zations continued to call on the Government to repeal the ISA and other legislation
 that deprive people of the right to defend themselves in court. Some officials sug-
 gested last year that the Government was studying possibilities of making the ISA
 "less ominous." The Deputy Home Minister announced in August 1995 that the Gov-
 ernment would examine the possibility of reducing the minimum detention period
 
 
 662
 to between 6 months and a year. However, the ISA remains intact to date. Senior
 government officials continue to insist that the ISA in its present form continues
 to be necessary to preserve peace and harmony in a multiracial society, without ex-
 plaining convincingly why reliance on the criminal law and the courts would seri-
 ously impair peace and harmony.
 The Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance was instituted
 after intercommunal riots in 1969. Although Parliament regained its legislative
 power in 1971, the Government has never lifted the state of emergency declared at
 te time of the riots. The Home Affairs Minister can issue a detention order for up
 to 2 years against a person if he deems it necessary to protect public order or for
 the 'suppression of violence or the prevention of crimes involving violence." Accord-
 ing to the Home Affairs Ministry in September, there were 447 people in detention
 under the Emergency Ordinance, up from 200 people in 1994. Local human rights
 organizations accept this figure as accurate.
 Provisions of the 1985 amendments to the Dangerous Drugs Act give the Govern-
 ment specific power to detain suspected drug traffickers. The suspects may be held
 up to 39 days-before the Home Affairs Minister must issue a detention order. Once
 the ministry has issued an order, the detainee is entitled to a habeas corpus hearing
 before a court. In some instances, the judge may order the detainee's release. Sus-
 pects may be held without charge for successive 2-year intervals, with periodic re-
 view by an advisory board, whose opinion is binding on the Home Affairs Minister.
 However the review process contains none of the due process rights that a defend-
 ant would have in a court proceeding. As of December, 1,810 drug suspects re-
 mained under detention or under restrictions equivalent to house arrest under this
 statute. The police frequently rearrest suspected narcotics traffickers and firearms
 offenders under the preventive measures clauses of the Dangerous Drugs Act or the
 ISA after an acquittal in court on formal charges under separate provisions of those
 acts.
 Immigration laws are used to detain possible illegal aliens without trial or hear-
 ing. A large number of migrant workers who were unable to prove their legal status
 have been placed in temporary detention under immigration laws. The detainees are
 not accorded any administrative or legal hearings and are released only after their
 employers p rove their legal status. Those who cannot prove their legal status are
 subject to deportation. Approiately 50 detainees have died from malnutrition and
 illnesses in the detention centers this year. Illegal aliens are kept in detention cen-
 ters which are different from prisons. Human rights organizations and opposition
 leaders accused the authorities of mistreatment and corruption and called for a
 thorough investigation. The Government initially denied any wrongdoing and de-
 fended the need to control the flow of illegal migrant workers. In response to wide
 public criticism, however, the authorities agreed to conduct a thorough investigation
 into the allegations as well as a defamation suit filed by a local police chief against
 the nongovernmental organization (NGO) that first exposed the problem. In the
 course of its investigation, the Royal Malaysian Police "interrogated" and "harassed"
 the head of the NGO, but there has been no movement in the defamation suit. The
 Government also established an independent board to advise the Home Affairs Min-
 istry on issues related to migrant workers. NGO's report that conditions in deten-
 tion centers have marginally improved since the allegations surfaced.
 Law enforcement authorities also continued to utilize the Restricted Residence Act
 to restrict movements of criminal suspects for an extended period. The Act allows
 the Home Affairs Ministry to place criminal suspects under restricted residence in
 a remote district away from home for a period of 2 years. The Ministry is authorized
 to issue the "banishment" orders without any judicial or administrative hearings.
 In March several professional soccer players and coaches allegedly involved in
 match fixing and bribery were "banished" under the Act. The restricted residence
 practice violates due process and is viewed in the same light as detention without
 trial. Human rights activists have questioned the need for a law that was passed
 60 years ago to deal with gambling under very different circumstances and have
 called for its repeal. In imposing the Act on the sports figures, however, the Govern-
 ment justified the Act as an important and still necessary tool in dealing with vice
 and gambling activities.
 A 1989 peace agreement allows members of the Communist Party of Malaya
 (CPM) to return to Malaysia. According to the Government, the agreement stipu-
 lates that they satisfy certain conditions, including taking a loyalty oath "to king
 and country" and renouncing the CPM in writing. Since 1989 more than 650 former
 CPM members have applied to return to Malaysia under the agreement. Sixty-six
 subsequently withdrew their applications because they objected to the conditions im-
 posed by the Government on their repatriation. The Government has rejected an un-
 known number of applications by former CPM members to return to Malaysia.
 
 
 663
 The Inspector General of the Police announced in October that over 400 former
 communists have been "rehabilitated" by the Malaysian security authorities and re-
 settled in Malaysia since December 1989. This rehabilitation consists of detention
 without trial under the ISA at the Kamunting Detention Center in Perak state. In
 addition, rehabilitated former CPM members who have reintegrated into Malaysian
 society are restricted to certain areas where security authorities watch them care-
 fully for up to 6 years. These rehabilitated persons cannot resume full participation
 in Malaysia's political life until this period of surveillance demonstrates to the satis-
 faction of the olice that they have abandoned their former ideology.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tral.-Malaysia's legal system is based on English com-
 mon law. High Courts have original Jurisdiction over all criminal cases involving se-
 rious crimes and most civil cases. Civil suits involving car accidents and landlord-
 tenant disputes are heard by Sessions courts. Magistrate's courts hear criminal
 cases in wdich the maximum term of sentence does not exceed 12 months. The
 Court of Appeal has appellate jurisdiction over High court and Session court deci-
 sions. The Federal Court hears appeals of Court of Appeal decisions. Islamic reli-
 gious laws administered by state authorities through Islamic courts bind ethnic Ma-
 rays in some civil matters, such as family relations and diet.
 The Malaysian judiciary has traditionally been regarded by the public and the
 legal community as committed to the rule of law, and it has ruled against the Gov-
 ernment in some politically sensitive cases. However, the Government's 1988 dis-
 missal of the Supreme Court Lord President and two other justices, along with a
 constitutional amendment and legislation restricting judicial review, has under-
 mined judicial independence and strengthened executive influence over the judiciary
 in politically sensitive cases. These developments created the possibility that Malay-
 sians who might otherwise seek legal remedies against government actions would
 be reluctant to do so and have resulted in less willingness by the courts to challenge
 the Government's legal interpretations in politically sensitive cases.
 With the appointment of a new Chief Justice last year, the relations between the
 judiciary and the bar appeared headed for a more cordial and effective partnership.
 However, following a series of questionable election-related decisions and the con-
 troversial handling of a celebrated commercial case this year, impartiality and inde-
 pendence of the judiciary were again in the spotlight. The Ear Council issued strong
 condemnations of the judiciary and of the Chief Justice. The press gave wide and
 fair coverage to the debate. As the public debate escalated, the Prime Minister ad-
 vised the Bar Council and the judiciary to work out the problems quietly and avoid
 press battles. The Bar Council has vowed to stand firm in its push for an independ-
 ent and impartial judiciary.
 Most civil and criminal cases are fair and open. The accused must be brought be-
 fore a judge within 24 hours of arrest, and charges must be levied within 10 days.
 Defendants have the right to counsel, bail is available, and strict rules of evidence
 apply in court. Defendants may appeal court decisions to higher courts and, in
 criminal cases, may also appeal for clemency to the King or local state rulers as ap-
 propriate. All criminal trials, including murder trials, are heard by a single .judge.
 Parliament voted in 1994 to amend the Criminal Procedure Code by abolishing jury
 trials in death penalty cases. Human rights organizations and the Bar Counciffhave
 complained that they were not consulted by the Government prior to tabling this
 amendment. The defease in both ordinary criminal cases and the special security
 cases described below is not entitled to a statement of evidence before the trial.
 The right to a fair trial is restricted in criminal cases in which the Attorney Gen-
 eral invokes the Essential (Security Cases) Regulations of 1975. These regulations
 governing trial procedure normally apply only in firearms cases. In cases tried
 under these regulations, the standards for accepting self-incriminating statements
 by defendants as evidence are less stringent than in normal criminalrcases. Also,
 the authorities may hold the accused for an unspecified period of time before mak-
 ing formal charges. The Attorney General has the authority to invoke these regula-
 tions in other criminal cases if the Government determines that the crime involves
 national security considerations, but such cases are rare. There were no cases in-
 volving this restriction in 1995.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitr       erence with Privaciy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for these rihts and the foverment generally respects them. Provisions in
 the security legislation (see Sectin 1.d.), however, allow the police to enter and
 search without a warrant the homes of persons suspected of threatening national
 security. Police may also confiscate evidence under these acts. In some cases each
 year, police have used this legal authority to search homes and offices, seize books
 and papers, monitor conversations, and take people into custody without a warrant.
 
 
 664
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and the press, some important limitations exist, and over the years the
 Government has restricted freedom of expression of media organizations and indi-
 viduals. The Constitution provides that freedom of speech may be restricted by leg-
 islation "in the interest of security . . . (or) public order.* Thus, the Sedition Act
 amendments of 1970 prohibit public comment on issues defined as sensitive, such
 as citizenship rights for non-Maays and the special position of Malays in society.
 Shortly before the general election, opposition member of the Parliament Lim
 Guan Eng was charged with sedition and violation of the Publications Act for mak-
 ing statements and distributing pamphlets regarding a rape case in which the
 former Chief Minister of Malacca was a suspect. The case against Lim is still pend-
 ing, and the hearing is scheduled for next year. Lim, who retained his seat in the
 general election, has argued that the case against him is politically motivated.
 The Printing Presses and Publications Act of 1984 contains important limitations
 on press freedom. Domestic and foreign publications must apply annually to the
 Government for a permit. The Act was amended in 1987 to make the publication
 of "malicious news a punishable offense, expand the Government's power to ban or
 restrict publications, and prohibit court challenges to suspension or revocation of
 publication permits. Government policies create an atmosphere which inhibits inde-
 pendent journalism and result in self-censorship of issues government authorities
 might consider sensitive. Government displeasure with press reporting is often con-
 veyed directly to the newspaper's board of directors. There have also been credible
 reports of efforts by the Government to stop reporters from pursuing stories on sen-
 sitive subjects.
 In practice press freedom is also limited by the fact that leading political figures
 or companies controlled by leading political figures in the ruling coalition, own all
 the major newspapers and all radio and television stations. These mass media pro-
 vide generally laudatory, noncritical coverage of government officials and govern-
 ment policies, and give only limited and selective coverage to political views of the
 opposition or political rivals. Editorial opinion in these mass media frequently re-
 flects government positions on domestic and international issues. Chinese-language
 newspapers are generally more free in reporting and commenting on sensitive politi-
 cal and social issues.
 Despite strong political influence on the editorial decisions of major publications
 small-circulation publications of opposition parties, social action groups, unions, and
 other private groups actively cover opposition parties and frequently print views
 critical of government policies. The Government does retain significant influence
 over these publications by requiring annual renewal of publishing permits.
 Although there were no cases of denial of renewal requests this year, the Govern-
 ment has in the past used this requirement to place limitations on opposition and
 other publications critical of the Government. The government ruling coalition's firm
 control of the press was clearly evident during the general election. As opposition
 candidates struggled to receive any coverage, the ruling coalition was lauded in
 front page stories for the duration of the campaign period.
 J The Official Secrets Act is also sometimes used to restrict freedom of the press.
 In April the police arrested two reporters for violation of the Act for writing articles
 related to an ongoing investigation of a criminal case. While the Government em-
 phasized the importance of journalists acting "within the law," the National Union
 of Journalists criticized the arrest as a threat to freedom of the press. Pointing out
 the dangers of abuse of the Act to restrict press freedom, the Bar Council called for
 a review of certain provisions of the Act which grant too much discretion to the au-
 thorities in classifying documents and deny the judiciary power to review the classi-
 fications. The reporters were released after a short period of detention.
 In a positive development, authorities showed tolerance for television and radio
 talk shows which air views critical of the Government. One particular live television
 show in which panelists had expressed frank views on various sensitive topics was
 allowed to remain on the air after a contentious public debate. Government leaders
 agreed with the press that exchanges of ideas should be encouraged and available
 to the public.
 In June 1990, Parliament enacted legislation making the Government-controlled
 Malaysian News Agency (Bernama) the sole distributor of foreign news in Malaysia,
 formalizing previous practice. The parliamentary opposition opposed the bill, argu-
 ing that it would increase government control over foreign news. Although the Gov-
 ernment has not to date used this law to restrict foreign news coverage or availabil-
 ity, in the past the Government has banned under separate legislation individual
 editions of foreign publications.
 
 
 665
 The Government generally respects academic freedom in the areas of teaching and
 publication. Malaysian academics are often publicly critical of the Government.
 However there is a degree of self-censorship among public university academics
 whose career advancement and funding are prerogatives of the Government. Private
 institution academics also practice a limited degree of self-censorship for fear that
 the Government may revoke licenses for their institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assodiation.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of freedom of peaceful assembly and association, but there are significant
 restrictions. These rights may be limited in the interest of security and public order,
 and the 1967 Polie Act reqtuires poie permits for all public assembies with the
 exception of workers on picket lines. Spontaneous demonstrations occur periodically
 without permission, but th~ey are limited in scope and generally occur with the tacit
 consent of the police. In the east Malaysian state of Sarawak, groups of indigenous
 people have held peaceful demonstrations to protest government policies and ac-
 tions.
 In the aftermath of the intercommunal riots in 1969, the Government banned p-
 litical rallies. The Government continued the policy during the general election of
 1995. However, both government and opposition parties held large indoor political
 gatherings dubbed "discussion sessions" during the campaign period. The ruling coa-
 lituion a held several large scale events which very much resembled political ral-
 lies but were called something else and allowed.
 Government and opposition candidates campaign actively. There are, however,
 some restrictions on freedm of assembly during campaigns. During the actual cam-
 paign period, political parties submit lists of times and places for their "discussion
 groups. Although theoretically no police permit is required, some opposition discus-
 sion group meetings in past campaigns have been canceled for lack of a police per-
 mit. Outside of the campaign period, a permit is required, with most applications
 routinely approved. These restrictions and the ban on political rallies handicap the
 opposition's ability to campaign effectively.
 Other statutes limit the right of association, such as the Societies Act of 1966,
 under which any association of seven or more members must register with the Gov-
 ernment as a society. The Government may refuse to register a new society or may
 impose conditions when allowing a society to register. The Government also has the
 power to revoke the registration of an existing society for violations of the Act, a
 power it has selectively enforced against political opposition groups. In 1994, the
 Government declared the Al Arqam religious movement to be an illegal organization
 under the Societies Act and seized computers and other materals belonging to the
 organization. More th   th   ems  of te sect were arrested for being associated
 with the organization. The threat of possible deregistration inhibits political activ-
 ism by public or special interest organizations.
 Another law affecting freedom of association is the Universities and University
 Colleges Act; it mandates government approval for student associations and pro-
 hibits student associations, as well as faculty members, from engaging in political
 activity. Campus demonstrations must be approved by a university vice chancellor.
 Human rights organizations have called for a repeal of the Act on the grounds that
 it inhibits free flow of ideas and exchange of views.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-!Islam is the official religion. Religious minorities, which
 include large Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and Christian communities, generally are per-
 mitted to worship freely but are subject to some restrictions. Islamic religious laws
 administered by state authorities through Islamic courts bind ethnic Malaya in some
 civil matters, such as family relations and diet. Government funds support an Is-
 lamic religious establishment, and it is official policy to "infuse Islamic values" into
 the administration of Malaysia. At the same time, the Constitution provides for free-
 dom of religion, and the Goveent has refused to accede to prerees to impose
 Islamic religious law beyond the Muslim community.
 The Government opposes what it considers extremist or deviant interpretations
 of Islam    an  iatbaned the Al Arqam religious movement for what it termed
 "deviationist teachings." In the, past, the Government has imposed restrictions on
 certain Islamic sects. It continues to monitor the activities of the Shi'ite minority.
 Although there were no incidents of restrictions on religious sects in 1995, govern-
 ment duthorities continued to emphasize the importance of controlling deviationist"
 gups.They warned that these groups will not be allowed to take advantage of
 organ of religion to spread discord among the Malaysian people.
 Alhothog ther were no reports of specific incidents in 1995, allegations that some
 state governments are slow in approving building permits for non- uslim places of
 worship or land for cemeteries for non-Muslim persisted. The Government has lim-
 ited the circulation of a popular Malay-language translation of the Bible, and some
 states restrict the use of religious terms by Christians in the Malay language.
 
 
 666
 
 The Government permits but discourages conversion to religions other than Islam.
 Some states have long proscribed by law proselytizing of Muslims and other parts
 of the country strongly discourage it as well. In a March 1990 decision, the Supreme
 Court upheld the primacy of the Constitution over inconsistent state laws by ruling
 that parents have the right to determine the religion of their minor children under
 the age of 18. The decision eased fears of the non-Muslim community over state
 laws that in religious conversion cases set the age of majority at puberty based on
 Islamic law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens generally have the right to travel within the country and live
 and work where they please, hut the Government restricts these rights in some cir-
 cumstances. The states of Sabah and Sarawak have the independent right to control
 immigration into their territories; citizens from peninsular west Malaysia and for-
 eigners are required to present passports or national identity cards for entry. The
 Government regulates the internal movement of provisionally released ISA detain-
 ees. It also limit s the movement of some released ISA detainees to a designated city
 or state (see Section i.e.). The Government also uses the Restricted Residence Act
 to limit movements of those suspected of gambling or vice activities (see Section
 I.e.).
 The Government generally does not restrict enmgration  Citizens are free to travel
 abroad, although in some cases the Government has refused to issue or has with-
 held passports on security grounds or in the belief that the trip will be detrimental
 to the country's image. Most government action is taken because of suspected drug
 trafficking offenses or other serious crimes. In an unprecedented move last year, the
 Government revoked the passport of Al Arqam leader Ashaari Muhammed and nine
 of his followers while Ashaari and his followers were still residing in Thailand.
 Citizens are not permitted to travel to Israel, and in 1994, following a public out-
 cry, the Government revoked the passport of Tunku Abdullah, a member of the
 royal family, after Abdullah made what was described as a "private business trip"
 to Israel. Recently, however, the Government has loosened travel restrictions. Citi-
 zens are now permitted to travel to Jerusalem for religious purposes.
 According to a report by the Home Affairs Ministry, a total of 455,070 foreign
 workers were issued work permits as of June 1994. However, there may be over 1
 million foreign workers in Malaysia, many illegally, who work in low-skill jobs in
 the plantation, construction, and service sectors of the economy. The Human Re-
 sources Ministry reports that as many as 1.3 million foreign workers, both legal and
 illegal are in the country. It acknowledges that as many as 500,000 of those are
 here ieglly. Although some illegal workers ultimately are able to regularize their
 ration status, others depart voluntarily after a few months, while some are
 formally deported as illegal migrants. In 1992 the Government conducted a registra-
 tion program designed to regularize the immigration status of illegal workers. After
 the registration program ended, the Government launched combined police and mili-
 tary operations to enforce immigration and passport laws. In 1994 more than
 130,000 foreign workers were detained, of whom about 50,000 were deported. Fol-
 lo wing a report of numerous deaths in the detention enters, human rights groups
 and opposition politicians accused the authorities of mistreatment and corruption
 and called for an independent investigation (see Section 1.d.).
 In 1991 and 1992 over 300 asylum seekers from the Indonesian province of Aceh
 arrived in Malaysia, allegedly fleeing violence stemming from a separatist rebellion
 in northern Sumatra. The Government refused to recognize the Acehnese as politi-
 cal refugees. By mid-1993 a p proximately 163 Achnese had returned voluntarily to
 Sumatra. In early 1994 the Government offered to release those in detention, to pro-
 vide all of the Acehnese with work permits and to give them jobs on plantations.
 The Acebnese rejected the Government's offer, contending they were not economic
 migrants. Nevertheless, in mid-1995 the 131 Acehnese in detention and the 51 who
 had obtained refuge in the compound of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) agreed to resolve the impasse by accepting the Government's offer of work
 permits renewable on a yearly basis along with the freedom to work in any sector.
 Having provided first asylum to more than 254,000 Vietnamese beat refugees
 since 1975, the Government began in May 1989 to deny, in contravention of its com-
 mitments under the Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA), first asylum to virtually
 all arriving Vietnamese. Between May 1989 and November 1993 Malaysia denied
 first asylum to over 10,000 Vietnamese. However, in late 1993 the Government re-
 versed its policy, and throughout 1994 and 1995 it fully complied with the CPA's
 first asylum provisions. Military officers conducted the screening of the applicants
 for refugee status, with legal consultants from the UNHCR present during each
 interview. Final appeals were reviewed in late 1994. Between March 1989 and De-
 cember 4, 1995, 9,635 Vietnamese were granted refugee status to settle in the Unit-
 
 
 667
 ed States. During the same period, 4,747 returned voluntarily to Vietnam, including
 626 in 1995. Voluntary returns to Vietnam slowed to a trickle in the second haf
 of 1995. Lie Government declared that Malaysia would use its bilateral orderly re-
 turn program with Vietnam to repatriate all the remaining Vietnamese asylum
 seekers by December 31, 1995. However, the Government was not able to persuade
 the Vietnamese Government to accept large numbers of screened out asylum seek-
 ers. As of December 4, 1995, 4,406 Vietnamese asylum seekers remained in the
 camps, of whom 94 have been approved for resettlement in a third country, another
 39 Khmers also remained.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 By law citizens have the right to change their government through periodic elec-
 tions, which are procedurally free and fair, with votes recorded accurately. In prac-
 tice, however, it is very dificult for opposition parties to ompete on equal terms
 with the governing coalition ( which has held power at the national level since 1957)
 because of some electoral irregularities and legal restrictions on campaigmng, as
 well as restrictions on freedom of association and of the press. Nevertheless, opposi-
 tion candidates campaign actively and admit that the voting and counting of votes
 are relatively free.
 Following the 1995 general election, courts issued several controversial decisions
 on election-related disputes which the opposition argued were motivated by "politi-
 cal" mandates of the ruling coalition. In one instance, the court overturned an elec-
 tion result and awarded the seat to the ruling party candidate, who had lost the
 election to an opposition incumbent. In doing so, the court overturned an election
 commission decision that the opposition candidate was qualified to run despite a
 judgment against him in an unrelated case. The opposition argued that since the
 election itself was conducted without fraud, a new election should be called. How-
 ever, the court ruled that the seat belonged to the losing candidate because the win-
 ner should not have been allowed to run in the first place. The decision awards to
 the ruling party a seat that has been traditionally held by the opposition, and the
 ruling has been criticized as an unfair political judgment.
 Malaysia has a Westminster-style parliamentary system of government. National
 elections, required at least every 5 years, have been held regularly since independ-
 ence in 1957. A general election was held this year in accordance with the 5-year
 rule. The ruling coalition won an overwhelming victory, increasing its majority in
 the Parliament to 82 percent. The UMNO Malays dominate the ruling national front
 coalition of ethnic-based parties that has controlled Parliament since independence.
 Within the UMNO there is active political debate.
 The Parliament passed amendments to its rules in October which strengthen the
 power of the speaker and which curb parliamentary procedures heavily used by the
 opposition. The amendments empower the speaker to ban obstreperous opposition
 Members of Parliament (M.P.'s) or up to 10 days, imposed limits on the ability of
 M.P.'s to pose supplementary questions and revisit nongermane issues, and estab-
 lish restrictions on the tabling of questions of public importance. The amendments
 reduce substantially the opposition's scope to criticize the Government in Par-
 liament.
 A new cabinet position was created after the election, and non-Malays now fill 7
 of the 26 cabinet posts. The government coalition currently ontrls 12 of 13 states.
 Ethnic Chinese leaders of a member party of the Government coalition hold execu-
 tive power in the state of Penang. Anslamic opposition party controls the northern
 state of Kelantan.
 Women face no legal limits on participation in government and politics, but there
 are practical impediments. Women are represented in senior leadership posit ions in
 the Government in small numbers, including two cabinet-level Ministers. Women
 comprise approximately 7.8 percent (holding 15 seats out of 192) of the elected lower
 house of Parliament and approximately 19 percent (13 seats out of 69) of the ap-
 pointed upper house. They also hold high-level judgeships.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestgat ion of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 After a 2-year struggle for registration, the National Human Rights Association,
 a local human rights society of prominent Malaysians, began operatin in 1991. This
 association publicly criticizes the Government, although it does not Minvestig.ate the
 Government except in response to individual complaints. It seeks repeal of the ISA
 and is reviewing Kelantan'a efforts to impose Islamic restrictions in that state.
 A number of other organizations, including the Bar Council and public interest
 groups, devote attention to human rights activities. The Government tolerates their
 
 
 668
 activities but rarely responds to their inquiries or occasional press statements, offi-
 cials criticize local groups for collaborating with internationaI human rights organi-
 zations, representatives of which have visited and traveled in Malaysia but rarely
 have been given access to government officials. In 1992 a group seeking to form a
 local chapter of a prominent international human rights organization appealed a
 government rejection of its application under the Societies Act. In 1993 the Govern-
 ment rejected the appeal.
 NGO's are becoming increasingly active and critical of the Government. Although
 the Government did not place any restrictions on their activities in 1995, govern-
 ment authorities highlighted allegations of abuses by NGO's and hinted that they
 may need to be more closely monitored.
 The Government has not acceded to any of the major international treaties on
 human rights, generally maintaining that such issues are internal matters. It re-
 jects criticism of its human rights record by international human rights organiza-
 tions and foreign governments.
 Foreign government officials have discussed human rights with their Malaysian
 counterparts, and private groups occasionally have done so.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Federal Constitution of Malaysia provides for equal protection of the law and
 prohibits discrimination against citizens on the basis of religion, race, descent or
 place of birth. Although neither the constitution nor laws explicitly prohibit dis-
 crimination on the basis of sex or disabilities, the government has made efforts to
 eliminate discrimination against women and the disabled. Despite the constitutional
 prohibition against discrimination on the basis of religion or race, government poli-
 cies include affirmative action programs for bumiputras (i.e., Malays and Muslims).
 Women.-NGO's concerned a out women's issues push for legislative and social
 reforms to improve the status of women. These groups raise issues such as violence
 against women, trafficking in women and young girls, employment opportunities
 with equal pay, and greater participation by women in decisionmaking positions.
 Statistics on domestic violence are sketchy but government leaders have identified
 domestic violence as a continuing social ill. The Government is taking steps to ad-
 dress the problem.
 In 1994Parliament passed the first domestic violence bill after 8 years of lobbying
 by women's groups. It offers a broad definition of domestic violence, gives powers
 to the courts to protect victims, and provides for compensation and counseling for
 victims. However, it fails to make an act of domestic violence a criminal offense, and
 women's groups have criticized it on those grounds. Those covered under the bill in-
 clude a spouse, former spouse, a child, an incapacitated adult, or any other member
 of the family. Cases of wife beating or child abuse normally are tried under provi-
 sions of the Penal Code governing assault and battery, which carry penalties of 3
 months to 1 year in prison and fines up to $300. Women's issues continued to re-
 ceive prominent coverage in public seminars and the media in 1995.
 The cultural and religious traditions of Malaysia's major ethnic groups heavily in-
 fluence the condition of women in Malaysian society. In family and religious mat-
 ters, Muslim women are subject to Islamic law. Polygyny is allowed and practiced
 to a limited degree, and inheritance law favors male offspring and relatives. The Is-
 lamic Family Law was revised in 1989 to provide better protection for the property
 rights of married Muslim women and to make more equitable a Muslim woman s
 right to divorce.
 Non-Muslim women are subject to civil law. Changes in the Civil Marriage and
 Divorce Act in the early 1980's increased protection ofmarried women's rights, espe-
 cially those married under customary rites.
 Government policy supports women's full and equal participation in education and
 the work force. Women are represented in growing numbers in the professions, al-
 though their participation as of 1990 in the administrative and managerial occupa-
 tions was less than 1 percent, and they generally receive lower wages. In 1993
 women still occupied only about 1 percent of administrative and managerial posi-
 tions. In the scientific and medical fields, women now make up more than half of
 all university graduates and the total intake of women into universities increased
 from 29 percent in 1970 to half of the student population in 1995. The participation
 of women in the labor force increased from 37 percent in 1970 to 48 percent in 1994,
 including a tripling of the number of women involved in manufacturing.
 In the opposition-controlled state of Kelantan, the state government has imposed
 restrictions on all female workers, including non-Muslims. Female workers cannot
 work at night and are restricted in the dress they may wear in the workplace. The
 state government justifies these restrictions as reflecting Islamic values. Given Ma-
 
 
 669
 laysia's federal structure of government, there are no legal means, short of amend-
 ing the Constitution, by which the central Government can overturn such state
 laws. A court decision applies only to the facts of the particular case. However, it
 is conceivable that if someone were to challenge Kelantan's restrictions in court, the
 court might use the same line of reasoning to deal with the restrictions.
 Children.-The Government is committed to childrens' rights and welfare; it
 spends roughly 20 percent of its current budget on education. According to statistics
 publicized by the National Unity and Social Development Ministry, 1,075 cases of
 child abuse were reported in 1993. The Government has taken some steps to deal
 with the problem. Parliament passed the Children's Protection Act in 1991, effective
 in 1993. In 1995 the Law Minister announced that the Government was considering
 imposing a mandatory death sentence for those found guilty of child abuse which
 resulted in death. Public and government awareness of child abuse and children's
 rights continued to increase as the press and NGO's devoted more attention to the
 issue.
 Statistics on the extent of child prostitution are not available, but women's organi-
 zations have highlighted the problem of trafficking in underage girls. The Health
 Ministry announced that it would work closely with the police to stamp out child
 prostitution, and some brothel owners have been prosecuted.
 People With Disabilities.-While the Government does not discriminate against -
 physically disabled persons in employment, education, and provision of other state
 services, budgetary allotments for people with disabilities are very small. Public
 transportation, public buildings, and other facilities are not adapted to the needs of
 the disabled, and the Government has not mandated accessibility for the disabled,
 through legislation or otherwise. Special education schools exist, but they are not
 sufficient to meet needs. The Government, however, appears to be becoming more
 sensitive to the needs of physically disabled. In August the Transportation Minister
 announced that new commuter trains will be made wheelchair accessible. The Gov-
 ernment also provides incentives for employers to offer employment opportunities
 for the disabled.
 Disabled persons work in all sectors of the economy, but the prevalent feeling in
 society remains that disabled people cannot work. In 1994 the Government did take
 a major step to acknowledge the rights of those with disabilities when the Deputy
 Prime Minister signed the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific
 (ESCAP) proclamation on full participation and equality of people with disabilities
 in the Asia and Pacific region. By signing this agreement, the Government commit-
 ted itself to implementing new policy initiatives and actions aimed at systematically
 improving the living conditions of people with disabilities.
 The Government has sought to register those with disabilities under four cat-
 egories--blind, deaf, physical, mental-and as of June, 1995, has registered 55,673
 persons with disabilities in peninsular Malaysia. NGO's estimate that there are at
 least 200,000 persons with disabilities in Malaysia.
 Indigenous People.-Indigenous groups and persons enjoy the same constitutional
 rights as the rest of the population along with the same limitations. In practice, fed-
 eral laws pertaining to indigenous people vest almost total power in the Minister
 of National Unity and Social Development to protect, control, and otherwise decide
 issues concerning them. As a result, indigenous people have very little ability to par-
 ticipate in decisions. State governments make decisions affecting land rights in pe-
 ninsular Malaysia. The law does not permit indigenous persons (known as Orang
 Asli) in West Malaysia, who have been granted land on a group basis, to own land
 on an individual basis. In some cases, groups of Orang Asi have applied for titles,
 but state authorities have not provided them. Land disputes between Orang Ash'
 and others resulted in three people being killed in April 1993. Although not pub-
 licized widely, the problem of land disputes between Orang Ash and others persist.
 In east Malaysia, although state law recognizes indigenous people's right to land
 under "native customary rights," the definition and extent of these lands are in dis-
 pute. Indigenous people in the state of Sarawak continued to protest the alleged en-
 croachment by the State or private logging companies onto land that they consider
 theirs by virtue of customy rights.  vival of a large dam project (Bun Dam)
 in Sarawak, which will involve resettlement of a large number of residents in the
 area, has raised several controversial questions regarding land disputes as well as
 potential environmental problems.
 According to government figures, the indigenous people in peninsular Malaysia,
 who number fewer than 100,000, are the poorest group in Malaysia. However, ac-
 cording to Malaysian government officials, Orang Asi are gradually catching up to
 other Malaysians in their standard of living, and the percentage of Orang Ali who
 were still leading a nomadic lifestyle has dropped to less than 40 percent.
 
 
 670
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic minorities are represented in cabi-
 net-level positions in government, as well as in senior civil service positions. Never-
 theless, the political dominance of the Malay majority means in practice that ethnic
 Malays hold the nost powerful senior leadership positions in government.
 The Government implements extensive "affirmative action programs designed to
 boost the economic osition of the ethnic Malay majority which remains poorer on
 average, than the Chinese minority despite the former's political dominance. Such
 government affirmative action programs and policies do, however, limit opportuni-
 ties for non-Malays in higher education, government employment, business permits
 and licenses, and ownership of newly developed agricultural lands.
 Indian Malaysian. continue t la~g behind in Malaysia's economic development, al-
 thoun the national economic policies target less advantaged populations regardless
 of ethnicity.. These programs, which have operated since the 1969 riots, are widely
 credited with helping to ensure the generally strife-free ethnic balance.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 .a. The.Right of Association.-By law most workers have the right to engage in
 tr~ade union activity, and approxim~ately 10 percent of the work force are members
 of trade ,unions. Exceptions. include certain limited categories of workers labeled
 confidential" and "managerial and executives," as well as defense and police offi-
 cia.m witin certain lmitations, unions may organize wrkplaces, bargain collec-
 tively with employers, and associate with nationa[ federations.
 The Industrial Relation. Act prohibits interfering with, restraining, or coercing a
 wo rker in the e xercie of the right to form trade unions or in participating in lawful
 trade union activities. The Trade Unions Act, however, restricts a union to rep-
 resenting workers in a "particular establishment, trade, occupation or industry or
 within any similar trades, occupations, or industries," contrary to International
 Labr Organization (ILO) guidelines. Th~e Director General of Tra'd Unions (DGTU)
 may refuse to register a trade union and, in some circumstances, may also withdraw
 the registration of a trade union. When registration has been refused, withdrawn,
 or canceled, a trade union is considered an unlawful association. The Government
 jsifies its overall labor policies by positing that a 'social compact" exists wherein
 th overnment, employer, and worker are part of an overall effort to create jobs,
 tanworkers, boost prductivity and profitability, and ultimately provide the re-
 Sou res necessary to fund human resource development and a national social safety
 nt
 ,Trade unons from different industries may join together in national congrsses,
 but m ust regiter as societies under the Societies Act. Government policy discour-
 ages te frmation o natA  a unions n te electncs sector , the Government be-
 lieves enrrise-level unions are more appropriate for this sector. At year's end,
 here were sx such enterprise-level unions registered in the electronics industry (it
 takes only seven workera to form a union) of which four were rognied through
 eilons in wthicn  ey represented  5 percent plus 1 of the workers, and two bad
 colective bargaining agreements negotiated with their employers. In one case in
 1990, a company dismi.ssed al members of one of these unions. The union charwed
 te company wit nion-bustilng and wroengful dismissal in industrial court. The
 Cas was ith e n  sm eptembr 1990; the uion appealed an industrial court decision
 o May 1994 (in roe r of the co mpany) to the High Court. On August 8ith draw
 Couh  reversed the dec ision of the industrial ourt and ordered a new  eeinghn
 te lower court, Restritions on freedom of association in the electronics industry
 have beenthe subject of om plaints to the ILO. In July 1995, in a case involving
 theMetal  ndutmry Workers Union, the Ministry of Human Resources went to court
 to force an employer to disclose information necessary to resolve a claim of recogni-
 tion-the first action of its kind.
 Unions maintain independence both from the Government and from the political
 padr ts,bun  mdividual uenon members may belong to political parties. Although
 unon omicers are foriden to nold princieal offices in political parties, individual
 tradae union leaders have served in Parliament as opposition politicians. Trade
 umons are f    o asocate with national labor societies that exercise many of the
 responsibilises of nat ion  ar uons, although they cannot bargain  or local
 unions. Enterprise unions also can associate with international labor bodies and ac-
 tively do so.
 Relations between the Government and the Malaysian Trade Unio    n Congress
 (MTUC), the leading labor center, have never been warm, but there have been peri-
 ods of closer cooperation and less overt antagonism. Relations reached a low point
 when MTUC President Zainal Rampak and former MTUC Secretary General Dr. V.
 David were arrested and charged in October 1994 with criminal breach of trust
 along with two other union lears. Some groups claimed that the fact of the arrests
 
 
 671
 (based on events in the 1980s) and the high bail amount (close to $200,000 for a
 violation involving some $4,000) were an attempt to keep Rampak from attending
 and raising controversial issues in international labor forums, such as the Inter-
 national Labor Organization (ILO). This concern was allayed when Rampak, whose
 passor had been seized by the authorities, was given permission to travel to Gene-
 va. The trial, which was set for May 1995, was postponed to November when David
 was unable to make a court appearance due to illness. They appeared in the Ses-
 sions court on November 21 and pled not guilty to the original charges as well as
 additional charges of criminal breach of trust involving over $30,000. Next hearings
 are set for May 1996. MTUC and international observers continue to be concerned
 about the outcome of this trial.
 Although strikes are legal, the right to strike is severely restricted. The law con-
 tains a list of "essential services' in which unions must give advance notice of any
 industrial action. The list includes sectors not normally deemed "essential" under
 ILO definitions. There were 15 strikes in 1994 resulting in a loss of 5,675 man-days.
 A majority of the strikes (7) were in the plantation sector. Six strikes took place
 in the manufacturing sector, double the number for previous year.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1967 requires the parties to notify the Ministry
 of Human Resources that a dispute exists before any industrial action (strike or
 lockout) may be taken. The Ministry's Industrial Relations Department may then
 become actively involved in conciliation efforts. If conciliation fails to achieve a set-
 tlement, the Minister has the power to refer the dispute to the Industrial Court.
 Strikes or lockouts are prohibited while the dispute is before the industrial court.
 According to 1994 data, the industrial court found for labor in 62 percent of its cases
 and for management in 14 percent. Figures for 1995 were not available. The re-
 maining 24 percent were settled out of court. The Industrial Relations Act prohibits
 employers from taking retribution against a worker for participating in the lawful
 activities of a trade union. Where a strike is legal, these provisions would prohibit
 employer retriution against strikers and leaders. Although some trade unions ques-
 tion their effectiveness, it is not possible to assess fully whether these provisions
 are being effectively enforced, given the limited number of cases of alleged retribu-
 tion.
 There are three national labor organizations currently registered: one for public
 servants, one for teachers, and one for employees of state-based textile and garment
 companies. Public servants have the right to organize at the level of ministries and
 departments. There are three national joint councils representing management and
 professional civil servants, technical employees, and nontechnical workers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the legal right
 to organize and bargain collectively, and collective bargaining is widespread in those
 sectors where labor is organized. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by em-
 ployers against union members and organizers. In one case, the industrial court or-
 dered aJapanese maker of electronic wateh components to reinstate an employee
 who had been unfairly dismissed for his involvement in trade union activities. To
 date, the company has failed to implement the order, leading some union leaders
 to say that the legal system is not capable of dealing promptly and fairly with their
 complaints. Charges of discrimination may be fled with the Ministry of Human Re-
 sources or the Industrial Court. When conciliation efforts by the Ministry of Human
 Resources fail, critics say the Industrial Court is slow in adjudicating worker com-
 plaints.
 Companies in free trade zones (FTZ's) must observe labor standards identical to
 those elsewhere in Malaysia. Many workers at FTZ companies are organized, espe-
 cially in the textile and electrical prodcts sectors. During 1993 the Government
 proposed amendments to the Industrial Relations Act to remove previous restric-
 tions on concluding collective agreements about terms and conditions of service in
 "pioneer industries. " Legislation to address this issue was introduced and subse-
 quently withdrawn in late 1994 by the Ministry of Human Resources to take into
 account other developments in the labor sector. Government plans to reintroduce
 such legislation in 1995 did not materialize. The Government took these measures
 in part to respond to ILO criticism of its previous policy with respect to pioneer in-
 dustries. The 1LO continues to object to other legal restrictions on collective bargain-
 ing. Some labor leaders criticized amendments to the Labor Law in 1980, designed
 to curb strikes, as an erosion of basic worker rights. The labor critics contend that
 these changes do not conform to ILO standards.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no evidence that forced
 or compulsory labor occurs. In theory, certain laws allow the use of imprisonment
 with compulsory labor as a punishment for persons expressing views opposed to the
 established order or who participate in strikes. The Government maintains that the
 
 
 constitutional prohibition on forced or compulsory labor renders these laws without
 effect.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Children and Young Persons
 (Employment) Act of 1966 prohibits the employment of children younger than the
 age of 14. The Act permits some exceptions, such as light work in a family enter-
 prise, work in public entertainment, work performed for the Government in a school
 or training institution, or work as an approved apprentice. In no case may children
 work mere than 6 hours per day, more than 6 days per week, or at night. Ministry
 of Human Resources inspectors enforce these legal provisions. In December 1994,
 a Japanese electronics firm was fined $5,400 for violating the Children and Young
 Persons Act. This was the first time that a large firm has been fined under the Act.
 According to credible reports, child labor is still prevalent in certain sectors of the
 country. A joint report by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and
 the Asian and Pacific Regional Organization put Malaysia's child work force at
 75,000. However, government officials maintain that the figure is outdated as it was
 based on a nationwide survey of child labor undertaken in 1980, which estimated
 that more than 73,400 children between the ages of 10 to 14 were employed full-
 time. NGO surveys indicate that most child laborers are employed on agicltural
 estates but there are indications that some are bein employed in small factories.
 Government officials do not deny the existence of chil labor but maintain that child
 laborers have largely been replaced by foreign guest workers and that the Govern-
 ment vigorously enforces child labor provisions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Malaysia does not have a national minimum
 wage, but the Wage Councils Act provides for a minimum wage in those sectors or
 regions of the country where a need exists. Under the law, workers in an industry
 who believe that they need the protection of a minimum wage may request that a
 "wage council" be established. About 140,000 workers, or 2 percent of the over 7-
 million-member labor force, are covered by minimum wages set by wage councils.
 Representatives from labor, management, and the Government sit on the wage
 councils. The minimum wages set by wage councils generally do not provide for an
 adequate standard of living for a worker and family. However, prevailing wages in
 Malaysia, even in the sectors covered by wage councils, are higher than the mini-
 mum wages set by the wage councils and do provide an adequate living.
 Under the Employment Act of 1955, working hours may not exceed 8 hours per
 day or 48 hours per workweek of 6 days. Each workweek must include one 24-hour
 rest period. The Act also sets overtime rates and mandates public holidays, annual
 leave, sick leave, and maternity allowances. The Labor Department of the Ministry
 of Human Resources enforces these standards, but a shortage of inspectors pre-
 cludes strict enforcement. In October 1993, Parliament adopted a new Occupational
 Safety and Health Act (OSHA) which covers all sectors of the economy, except the
 maritime sector and the military. The Act established a national Occupationa Safe-
 ty and Health Council, composed of workers, employers, and government represent-
 atives, to set policy and coordinate occupational safety and health measures. It re-
 quires employers to identify risks and take precautions, including providing safety
 training to workers, and compels companies aving more than 40 workers to estab-
 lish joint management-employee safety committees. The Act requires workers to use
 safety equipment and to cooperate with employers to create a safe, healthy work-
 place. Trade unions maintain that relatively few committees have been established
 and even in cases where they exist that they meet infrequently and are generally
 ineffective.
 There are currently no specific statutory or regulatory provisions which create a
 positive right for workers to remove themselves from dangerous workplace condi-
 tions without arbitrary dismissal. Employers or employees violating the OSHA are
 subject to substantial fines or imprisonment for up to 5 years.
 Significant numbers of contract workers, including numerous illegal immigrants
 from Indonesia, work on plantations and in other sectors. Working conditions on
 plantations for these laborers compare poorly with those of direct hire plantation
 workers, many of whom belong to the National Union of Plantation Workers. More-
 over, immigrant workers in the construction and other sectors, particularly if they
 are illegal entrants, generally do not have access to Malaysia's system of labor adju-
 dication. Government investigations into this problem have resulted in a number of
 steps to eliminate the abuse of contract labor. For example, in addition to expanding
 programs to regularize the status of immi$rant workers, the Government inves-
 tigates complaints of abuses, endeavors to inform workers of their rights, encour-
 ages workers to come forward with their complaints, and warns employers to end
 abuses. Like other employers, labor contractors may be prosecuted for violating Ma-
 laysia's labor laws. In August the Federal Government banned employment agencies
 from recruiting foreign workers in certain sectors and froze the entry of workers
 
 
 673
 from Bangladesh. These actions were taken in response to allegations of abuse and
 exploitation of foreign workers by employees, agencies, and by police officers at the
 various detention centers around the country. The Government has admitted that
 approiately 50 foreign workers have died while in detention but vigorously denies
 allegations by NGO's that detainees are tortured, are living in inhumane conditions
 and are not *ven propr medical care. The Government is investigating these alle-
 gations and has issued new guidelines on foreign worker recruitment. The Govern-
 ment has taken action against labor contractors who violate the law, and has as-
 sessed fines. The minimum fine currently assessed by law is $8,000. In principle,
 serious violators can be jailed, but, in practice, such punishments are rare.
