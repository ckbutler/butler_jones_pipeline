 CAPE VERDE
 Cape Verde achieved independence from Portugal in 1975 and is
 still being governed on the basis of a decree law published
 at that time. Cape Verde is a single party state governed by
 the African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and
 Cape Verde (PAIGC). Legislation is by Executive Decree.
 During 1979 around 40 political prisoners were released and
 steps toward completion of a constitution were taken.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Incidents of torture were not reported during this year.
 The draft constitution prohibits torture. When reported,
 police brutality often results in disciplinary action
 against the offending officer.
 b.    Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports of such incidents during 1979.
 c.    Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Around 40 political prisoners who had been imprisoned since
 1977 without trial were released in January 1979, and
 the Department of State believes that no political prisoners
 are currently being held.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Prisoners who are considered to be a threat to national
 security can be imprisoned without trial or subjected
 to trial by a military court. There have, however,
 been no such incidents during 1979.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The Decree Law governing Cape Verde specifically prohibits
 search of the home without a warrant. A search can only
 be conducted by a police official of the rank of inspector
 or higher.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Most Cape Verdeans are very poor; many are sick and illiterate.
 Health care is inadequate and the birth rate is among the
 highest in Africa. Faced with a devastating drought, now in
 the twelfth year, and with severe budgetary limitations, the
 government, with the effective participation of various
 western donors, has developed programs and projects to
 improve living conditions on the islands. The government's
 programs in education, agriculture and public works are well
 planned and executed despite very great obstacles. More than
 
 
 70 percent of the national budget and virtually all interna-
 tional assistance are devoted to development and the allevia-
 tion of the effects of the drought, erosion and decades of
 neglect. Inadequate planning mechanisms, reluctance to
 accept private investment and an inefficient and multilayered
 bureaucracy are problems that need to be overcome. There is
 little corruption in the government.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The Decree Law governing Cape Verde prohibits the infringe-
 ment of the freedoms of religion and assembly. In practice,
 however, all public meetings of over 15 must be officially
 approved. Church and civic groups are active, but the govern-
 ment discourages their involvement in any political activities.
 Some food programs are channeled by the government through
 church groups. There is one regularly published newspaper
 which is the official organ of the government and ruling
 party. Another newspaper, published by the Catholic church
 on an irregular basis, is subject to censorship.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are few restrictions on travel within Cape Verde
 although the government does occasionally seize and hold the
 passports of persons considered politically suspect. An exit
 permit is required for all citizens to leave Cape Verde and
 certain categories of persons (doctors, nurses and teachers)
 have difficulty obtaining such permits.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Cape Verde is a single party state ruled by a party of
 approximately 3,500 members. As a practical matter, some 30
 persons provide the leadership of the party and make decisions-
 which become law, decree or procedure for the country. Though
 opposition groups do exist, they are officially outlawed and
 must operate clandestinely.
 The government is sensitive to criticism, but recently some
 minor complaints have been cleared for publication in the
 state controlled press. A political police exists and
 appears to have around 300 members. Though one need not
 be a member of the PAIGC to hold elected or appointed
 office, party members are given preference over non-party
 members. Suffrage is universal. The National Assembly
 meets infrequently and has little real power.
 By law women have the same political, social and economic
 rights and privileges as men. The number of.women in posi-
 tions of responsibility in the government increased during
 1979, and the party-directed Women's Mass Organization began
 to take a definite shape. A survey of scholarship winners
 indicates that in 1979 at least half of those going abroad
 
 
 36
 for higher education were women. The government has a
 program of birth control and permits abortions, despite the
 active opposition of the Catholic church.
 Unemployment and underemployment are serious problems in Cape
 Verde, and government investment projects, including the
 Emergency Program, are the largest single employers. These
 conditions have not favored the growth of an organized lanor
 movement.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Department of State is aware of no requests for outside
 investigation of human rights conditions.
