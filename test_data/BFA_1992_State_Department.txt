 BURKINA FASO
 In 1992 Burkina Faso completed the carefully controlled process of government
 restructuring and- reform initiated by President Blaise Compaore in 1990.
 Multiparty legislative elections were held on Ma 24 1992, resulting in a landslide
 victory for President Compaore's Organization for  pular Democracy (ODP/MT).
 Four weeks later, the first Government of Burkina Faso's Fourth Republic was in-
 stalled. Opposition parties charged that widespread fraud rendered the May legisla-
 tive balloting meaningless. Independent observers agreed that abuses had occurred
 but were reluctant to ascribe the ODP/MT victory solely to these irrgularities.
 The multiparty elections represented a return to political dialog aer an extended
 period of confrontation between the Government and opposition parties. The opposi-
 tion had, refused to participate in December 1991 presidential elections following
 Compaore's refusal to convoke a sovereign national conference. Only an estimated
 25 percent of those registered voted in that balloting, thus denying Compaore the
 mandate he sought. In the aftermath of the vote, one opposition activist was killed
 and another wounded in separate attacks, for which many Burkinabe held the Gov-
 ernment responsible. Compaore then convoked a national "forum of reconciliation"
 as a substitute for a national conference. The National Forum failed when
 progovernment forces refused to go along with opposition calls for live broadcast of
 its proceedings. Thereafter, Compaore succeeded in splitting the opposition coalition,
 enticing some parts of it into his third transition Government. The remainder of the
 opposition thus felt compelled to participate in the legislative campaign rather than
 be marinalized.
 Burkina Faso's security apparatus consists of the armed forces and the para-
 military gendarmerie (controlled by the Ministry of Defense) and the police (con.
 trolled by the Ministry of Territorial Administration). Total military expenditures
 for 1989, the last year for which the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
 conducted a detailed analysis, were roughly estimated to be between $52 million
 and $58 million. The Government is discussing, but has not yet implemented, mili-
 tary spendin cuts. Although the human rights situation improved, elements of the
 security services used for police duties were responsible for abuses, including mis-
 treatment of detainees, in 1992.
 Burkina Faso is overwhelmingly dependent on subsistence agriculture which, in
 turn, is highly vulnerable to naiall variations. Frequent drought, a weak commu-
 nications and trans prtation infrastructure, and a low literacy rate are all long-
 standing problems. Per capita income is approximately $300 per year. In 1992 the
 Government continued implementation of the 3-year structural adjustment program
 agreed on with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (MF) in
 1991. The program aims to limit government spending, open the economy to free-
 market forces, promote the private sector, and attract foreign investment.
 Although the transition rom Compaore's Popular Front to the Fourth Republic
 brought improvements, human rights remained circumscribed in 1992. There were
 no political prisoners, and the Government generally tolerated the country's often
 critical independent press. However, human rights problems included police torture
 and other abuses o detainees (generally committed with impunity), weakness in
 laws concerning arbitrary detention and fair trials (especially in security cases), and
 continuing questions about citizens' ability to change their government peacefully
 and democratically. Discrimination and violence against women, particularly in
 rural areas, remain problems, but the Government has implemented a vigorous edu-
 cation effort to discourage both violence against women and the practice of female
 genital mutilation.
 RESPECT FOR HU!4AN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-In addition to the assassination of
 Clement Ouedraogo and the attempt on the-life of Moctar Tall in December 1991,
 two other apparent, but unconfire d, extrajudicial killings remained unresolved.
 Professor Gifllaume Sessouma, detained in December 1989 for allegedly participat
 ing in a coup plot, and medical student Dabo Boukary, detained following student
 demonstrations in May 1990, disappeared while in detention. Credible reports indi-
 
 
 cated that both were tortured and killed by elements of the security services after
 being taken into custody. The Burkinabe Movement for the Rights of Man and Peo-
 ples (MBDHIP) continued to press the Government to account for both disappear.
 ances, but the Government neither conceded that the deaths occurred nor punished
 those responsible. A government-directed inquiry into the Ouedraogo assassination
 yielded no tangible r'sults.
 There were recurrent and credible reports of extrajudicial killings by security
 forces of suspected criminals throughout Burkina Faso. The MBDI-P investigated
 the allegations and pressed the Government to respect the rights of those accused
 of criminal activity.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported disappearances other than those of
 Guillaume Sessouma and Dabo Boukary (see Section L.a.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 While legally prohibited, torture and mistreatment of detainees have been docu-
 mented or a number of years in Burkina Faso. No known disciplinary action has
 been taken against those resp nsible. The most recent manifestation of the problem
 occurred in Bobo-Dioulasso whiere those taken into custody following an election day
 riot in December 1991 were tortured by paramilitary forces before being turned over
 to the police. After Burkina's two local human rights groups (see Section 4) pro-
 tested these actions, those detained were released, and no further allegations of mis-
 treatment were made. The Government did take steps to punish military recruits
 who went on a rampage in Fada N'Gourma in June, injuring 83 people. The incident
 followed a period of tension between town residents and soldiers at a local military
 camp. Thirty-two soldiers were sentenced by a civilian tribunal to varying prison
 terms, and the Government assumed civil liability for property destroyed and looted.
 Those detained for suspected criminal activity were beaten and tortured to obtain
 confessions. There were reports that some detainees suffocated in cramped holding
 cells.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Since the June 1991 adoption of the Con-
 stitution, which guarantees the right to expeditious arraignment and access to legal
 counsel, there have been no known cases of prolonged arbitrary arrest or detention.
 The law permits detention for investigative purposes without charge for a maximum
 of 72 hours, renewable for a single 72-hour period. Historically, however, these limi-
 tations are rarely observed, particularly in sensitive cases. The military code takes
 precedence over the civil code in national security cases.
 Prior to the adoption of the Constitution, the Compaore regime held a large num-
 ber of its opponents in custody, but there were no known political prisoners in
 Burkina Faso in 1992.
 Although some intellectuals, military officers, and former government officials re-
 main in self-imposed exile abroad, a number have repatriated themselves since the
 beginning of the country's reform process. None did so in 1992, however.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides the right to public trial,
 access to counsel, and appeal. These rights are respected in the normal court system
 but do not exist in the People's Revolutionary Courts (TPR's), the politicized tribu-
 nals established following the 1983 revolution to judge former government officials
 on corruption and other charges. The TPR's were inactive after the Constitution's
 promulgation in 1991 but were not officially abolished.
 In 1991 the Government restored the civil rights of those convicted of political of-
 fenses. The July general amnesty, however, pardoned only those convicted of politi-
 cal crimes, not those convicted by the TPRs of other offenses. Those convictions
 could be appealed through a separate process. In 1992 the Government also contin-
 ued the admnistrative and financial rehabilitation of those dismissed from the civil
 service for political reasons from 1960 to 1991.
 Military courts exercise jurisdiction in security and political cases and are con-
 vened on an ad hoc basis. They are subject to flexible procedures and executive in-
 fluence but apparently were not active in 1992.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.--Govern-
 ment authorities generally do not interfere in the daily lives of ordinary citizens,
 but monitoring of private correspondence or telephones does occur in suspected na-
 tional security cases. According to the law, homes may be searched only under the
 authority of a warrant issued by the Minister of Justice. In national security cases,
 however, a special law permits surveillance, searches, and monitoring of telephones
 and correspondence without a warrant. Vestiges of President Compaore's old Popu-
 lar Front Government and its infrastructure continued to play an active role on the
 local scene in 1992, although usually under new names. In some cases, local prefects
 appointed former Revolutionary Committee members as administrative delegates in
 local villages. These organizations continued to exercise an intimidating role in local
 communities.
 
 
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.--Freedom of speech and the press are guaran-
 teed by the 1991 Constitution and the 1990 Information Code. Scattered attempts
 at intimidation occurred, most notably targeting La Clef, a paper published and
 edited by civil servants in their spare time. The paper's editor, also an employee
 of a government paper, was reassigned to a remote provincial capital, and the pub-
 lisher was told to choose between the paper and his civil service position. Generally,
 the Government tolerated the often critical reporting of the country's private press.
 All papers practiced some degree of self-censorship.
 The Information Code of 1990 established the right of private publication, but
 legal observers found other aspects of the Code defective. It imposes extensive re-
 strictions on journalists which, if fully enforced, would make publication of any in-
 formation on controversial subjects legally punishable. The Code also forbids and es-
 tablishes penalties for. the publication of details about crimes and civil suits; the
 diffusion of erroneous or tendentious information about the State and its laws, pub-
 lic order, state security, the Head of State or Head of Government; and attacks on
 good morals. These Code provisions were enforced in only one case-when a former
 minister brought suit for defamation against a weekly paper. A minimal fine was
 levied in that case. In March 1992, the preparatory committee of the National
 Forum, which Compaore had asked to review the Code, proposed extensive modifica-
 tions to guarantee freedom of the press more effectively. However, these rec-
 ommendations had not been adopted by the National Assembly by year's end.
 Burkina Faso's independent press includes eight regularly published newspapers
 and a weekly newsmagazine. Two of the papers were published in the country's eco-
 nomic capital, Bobo-Dioulasso. L'Observateur Paalga, one of the new independent
 papers, established itself as the nation's most respected and popular daily. The
 same pattern was true with Radio Horizon, which dominated the market despite es-
 tablishment of a government FM music station. Although official media outlets, in-
 cluding the daily newspaper Sidwaya and national radio, displayed a lingering
 progovernment bias, the presence of independent competition ledthe official media
 to give more coverage to the political opposition.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines entered the country freely. Foreign journalists
 traveled freely, filed stories without censorship, and enjoyed access to government
 officials. There was no interference with international radio broadcasts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Since early 1990 political par-
 ties have been permitted to organize and hold meetings. Parties can hold rallies and
 meetings without seeking government permission, but political marches remained
 banned in accordance with a presidential decree issued following violent incidents
 in late 1991. In contrast to the atmosphere in the 1991 presidential campaign, there
 was little apparent intimidation of opposition parties in the period leading up to the
 May legislative elections. Police did break up a student march called to press finan-
 cial demands and for an inquiry into the disappearance of Dabo Boukary. The Gov-
 ernment denied the Sankarist Front permission to organize either a meeting or a
 march to commemorate the anniversary of the late President Thomas Sankara's as-
 sassination in the coup that brought President Compaore to power. Sankara's fol-
 lowers defied the ban, and the Government took no action to stop the ceremonies.
 More than 50 political parties existed in Burkina Faso at the end of 1992; over half
 competed in the legislative elections.
 There are nonpolitical associations for business, religious, cultural, and other pur-
 poses. They experience no difficulty obtaining permission to meet or associate with
 international associations in their fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Burkina Faso is a secular state where Islam and Chris-
 tianity exist side by side, with about 40 percent of the population Muslim and about
 15 percent Christian. The remainder of the population practices traditional African
 religions. Muslim and Christian holidays are recognized as national holidays. Social
 mobility and access to modern sector jobs are neither linked to, nor restricted by,
 religious affiliation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Travelers within Burkina Faso are routinely stopped for identity checks
 at police and military checkpoints. There is little restriction on foreign travel for
 business and tourism. Exit permits are no longer required. Refugees are accepted
 freely in Burkina Faso, and attempts are made to provide for their care in coopera-
 tion with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. At the end of 1992,
 there were approximately 5,000 refugees and displaced persons in Burkina Faso,
 mainly Tuareg refugees from Mali.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Burkinabe citizens were able to participate in multiparty elections for the first
 time in 14 years, but they still had not demonstrated the right and ability to peace-
 fully transfer power to a democratically elected opposition. The opposition boycotted
 the December 1991 presidential vote following President Compaore's refusal to con-
 vene a sovereign national conference, but 27 parties participated in May 1992 legis-
 lative balloting. In the vote, the President's ODP/MT profited from larger financial
 resources, control of the Burkinabe administration, and opposition disunity to win
 78 of 107 seats in the National Assembly. The opposition protested numerous irreg-
 ularities in the conduct of the vote most notably the revision of electoral lists. Many
 of those who boycotted the December presidential vote were removed from the elec-
 toral rolls before May 1992. Independent observers agreed that there were many
 problems but believed the ODP/MT would have taken the largest number of seats
 in any case. The Supreme Court's decree promulgating the results of the legislative
 elections noted numerous "irregularities" in the conduct of the vote but did not over-
 turn any results.___
 With the election and subsequent installation of the first Government of the
 Fourth Republic, Burkina Faso completed its carefully controlled transition from
 Compaor's military regime to civilian rule. Power remained in the hands of Presi-
 dent Compaor and his political party' the ODP/MT, but within a new framework.
 That structure includes a strong presidency, a prime minister and council of min-
 isters, a two-chamber national assembly, and an independent judiciary. The dis-
 puted but overwhelming victory of President Compaore's ODP/MT and its allies left
 the Government with a majority sufficient to amend the Constitution, thus neutral-
 izing the  stem's theoretical checks and balances. The imbalance, coupled with the
 absence of a unified and effective opposition, prompted fears for the future of
 Burkina Faso's constitutional experiment.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government is rarely responsive to investigations by international non-
 governmental organizations, and its response to demarches by local human rights
 groups has been mixed. The Government has continued to tolerate the activities of
 the Burkinabe Movement for the Rights of Man and Peoples (MBDHP), and, after
 protests by the MBDHP and another local human rights group, it released opposi-
 tion supporters detained following election-day riots in December 1991 in Bobo-
 Dioulasso. However it studiously ignored MBD-P demands to account for the
 deaths of Boukary Dabo and Gullaume Sessouma. The MBDHP is an independent
 group, composed mostly of professionals and led by the president of the administra-
 tive chamber of the Supreme Court. The MBDHP took the lead in the creation of
 a new Inter-African Human Rights Union (UIDH). The Government and state media
 were well represented when human rights groups from 18 countries met in
 Ouagadougou in Jul to found the UIDH.
 Although most MBDHP members have not been targeted for reprisal, the group's
 president, Alidou Ouedraogo was replaced as head of the administrative chamber
 of the Supreme Court and named to a new post as counselor to the court in late
 1992. Another magistrate member of the MBDHP was also reassigned. The Govern-
 ment made no public statement about the moves, which were part of a larger per-
 sonnel realignment in the justice system, but some observers interpreted the action
 as the result of government disapproval of Ouedraogo's high-profile human rights
 activities.
 In April 1991, a second human rights organization, the Association for the Pro-
 motion of a State of Law and Liberty (APED/L) was founded by a group of lawyers
 and professionals. Claiming to defend the "everyday" rights of man, APED/L subtly
 criticized the MBDHP's antigovernment stance. The association's close relations
 with the Government and official media suggested that it was established to coun-
 teract the MBDHP's human rights activities. In early 1992, however, the association
 was buffeted by a wave of resignations and thereafter was relatively inactive.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic origin is illegal under the
 1991 Constitution. In practice, such discrimination does not occur on a large scale.
 Minority ethnic groups are as likely to be represented in the inner circles of the
 Government as are the majority Mossi, and government decisions do not favor one
 group over another. In the largely rural society of Burkina Faso, women continue
 to occupy a subordinate position and face discrimination in such areas as education
 jobs, property, and family rights. In the modern sector, however, women are well
 
 
 represented, making up one-fourth of the government work force, although usually
 in lower paying positions. Women constitute approximately one-third of the total
 student population in the primary, secondary, and higher educational systems.
 Schools in rural areas have disproportionately fewer female students than schools
 in urban areas.
 Violence against women, especially wife beating, occurs fairly frequently in rural
 areas, less often in cities. The Government is attempting to educate people on the
 subject through the media. Such cases are sometimes mediated by a "popular concil-
 iation tribunal" composed of community representatives.
 The Government has made a particularly strong commitment to eradicating fe-
 male genital mutilation through widespread educational efforts. Female circumci-
 sion still occurs in many rural areas, although it is becoming less common in urban
 centers. According to an independent expert in the field, the percentage of
 Burkinabe women who have undergone this procedure may be as high as 70 per-
 cent. Another form of mutilation, scarification of the faces of both boys and girls of
 certain ethnic groups, is gradually disappearing.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers, including civil servants, traditionally have
 enjoyed a legal right to association which is recognized in the Fourth Republic's
 Constitution. There are a large number of trade unions and five trade union federa-
 tions. Although unions are independent of the Government, in the past the Govern-
 ment has limited their freedom of action to ensure compliance with government
 labor policy. Once the most powerful political force in the country, organized labor-
 approximately 60,000 nonagricultural workers-lost much of its influence under the
 Sankara and Compaore military regimes. The five trade union federations did par-
 ticipate in the drafting of the 1991 Constitution.
 The new Constitution also guarantees organized labor the right to strike in ac-
 cordance with existing laws. Labor unrest has increased as the country has em-
 barked on an austerity economic adjustment program. A number of unions staged
 warning and other strikes in 1992. Labor unions freely affiliate with international
 trade union bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to bar-
 gain for wages and other benefits, both directly with employers and with industry
 associations. These negotiations are governed by minimums on wages and other
 benefits contained in the interprfessional collective convention and the commercial
 sector collective convention. If no agreement is reached, employees may exercise
 their right to strike. Either labor or management also may refer an impasse in nego-
 tiations to the Government for consideration at the level of the labor tribunals. Ap-
 peals may be pursued through the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, a decision
 of which is binding on both parties. Collective bargaining is extensive in the modern
 sector, which encompasses only a small percentage of the population. The Labor
 Code prohibits antiunion discrimination; complaints about such discrimination are
 handled by Labor Ministry inspectors and may be appealed to a tribunal in the Min-
 istry. Union officials believe that this system functions adequately.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code, which was under
 revision at year's end, sets the minimum age for employment at 14, the average age
 for completion of basic secondary school. However, the Ministry of Employment,
 Labor, and Social Security, which oversees labor standards, lacks the means to en-
 force this provision adequately, even in the small wage sector. Most children actu-
 ally begin work at an earlier age on small, family subsistence farms and in the tra-
 ditional apprenticeship system and informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code mandates a minimum monthly
 wage, a standard workweek of 40 hours with at least one 24-hour rest period, and
 establishes safety and health provisions. The current minimum wage rate, which
 does not apply to the large subsistence agriculture sector, was last set by the Gov-
 ernment in 1983 and is not adequate for an urban worker to support a family. Wage
 earners usually supplement their income through reliance on the extended family
 and subsistence agriculture. A system of government inspections under the Ministry
 of Labor and labor courts ensures that health and safety standards are applied in
 the small industrial and commercial sectors, but they are not applicable in the sub-
 sistence agriculture sector, which employs more than 85 percent of the population.
