 BHUTAN*
 The Wangchuck dynasty of hereditary monarchs has ruled Bhutan
 since 1907. Isolated in the Himalayas between India and '
 Tibet, the small Kingdom (about the combined size of Vermont
 and New Hampshire, with a current population of about 1.3
 million) has been able to escape domination by any external
 power since the 10th century. It was not until the rule of
 King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck (1952-72) that a Bhutanese ruler
 took steps to move the Kingdom from centuries of medieval
 seclusion toward a more representative political system and a
 better integrated, more productive economy. Although he
 retained strong executive powers, the King created several
 important institutions, including the National Assembly
 (1953), the Royal Advisory Council (1965), and the Council of
 Ministers (1968), to provide broader participation in the
 government. Serfdom was abolished, land reform introduced,
 laws codified and the judiciary separated from the executive.
 There is no written constitution or bill of rights. The
 present monarch, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, has continued
 Bhutan's social and political evolution, although progress has
 been seriously handicapped by the Kingdom's limited
 administrative capacity and resources.
 Internal security is maintained by the Royal Bhutan Police.
 It is assisted in this function by the Royal Bhutan Army,
 which consists of 8,000 lightly armed men.
 Bhutan remains, at least in terms of national income
 statistics, the poorest country in South Asia and one of the
 most traditional and least developed countries in the world.
 The vast majority of the population is illiterate and rural,
 living on subsistence agriculture and pastoral pursuits in a
 largely bar-ter economy. Bhutan continues to restrict access
 by the outside world in the hope of minimizing the spread of
 foreign influences. The number of tourists is strictly
 limited to 3,000 a year. In 1988 the Bhutanese also closed
 Buddhist monasteries to tourism to maintain the "religious
 purity" of those shrines.
 Knowledgeable Bhutanese report no major violations of human
 rights in the Kingdom in 1988. Although the Bhutanese
 Government is still essentially autocratic, most observers
 agree that the Kingdom suffers few of the problems of
 disaffection and repression that afflict many third world
 countries undergoing more rapid change.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known political killings.
 *Bhutan and the United States have not exchanged diplomatic
 representatives, and U.S. officials travel there
 infrequently. Since few scholars have published studies on
 the contemporary Bhutanese polity or society, information on
 Bhutanese practices which bear on human rights is neither
 readily available nor complete.

 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There was no evidence of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment. Serious crimes are still rare, although
 reportedly there has been a trend toward more criminal activity
 in recent years with the growth of a foreign labor force in
 the country, widening economic disparities, and greater contact
 with foreign cultural values. Mutilation was outlawed in 1965.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no special or preventive detention, and arrests can
 be made only under legal authority. As far as is known, exile
 is not employed as a form of punishment.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Criminal cases and a variety of civil matters are adjudicated
 under an 18th century legal code which was revised in 1957 and
 which applies to all Bhutanese. Familial questions are
 resolved according to the traditional religious norms of the
 two major religious groups in the country: Buddhist law
 governs the majority of Bhutanese, and Hindu law is applied in
 areas where persons of Nepali origin predominate.
 The Kingdom's legal system does not provide for juries, the
 right to be represented by legal counsel, or due process in
 the Western sense. However, trials are public and are usually
 carried out expeditiously. There are generally no prosecuting
 or defense attorneys because the number of lawyers in the
 country is insufficient to serve in these capacities. Judges,
 appointed by and accountable to the King, are responsible for
 all aspects of a case, including investigation, filing of
 charges, prosecution, and judgment of the defendant. A
 separate judiciary was established in 1968 which provides for
 local, district, and-national courts with original and
 appellate jurisdiction. Final appeals may be made to the King.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There are no written guarantees of privacy, but tradition has
 bolstered the concept. In practice, the Government does not
 intervene arbitrarily or unreasonably in the lives of the
 people.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 With an adult literacy rate of around 12 percent, Bhutan's
 adult population is relatively unaffected by the print media.
 The Government's weekly newspaper is the country's only
 regular publication. Indian and other foreign newspapers and
 publications are distributed without apparent government
 control. Bhutan has no television, and the one radio station
 broadcasts for only 3 hours daily. Criticism of the King is
 
 
 1307
 BHUTAN
 permitted in the National Assembly, but not in the public
 media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 While no written guarantees of these freedoms exist, Bhutanese
 generally enjoy the freedom of peaceful assembly and
 association. There are no private voluntary social, communal
 or economic associations and no professional or trade
 organizations. For a discussion of freedom of association as
 it applies to labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Buddhism is the state religion of Bhutan. The Government
 subsidizes monasteries and shrines and provides aid to about
 half of the Kingdom's 12,000 monks. The monastic establishment
 enjoys statutory representation in the National Assembly and
 the Royal Advisory Council and is an influential voice on
 public policy. Citizens of other faiths, who are mainly
 Hindus of Nepali origin, enjoy freedom of worship. In an
 effort to encourage national cultural integration, the King
 has declared major Hindu festivals to be national holidays,
 and the royal family participates in them. Foreign
 missionaries are not permitted to proselytize in the Kingdom.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Bhutan for all Bhutanese
 citizens and no bar on emigration or foreign travel. Fox many
 years, Bhutanese traveled little inside or outside the
 Kingdom, but. the recent rapid construction of roads and the
 establishment of air links with Calcutta and Dhaka have
 encouraged travel. A policy introduced in the 1950's, which
 prohibited the exiled leaders of an outlawed Nepali-Bhutanese
 political party from returning to the country, has been
 liberalized to allow them to return.
 Bhutan traditionally has welcomed refugees and exiles from
 other countries in the region. Some 6,000 Tibetans sought
 refuge in Bhutan in 1959, joining approximately 4,000 Tibetans
 already in the country. Because it perceived threats to its
 national security from the Tibetan refugees' suspected lack of
 allegiance to Bhutan, the Government required in 1979-80 that
 they either accept Bhutanese citizenship or face expulsion.
 Although most Tibetans in Bhutan have accepted Bhutanese
 citizenship, they have been assured by the Government that
 they will be free to return to their homeland. The Government
 decided not to carry out its threat to deport those who did
 not apply fox Bhutanese citizenship.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The citizens of Bhutan to not have the right to change their
 government. Bhutan is a traditional monarchy, with sovereign
 power vested in the King. It is a highly elitist polity, with
 decisionmaking centered in the palace and involving only a
 small number of officials in the civil and religious
 establishments. Although the present King and his father have
 endeavored to integrate women and southerners (Nepali ethnics)
 into the body politic, the system is still dominated by the
 male members of an aristocracy of Tibetan, Buddhist stock.
 
 
 1308
 BHUTAN
 Political parties do not exist, and their formation is
 discouraged. Local administration is carried out by centrally
 appointed government officials. Villages, however, have the
 traditional right to elect by consensus their own headmen, who
 form the lowest rung of the administrative hierarchy. When
 the King is touring outlying districts of the Kingdom (which
 he does frequently), any citizen can flag down his car and
 present an aide with a written petition, which is assured an
 official response.
 The 150-member National Assembly is composed of 105 members
 elected by limited franchise (heads of family in Hindu areas,
 village headmen in Buddhist regions), 12 elected by the
 monastic establishment, and 33 high-level officials of the
 government administration appointed by the King. Its
 principal functions are to enact laws, approve senior
 appointments in the Government, and advise the King on matters
 of national importance. It also provides a forum for
 presenting grievances and rectifying cases of
 maladministration. Voting is by secret ballot, with a simple
 majority needed to pass a measure.
 Government officials may be questioned by the body, and
 ministers can be forced to resign by a two-thirds vote of
 no-confidence. The King cannot formally veto legislation
 passed by the Assembly, but he can refer bills back to it for
 further consideration. The Assembly occasionally has rejected
 the King's recommendations or delayed their implementation,
 but the King has always had enough influence to persuade the
 Assembly to approve any legislation he considers essential or
 to withdraw any proposed legislation he opposes.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No international agency or group is known to have sought entry
 into Bhutan to investigate human rights conditions. No
 nongovernmental human rights groups are known to exist in
 Bhutan, nor do human rights appear to be a subject of domestic
 political debate.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The status of women is higher in Bhutan than in many of the
 surrounding countries. In contrast with some of its
 neighbors, Bhutan has not developed either a rigid caste
 system or customs which sequester or disenfranchise women.
 Boys tend to outnumber girls by about two to one in primary
 school, but family land is divided equally between sons and
 daughters.
 The sexes mix relatively freely, marriages can be arranged by
 partners themselves as well as by their parents, and divorce
 is common. A man is allowed by law to have three wives, but
 polyandry is not sanctioned. Legislation has been enacted in
 recent years making marriage registration compulsory and
 favoring women in matters of alimony. In 1985 some 10 percent
 of the persons employed by'the various government ministries
 and departments were women.
 The potentially most divisive issue in Bhutan is how to
 accommodate the large (estimated at 20-30 percent) segment of
 the population of Nepali Hindu origin. The country's Buddhist
 
 
 1309
 BHUTAN
 majority has long been concerned about being outnumbered by
 immigrants from Nepal, as occurred in neighboring Sikkim. In
 the past, the Government responded to this concern by tightly
 limiting immigration and restricting residence and employment
 of the Nepali population to the southern part of the country.
 More recently, the Government has liberalized its policy
 toward the Nepali minority. The Government now encourages
 intermarriage, educates some students in regions other than
 their own, and gives higher priority to economic development
 of the south.. By law, southerners may own land and establish
 business in the north and vice versa, but reportedly it is
 sometimes still difficult for non-Buddhist Bhutanese (except
 government officials) to buy property in Buddhist areas.
 More and more young Bhutanese of Nepali origin are entering
 public economic and administrative bodies, and laws concerning
 land tenure and taxation in the south are being liberalized.
 Although the language of instruction is English, there is a
 requirement that Dzongkha, the language of the western
 highlands, be taught in all schools, and this requirement is
 said to disadvantage students from other areas. In general,
 however, the Government appears to be sensitive to the
 problems of national integration and is attempting to
 eliminate the factors which, in the past, led some Nepali
 Bhutanese to describe themselves as second-class citizens.
 Families with ties to the palace and senior levels of the
 Government are strongly favored in their access to state
 scholarships for foreign education. Nevertheless, the King is
 making a serious effort to draw qualified persons from a
 broader range of social and ethnic backgrounds into the
 prestigious civil bureaucracy.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Bhutan has no labor unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no collective bargaining, and no legislation
 addressing labor-related issues governing the small industrial
 work force, which makes up less that 1 percent of the
 population. Labor legislation and practice is uniform
 throughout Bhutan.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 As far as is known, there is no forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There are no laws governing the employment of children.
 Hdwever, children are not employed in industrial labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The shortage of labor in Bhutan is such that the larger
 industrial firms, all of which were established relatively
 recently, are organized along modern lines and incorporate a
 considerable amount of labor-saving technology. No industrial
 plant employs more than 60-70 workers, and most of these are
 guest workers from Nepal. Apart from a few larger plants, the
 entire industrial sector consists of home-based handicrafts
 
 
 1310
 BHUTAN
 and some 60 privately owned small or medium-scale factories
 producing consumer goods.
