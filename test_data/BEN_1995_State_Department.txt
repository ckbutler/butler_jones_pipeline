 BENIN
 The Republic of Benin is a constitutional democracy headed by President
 Nicephore Soglo. The Government respects the constitutional provisions for an inde-
 pendent judiciary in practice, including the Constitutional Court's ruling upholding
 the National Assembly's establishment of a new autonomous National Electral
 Commission (CENA). Elections held in March for the National Assembly were gen-
 erally free and fair and open to international observers. There were, however, a few
 instances of government interference with opposition political campaigning, and the
 Constitutional Court annulled the results in 2 of the 18 electoral districts, resulting
 in a special round of elections in May for these 2 districts. There are 18 political
 parties represented in the new National Assembly whose membership was increased
 from 64 to 83 by a new electoral law. No party or grouping commands a majority
 of seats.
 The civilian-controlled security forces consist of the armed forces under the direc-
 tion of the Minister of Defense and the police force under the Minister of Interior.
 The two Ministers also share authority over the gendarmerie, which exercises police
 functions in rural areas. The military continued to play an apolitical role in govern-
 ment affairs, but there were some concerns about morale within its ranks, its ethnic
 imbalance, and the depth of its commitment to constitutional rule.
 Benin is a poor country with an annual per capita Gross National Product of ap-
 proximately $400. The economy is largely characterized by subsistence agriculture
 in rural areas and informal services in urban areas. Approximately 70 percent of
 the population is engaged in farming, fishing, forestry, and livestock raising. The
 leading exports are cotton and crude oil from small-scale offshore oil production. The
 Government continued implementing an austere economic policy to privatize state-
 owned enterprises, eliminate price controls, increase exports, and reduce fiscal ex-
 Fenditures. Its policy is aimed at setting the foundation for a market economy and
 ostering growth in the private sector. Foreign aid is an important source of national
 income.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens as provided
 for in the 1990 Constitution. The major human rights problems continued to be the
 failure by police forces to curtail acts of vigilantism and mob justice; serious admin-
 istrative delays in processing criminal cases with attendant denial of timely fair
 trials; harsh and unhealthy prison conditions; societal discrimination and violence
 against women, and some abuse of children.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings. However, a rising crime rate and a lack of police respon-
 siveness led to more reports of mob justice. There was an increase in citizen groups
 killing or inflicting severe injuries on suspected criminals, particularly thieves
 caught in the act. Although a number of these incidents took place in urban areas,
 there were no indications that the Government investigated or prosecuted anyone
 involved.
 The government investigation into the killing of seven nomadic children in the in-
 terior in 1994 is apparently closed and did not result in any prosecutions.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and there were no confirmed reports that
 government forces employed them. The Government continued to make payments to
 victims of torture under the previous military regime which ruled from 1972 to
 1989.
 Prison conditions continue to be harsh. Extensive overcrowding and lack of proper
 sanitation and medical facilities pose a risk to prisoner's health. The prison diet is
 grossly inadequate, and malnutrition and disease are common among prisoners.
 Prisoners are allowed to meet with visitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government generally observes this prohibition.
 The Constitution prohibits detention of persons for more than 48 hours without a
 hearing before a magistrate, whose order is required for continued detention. How-
 ever, there were credible reports that authorities exceed this 48-hour limit in many
 cases, sometimes by as long as a week, using the accepted practice of holding a  r-
 son without specified timelimit "at the disposition of" the public prosecutor's oce
 before presenting the case to a magistrate. There were no reports of incommunicado
 detention. Approximately 75 percent of prisoners are pretrial detainees. Arbitrary
 arrest is not routine but does occur occasionally.
 The Constitution prohibits forced exile of its citizens, and many who went into
 exile under previous governments have returned.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary and the right to a fair public trial, and the Government generally respects
 these provisions m practice. Judges are answerable only to the law in carrying out
 their duties. However, the executive has important powers in respect of the judici-
 ary. The President ap]points career magistrates as judges in civil courts, and the
 Constitution gives the Ministry of Justice administrative authority over judges, in-
 cluding the power to transfer them.
 A civilian court system operates on the national and provincial levels. Military
 disciplinary councils deal with minor offenses by military members. The Supreme
 Court is the court of last resort in all administrative and judicial matters. The Con-
 stitutional Court is charged with passing on the constitutionality of laws and de-
 cides disputes between the President and the National Assembly. Its rulings against
 both the executive and legislative branches of government indicated its independ-
 ence from these two branches of government. The Constitution also provides for a
 High Court of Justice to convene in the event of crimes committed by the President
 or government ministers against the State.
 The legal system is based on French civil law and local customary law. A defend-
 ant enjoys the presumption of innocence and has the right to be present at trial,
 to have an attorney-at public expense if necessary-to confront or question wit-
 nesses, and to have access to government-held evidence.
 Despite constitutional safeguards, defendants do not always receive timely trial.
 Inadequate facilities and overcrowded dockets result in slow administration of jus-
 tice. The relatively low salaries of magistrates and clerks have a demoralizing effect
 on their commitment to efficient and timely justice and make them susceptible to
 corruption.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, and government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent and active private press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning demo-
 
 
 10
 cratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, includ-
 ing academic freedom. Nevertheless, the Government continued to own and operate
 the local radio and television stations and a daily newspaper, the media most influ-
 ential in reaching the public.
 There is no government censorship of the media, books, or art. The High Author-
 ity for Audio-Visual and Communications (HAAC), a new constitutionally mandated
 body, requires broadcasters to submit weekly lists of planned progms and requires
 publishers to deposit copies of all publications with them. The 1AAC solicited bids
 from private operators to develop private radio stations but at year's end had not
 approved any licenses. Journalists criticized the HAAC's published criteria for
 awarding licenses.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of peaceful assembly and association, and the Government generally re-
 spected these rights in practice. The Government requires permits for use of public
 paces for demonstrations and requires associations to register. Although it routinely
 grants both permits and registrations, the Government in some instances interfered
 with activities of political candidates during the campaign for legislative elections.
 For example, the Government seized the vehicles of an opposition party during the
 campaign period. It also broke up a political rally held by another opposition figure.
 The Constitutional Court has consistently and effectively ruled against government
 interference with the freedom of assembly and association.
 The Government did not take any actions against nonregistered organizations for
 failure or refusal to register.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. The presence of police, gendarmerie, and illegal roadblocks,
 however, ipedes domestic movement. Though ostensibly meant to enforce auto-
 motive safety and customs regulations, many of these checkpoints serve as a means
 for officials to exact bribes from travelers.
 The Government announced a more restrictive policy toward transhumance and
 attempted to enforce it against nomadic herders at more strictly designated entry
 points. Previous policy allowed migratory Fulani herdsman from other countries to
 enter freely. Friction between native farmers and foreign herders occasionally leads
 to violence.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no re-
 ports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status. At the end
 of 1995, there were less than 40,000 refugees in Benin, mainly from Togo, compared
 to about 60,000 at the beginning of 1995.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right peacefully to change their gov-
 ernment. Citizens exercised this right by secret ballot on the basis of universal suf-
 frage in free and fair elections in 1991 and legislative elections in 1995. A new law,
 upheld by the Constitutional Court in 1995, created an independent National Elec-
 toral Commission (CENA) which effectively improved the fairness and transparency
 of the voting process.
 There were a few instances of government interference with these political rights
 during the legislative campaign (see Section 2.b.), and a lack of coordination be-
 tween the Government and CENA resulted in administrative deficiencies at some
 polling stations, e.g., some voting stations ran out of ballots. The Constitutional
 Court proclaimed the winners only after judging whether the irregularities were so
 widespread as to warrant a new election. In two of the electoral districts, including
 the Cotonou district, the Court annulled the results and ordered new elections. This
 second round of elections was much more orderly, and the Court proclaimed the re-
 sults officially a few days after the vote.
 The Constitution provides for a 5-year term of office for the President (who is lim-
 ited to two terms) and 4-year terms for National Assembly members (who may serve
 unlimited numbers of terms).
 Thirty-one political parties fielded candidates for the legislative elections, and 18
 parties won seats. In a fluid political environment, three major political groupings
 have formed in the National Assembly, but none has a majority. Presidential elec-
 tions are scheduled for 1996. The National Assembly has demonstrated its inde-
 pendence by passing laws, such as the new election laws, which have been upheld
 by the Constitutional Court against challenges by the President.
 
 
 Women participate actively in the political parties but are underrepresented in
 government positions. There are now 4 women (there were previously 2 in 1994) in
 the 20-member Cabinet. There are 6 female deputies in the 83-member National As-
 sembly. The President of the Constitutional Court is a woman, and the HAAC and
 the Economic and Social Council each have one female member. The Government
 and National Assembly appointed women to 7 of the 17 positions in the National
 Electoral Commission.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigations of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, and religion, but so-
 cietal discrimination against women continues.
 Women.-While no statistics are available, violence against women, including wife
 beating, occurs. The press sometimes reports incidents of abuse of women, but
 judges and police are reluctant to intervene in domestic disputes, considering such
 abuse a family matter.
 Although the Constitution provides for equality for women in the political, eco-
 nomic, and social spheres, women experience extensive societal discrimination, espe-
 cially in rural areas, where they occupy a subordinate role and are responsible for
 much of the hard labor on subsistence farms. In urban areas, women dominate the
 trading sector in the open-air markets. By law, women have equal inheritance and
 property  ghts, but local custom in some areas prevents them from inheriting real
 property. Women do not enjoy the same educational opportunities as men, and fe-
 male literacy is about 16 percent (male 32 percent).
 There are active women's rights groups that have been effective in drafting a fam-
 ily code which would improve the status of women under the law. The Government
 approved the draft family code, but the National Assembly had not passed it by
 yeas end.
 Children.-The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is responsible for the protec-
 tion of children's rights, primarily in the areas of education and health. In particu-
 lar, the Government is trying to boost primary school enrollment which is only
 about 66 percent. In some parts of the country, girls receive no education at all.
 There is no broad pattern of societal abuse against children, nor is there child
 prostitution. There are some traditional practices that inflict violence on children
 which the Government has been vigorous in its efforts to end, including prosecuting
 offenders. These practices include the killing of deformed babies (thought to be sor-
 cerers in some rural areas) and a tradition in which a groom abducts and rapes the
 prospective (under 14 years of age) bride. Criminal courts mete out stiff sentences
 to criminals convicted of crimes against children.
 The Government has been less successful in combating female genital mutilation
 (FGM), which is not illegal. FGM is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. In Benin it is practiced
 on females at a young age as well as on teenage girls and women up to age 30.
 Studies suggest that at least 4 percent of Beninese women are affected by this prac-
 tice, mostly in the northern provinces. Recent research by a nongovernmental orga-
 nization found that those who perform such operations, often elderly women, have
 a strong profit motive in the continued practice. The Government has cooperated
 with an inter-African committee working against the practice of FGM by making
 available locally produced posters and pamphlets at government health clinics.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the Constitution mandates that the State
 "look after the handicapped," the Government does not mandate accessibility for dis-
 abled persons. It does operate a number of social centers for disabled persons to as-
 sist their social integration. Nonetheless, many are unable to find employment and
 must resort to begging to support themselves.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Benin has a long history of regional rivalry.
 Although southerners dominate the Government's senior ranks, northerners domi-
 nate the military. The south has enjoyed more advanced economic development, a
 larger population, and has traditionally held favored status.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides workers with the freedom
 to organize, join unions, meet, and strike, and the Government usually respects
 these rights in practice. The labor force of about 2 million is primarily engaged in
 
 
 subsistence agriculture and other primary sector activities, with less than 2 percent
 of the populat*bn engaged in the modern (wage) sector. Approximately 75 percent
 of the wage ea..ers belong to labor unions. There are four union confederations, and
 unions are generally independent of government and political parties. The Economic
 and Social Council, a constitutionally mandated body installed in 1994, includes four
 union representatives. In 1995 the Constitutional Court overruled a 1994 govern-
 ment decision blocking the formation of a national student union.
 There were several instances in which labor unions threatened to go on strike,
 and there were a number of orderly sit-ins (measured in hours), but there were no
 strikes. There were no known instances of efforts by the Government to retaliate
 against union activity. Laws prohibit employer retaliation against strikers, and the
 Government enforces them effectively.
 Unions may freely form or join federations or confederations and affiliate with
 international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivey.-The Labor Code provides for
 collective bargaining, and workers freely exercised these rights. Wages in the pri-
 vate sector are set in negotiations between unions and employers. A tripartite
 group, composed of unions, employers, and the Government, discussed and agreed
 to revisions in the Labor Code, but the new code had not yet been enacted into law
 by the end of the year. The Government sets wages in the public sector by law and
 regulation.
 Re Labor Code prohibits employers from taking union membership or activity
 into account regarding hiring, work distribution, professional or vocational training,
 or dismissal. The Government levies substantial penalties against employers who
 refuse to rehire workers dismissed for lawful union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and such labor is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code prohibits the em-
 ployment or apprenticeship of children under the age of 14 in any enterprise. How-
 ever, the Ministry of Labor enforces the Code in only a limited manner (and then
 only in the modern sector), due to the lack of inspectors. Child labor continues on
 rural family farms, on construction sites in urban areas, and as domestic servants.
 Children also commonly work as street vendors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government administratively sets mini-
 mum wage scales for a number of occupations. The minimum wage is approximately
 $40 per month (CFA20,300), which is insufficient to cover the costs for food and
 housing of even a single worker living in an urban area. Many workers must supple-
 ment their wages by subsistence farming or informal sector trade. Most workers in
 the wage sector, however, earn more than the minimum wage.
 The Labor Code establishes a workweek of from 40 to 56 hours, depending on the
 type of work, and provides for at least one 24-hour rest period per week. The au-
 thorities generally enforce legal limits on workweeks. The Labor Code establishes
 health and safety standards, but the Ministry of Labor does not enforce them effec-
 tively. The Labor Code does not provide workers with the right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
 The Ministry of Labor has the authority to require employers to remedy dangerous
 work conditions but does not do so effectively.
