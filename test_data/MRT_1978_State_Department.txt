 MAURITANIA
 Mauritanian law protects the integrity of the person
 and guarantees civil and political liberties. By all
 accounts, and despite the incipient threat to public
 order posed by Polisario guerrilla activity, these laws
 are respected in practice. Although the Government was
 overthrown by a coup on July 10, 1978 there are few
 political prisoners in Mauritania. The circumstances
 surrounding the July 10 coup d'etat illustrate the
 generally high regard in Mauritania for personal
 liberties and due process. The military coup was not
 accompanied by mass arrests nor by purges of friends of
 the former Government. The former president, his
 cabinet and the former president of the National
 Assembly are under arrest, but according to informed
 sources they are being well treated. Although the
 Constitution has been abolished, the administration
 of justice continues to, be based on both the French
 Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture:
 Mauritanian law prohibits the use of torture, and there
 are no reports that it has been practiced there.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are no reports of such treatment or punishment or
 arbitrary deprivation of life.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 These practices are prohibited by law and generally do
 not occur. Following the July 10 coup d'etat, President
 Ould Daddah, his entire cabinet, the President of the
 (119)
 
 
 120
 National Assembly and a few officials close to the
 President were placed under house arrest. The non-
 political figures were released within hours. The
 former president, his cabinet and the president of the
 National Assembly are still under arrest, almost five
 months after the coup. Reportedly they are treated
 well; they are allowed to correspond with their families,
 who have been left alone. The Head of State assured
 the U.S. Ambassador that there would be no reprisals,
 that in due course all former cabinet members would be
 permitted to lead normal lives in Mauritania and that
 former President Ould Daddah would be detained only
 "until new democratic institutions are established."
 The new Government has not yet focused its attention
 on the promised reestablishment of democratic institu-
 tions. Rather, it is preoccupied with attempts to
 disengage Mauritania from the war over the Western
 Sahara and to address the country's serious financial
 problems.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair and public trials are provided and guaranteed by
 law.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The law prohibits such intrusions and is respected in
 practice.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The national goals adopted by the new Government of
 Mauritania are economic development and social welfare.
 The Mauritanian Government's economic development
 policies are designed to respond directly to the needs
 of the poor, i.e., the sedentary agricultural and
 widely dispersed nomadic peoples who make up 75
 percent of the population. The Third Economic Develop-
 ment Plan (1976-81) emphasizes growth in the rural
 sector. The Government is seeking to attain eventual
 
 
 121
 self-sufficiency in food production by emphasizing
 better cultivation techniques, rural infrastructure,
 training, and livestock programs. The Government also
 is seeking to improve health services for the rural
 poor, and some progress has been realized in improving
 the rural standard of living.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Although Islam is the official religion of Mauritania
 (99 percent of the population is Muslim and the
 formal name of the country is the Islamic Republic
 of Mauritania), freedom of conscience and the right to
 practice one's religion are taken for granted. Non-
 Moslems have experienced no difficulty exercising their
 religion in Mauritania. There is a Roman Catholic
 Bishop and several Catholic congregations. There are
 no restrictions on any religious expression or practice.
 Mauritania has one labor union, the union of Mauritanian
 workers, which works closely with the Government. The
 one daily newspaper is published by the Government and
 there is one Government radio station. This Government
 involvement in the media reflects a relative lack of
 development rather than an effort to control the media.
 International shortwave broadcasts and television
 broadcasts from nearby Dakar, Senegal are received
 without interference. Foreign newspapers, magazines,
 journals, and books circulate freely and are generally
 available to all, even when they contain information or
 commentary critical of the Government. The Government
 makes no attempt to enforce ideological conformity, and
 the average Mauritanian citizen expresses his views
 freely on national issues.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Movement is allowed freely within Mauritania, subject
 to control of travel to some areas because of the
 threat of Polisario guerrilla military activity.
 
 
 122
 Foreign travel and emigration are not restricted.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Direct citizen participation in the political process
 was suspended following the July coup. The new military
 Government abolished the one political party, the
 National Assembly and the Constitution. The country is
 now governed by an eighteen-member Military Committee
 for National Recovery (CMRN), which provides political
 guidance to the Head of State (who is also President of
 the CMRN) and to his cabinet members, some of whom also
 belong to the CMRN. There is a 22-member advisory
 group who theoretically represent a cross-section of
 Mauritanian society. The Department of State does not
 know what role, if any, this advisory group plays as a
 link between the ruling group and the rest of the
 society.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 We are not aware of any outstanding requests for
 outside investigation of human rights violations in
 Mauritania.
