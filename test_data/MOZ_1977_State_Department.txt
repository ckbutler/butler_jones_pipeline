 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambique, a former Portuguese colony which gained in-
 dependence in 1975, has embarked on a socialist course
 of national development under the guidance of its sole
 political party, FRELIMO (Front for the Liberation of
 Mozambique). Civil and political liberties have been
 considerably circumscribed. There have been few alle-
 gations of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. The
 Mozambican government is making a major effort to meet
 the basic needs of the population, but it has been serious-
 ly hindered by severe shortages of resources and personnel.
 1.   Respect for the integrity of the person including
 freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture does not appear to be practiced or countenanced.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been a few unsubstantiated allegations of
 cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Detention without trial is frequently practiced in
 Mozambique, largely for purposes of political indoctrina-
 tion. The number of persons involved appears to be con-
 siderable, but the Mozambican government has not divulged
 figures on how many it is holding at its "reeducation"
 camps.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Because of lack of experience and personnel, the opera-
 tion of the judicial system is erratic. Furthermore,
 the government's desire to reshape society to fit "social-
 ist" patterns has led to trials at variance with normal
 judicial procedures. In many instances, persons accused
 of a crime are tried and sentenced by a security official
 and have no recourse to a fair public trial. It is im-
 possible for an accused to retain private legal counsel
 since the private practice of law.has been abolished.

 e.   Invasion of the home
 The sanctity of the home is generally respected, but
 exceptions to this rule do occur in instances where offi-
 cials believe that there may be a threat to the security
 of the state.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The Government of Mozambique has been earnestly attempting
 to carry out policies to meet the basic needs of the
 population for food, health care, shelter, and education.
 It has launched ambitious programs in all these fields
 including one to Vaccinate the entire population against
 contagious diseases and another to eradicate illiteracy.
 Implementation of these programs has been uneven, mainly
 because of lack of materials and trained personnel to carry
 them out rather than because of lack of will on the part
 of the government.
 As the result of the spill-over from the war in Rhodesia,
 the severing of trade and transportation links with
 Rhodesia in line with United Nations resolutions, and
 the mass exodus of trained Portuguese at the time of
 independence, there are, at present, serious shortcomings
 in the national economy.
 Food shortages are commonplace, health care has been
 disrupted, opportunities for higher education have been
 curtailed, and, in some instances, factories have ceased
 to operate.
 Corruption diverting resources towards the elite and away
 from the poor does not appear to be a serious problem.
 When it is detected, strong action is generally taken
 against those involved.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Criticism may be voiced from within FRELIMO, the ruling
 party. However, public criticism of the nartv and its
 policies is not allowed. Persons who publicly criticize
 
 
 the government and its social policies may be subject to
 being sent for varying periods to "reeducation" centers for
 intensive political indoctrination.
 The media in Mozambique are government-controlled and
 are not accessible to those who wish to question basic
 government policies.
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the constitution,
 but there has been some repression of foreign mission-
 aries and certain proselytizing sects. Churches are no
 longer permitted to operate schools or hospitals.
 Freedom of assembly is limited by the one-party system.
 Nevertheless, independent trade unions, based in larger
 uznan areas, continue to exist. However, the government
 and party have more and more emphasized the importance of
 quasi-official workers' assemblies and have organized
 so-called "dynamizing groups" at industrial and commercial
 establishments to provide political guidance and control.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement within the country except
 in some combat-affected areas adjacent to the Rhodesian
 border. The right of emigration has been maintained for
 non-citizens resident in Mozambique, but there are tight
 restrictions on the removal of money and property.
 Restrictions have been placed on emigration and foreign
 travel by Mozambican citizens.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Mozambique is a one-party state controlled by FRELIMO.
 The party has adopted Marxism-Leninism as its guiding
 political philosophy. There is universal suffrage, but all
 competition among candidates takes place within the FRELIMO
 party structure. Election to national office is indirect
 and effected through district and provincial assemblies.
 Opposition political movements are not permitted.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 
 
 84
 No outside investigations of human rights are known to
 have beencarried out in Mozambique or requested by
 international organizations. However, during the past
 few months Mozambique has permitted foreign journalists
 to tour the country extensively. Two American journalists
 who recently did so, separately, reported extensively
 on human rights conditions in the country. They indicated
 that while there were restrictions on civil and political
 liberties, in other respects, such as in efforts to
 raise living standards, Mozambique had a favorable human
 rights record.
