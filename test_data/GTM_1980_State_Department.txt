 GUATEMALA
 violence has plagued Guatemalan history, and there have
 been many non-constitutional changes of government.
 In 1980, kidnapping and assassinations reached higher
 levels than in 1979. Deaths which appeared to be politi-
 cally motivated averaged about 75 to 100 each month.
 Reportedly these acts were carried out by armed extremists
 of the left and right and by elements of the official
 security forces. The government has not taken effective
 steps to halt abuses or carry out serious investigations.
 The high incidence of political and personal violence
 continued to seriously effect the exercise of most funda-
 mental liberties. Abductions and assassinations have
 the effect of rendering habeas corpus and fair trial
 meaningless even though they are constitutionally guaran-
 teed. In an open letter to the Guatemalan Catholio hierarchy
 made public November 2, the Pope deplored the wave of
 violence and pleaded with those responsible to bring
 it to an end.
 The government states it is engaged in a life or death
 struggle against armed, radical Marxist groups, especially
 active in 1980 in the central highlands. Marxist insur-
 gency in the eastern part of the country had been supressed
 with considerable loss of life in the early 1970s. There
 are reports that the government is condoning and organizing
 violence against those it perceives as its enemies.
 Charges of human rights violations such as degrading
 treatment, arbitrary arrest and summary execution are
 made regularly, particularly in those rural areas where
 Marxist guerrillas have intensified violence against
 the government, its allies, and business interests.
 Guatemalan security forces have increased efforts to
 eradicate the guerrillas. Innocent persons often are
 the victims of indiscriminate violence from both sides.
 It is frequently impossible to differentiate politically-
 inspired from privately-inspired violence. The government
 has resisted pressure to impose a state of emergency
 which would permit the suspension of some constitutional
 freedoms and protections. Violence inhibited opposition
 political activity, although the nationwide municipal
 elections in April 1980 were widely viewed as open and
 correct. Violence and threats of retribution have also
 damaged free expression and labor organization.
 Victims of the violence in 1980 included military and
 police personnel, government officials, pro-government
 politicians, businessmen, opposition political leaders,
 peasants and large numbers of students, academics and
 trade union activists. Fears for their safety spurred
 numerous academics and opposition politicians into self-
 exile, and the Bishop of El Quiche withdrew all Catholic
 clergy from his Diocese after the murder of two priests
 and other incidents in that area of rising army-guerrilla
 conflict. A third priest was killed elsewhere; a fourth
 was abducted. A US citizen working with private agricultural
 programs was murdered by unknown assailants in October.
 Leftist terrorists kidnapped two United Nations officials,
 and several Guatemalan and foreign businessmen, including
 the top local executive of Nestle, and killed the president
 of the principal business association. In January 1980,
 armed members of a radical left student organization
 with presumed ties to the guerrillas led a group of Indian
 campesinos in a take-over of the Spanish Embassy to protest
 
 
 442
 
 government policies. Thirty-two occupiers and seven
 hostages burned to death when police, ignoring the request
 of the Spanish Ambassador, stormed the building. As
 police broke into the occupied room, at least one of
 the occupiers threw a molotov cocktail touching off the
 fatal fire. The Spanish government broke relations with
 the Guatemalan government as a result of the incident.
 1.   Respect of the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Article 55 of the constitution and Article 10 of the
 criminal procedural code prohibit torture. There are
 reports that government security personnel engage in
 torture and other arbitrary and unjust treatment. Accord-
 ing to Guatemalan press reports, assassination victims
 often show signs of torture or mutilation. There is
 no indication that anyone involved in its practice has
 been disciplined.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Deaths which appear to be politically motivated averaged
 about 75-100 each month. Armed extremists of the left
 and right and elements of the official security forces
 are all reportedly responsible. Anti-criminal "death
 squad" killings averaged about 13 a month, according
 to press articles. Members of the security forces are
 reportedly involved, although the government denies this.
 In rural areas, there are frequent accusations of political
 and personal violence committed by local military and
 civil authorities, by Marxist and militant rightist terror-
 ists, and by private parties. There is no information
 that the government has charged or prosecuted those respon-
 sible. A 1979 International Commission of Jurists' report
 on Guatemala is critical of the Government of Guatemala's
 failure to investigate violence and-the activities of
 the "death squad."
 There are no reports of political prisoners. Criminal
 prisoners can pay for extra comforts and are treated
 equally. There are hospitals or clinics at all prisons.
 Diet is customary Guatemalan fare. Prisoners have ready
 access to other food to supplement a standard diet.
 Prisoners have considerable freedom of movement within
 the jails. There are liberal visiting hours for families
 and rooms are available for conjugal visits.
 c.   Disappearances
 In 1980 there were increasing numbers of abductions of
 people who have never been heard of again. The common
 assumption is that most of these persons are dead. The
 accidental discovery in Comalapa of a secret burial pit
 containing some thirty bodies, and of other clandestine
 burial sites confirmed this assumption. In June and
 August unidentified gunmen seized some 44 persons during
 two meetings of leftwing labor activists; one identifiable
 body has been found. Guatemalan leftwing opposition
 groups accused government security elements. Investiga-
 tions of disappearances appear to be pro forma.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Article 46 of the constitution prohibits arbitrary arrests.
 Habeas corpus procedures are honored'in criminal cases,
 as is the right of citizens to seek immediate redress
 
 
 443
 for administrative or judicial arbitrariness. Article
 51 of the constitution permits preventive detention but
 requires consignment to the courts or release within
 five days. The law also requires a prisoner to be informed
 of the charge against him within 48 hours of arrest.
 During 1980, some criminal repeaters were arrested and
 detained for several days, apparently without due process,
 but no other cases of lengthy detention without indictment
 or trial were reported in 1980.
 There are no known political prisoners. Confrontations
 between the army and those they suspect of being Marxist
 guerrillas seldom produce prisoners. Reports abound
 that persons seized on suspicion of guerrilla activity
 by government authorities, or by extremists acting indepen-
 dently of the government, were not brought before the
 judicial system but simply disappeared. Habeas corpus
 procedures in such cases are meaningless.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Article 53 of the constitution provides for due process
 for accused persons before the courts. Those persons
 processed generally received fair public trials. Courts
 are independent of executive or military control. Elected
 by the legislature, supreme court justices in turn appoint
 lower court judges. Under Guatemalan law, attorneys
 have access to clients after formal charges are made
 at a preliminary hearing which must take place within
 48 hours of'-apprehension. The court appoints a public
 defender if the accused lacks private counsel.
 Article 259 of the constitution provides that, except
 in a state of emergency, military courts have jurisdiction
 over civilians only if the latter act as chiefs or leaders
 of armed action against the public powers. The organiza-
 tion, composition and function of these courts are governed
 by military laws supplemented by ordinary legislation.
 There have been no military trials of civilians in recent
 years. As in the case of civil jurisdiction, verdicts
 of military courts are appealable, in both cases to higher
 civil courts.
 In spite of constitutional and legal guarantees, there
 is a widespread view that the judicial system does-not
 function effectively because of intimidation of judges,
 lawyers, litigants and witnesses. The threat of violent
 retaliation results in few convictions. Three judges
 and at least a half dozen lawyers were murdered in 1980,
 apparently the victims of such acts of retaliation.
 The International Commission of Jurists' 1979 report
 found that the operations of para-military forces have
 resulted in the breakdown of respect for judicial institu-
 tions and the rule of law.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 Article 57 of the constitution forbids invasion of the
 home except Vhen authorized by written order of a competent
 judge, and in no case before 6:00 a.m. or after 6:00 p.m.
 Nevertheless, homes have been invaded illegally. Rural
 homes, in particular, are the subject of searches without
 judicial warrants in the course of anti-guerrilla sweeps
 by security forces.
 2.   Government  Policies Relating to the Fullfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 
 
 444
 Guatemala's economic system is one of laissez-faire capital-
 ism. The government supports the dynamic industrial
 and well diversified, export-oriented agriculture sectors
 by providing favorable monetary and fiscal policies and
 necessary infrastructure. Property is privately owned.
 This right traditionally is protected. The public sector,
 in terms of personnel, expenditures and services, is
 small. Its principal source of funding is indirect taxes,
 principally on agricultural exports and luxury goods.
 The recently completed Northern Transversal pipeline
 has permitted limited petroleum production for export.
 The potential for expansion of petroleum production is
 considered good, and there is expectation that government
 revenue from this source will increase rapidly. Production
 at the end of 1980 was about 5000 barrels a day.
 Despite problems associated with the world recession
 and political uncertainty in the region, the economy
 is relatively healthy in macro-economic terms. 1979
 per capital income was estimated at $1014. The official
 inflation rate for 1979 was 10.5 percent. Real growth
 of GNP in 1979, a recession year, was a respectable 4.5
 percent.
 Income distribution is highly skewed. No current income
 distribution figures are available, but a 1972 income
 distribution report revealed that 25 percent of the popu-
 lation received a 60.5 percent of earned income. The
 poorest 25 percent got 6.7 percent. Although the middle
 class has expanded in recent years, overall income distri-
 bution in 1980 is not believed to have improved since
 that report was released. Large sectors of the population,
 including the Indians who make up over 50 percent of
 the population, are poor and have limited access to health
 and education services. Although statistics are inadequate,
 government officials estimate unemployment at 10-12 percent.
 Underemployment is substantial.
 About 2.5 million Indians in a total population of 7.2
 million speak a language other than Spanish as their
 mother tongue. The great majority of these people are
 illiterate. Many are isolated from much of national
 life. Often objects of informal discrimination and ex-
 ploitation, they must contend with many social, economic,
 and political disadvantages. In 1980, the government
 responded to Indian resentment of conscription practices
 by ordering army recruiters to cease strong-arm tactics
 and by providing $25 per month to the families of conscripts
 to ease the loss of the recruits' economic contribution.
 Many of the government's developmental and land distribu-
 tion initiatives have an Indian focus.
 The rate of population growth is estimated at 2.9 percent.
 Mortality and morbidity rates nevertheless remain high.
 Life expectancy is 60 years for non-Indians (Ladinos)
 and 50 for Indians. Infant mortality is 89/1000 in urban
 areas and 160/1000 in rural areas. Adult illiteracy
 stood at 64 percent in 1973. The current government
 has made a major effort to construct rural health stations.
 There are 38 modern regional hospitals, but modern medicine
 reaches only 35 percent of the population. The doctor/per
 capita ratio is 3.03/1000 and the nurse/per capita ratio
 is 2.02/1000. The technician/per capita ratio is 7.55/1000
 and the hospital bed/per capita ratio is 1.5/1000. Effec-
 tive methods of family planning are not widespread.
 Abortion, although forbidden under the penal code, is
 common. Half of maternal deaths are the result of septic
 abortions. A high rate of maternal mortality has been
 
 
 445
 associated with pregnancy and child bearing. The govern-
 ment, in response to interest groups, including well-
 organized women's organizations, recently approved family
 planning facilities to be adminstered through rural public
 health stations.
 Elements within Guatemalan society and the government
 espouse an expanded role for government in promoting
 equitable economic and social development. The 1979-
 1983 national development plan is based on the transform-
 ation of the rural economy with emphasis on productive
 infrastructure, the extension of free health and education
 services through the ninth grade, and industrial decentral-
 ization into rural areas. Many new programs were initiated
 with international financial support in agriculture,
 primary and secondary education and rural health. The
 Secretary General for Planning, who was in charge of
 the government's new social action plan, was assassinated
 in 1980. His replacement has vowed to carry on with
 the plan.
 While adequate shelter for the poor continues to be a
 major problem, ambitious programs in low-cost housing
 were initiated with the support of international donors.
 Some 27,000 families are scheduled to benefit over the
 next few years from these programs.
 Large tracts of government lands are being opened up
 for colonization by the landless poor. This land is
 suited mostly for the cultivation of tropical cash crops
 like coffee, rubber, cacao and cardomon. The Guatemalan
 military provides substantial logistical and material
 support to this program. The government issued over 6000
 land titles in 1980, for a total of about 20,000 since
 it assumed office in mid 1978.
 The current government has continued its encouragement
 of an important rural cooperative movement. The central
 budget in general and public investment in particular
 are growing rapidly. Among major infrastructure projects
 in progress are two dams, which will provide electricity
 to attract industry to now remote regions where unemploy-
 ment is high, and a peripheral highway which will provide
 farmers better access to urban markets. Corruption does
 not appear to have diverted significant resources from
 ongoing development programs.
 Women are becoming increasingly active in the labor force.
 In rural areas they play a key economic role in the marketing
 of small farm produce and in the handicraft industry.
 As economic pressure creates a greater need for supplement-
 ing family income, more middle class women are joining
 the labor force. However, wage levels for comparable
 work are lower and managerial positions are still dominated
 by men.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of speech, press
 and worship. However, the prevailing climate of political
 violence inhibits freedom of expression. The Inter-American
 Press Association registered concern about a climate
 of insecurity hampering press activity, and local media
 associations have deplored violence which in 1980 claimed
 more than a dozen of their members from across the political
 spectrum. Investigations of these deaths havg proven
 inconclusive. Nevertheless, newspapers and broadcasting
 media often criticize government officials and policies
 
 
 446
 without censorship or retaliation, continue to disseminate
 paid bulletins of militant left-wing opposition groups-,
 and render anti-government diatribes in news accounts.
 The film censorship board prevented the commercial showing
 of the American film "Norma Rae," a film portraying union
 organizing in the American South. Although Roman Catholicism
 is dominant, there is no state religion. Protestant
 and other sects function freely. Their members suffer
 no political or other disadvantage.
 Freedom of worship is permitted, but some members of
 the clergy have been intimidated when they spoke out
 on social or economic issues or advocated far-reaching
 change. Two priests were killed in the El Quiche region
 in 1980, presumably by rightist para-military groups.
 The Bishop of El Quiche subsequently withdrew all Catholic
 clergy from the diocese. A third priest was killed in
 another part of the country, and a fourth abducted and
 still missing. The prevalence of violence and anonymous
 threats have prompted some priests and other religious
 representatives to leave the country. The Bishop of
 El Quiche, who is the President of the Guatemalan Council
 of Bishops, was denied reentry to Guatemala in November,
 1980 upon return from a synod in Rome despite his Guatemalan
 citizenship.
 Politically-motivated violence claimed the lives of more
 than 80 faculty, staff and students of the National Univer-
 sity and its branches. Guerrilla elements have been
 harbored in the university, and right wing terrorists
 have traditionally viewed university students and staff,
 even those not associated with armed opposition, as subver-
 sive elements.
 Political protest demonstrations and parades are regulated
 by the Ministry of Government which, if satisfied that
 the demonstrations will be orderly and nonviolent, gener-
 ally issues permits. The government has dispersed demon-
 strations that lacked prior authorization. Principal
 protest demonstrations authorized in 1980 were the Univer-
 sity student parody parade and the May 1 Labor Day parade.
 As many as a dozen participants of the May 1 parade were
 gunned' down by unknown assailants. In parts of the country
 having guerrilla problems, the authorities have discouraged
 meetings of all but small groups.
 Labor and trade union freedoms are severely restricted
 by the violent conditions in Guatemala. Strikes are
 permitted in the private sector, but not in the public
 sector. Intimidation by left and right-wing terror,
 particularly the latter, which is reputedly linked in
 some cases to management or official security forces,
 inhibits the development of strong, independent unions,
 and few exist. Labor activity also is hampered by an
 excess of unskilled labor and the lack of effective leader-
 ship. The latter condition was caused, in part, by the
 assassination or abduction of more than 80 trade union
 leaders and activists by unindentified assailants in
 1980. This has created a climate of fear which not only
 prevents the growth of a free and vigorous labor movement,
 but weakens and inhibits those unions which exist. The
 procedure for registering new unions is complicated and
 difficult. The government proposed a new labor code,
 some of whose provisions, in line with ILO standards,
 could theoretically strengthen trade unions. Labor and
 management opposition has stalled legislative approval.
 The system of labor justice is viewed by unions as favoring
 business and is the source of much labor discontent.
 An extra-legal strike by agricultural workers in early
 
 
 447
 1980, to which the government responded with restraint,
 led to massive government-ordered wage increases in plan-
 tation agriculture, industry, and commerce.
 b.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Eargration and Repatriation
 There are generally no restrictions on foreign travel
 or on emigration by Guatemalans, and no distinctions
 by sex in this regard. Asylees in foreign embassies
 usually receive rapid processing for safe conduct out
 of the country. Estimates of Guatemalan political refugees
 are unavailable. Guatemala has received more than 10,000
 Nicaraguan and Salvadoran refugees. Refugees have been
 absorbed into the society without massive official assis-
 tance. Travel to and from some guerrilla areas and access
 to Guatemala City from the countryside at times are con-
 trolled.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 For most of the-past two decades, Guatemalan politics
 have been dominated by the military.  There is a consti-
 tutional framework providing for elections. Government
 functions below the top level are carried out by civilians.
 The 1978 elections transferred power to a new administra-
 tion, with the military retaining its traditional primacy.
 Nominated by civilian political parties, the three candi-
 dates were military officers one of whom was retired.
 Although open and hard-fought, the 1978 presidential
 elections were marred by fraud charges on all sides.
 Since no candidate received the necessary majority, the
 Congress selected the President as the constitution pro-
 vides. General Lucas, with the highest recorded popular
 vote (42 percent), was declared the winner. Abstentions
 came to about 65 percent of the registered electorate.
 opposition parties exist, but their ability to provide
 viable, effective opposition has been undermined by threats
 of violence and assassination. Politicians and other
 activists have been assassinated. The current government
 has authorized four additional parties. A total of seven
 political parties, including three of the opposition,
 and several local committees contested the 1980 municipal
 elections. However, six or seven leaders of a legally
 registered leftist party were assassinated in the three
 months prior to the election and the party did not parti-
 cipate. The elections themselves were widely regarded
 as technically correct and open. About 30 percent of
 those registered voted in those elections. Registration
 and voting in Guatemala is theoretically obligatory for
 all literate adults, a minority of the population, but
 discretionary for illiterates.
 Article 43 of the constitution prohibits sexual discrimin-
 ation, but historical, cultural and social biases have
 relegated women to an inferior status. Illiteracy rates
 are higher among women, but a growing number of women
 are taking advantage of higher education opportunities
 and constitute over 25 percent of university enrollment.
 Women have the option of marrying with a contract that
 will insure them of the retention of any property they
 bring into a marriage, should it be dissolved. Men still
 dominate most political and government positions.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 
 
 448
 Unofficial observers from the United States and Europe
 visited Guatemala for the 1978 national elections. Repre-
 sentatives of the International Commission of Jurists
 and Amnesty International visited Guatemala in 1979 and
 published reports highly critical of the government's
 human rights record. These organizations have not visited
 in 1980 but continue to comment critically on the human
 rights situation. Government spokesmen respond to these
 criticisms by denying the charges, stating that they
 are unsubstantiated.
 In 1980 the UN Human Rights Commission charged the Guate-
 malan Government with tolerating human rights abuses
 and urged that government to take necessary measures
 to ensure the human rights of its citizens. Guatemala
 postponed indefinitely a prior invitation to the Inter-
 American Commission on Human Rights to conduct an on-
 site investigation of the human rights situation.
 A local human rights commission, organized in late 1979,
 announced its disbandment in 1980 with the explanation
 that conditions did not permit fulfillment of its monitoring
 role.
