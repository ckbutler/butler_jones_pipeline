 FIJI
 Fiji is a multiracial society with a population of around
 700,000, made up of 46 percent ethnic Fijians, 48 percent
 Indians, and 6 percent other races (essentially other Pacific
 Islanders, Europeans, and Chinese). The culture and ethnic
 makeup of the Fijians, the original inhabitants, is a blend of
 Polynesian and Melanesian. Most of the Indians are descended
 from indentured laborers brought in to work on the sugar
 plantations in the late 19th century. However, a significant
 element came later as traders and to serve as government
 officials.
 On independence from Britain in 1970, the Constitution was
 drawn to preserve basic rights for all, with a delicate
 political power balance favoring the Fijians but guaranteeing
 a political role for all ethnic groups. Special attention was
 paid to preserving the land tenure rights of the indigenous
 Fijians, rights-which have been traditionally exercised
 communally rather than individually.
 In 1987 a period of political instability was initiated when a
 bloodless military coup led by Lt. Col. Sitiveni Rabuka
 overthrew the democratically elected government on May 14.
 After a few days, Rabuka turned over power to the Governor
 General. However, on September 25, Rabuka staged a second
 coup. Fiji returned to civilian rule again on December 5,
 when the military announced that former Governor General
 Ganilau and former Prime Minister Mara had agreed to head an
 interim government. Mara, as interim Prime Minister, has
 pledged to move towards elections under a new constitution.
 He has also called for restoration of national harmony and
 cooperation between Fiji's peoples to rebuild the country
 following the recent coups.
 Serious human rights abuses occurred under the coup leadership;
 the extent to which the new civilian leadership will be able
 to reverse this trend was not clear by year's end.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known politically motivated killings by the
 government, the military authorities, or opposition political
 groups.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no disappearances, nor evidence of people being
 abducted, secretly arrested, or clandestinely detained.
 However, immediately following the two military coups,
 detained persons were held for several days without being
 allowed t6 contact their families or friends under the
 military government.
 Immediately after the second coup, diplomatic missions were
 routinely denied consular access to their detained nationals.
 Following protests by the diplomatic community, the military
 government gave assurances of access, and the interim civilian
 government has stated that it will continue this policy.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In the period following the second coup, there were numerous
 reports of physical abuse of detainees by the military. U.S.
 representatives received reports of persons being severely
 beaten by military personnel. A well-known lawyer represented
 several defendants, who were presented to him in jail with
 injuries requiring medical attention. The attorney reported
 that these persons refused to testify in court about their
 experiences. Other reports, which cannot be confirmed, allege
 that detainees were forced to run barefoot on blacktop roads
 in the hot sun for several kilometers or were dumped in pit
 latrines or in sewage treatment plant holding tanks. In the
 last 2 months of 1987, the number of reports of human rights
 abuses declined sunstantially.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 During the first coup, members of the deposed parliament were
 detained, kept under house arrest for several days, and then
 released. A number of other political figures and journalists
 were detained, most of them briefly, but some for a week or
 more.
 During and after the second coup, arbitrary detention was more
 widespread and often accompanied by physical abuse or threats.
 Soldiers searching for deposed Prime Minister Bavadra entered
 his home, fired shots, and frightened his family. Dr. Bavadra,
 who was not at home, was later picked up at a roadblock. This
 was in marked contrast to the treatment the deposed Prime
 Minister received during the first coup.
 Other members of the deposed government were also detained for
 up to several days at a time without being allowed to contact
 families or friends. Some expatriate government advisors with
 no known-partisan affiliation were detained. Currently there
 are no reports of detentions.
 The military government's Basic Rights Decree allowed detention
 for up to 7 days without notification of charges. Names of
 persons detained were to be published in the Official Gazette
 within 14 days of detention. Cases of detained persons had to
 be reviewed within 1-month of detention, and at 6-month
 intervals thereafter, by a special tribunal, whose head was to
 be appointed by the Chief Justice.
 -Exile is not practiced formally. However, a'number of Fiji
 citizens (both Fijian and Indian) fldd the country and
 believed they would be subject to detention or arrest on
 return. It is also reported that the military authorities
 issued instructions that certain Fiji citizens be denied entry
 should they try to reenter the country. -
 There have been no reports of forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The military authorities dismissed the former judiciary,
 including the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice and two
 associate Justices, all staunch supporters-of the 1970
 Constitution and of a return to democracy, were detained for
 several days. All the expatriate Supreme Court Justices and
 one indigenous Justice were "encouraged" to leave Fiji after
 declining invitations to serve the military regime. In
 
 
 696
 FIJI
 October the military government named several new magistrates
 and judges. Several of these had previously held such
 positions. All were lawyers and a number were ethnic
 Indians. The court system has not yet resumed its full
 functions since the second coup. No sentences have been
 handed down without trial. The Crown Law Office and the
 Office of the Public Prosecutor also lost most of their legal
 personnel following the coups and have not yet returned to
 normal operation. A large backlog of cases will face the
 Supreme Court when it resumes its duties, a situation that
 could mean prolonged imprisonment for some detainees. In
 January the former Chief Justice accepted the interim civilian
 government's offer that he resume his role as head of Fiji's
 judiciary.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Fomily, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the 1970 Constitution, the sanctity of the home was
 protected. Warrants issued by a magistrate were required to
 enter a private home. The military government's Fundamental
 Freedoms Decree codified the right to security in one's home,
 but, as in other areas, allowed the Government to infringe on
 that right, for example, in the interest of state security or
 public order. Arbitrary invasions of homes were reported
 during4endi immediately after both coups, especially the second.
 There were some reports of interference with correspondence.
 As with-other violations ofhuman rights,-these reports peaked
 afteF.the second coup and have diminished since then.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil-Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of..speech.is severely constrained. Political assembly
 and speech inpublic is not permitted. After the second coup
 there were reports of persons being-detained after-uttering
 antigovernment sentiments in public places such-as bars and
 restaurants.
 Under the 1970 Constitution, Fiji had a free and active press.
 After the first coup, newspapers were shut down briefly-but
 resumed publication within a few days. After-the second coup
 the two major dailies were closed. When one -eopened on
 November 6, it-published a statement saying it had agreed not
 to publish anything that could incite ethnic antipathies or be
 prejudicial to the public order. The statement said the
 newspaper was not being, censored.by the authorities. The
 second English-language-,daily has not reopened.     -
 The military authorities took control-of radio stations in
 both coups. While normal broadcasts were resumed shortly
 after the first coup, the second coup resulted in the
 termination of all broadcasts except those by the official
 radio station.  During the period of government control,
 censorship'of news was practiced. Both radio stations
 returned to normal operations in late 1987.
 Journalists, both foreign and local, were subject to detention
 and harassment after both coups. Film and videotapes were   -
 confiscated. Some;physical abuse of journalists was reported.,

 FIJI
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political meetings and demonstrations are banned. The
 civilian Government has dropped a requirement imposed by the
 military government that a permit be obtained for gatherings
 of more than four people not family members. Police and
 soldiers investigate any large gathering in a private home to
 make sure that regulations are observed.
 Trade union rights have been severely restricted and were
 suspended altogether for a time. Trade union offices were
 closed after the second coup but reopened in late October
 following a threat by Australian labor unions to cut off air
 traffic from Australia to Fiji. A similar closure had been in
 effect for a time after the first coup.
 Leading trade unionists, a number of whom were ministers in
 the deposed government, were detained after both coups. Union
 leaders also were temporarily prevented from leaving Fiji to
 attend union meetings overseas.
 The former military government had sought to ensure that
 unions, which are mostly led and dominated by ethnic Indians,
 did not again gain political power.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The military regime announced its intention to ensure the
 supremacy of the Christian religion without interfering with
 the rights of others to practice their religions. However,
 religious elements were influential in the military government.
 Since the second coup, business activities, sporting events,
 and most "nonreligious" activities have been banned on Sundays
 except in the tourist areas. Even at the resorts, however,
 hotels can serve meals and provide other services only to
 registered guests on Sundays. All nonhotel restaurants are
 closed, and no buses or taxis can operate on Sundays.
 The military government did not interfere with worship or
 education by the Hindu and Muslim populations. Hindu and
 Muslim religious holidays have been observed as public
 holidays since the coups, as they were before. Non-Christians
 are permitted to attend temples and mosques on Sunday--but
 only for "religious services."
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Fiji citizens are free to move about within the country and to
 travel abroad. The military authorities when in power issued
 an order forbidding about 100 people,-most of them associated
 with the Bavadra government, from leairing the country. There
 are no formal restrictions on repatriation, but it is widely
 believed that certain political figures now outside the
 country would not be allowed to return. Emigration
 is allowed freely and has increased substantially since the
 first coup. About 400 to 500 people emigrate per month, most
 of them ethnic Indians. There are no displaced persons in
 Fiji.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 -to Change Their Government
 Until the first military coup on May 14, 1987, Fiji was a
 functioning multiparty democracy using the Westminster
 
 
 -698
 FIJI
 parliamentary system. Accirding to milita'iy spokesmen, the
 first coup was staged because the military feared a breakdown
 of public order and'did not want to be placed in the situation
 of taking actions against fellow tijians. Within a few'days,
 "Rabuka yielded pbwer to the Governor General' of Fiji, who
 attempted to7effect a politi6c'l reidncltiatlon. Rabuka and
 his supportBrs-A~mong the strongly pro-Fi'jian'Taukei movement,
 however, were dissatisfied with the results of the Governor
 General's efforts. - The army, again under Col. Rabuka, staged
 a second cou" oxinSeptember'2,  after negotiations between
 civilian politicians attemptihg to reestablish some form of
 democratic ''roess'failed tofteet the army's "min'imum demands"
 for etlnic Yijian supremacy. Col. Rabuka then declared the
 1970:'ConAitution null- -nd v6id, nominted, himself head of
 government, and announced the creation of a republic. Upon
 that declaration, Fiji's membership in the Commonwealth
 lapsed. -' B6tweeh'3jterifiber 25 and the creation on December.5
 of a rivlian interim government( Col. Rabuka ruled'bi decree.,
 On October 13, the military government"Published a "Fundamental'
 Freedoms Decree." It set out fundamental rights as follows:
 (a)'1-ff, 1ibierty, security of the -erson, and' the
 protection of the law;
 (b) freedom of conscience, or expression, akid of issembiy
 and association; and
 (c' pr6tectibh fox 'the' privacy of the hofe" and other"
 property,, -ri" from 'deAr;ivation of propetty' without
 compeiis~tioni.
 It alsd allowed the'military government to infri.nge onthese
 rights for ?'iasons blt sEcurity, phiblic ordef, or morality.
 On Decerflie' 5 the nitfitary regime returne'd the government to
 civilian rule. IHowe~er, Ehe military maintains a 'strong role
 in the interim civilian government as Rabuka holds the Home
 Affairs and' Security 'ministerIa! post. .'The military and its
 civilian supporters intend to ensure that ethnic Fijians hold
 an overwhelmi g'prepondeiance of power in the successor
 govenbiiit.  he dviliangovernment is pxpected-to adhere
 temporarily to the tdnets set out in the Fundamental Freedoms
 Decree.
 The coups x'ere-�staged to. ensure the jired6minance 'of the
 indigenous Fijian people'., The government elected in April
 was, for the first time in history, controlled by a coalitipn
 of the trfditibnal opposition National Federation Paty (NFP)
 and. the'New Labo'- Par-y. The coliti'on was dominated by
 ethnic- Itdians (alth-ough the Prime Minister was. a Fijian).
 Some lijans febred that tlie tfew ,overnment'ipitended to
 interfere iwith the land tenure rights of the native people.
 The interia Government hbs announced that-a new co1nstitution
 will be promulgated, but whenthris will happen remains
 unclear. ~~' state of imergency remains in effect but 'the
 curfew, which had been imposed by the military government, was
 lifted in early November.

 FIJI
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Until the military coups, there were no allegations of human
 rights violations in Fiji or requests for investigations. At
 a November 16 press conference in New Zealand, the Fiji
 Information Minister in the military government took note of
 Amnesty International's reports of human rights abuses by
 security forces, saying, "We are concerned. If there is some
 truth in this, then the people involved should be disciplined.
 Something should be done to them." A Fiji newspaper reported
 in mid-November that Rabuka invited a local Red Cross
 representative to speak to Fijian soldiers on human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Influential figures in the military regime who expressed
 strong racist sentiments were dropped .from the interim civilian
 government, although it remains the intention of the military
 to ensure that the supremacy of the indigenous Fijians in the
 political arena is institutionalized. The military also
 attaches high priority to changing the ethnic balance in the
 civil service, which has been dominated by ethnic Indians.
 Many ethnic Fijians feel that the public service discriminated
 against them in assignments and promotions. Many senior
 Indian civil servants have resigned, been fired, or taken
 early retirement.
 Some within the military want to restrict further the rights
 of tenants on land owned communally by Fijian villages, which
 includes most of the land used for sugar cane cultivation and
 tourist resorts--the country's two major foreign currency
 earners.
 About 85 percent of the land in Fiji is held communally by
 indigenous Fijians. Most cash crop farmers are Indians, who
 lease land from the villages. Freehold land title is not an
 indigenous concept; current freehold and crown lands were
 alienated from customary owners during the colonial period.
 Approximately 6 percent of the land is government held, leaving
 9 percent as freehold. Government land can be leased but not
 sold. The arrangement regarding land ownership was instituted
 to protect the interests of the indigenous Fijians from the
 more economically competitive Indians. But many Indians,
 particularly farmers, feel that the lack of security of land
 tenure discriminates against them. Campaign promises to
 improve the land rights of tenants caused many Fijians to fear
 that the Bavadra government was a threat to their traditional
 rights as owners of the land.
 Women in both the Fijian and Indian communities have
 functioned primarily in traditional roles. A few women occupy
 high positions in the Fijian chiefly system and in politics.
 The civilian government's cabinet includes two women, the
 Minister of Women's Affairs (a Fijian chief) and the Minister
 of Indian Affairs (an Indian politician).
 Ethnic Indians have been generally more successful than
 Fijians in business. Many Fijians feel discriminated against
 in business by the network of supplier and financial
 relationships within the Indian business community. At the
 same time, there are certain features of Fijian culture, such
 as obligations to family members and a bias against
 
 
 700
 FIJI
 accumulation of wealth by individuals, that make it more
 difficult (or a less attractive prospect) for Fijians to
 succeed in business.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Worker rights in Fiji are protected by legislation, much of
 which is still in effect. Children under age 12 may not be
 employed in any capacity. Children (under age 15) and "young
 persons" ,(age 15-17) may not be employed in industry or in
 attendonte onopachinery. There is no national minimum wage;
 however, minimum wages have been established for several
 sectors.
 A workMen's compensation act and an accident compensation plan
 have been enacted to set safety standards in the workplace and
 establish guidelines for workers injured on the job. Some
 unions in Fiji have criticized employers and the Government
 for failing._to take action to correct unsafe working conditions
 after bqing-notified Qf them by the unions. Most such
 allegations have-been made -in connection with the sugar
 industry., the largest and mqst industrialized sector of the
 economy. Legislation in place before the .coup protected
 workersrro, isummary dismissal without Just cause. Since the
 two coups, ,aspecial1Jy the second, numerous ethnic Indians in
 the public senviqe have been dismissed or pressured to-xesign
 or retire.
