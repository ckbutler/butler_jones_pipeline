 YEMEN
 The Republic of Yemen, comprising the former (northern) Yemen Arab Republic
 (YAR) and (southern) People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, was proclaimed in
 1990. Following a brief but bloody civil war in mid-1994, the country was reunified
 under the Sana'a-based Government. Ali Abdullah Saleh is the President and leader
 of the General People's Congress (GPC.) He was elected by the legislature in 1994
 to a 5-year term. The Constitution provides that henceforth the President is to be
 elected by popular vote from at least two candidates selected by the Parliament. The
 Government has scheduled a popular election for president in late 1999. The first
 Parliament elected by universal adult suffrage was convened in 1993. Parliamentary
 elections were held in 1997, with the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), formerly the
 main party of the south and a previous coalition partner, leading an opposition boy-
 cott. The GPC won an absolute majority of the new Parliament, with Islaah the only
 other major party represented. International observers judged the elections as rea-
 sonably free and fair, while noting some problems with the voting. However, the
 Parliament is not yet an effective counterweight to executive authority, although it
 increasingly demonstrated independence from the Government. Real political power
 rests with a few leaders, particularly the President. The judiciary, nominally inde-
 pendent, is weak and severely hampered by corruption, executive branch inter-
 ference, and the frequent failure of the authorities to carry out sentences.
 The primary state security apparatus is the Political Security Organization (PSO),
 which reports directly to the President. It is independent of the Ministry of Interior.
 The Criminal Investigative Department (CID) of the police conducts most criminal
 investigations and makes most arrests. The Central Security Organization (CSO),
 a part of the Ministry of Interior, maintains a paramilitary force. The civilian au-
 thorities did not maintain effective control of the security forces. Some members of
 the security forces, particularly the PSO, committed numerous, serious human
 rights abuses.
 Yemen is a very poor country. Its embryonic market-based economy, despite a
 major economic reform program, remains impeded by excessive government inter-
 ference and endemic corruption. Its annual per capita gross national product (GNP)
 fell from $325 in 1997 to $260 in 1998. Agriculture accounts for approximately 22
 percent of GNP, industry for approximately 27 percent, and services for approxi-
 mately 51 percent. Oil is the primary source of foreign exchange. Other exports in-
 clude fish, agricultural products, cotton, and coffee. Remittances from Yemenis
 working abroad (primarily in Saudi Arabia) are also important. Remittances were
 sharply reduced after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states expelled up to 850,000
 Yemeni workers during the Gulf War because of the Government's lack of support
 for the U.N. coalition. The Gulf states also suspended most assistance programs,
 and much Western aid was reduced. Foreign aid began to re-emerge as an impor-
 tance source of income. The unemployment rate is estimated at 35 to 40 percent,
 and is highest in the southern governorates, where, prior to unity, most adults were
 employed by the PDRY government.
 The Government's human rights record continued to be poor, although it took
 some steps to address human rights problems. There are significant limitations on
 citizens' rights to change their government. There were instances of extrajudicial
 killing by some members of the security. forces. There was compelling evidence that
 at least one person died in the custody of the security forces, and the Government
 has not yet made a credible effort to investigate the death. Following the Govern-
 ment's lifting of subsidies on certain commodities, an estimated 50 to 250 persons,
 at least 40 of whom were security officials, died in clashes in late June and early
 July between the authorities and armed civilians.
 Prison conditions are poor and some detainees were held in private prisons not
 authorized by the Government. Some members of the security forces tortured and
 otherwise abused persons, and continued arbitrarily to arrest and to detain citizens,
 especially oppositionists in the south and other persons regarded as "secessionists."
 PSO officers have broad discretion over perceived national security issues. Despite
 constitutional constraints, they routinely monitor citizens' activities and search their
 homes, detain citizens for questioning, and mistreat detainees. In fact, security
 forces sometimes countermanded orders from the President and the Interior Min-
 istry. In general, the Government failed to hold members of the security forces ac-
 countable for abuses, although it did undertake to investigate three security officers
 
 
 1831
 who allegedly tortured a witness in a court case. Prolonged pretrial detention is a
 serious problem, and judicial corruption, inefficiency, and executive interference un-
 dermine due process. The Government began to implement a comprehensive pro-
 gram for judicial reform, but its impact is not yet clear. The Constitution limits free-
 dom of speech and of the press, and the Government occasionally harassed, intimi-
 dated, and detained journalists. Journalists practice self-censorship. The Govern-
 ment imposes some restrictions on freedom of religion. There were some limits of
 freedom of movement. Discrimination based on sex, race, disability, social status,
 and to a lesser extent, religion, exists. Violence against women is a problem. Female
 genital mutilation is practiced on a limited scale, primarily along the coastal areas
 of the Red Sea. Although the practice is discouraged publicly, the authorities do not
 prohibit it. Child labor is a problem.
 At the invitation of the authorities, delegations from the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission (UNHRC), Amnesty International (AI), and Prison Reform Inter-
 national (PRI) visited Yemen during the year to observe the human rights situation
 and make recommendations. The Government agreed to implement a program rec-
 ommended by the PRI that consists mainly of technical training for prison officials.
 The Government also began to implement a comprehensive program for judicial re-
 form. The Government codified penalties for the perpetrators of kidnapings and im-
 plemented regulations designed to minimize the carrying of unlicensed weapons in
 cities.
 A campaign of bombings-the devices sometimes were little more than noise
 bombs--continued throughout the year, particularly in the southern governorates.
 The bombs caused a number of deaths, but damage to property was limited, and
 the perpetrators of and motives for the bombings remain unknown.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was credible evidence that se-
 curity forces killed a prisoner in detention in late 1997 or early 1998. Wadia al-
 Shaibani, a 22-year-old arrested in connection with the July 1997 bombings in Aden,
 apparently died after suffering a beating at the Soleyban police facility in Aden.
 Government authorities declined to investigate; they claimed that al-Shaibani com-
 mitted suicide.
 Faraj Bin Hammam, age 40, and Abmad Omar Ba Rajash, age 42, died during
 an April demonstration in Mukallah that turned violent. Demonstrators claimed
 that police and security officials opened fire without provocation. The authorities
 claimed that the demonstrators themselves had thrown rocks and shot at security
 officials. Two parliamentary delegations came to differing assessments as to who
 was at fault (see Section 2.b.).
 In May Mohamed Thabit al-Zubeidi, a resident of al-Dhala, was shot and killed
 by security forces as he crossed a checkpoint in that town. His companions returned
 fire, killing three soldiers (see Section 2.d.).
 Police killed three tribal sheikhs at a checkpoint in Jawf in August (see Section
 2.d.).
 An estimated 50 to 250 persons, including at least 40 security officials, died when
 demonstrations led to clashes between the authorities and armed civilians during
 late June and early July in some cities as well as in Marib governorate. The over-
 whelming majority of casualties occurred in Marib. The clashes in the cities initially
 were sparked by the Government's lifting of subsidies on certain commodities; politi-
 cal opponents of the Government apparently took advantage of the situation to en-
 courage the demonstrations. Occasionally violent demonstrations, usually lasting
 not more than a day or two, occurred in Sana'a and other areas, including Taiz, Ibb,
 and Dhamar. Protests took the form of looting, vandalism and armed clashes be-
 tween demonstrators and security officials. Military and riot police were dispatched
 to the streets in some cities.
 In the wake of the initial clashes in the cities, heavy and more prolonged fighting
 broke out in Marib governorate, where confrontations took place between govern-
 ment forces in tanks and tribal nomads with antipersonnel and antitank rocket-pro-
 pelled grenades (RPG's). A nomad settlement reportedly was destroyed by govern-
 ment helicopter gunships. Tribesmen cut off key highways and sabotaged oil pipe-
 lines and fuel trucks. A group of tribesmen stormed a bank in the town of Marib.
 Tribesmen also blocked the Saada-Sana'a road and several roads in Shabwa
 governorate. Scattered firefights took  place throughout Shabwa and Jawf
 governorates. The conflicts in tribal areas stemmed from a variety of factors, includ-
 ing reaction to the price hikes and demands for government services, as well as op-
 
 
 1832
 position to government efforts to crack down on illegal tribal activities. Both the se-
 curity forces and the tribes suffered heavy casualties.
 On December 28, a group of 16 western tourists was kidnaped by terrorists in
 Abyan governorate near Mudiyah. The next day, Government forces surrounded the
 area and attempted a rescue operation. Four of the hostages and three of-the terror-
 ists were killed. There were varying reports as to whether the government forces
 killed any of the hostages. The Government has stated that its decision to intervene
 was based on its belief that the hostages' lives were in immediate danger. Three
 surviving terrorists were charged with murder, and their trial was to begin in early
 1999.1
 The 1996 case of a YSP activist who died in police custody remained unresolved.
 The youth had been arrested following his participation in a peaceful demonstration
 in Mukallah. No member of the security forces has been charged in connection with
 his death.
 -Up to 20 persons were killed in a series of violent incidents-unexplained bomb-
 ings and shootings-that occurred throughout the year, primarily in the southern
 governorates. Of these, eight died in three separate mosque bombings in Aden,
 Sana'a, and Hodeidah. In most cases it was impossible to determine-who was re-
 sponsible for such acts, or why they occurred, and there were no claims of respon-
 sibility. The Government accused southern oppositionists of perpetrating some inci-
 dents, but the opposition denied any involvement. Some cases appeared to have
 criminal, religious, or political motives; others appeared to be cases of tribal revenge
 or land disputes. A prominent tribal figure and his 13-year-old nephew were killed
 in downtown Sana'a in late October in what appeared to be a tribal revenge killing.
 In June the President established a committee to study the phenomenon of revenge
 killings and to make recommendations on how to combat that problem. News re-
 ports and official discussions on the subject were continuing at year's end.
 b. Disappearance.-Members of the security forces continue to arrest and detain
 citizens for varying periods of time without charge or notification to their families.
 Many detainees, especially in southern governorates, are associated with the YSP
 or other opposition parties and are accused of being "secessionists." Most such dis-
 appearances are temporary, and detainees, typically are released within weeks or
 months.
 Following an April opposition demonstration in Mukallah in which two persons
 were killed (see Section L.a.), the authorities rounded up and detained a large num-
 ber of demonstrators. The security forces released 14 of the detainees in late May.
 However, at year's end, oppositionists in Mukallah claimed that a number of per-
 sons remained unaccounted 'for, including Hassan Baoum, the leader of the YSP in
 Hadramaut and head of the opposition Coordination Council. The Government stat-
 ed that it was not holding anyone except those charged with crimes, and asserted
 that Baoum is in hiding.
 In late October, the Hadramaut Primary Court announced that a trial would
 begin in the case of Baoum and other oppositionists charged in connection with the
 April demonstration in Mukallah. However, the Governor of Hadramaut subse-
 quently announced that this case would not be pursued if Baoum were to turn him-
 self over to the authorities peacefully.
 At the invitation of the authorities, delegations from the U.N. Human Rights
 Commission and Amnesty International visited the country to investigate the
 whereabouts of persons who have "disappeared" in custody since unification. The
 UNHRC and AI had not yet released reports on their findings by year's end. In 1997
 the Government had promised AI that it would-look into 28 cases of persons who
 died after they reportedly "disappeared" while in government custody in the years
 1994-96. Both the U.N. Committee on Disappearances and AI also continued to al-
 lege that there were hundreds of unresolved disappearances dating from the pre-
 union period in the former PDRY, particularly from the 1986 civil war in the PDRY.
 The Government asserts that it cannot be held responsible for cases that took place
 in the former PDRY prior to unity; however, it has set up a computer database in
 the Ministry of Foreign Relations to track disappearances, including those dating
 from the pre-unity period.
 Some tribes seek to bring their political and economic concerns to the attention
 of the Government by kidnaping and holding hostages. Victims include foreign busi-
 nessmen, diplomats, and tourists, as well as Yemenis. Several women and at least
 one child were kidnaped during the year. The legal magazine al-Qistas, in a study
 that it conducted on 159 kidnapings perpetrated since unity, found that Sana'a,
 Marib and Shabwa are the areas where a foreigner is most likely to be kidnaped.
 Kidnaping victims rarely are injured, and the authorities generally have been suc-
 cessful in obtaining the quick release of foreign hostages. However, kidnapings con-
 tinue because the judiciary fails to implement sentences against accused kidnapers.
 
 
 1833
 Moreover, some families linked to various kidnapings also are politically or tribally
 prominent or have links with such tribes. In most cases the kidnapings are settled
 out of court, with no suspects facing trial.
 In August the Government issued by presidential decree a law that stipulated se-
 vere punishments up to and including capital punishment for persons involved in
 kidnaping and banditry. Persons charged with helping a foreign state or gang in a
 kidnaping or theft by force face sentences of 10 to 15 years, subject to doubling if
 the instigators are military officers or otherwise employed by the state.
 In late December, three persons arrested after the December 28 terrorist incident
 in Mudiyah were charged with abduction and murder; their trial was to begin in
 early 1999 (see Section l.a.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution is ambiguous on its prohibition of cruel or inhuman punishment;
 however, there were numerous reports that members of the security forces tortured
 and otherwise abused persons in detention, particularly in Aden and elsewhere in
 the south. Arresting authorities are known to use force during interrogations, espe-
 cially against those arrested for violent crimes. Detainees sometimes are confined
 in leg-irons and shackles, despite the passage of a law during the year outlawing
 this practice.
 Several individuals on trial in Aden in connection with a series of bombings in
 1997 testified publicly that they had been tortured. One defendant claimed that he
 had been raped in custody. At least one other person arrested in connection with
 the same bombings died as a result of beatings inflicted by security officials. Accord-
 ing to eyewituesses who also claimed to have been tortured, Wadia al-Shaibani was
 first beaten in a criminal security office in Aden, then transferred to the Soleyban
 police facility, were he was tortured to death (see Section l.a.). No charges have
 been  fied.               Ib
 In a related case in which 31 persons were accused of conspiracy in Mahra
 overnorate in 1997, several of the suspects claimed that they had confessed only
 because they had been tortured. Defense attorneys asserted the existence of films
 that would prove their clients' allegations that they had been beaten, and asked the
 judge to view the films. The judge overruled this request. In late October, the court
 sentenced three of the defendants to death, found one innocent, and sentenced the
 others to jail for periods ranging from 6 to 10 years (see Section i.e.).
 There was credible information that in February officers of the Rawdah police sta-
 tion assaulted Mohamed Noman Muqbll, an Adeni human rights activist and
 During anpril demonstration in Mukallah in which two persons died, police and
 security officials used tear gas to break up the crowd. Some persons reported that
 that they were treated roughly by officials. The Government claimed that the dem-
 onstrators had fired on their forces and therefore had to be subdued (see Section
 l.a.).
 The Government has acknowledged publicly that torture takes place, but has
 claimed that the use of torture is not government policy. A government prosecutor
 has cited illiteracy and lack of training among police and security officials as one
 of the reasons for the persistence of the use of undue force in prisons. It appears
 that at least some cases of torture by security officials have been referred to the
 courts. In late November, the newly-appointed Attorney General ordered that three
 officers from the criminal investigation department be detained and investigated in
 connection with the use of torture of a witness in a family dispute case. The three
 officers included the head of the antiterrorism unit within the Interior Ministry.
 This officer also had been implicated in the abuse of defendants in the Aden bomb-
 ing case (see Section i.e.).
 The Constitution may be interpreted as permitting amputations in accordance
 with Shari'a. There have been no reports of amputations since st9. However, a
 small number of persons who have been found guilty of theft and sentenced to am-
 putation remain in jail awaiting the implementation of their sentences. The Shari'a-
 based law permits physical punishment such as flogging for minor crimes (e.g., the
 penalty for the consumption of alcohol is 80 lashes). The law also provides for the
 ritual display in public of the bodies of executed criminals. The ostensible purpose
 of this practice is to demonstrate to the families of victims that justice has been
 done and to prevent blood feuds between tribes.
 Prison conditions are poor and do not meet internationally recognized minimum
 standards. Prisons are overcrowded, sanitary conditions are poor, and food and
 health care are inadequate. Inmates must depend on relatives for food and medi-
 cine. Many inmates lack mattresses or bedding. Prison authorities often exact
 money from prisoners and refuse to release prisoners until family members pay a
 bribe. Tribal leaders misuse the prison system by placing "problem" tribesmen in
 
 
 1834
 jail, either to punish them for non-criminal indiscretions or to protect them from re-
 taliation or violence motivated by revenge. Refugees, persons with mental problems,
 and illegal immigrants sometimes are arrested without charge and placed in prisons
 alongside criminals. The newspaper al-Ayyam reported that two mentally disabled
 persons were arrested and imprisoned in the central security prison in al-Dhala fol-
 lowing armed confrontations between authorities and civilians in May and June (see
 Section L.a.) According to a local human rights organization, many instances of tor-
 ture have taken place at Amran prison.
 Conditions are equally poor in women's prisons, where children are likely to be
 incarcerated along with their mothers. By custom and preference, babies born in
 prison generally remain in prison with their mothers. Female prisoners regularly
 are held in jail past the expiration of their sentences, and are not released until a
 male relative arranges their release. Female prisoners sometimes are subject to sex-
 ual harassment and violent interrogation by male police and prison officials. In Sep-
 tember the Government permitted a delegation from Al to visit the central prison
 in Taiz, specifically to check on the condition of female prisoners in that facility. The
 Government also cooperated with Prison Reform International, which visited many
 of the country's main prisons and designed a program to train prison and security
 officials.
 The Government tightly controls access to detention facilities by nongovernmental
 organizations (NGO's), although it sometimes permits local and international
 human rights monitors access to persons accused of crimes. However, the Govern-
 ment does not permit access to political prisoners.
 The Human Rights Committee of the Consultative Council (an advisory board to
 the President) continued to conduct spot checks of prisons and to arrange for the
 expeditious release of persons held improperly. The Committee also investigated the
 death of Wadia al-Shaibani, a youth who apparently was beaten to death while in
 an Aden jail (see Section L.a.). However, the Committee was unable to persuade the
 authorities to investigate the death or to bring charges against security officials.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides due process safeguards;
 however, security forces arbitrarily arrest and detain persons. Enforcement ofthe
 law is irregular and in some cases nonexistent, particularly in cases involving secu-
 rity offenses. According to the law, detainees must be arraigned within 24 hours of
 arrest or be released. The judge or prosecuting attorney must inform the accused
 of the basis for the arrest and decide whether detention is required. In no case may
 a detainee be held longer than 7 days without a court order. Despite these constitu-
 tional and other legal provisions, arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention without
 charge are common practices.
 The law provides detainees with the right to inform their families of their arrests
 and to decline to answer questions without an attorney present. There are provi-
 sions for bail. In practice, many authorities abide by these provisions only if bribed.
 The majority of those detained in late 1997 in connection with the Aden bombings
 (see Section I.e.) were not permitted contact with their families or lawyers until
 many months after their arrest. The trial of 27 of these persons concluded in Octo-
 ber, although, according to the law, the violation of the right to counsel should have
 suspended the case.
 Citizens in southern governorates regularly complained that security officials did
 not observe due process procedures when arresting and detaining suspects, particu-
 larly those accused of involvement in the various bombings and explosions that con-
 tinued to occur in the south during the year. Security forces sometimes detained
 demonstrators (see Section 2.b.).
 In April the Rabeta Party reported that one of its officials, Mohsen Zein Hussein,
 was -arrested by the PSO in Lahaj without a warrant and incarcerated in Sabr pris-
 on. Hussein was released 22 days later without being charged with a crime. He said
 that he had been circulating a petition calling for national reconciliation when the
 authorities detained him. In June the director of Central Security in Aden released
 five persons arrested in connection with the 1997 bombings in that city. The official
 apologized to the men, who had been incarcerated for 4 months, for having impris-
 oned them 'in error."
 In February Mohamed Noman Muqbil, a human rights activist and oppositionist,
 was arrested without a warrant, and later was released without being charged. Ac-
 cording to reliable reports, he apparently was beaten during his detention in
 Rawdah police station in Aden (see Section 1.c.).
 In cases where a criminal suspect is at large, security forces sometimes detain a
 relative while the suspect is being sought. The detention may continue while the
 concerned families negotiate compensation for the alleged wrongdoing. Arbitration,
 rather than the court system, commonly is used to settle cases.
 
 
 1835
 The Government has failed to ensure that detainees and prisoners are incarcer-
 ated only in authorized detention facilities. The Ministry of Interior and the PSO
 operate extrajudicial detention facilities. A large percentage of the total prison popu-
 lation consists of pretrial detainees. Thousands of persons have been imprisoned for
 years without documentation concerning charges against them, their trials, or their
 sentences. Local and international human rights organizations believe that at least
 some of these persons are political detainees.
 While a few cases of those being held without charge have been redressed through
 the efforts of local human rights groups (and a few illegally detained prisoners re-
 leased), the authorities have done nothing to investigate or resolve these cases.
 Unauthorized, private prisons also exist in tribal areas, where the Government
 exercises very little authority. Persons detained in these prisons often are held for
 strictly personal reasons and without trial or sentencing.
 The Government does not use forced exile. However, at the end of the 1994 civil
 war, the Government denied amnesty to the 16 most senior leaders of the secession-
 ist Democratic Republic of Yemen (DRY) who fled abroad. Although they were not
 forced into exile, they are subject to arrest if they return. The trial of the so-called
 "16" concluded in March (see Section I.e.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution provides for an "auton-
 omous" judiciary and independent judges, the judiciary is not fully independent.
 Judges are appointed by the executive branch, and some have been reassigned or
 removed from office following rulings against the Government. Many litigants main-
 tain, and the Government acknowledges, that a judge's social ties and susceptibility
 to bribery sometimes have greater influence on the verdict than the law or the facts
 of the case. Many judges are poorly trained, and some closely associated with the
 Government often render decisions favorable to it. The judiciary is hampered fur-
 ther by the Government's frequent reluctance to implement sentences.
 In June the Government announced a reform of the judiciary that included the
 dismissal of several judges alleged to have been corrupt, incompetent, or both, and
 the appointment of new, and reportedly more competent, judges. In July the Gov-
 ernment cut the size of the Supreme Court from more than 90 judges to approxi-
 mately 40. This reduction followed several months of internal debate over how to
 proceed with the Government's judicial reform program, approved by ministerial de-
 cree in late 1997. The comprehensive reform program envisions improving the oper-
 ational efficiency and statutory independence of the judiciary by putting reform-
 minded personnel into the courts; forming an inter-ministerial council to oversee the
 reform project; publishing a judicial code of ethics; and making the Supreme Court
 smaller, more efficient, and less corrupt. Foreign donors have offered to provide as-
 sistance to the Government in implementing judicial reform. The reform program's
 impact is not yet clear.
 There are five types of courts: criminal, civil (e.g. divorce and inheritance), admin-
 istrative, commercial, and military.
 All courts are governed by Shari'a (Islamic law). There are no jury trials under
 Shari'a. Criminal cases are adjudicated by a judge who plays an active role in ques-
 tioning witnesses and the accused. By law, the Government must provide attorneys
 for indigent defendants. In practice, however, this never occurs; neither the Crimi-
 nal Code nor the judicial budget allows for defense attorneys.
 By law prosecutors are a part of the judiciary and independent of the Govern-
 ment. In practice, however, prosecutors look upon themselves as an extension of the
 police. They do not receive the normal judicial training that judges do, nor do they
 take seriously their legal obligation to penalize police who delay reporting arrests
 and detentions.
 Defense attorneys are allowed to counsel their clients, address the court, and ex-
 amine witnesses. Defendants, including those in commercial courts, have the right
 to appeal their sentences. Trials are public. However, all courts may conduct closed
 sessions "for reasons of public security or morals." Foreign litigants in commercial
 disputes have complained of biased rulings. However, some foreign companies have
 reported winning cases against local defendants and seeing the decisions enforced.
 The law permits, in addition to regular courts, a system of tribal adjudication. The
 results of such mediation carry the same weight as court judgments. This provision
 of law explains in part why so many persons who spend time in jail are never actu-
 ally charged with any crime.
 Prior to unification, approximately half of the judges working in southern Yemen
 were women. However, after the civil war of 1994, fundamentalist leaders of the ju-
 diciary reassigned many southern female judges to administrative or clerical duties.
 Although a few female judges continue to practice in Aden, there are no female
 judges in northern courts.
 
 
 1836
 A trial continued throughout most of the year for a total of 27 suspects charged
 with conspiracy, espionage, and other crimes related to a series of bombings in Aden
 in 1997. The trial did not meet minimum international standards for due process.
 Many of the defendants' confessions apparently were coerced, and the defendants
 were not -permitted to see their lawyers until after the trials began and other de-
 fendants already had testified. In late October, the court sentenced the main sus-
 pect, a Spanish-Syrian national, to death. Five persons were found innocent, 16 re-
 ceived prison sentences of from 1 to 3 years, and the rest were released after the
 judge ruled that they already had served enough time in jail. The Spanish Govern-
 ment and the European Union have asked the Government not to implement the
 death sentence against the Spanish-Syrian defendant.
 The trial of another 31 persons accused of conspiracy against officials in Mahra
 governorate in 1997 also continued throughout the year in a Sana'a court. Several
 of the suspects claimed that they had confessed only because they had been tor-
 tured. The judge overruled a defense request to review evidence of torture. In late
 October, the court sentenced three of the defendants to death, found one innocent,
 and sentenced the others to jail for periods ranging from 6 to 10 years (see Section
 1.c.). The security services made several arrests, brought charges, and put on trial
 a number of persons alleged to be linked to various shootings, explosions, bombings,
 and other acts of violence that continued to plague the southern governorates
 throughout the year. Citizens and human rights groups alleged frequently that the
 judiciary was not observing due process standards in these cases. -
 The Government claims that it holds no political prisoners, and releases no data
 on such cases. However, this claim is disputed by local and international human
 rights groups, which report that various political prisoners were convicted after un-
 fair trials.
 At the end of the 1994- civil war, the President pardoned nearly all had who
 fought against the central Government, including military personnel and most lead-
 ers of the unrecognized DRY. The Government denied this amnesty to the 16 most
 senior leaders of the DRY (one of whom is now presumed dead), who fled abroad
 and who are subject to arrest if they return. In 1997 and 1998 the so-called "16"
 were tried in absentia on various charges including forming a secessionist govern-
 ment, conspiracy, and forming a separate military. All but two were found guilty,
 and in March a judge sentenced five of the defendants to death and three to 10
 years in jail. Six persons received suspended sentences, and two were acquitted.
 Many opposition figures have urged the President to issue an amnesty for those re-
 ceiving sentences, in the interest of promoting reconciliation between north and
 south. The President has stated that it is up to the judicial system to pass judg-
 ment. Defense attorneys have appealed to a higher court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Despite
 constitutional provisions against government interference with privacy, security
 forces routinely search homes and private offices, monitor telephones, read personal
 mail, and otherwise intrude into personal matters for alleged security reasons. Such
 activities are conducted without legally issued warrants or judicial supervision. Se-
 curity forces regularly monitor telephone conversations and interfere with the tele-
 phone service of government critics and opponents. Security forces sometimes detain
 relatives of suspects (see Section 1.d.).
 The law prevents arrests between the hours of sundown and dawn. However, per-
 sons suspected of crimes sometimes are taken from their homes in the middle of the
 night, without search warrants.
 Jews traditionally face social (but not legal) restrictions on their residence and
 their employment (see Section 5).
 According to a 1995 Ministry of Interior regulation, no citizen may marry a for-
 eigner without Interior Ministry permission. This regulation does not carry the force
 of law, and appears to be irregularly enforced. However, some human rights groups
 have raised concerns about the regulation.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution restricts the freedom of speech
 and of the press "within the limits of the law." Although most citizens are uninhib-
 ited in their private discussions of domestic and foreign policies, some are cautious
 in public, fearing harassment for criticism of the Government. The Press Law crim-
 inalizes "the humiliation of the State, the Cabinet, or parliamentary institutions,"
 and the publication of "false information" that "threatens public order or the public
 interest.' The Government influences the media and limits press freedom. Some se-
 curity officials attempt to influence press coverage by threatening, harassing, and
 detaining journalists.
 
 
 1837
 
 The relative freedom of the press permitted between unification (1990) and the
 civil war (1994) has not been reestablished. An atmosphere of government pressure
 on independent and political party journals continues that was not present before
 the civil war. The international human rights group, the Committee to Protect Jour-
 nalists (CPJ), criticized the Government for restrictions, harassment, and arbitrary
 detention directed at journalists.
 The Ministry of Information influences the media by its control of most printing
 presses, by subsidies to certain newspapers, and by its ownership of the country's
 sole television and radio outlets. Only one newspaper, the twice-weekly Aden inde-
 pendent Al-Ayyam, owns its own press. The Government selects the items to be cov-
 ered in news broadcasts, and does not permit broadcast reporting critical of the Gov-
 ernment. Televised debates in the Parliament are edited to delete such criticism.
 After more than 7 years, the Government implemented regulations for the 1990
 Press Law. The new regulations specify, among other things, that newspapers must
 apply annually to the Government for licensing renewal, and that they must show
 continuing evidence of about $5,000 (700,00 Yemeni riyals) in operating capital.
 Some journalists welcomed the new regulations, saying that they were long overdue.
 Others claimed thet the regulations are designed to drive some opposition papers
 out of business. Al-Ayyam, the largest-circulating newspaper in the country, re-
 ported that the Government was using the new regulations to deny it a license to
 publish a newspaper about sports, even though the newspaper claimed to have com-
 plied with the requirements of the law.
 Although newspapers are allowed to criticize the Government, journalists some-
 times censor themselves, especially when writing on such sensitive issues as govern-
 ment policies toward the southern governorates, relations with Saudi Arabia and
 other foreign governments, or official corruption. The penalties for exceeding these
 self-imposed limits can be arrest for libel, dismissal from employment, or extralegal
 harassment. Some journalists reported being threatened by security officials to
 change the tone and substance of their reporting. Journalists must have a permit
 to travel abroad, although enforcement of this restriction is irregular (see Section
 2.d.).
 In January author and journalist All Abdullah al-Kutheri and Mohsen al-Amoudi,
 both officials of the Rabeta party, were arrested at Rayan airport near Mukallah
 when they attempted to board a flight to Saudi Arabia. Their passports were con-
 fiscated  temporarily (see  Section  2.d.). An  Aden  reporter for al-Ayyam,
 Abdulrahman All Khubara, was held for questioning by the authorities following an
 August trip to Cairo (see Section 2.d.).
 In March the Sana'a prosecutor responsible for press matters brought a case
 against al-Thawri, the newspaper of the Socialist Party, for articles criticizing the
 Government. Three al-Thawri journalists reported being interrogated at length by
 the prosecutor's office. The case was still under review at year's end.
 In May three journalists from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) were
 arrested after they traveled to a tribal area that the Government considered unsafe.
 The BBC crew claimed that it had prior government permission to visit the area,
 but the authorities disputed this. Eventually the journalists were put on trial, but
 the judge dropped the case within 24 hours.
 In June security officials ordered the newspaper al-Ayyam, which had been cover-
 ing the Aden bombing trial on a regular basis, to cease publishing any news relating
 to that case. The Government also prohibited the local correspondent from the
 Qatar-based Jazeera television channel from transmitting footage of the trial. The
 Government claimed that reporting on the case would violate the press and national
 security laws.
 The Government, purportedly to avoid inflaming the situation further, withheld
 film footage taken during riots that took place in Sana'a and other cities in late
 June (see Section l.a.). The correspondent for the Qatar-based al-Jazeera television
 channel reported that his film was confiscated by security officials. However, the
 Government allowed televised coverage of the Parliament's criticism the Govern-
 ment's handling of the crisis. The Ministry of Information later referred five
 unnamed newspapers to the courts.
 In July government officials called in journalists working for foreign media outlets
 and warned them about publishing news involving national security matters. No
 judgment has yet been rendered in the Government's case against the newspaper
 al-Shoura, which dates to 1995. The case involved two journalists for the newspaper
 who had been found guilty of slander and character assassination against an impor-
 tant sheikh, a leader of the Islaah Party. The judge ordered that the newspaper be
 shut down, and that the journalists be flogged 80 lashes, stopped from working for
 one year, and fined 100,000 riyals ($800). The Ministry of Justice suspended this
 
 
 1838
 
 judgment while reviewing its conformity with law and judicial procedure. Mean-
 while, al-Shoura continues to operate.
 In September a judge issued a ruling against Muhammad al-Saqqaf, a journalist
 and former university law professor accused of writing articles critical of the Gov-
 ernment in the weekly Government-controlled newspaper al-Wahda in 1996. Specifi-
 cally, al-Saqqaf had questioned the Government's handling of preparations for the
 1997 election. The judge ordered both al-Saqqaf and the newspaper to each pay a
 fine of approximately $35,000 (5 million riyals). Al-Saqqaf also was ordered to apolo-
 gize to the Supreme Elections Committee.
 In November the Special Media Court filed a case against Abdul Aziz al-Saqqaf,
 the editor of the English-language weekly Yemen Times, for publishing a story ques-
 tioning the disposition of government profits from oil exports.
 Customs officials confiscate foreign publications regarded as pornographic or ob-
 jectionable because of religious or political content. The Ministry of Information rou-
 tinely delayed the distribution of international Arabic-language dailies such as al-
 Hayat and al-Sharq al-Awsat in an apparent effort to decrease their sales in the
 country.
 An author must obtain a permit from the Ministry of Culture to publish a book.
 Most books are approved, but the process is time-consuming for the author. The au-
 thor must submit copies of the book to ,the Ministry. Officials at the National Li-
 brary must read and endorse the text. It is then submitted to a special committee
 for final approval. If a book is not deemed appropriate for publication, the Ministry
 simply does not issue a decision. Publishers do not usually deal with an author who
 has not yet obtained the permit.
 Academic freedom is somewhat restricted by the extreme politicization of univer-
 sity campuses. A majority of professors and students align themselves with either
 the ruling GPC party or the opposition Islaah Party. Each group closely monitors
 the activities of the other. In contrast to past years, there were no reports during
 the year of Islaah members harassing students and professors. Top administrative
 positions usually are awarded to political allies of these two major parties.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There are no constitutional re-
 strictions on the right to assemble peacefully, although the Government requires a
 permit for these purposes. Government informers monitor meetings and assemblies.
 Following the demonstrations of June and July, the Government sent a draft law
 to Parliament in September that would impose significant limitations on the right
 to assemble and to demonstrate. The draft law aroused controversy among many
 lawyers, human rights activists, and members of Parliament. The Parliament so far
 has refused to take action on this proposed new law.
 In April police killed two protesters in Mukallah during demonstrations that
 turned violent. Demonstrators claimed that police opened fire without provocation.
 The authorities claimed that demonstrators instigated the clashes (see Section L.a.).
 In late June and July, demonstrations in the cities led to clashes between security
 forces and civilians in which some persons were killed (see Section l.a.). Two opposi-
 tion demonstrations took place-in Lahaj and Mukallah on June 29 and 30, respec-
 tively, in the wake of intense public criticism directed against the Government's lift-
 ing of subsidies on commodities. Opposition leaders applied for and received per-
 mits, and both events occurred without violence. The opposition claimed that 21 of
 its leaders were arrested prior to the march. In August several opposition figures
 were briefly detained after a peaceful demonstration in Abyan. They later were re-
 leased without charge.
 There are no constitutional restrictions on the freedom of association, and the
 Government generally respects this right in practice. Associations must obtain an
 operating license from the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, usually a routine
 matter.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion. Although followers of other
 religions are free to worship according to their beliefs, there are some restrictions
 on their other activities, including a ban on proselytizing.
 Virtually all citizens are Muslims, either of the Zaydi branch of Shi'a Islam or the
 Shafa'i branch of Sunni Islam. There are also some Ismailis in the north. Private
 Islamic organizations may maintain ties to pan-Islamic organizations and operate
 schools, but the Government monitors their activities.
 Most Christians are foreign residents, except for a few families of Indian origin
 in Aden. There are several churches and Hindu temples in Aden, but no non-Muslim
 public places of worship exist in the former North Yemen. Church services are held
 regularly without harassment in private homes or facilities such as schools. How-
 ever, security forces occasionally censor the mail of Christian clergy who minister
 to the foreign community, ostensibly to prevent proselytizing.
 
 
 1839
 
 Nearly all Yemen's once sizable Jewish population has emigrated. There are no
 legal restrictions on the few hundred Jews who remain, although there are tradi-
 tional restrictions on places of residence and choice of employment (see Section 5).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In general, the Government does not obstruct domestic travel, although
 the army and security forces maintain checkpoints on major roads. Human rights
 groups reported several violent incidents at checkpoints during the year, although
 responsibility for instigatingthe violence was not clear. In May Mohamed Thabit
 al-Zubeidi, a resident of al-Dhala, was shot and killed as he crossed a checkpoint
 in that town. His companions returned fire, killing three soldiers (see Section 1.b.).
 Three tribal sheikhs were killed at a checkpoint in Jawf in August (see Section 1l.a.).
 It was not clear who was responsible for that incident.
 In certain areas, armed tribesmen occasionally man checkpoints alongside mili-
 tary or security officials, and subject travelers to physical harassment and theft.
 The Government does not routinely obstruct foreign travel or the right to emi-
 grate and return. Journalists must have a permit to travel abroad. Women must ob-
 tain permission from a male relative before applying for a passport or departing the
 country. Enforcement of the restrictions on journalists and women is irregular. In
 January the author and journalist All Abdullah al-Kutheri and Mohsen al-Amoudi,
 both officials of the Rabeta party, were arrested at Rayan airport near Mukallah
 when they attempted o board a fight to Saudi Arabia (see Section 2.a.). Their pass-
 ports were confiscated temporarily. An Adeni reporter for Al Ayyam, Abdulrahman
 All Khubara, was held for questioning by the authorities following a trip to Cairo
 in August (see Section 2.a.).
 Immigrants and refugees traveling within the country often are required by secu-
 rity officials at government checkpoints to show that they possess resident status
 or refugee identification cards.
 The Government in 1997 offered first asylum to some 51,500 Somali refugees who
 fled the fighting in that country. It also cooperated with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UINHCR) in assisting refugees from Eritrea (2,500 per-
 sons), Ethiopia (1,200 persons) and various other countries (750 persons). The Gov-
 ernment permitted the UNHCR to monitor the situation of 20,000 Iraqis in Yemen.
 The UNHCR provides food and medical assistance to up to 9,000 Somalis and
 Ethiopians in a temporary refugee camp at al-Jahin in Abyan governorate. Children
 receive schooling in the camp, and adults are eligible for vocational training. The
 Government has approved a new UNHCR facility to be built at a site in Lahaj
 governorate.
 The law does not include provisions for granting refugee or asylee status in ac-
 cordance with the provisions of the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of
 Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. The Government has granted refugee status to some
 persons and resettled them. Approximately 30,000 Somali refugees have now been
 integrated into society and are no longer receiving food or financial assistance from
 the UNHCR. However, they still are eligible for medical treatment at UNHCR facili-
 ties in Aden and Sana'a. Also, the UNHCR provides small loans to refugee women
 who wish to initiate income-generating activities.
 The UNHCR reports that the Government consults with it prior to returning fie-
 gal immigrants to their countries of origin in order to avoid the involuntary repatri-
 ation of refugees with a credible fear of persecution. There were no reports of the
 forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution. The bUNHCR
 facilitated the voluntary repatriation of some Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees, as
 well as the voluntary return of 700 Somali refugees to areas of Somalia that are
 considered safe.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the Government is by law accountable to the Parliament, there re sig-
 nificant limitations on the ability of citizens to change their government. Inter-
 national observers judged the 1997 parliamentary elections as "reasonably free and
 fair" despite some problems associated with the voting. However, the Parliament is
 not yet an effective counterweight to executive authority. Decisionmaking and real
 political power still rest in the hands of a few leaders, particularly the President.
 The President appoints the Prime Minister, who forms the Government. The Cabi-
 net consists of 24 ministers. Parliament is elected by universal adult suffrage; the
 first such election was held in 1993.
 The President has the authority to introduce legislation and promulgate laws by
 decree when Parliament is not in session. Decrees must be approved by Parliament
 30 days after reconvening. In theory, if a decree is not approved, it does not become
 law; in practice, a decree remains in effect even if not approved. Although the Con-
 
 
 1840
 stitution also permits Parliament to initiate legislation, to date it has not done so.
 Its major activity consists of debating policies tat the Government already has im-
 plemented. However, despite the fact that the President's party enjoys an absolute
 majority in Parliament, it has rejected or delayed action on legislation introduced
 by the Government. The Parliament also has criticized strongly the Government for
 some actions, including the June lifting of subsidies that led to widespread violence.
 The Parliament also called on the Government to investigate the continuing prob-
 lem of violence, includin bombings and explosions, in the south. Parliamentarians
 and parliamentary staff attended foreign nongovernmental organization (NGO)-
 sponsored training workshops designed to increase their independence and effective-
 ness.
 By-elections were held in four constituencies during the year in order to fill va-
 cant parliamentary seats. European observers reported no serious problems with
 these elections.
 The President is advised by a 59-member Consultative Council, a board of ap-
 pointed notables chaired by a former prime minister. The Council reviews and ad-
 vises the President on all laws that are submitted to the Chamber of Deputies. The
 Council has no constitutional powers.
 Government authority is centralized in Sana'a; many citizens, especially in the
 south, complain about the inability of local and governorate entities to make policy
 or resource decisions. In some governorates, tribal leaders retain considerable dis-
 cretion in the interpretation and enforcement of the law. Central government au-
 thority in these areas is often weak.
 The multiparty system is functional but arguably weaker than in 1993, when the
 first parliamentary elections were held. The GPC clearly dominates the Parliament,
 and Islaah is the oniy other party of significance. All parties must be registered in
 accordance with the Political Parties Law of 1991, which stipulates that each party
 must have at least 75 founders a   t least 2,500 members. Some oppositionists
 complain that they cannot organize new parties because of the prohibitively high
 legal minimums on the number of members and leaders. Twelve parties participated
 in the 1997 elections, compared With 16 in 1993. The YSf land several smaller par-
 ties boycotted the elections, leading to lower voter tursout in the south than in
 1993.
 The Constitution prohibits the establishment of parties that are contrary to Islam,
 oppose the goals of the Yemeni revolution, or violate Yemen's international commit-
 ments. The Government provides financial support to all parties represented in Par-
 liament, including a small stipend to publish their own newspapers.
 Although women vote and hold office, these rights often are limited by cultural
 and religious customs. Two women were elected to the Parliament in 1997 (the same
 number as in 1993), and few hold senior leadership positions in the Government or
 political parties. GPC members attended a foreign NG0-conducted workshop on how
 to better include women in the party's membership, leadership positions, and delib-
 erations. Many Akhdam, a small ethnic minority that may be descendants of Afri-
 can slaves, and some members of religious minorities are not permitted to partici-
 pate in the political process, mainly due to their inability to obtain citizenship.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestgation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The concept of local nongovernmental human rights organizations is relatively
 new, with the first groups forming oniy in the years since unification. Several
 groups held workshops and other activities during the year without government in-
 terference and occasionally with government support. The Government cooperates
 with NGO's, although NGO's complain that there is a lack of response to their re-
 quests from government officials. The Government's ability to be responsive is lim-
 ited in part by a lack of material and human resources. The Government introduced
 a new draft law for regulating the formation nd activities of NGO's. While more
 liberal than the law it is designed to replace, the proposal still contains significant
 limitations on such organizations. The Parliament has yet to take anyaction on the
 proposed new law.
 Several new NGO's devoted to human rights education and democratization have
 organized in recent years. The Taiz-based Human Rights Information and Training
 Center (HRITC), the most prominent of these, has sponsored training workshops for
 other NGO's. Several donors have contributed support to the HRITC.
 The Yemeni Organization for the Defense of Liberties and Human Rights, the
 only NGO without government sponsorship that engages in human rights advocacy
 as such, is based in Aden. Although the organization continued to suffer from a lack
 of funds, it actively publicized human rights abuses, particularly in the south. In
 September in conjunction with the Aden branch of Amnesty International the orga-
 
 
 1841
 
 nization sponsored a photographic exhibition of human rights abuses committed in
 the course of the 1994 civil war.
 The Committee to Combat Torture was formed in April. The Committee is com-
 posed of 100 senior parliamentarians and party leaders, including some opposition
 members. Several members of the Committee investigated the violent incidents that
 occurred in al-Dhala in May and June in which four persons died (see Sections l.a.
 and 2.d.).
 The Yemeni Human Rights Organization (YHRO) is the most well-organized local
 human rights group. It is headquartered in Sana'a with branches in seven other cit-
 ies. It was foundedby the Government, and oppositionists as well as some human
 rights experts have viewed its findings as not objective. However, the head of the
 YHRO, a prominent member of the judiciary, was transferred in June from his post
 as head of the Sana'a Court of Appeals to the Dhamar Court of Appeals. This was
 seen by some observers as a demotion or an attempt by the Government to
 marginalize the judge, who was seen as too independent on human rights questions.
 In May the YHRO sponsored a training seminar for judges, prosecutors, and secu-
 rity officials.
 The Center for Future Studies, a think tank affiliated with the Islaah party,
 issues a report on human rights practices.
 In June Prison Reform International (PRI), a London-based international organi-
 zation, conducted a fact-finding mission to Yemen. It identified several issues of con-
 cern, including the mistreatment of prisoners, lack of education and resources for
 prison officials, and unsanitary and overcrowded conditions. In late 1998, the PRI
 opened a temporary office in Sana'a and organized training workshops and other ac-
 tivities for prison and security officials.
 Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Parliament of the European
 Union, and the Committee to Protect Journalists observe the country closely. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) maintains a resident representa-
 tive in Yemen. The Government has given these groups broad access to government
 officials, records, refugee camps, and prisons. The Government had acknowledged
 some abuses alleged in a 1997 AI report and had promised to investigate them.
 However, the Government rejected other allegations in the Amnesty report.
 The Supreme National Committee for Human Rights, which was formed in 1997
 and reports to the Deputy Prime Minister/Ministr of Foreign Affairs, is charged
 with ensuring that Yemen meets its obligations with respect to implementing inter-
 national human rights conventions. The Committee is also expected to look into spe-
 cific instances of abuse. In March the Supreme Committee sponsored human rights
 education training in four cities. However, the Supreme Committee has beenless
 active in looking into specific cases of abuse. Many persons alleged that the Commit-
 tee has not followed up on its stated commitment to investigate allegations of
 human rights abuses. For example, the Supreme Committee declined to investigate
 the case of Wadia al-Shaibani, who reportedly died while in the custody of security
 forces in Aden (see Section l.a.). Instead, the Committee accepted the official coro-
 ner's report-of death by suicide. The Committee is hampered by a lack of human
 and material resources.
 The Human Rights Committee of the President's Consultative Council had limited
 success in investigating human rights abuses. However, members of the Committee
 expressed frustration at the lack of subsequent action by the authorities.
 A parliamentary human rights committee has investigated some reports of human
 rights abuses. It suffers from lack of official and financial support and has no au-
 thority to do anything except issue reports.
 The UNHRC, while maintaining a file on Yemen, elected to take no actions
 against the Government during the year, pending an assessment of the Govern-
 ment's action on current and past cases. Two delegations from the UNHRC visited
 late in the year. The purpose of one delegation was to determine what progress the
 Government had made on cases of "disappearances" (see Section l.b.). The other
 conducted an assessment of the Government's need for technical assistance, particu-
 larly for the Supreme National Committee on Human Rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Prior to 1994, the Constitution stated that "no discrimination shall be practiced
 due to sex, color, racial origin, language, occupation, social status, or religious be-
 liefs." However, as amended in 1994, the Constitution now states that "all citizens
 are equal in general rights and duties". Discrimination based on race, sex, disability,
 and, to a lesser extent, religion, exists.
 Women.-Although spousal abuse is reportedly common, it is generally undocu-
 mented. In Yemen's traditional society, an abused woman would be expected to take
 
 
 1842
 
 her complaints to a male relative (rather than the authorities), who should intercede
 on her behalf or provide her sanctuary if required. Only recently has the press
 begun to investigate or report on violations of women's rights.
 Women face significant restrictions imposed by law, social custom, and religion.
 Men are permitted to take as many as four wives, though few do so. By law the
 minimum age of marriage is 15. However, the law largely is unenforced, and some
 girls marry as early as age 12. During the year, some conservative Members of Par-
 liament attempted to eliminate the "minimum age" requirement on the grounds that
 parents should decide when their daughters are old enough to marry. Their draft
 faw failed by a large majority, leaving the minimum age at- 15. A 1998 draft law
 to raise the minimum age of marriage also failed by- a large majority. The law stipu-
 lates that the wife's "consent" is required; "consent" is defined as "silence" for pre-
 viously unwed women and "pronouncement of consent" for divorced women. The
 husband and the wife's "guardian" (usually her father) sign the marriage contract;
 in the former South Yemen, the wife also signs. The practice of dowry payments is
 widespread, despite efforts to limit the size of such payments.
 The law stipulates that the wife must obey the husband. She must live with him
 at the place stipulated in the contract; consummate the marriage, and not leave the
 home without his consent. Husbands may divorce wives without justifying their ac-
 tion in court. Theoretically women have the legal right to divorce. However, in prac-
 tice women divorce only when their husbands have failed to provide for them. Fol-
 lowing a divorce, the family home and older children often are awarded to the hus-
 band. The divorced woman usually returns to her father's home, or to the home of
 another male relative. Her former husband must continue to support her for another
 3 months, since she cannot remarry until she proves that she is not pregnant.
 Women seeking to travel abroad must obtain permission from their husbands or
 fathers to receive a passport and to travel. They also are expected to be accom-
 panied by male relatives. However, enforcement of this requirement is irregular.
 Islamic law permits a Muslim man to marry a Christian or Jewish woman, but
 no Muslim woman may marry outside of Islam. Married women do not have the
 right to confer citizenship on their foreign-born spouses; however,- they may confer
 citizenship on children born in Yemen of foreign-born fathers. " -
 According to a 1995 Interior Ministry regulation, any citizen who wishes to marry
 a foreigner must obtain the permission of the Ministry. A Yemeni woman wishing
 to marry a foreigner must present proof of her parents' approval to the Interior Min-
 istry. A foreign woman who wishes to marry a Yemeni man must prove to the Min-
 istry that she is "of good conduct and behavior," and "is free from contagious dis-
 ease." There are no corresponding requirements for men to demonstrate parental
 approval, good conduct, or freedom from contagious diseases. Although the regula-
 tion does not have the force of law and is applied irregularly, some human rights
 groups have raised concerns about it.
 An estimated 80 percent of women are illiterate, compared with approximately 35
 percent of men. The fertility rate-is 6.7 children per woman. Most women have no
 access to basic health care. Only approximately 16 percent of births are attended
 by trained health-care personnel.-Even where clinics are available, many women do
 not use them because their male relatives, or they themselves, refuse to allow a
 male doctor to examine them.
 In general, women in the south, particularly in Aden, are better educated and
 have had somewhat greater employment opportunities than their northern counter-
 parts. However, since the 1994 civil war the number of working women in the south
 appears to have declined, due not only to the stagnant econony but also to increas-
 ing cultural pressure from the north.
 A government-sponsored women's association promotes female education and civic
 responsibilities, and an NGO also has been established for the same purpose. Sev-
 eral women's groups have formed and registered with the Government
 Children.-While the Government has asserted its commitment to protect chil-
 dren's rights, it lacks the resources necessary to ensure adequate health care, edu-
 cation, and welfare services for children. The U.N. Development-Program estimates
 that 30 percent of children are malnourished. The infant mortality rate is 105
 deaths per 1,000 births.
 The law provides for universal free education for 9 years, but this provision is not
 enforced. Many children, especially girls, do not attend primary school. An esti-
 mated 6.5 percent of primary school-aged children do not attend. Some rural areas
 have no schools for their school-age population. The Parliament in mid-year passed
 a law eliminating school fees and the requirement of uniforms for girls. This law
 is designed to encourage girls' attendance at school.
 Child marriage is common, especially in rural areas. Although the law requires
 that a girl be 15 to marry, it is not enforced. Marriages of 12-year-old girls are not
 
 
 1843
 unusual. Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by inter-
 national health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is
 practiced by some citizens. According to a 1997 demographic survey conducted by
 the Government, nearly one-fourth (23 percent) of women who have ever been mar-
 ried have been subjected to FGM. However, the prevalence of the practice varies
 substantially by region. Citizens of African origin or those living in communities
 with heavy African influence are more likely to engage in FGM. For example, ac-
 cording to the survey, approximately 69 percent of women living in coastal areas
 were subjected to FGM, compared with 15 percent in mountainous regions, and 5
 percent in the plateau and desert regions. The procedure is mainly confined to exci-
 sion, with infibulation being practiced only among East African immigrants and ref-
 ugees. FGM rarely is reported among the Shafai religious sect, and adherents to
 the Zaydi sect reputedly do not practice it at all. The Government's publication of
 the data on FGM is an important first step in addressing this problem. While some
 government health workers actively and publicly discourage the practice, the Gov-
 ernment has not passed legislation to outlaw it, nor have women s groups adopted
 the problem as a major concern.
 People With Disabilities.-Persons with mental and physical disabilities face dis-
 tinct social prejudices, as well as discrimination in education and employment. The
 Government has not enacted legislation or otherwise mandated accessibility for the
 disabled, nor provided special clinics or schools for them. Many disabled persons are
 reduced to begging in order to support themselves. Mentally ill patients, particularly
 those who commit crimes, are imprisoned and even shackled when there is no one
 to care for them. The ICRC, in cooperation with the Yemeni Red Crescent Society,
 built and now staffs separate detention facilities for mentally disabled prisoners.
 These new facilities are located in Sana'a, Ibb, and Taiz, and collectively can care
 for a population of 300 persons.
 Religious Minorities.-Apart from a small but undetermined number of Christians
 and Hindus in Aden, and a few Baha'is in the north, Jews are the only indigenous
 religious minority. Their numbers have diminished dramatically-from several tens
 of thousands to a few hundred-due to voluntary emigration. Although the law
 makes no distinction, Jews traditionally are restricted to living in one section of a
 city or village and often are confined to a limited choice of employment, usually
 farming or handicrafts. Jews may, and do, own real property.
 Christian clergy who minister to the foreign community are employed in teaching,
 social services, and health care. Occasionally the security authorities harass such
 clergy by censoring their mail, ostensibly to prevent proselytizing (see Section 2.c.).
 In July a gunman murdered three nuns belonging to the Sisters of Charity order
 in Hodeidah. The attack did not appear to be part of an organized campaign against
 Christians or foreigners.
 A hospital in Jibla operated by the Baptist church in the past experienced occa-
 sional threats and harassment from local Islamic extremists who feared that the
 hospital might be used to spread Christianity.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Yemenis with a non-Yemeni parent, called
 "muwalladin," sometimes face discrimination in employment and in other areas.
 Persons who seek employment at Sana'a University or admission to the military
 academy must by law demonstrate that they have two Yemeni parents. Nonetheless,
 many senior government officials, including Members of Parliament and ministers,
 have only one Yemeni parent. In some cases, naturalization of the non-Yemeni par-
 ent is sufficient to overcome the "two-Yemeni parent" requirement.
 A small group of persons claiming to be the descendants of ancient Ethiopian oc-
 cupiers of Yemen, who later were enslaved, are considered the lowest social class.
 Known as the "Akhdam" (servants), they live in squalor and endure persistent social
 discrimination.
 There were reports by human rights groups that some immigrants of African ori-
 gin were having difficulty in securing Interior Ministry permission to marry Yemeni
 citizens. An Interior Ministry regulation requires that marriages of citizens and for-
 eigners be approved in advance by the Ministry.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides that citizens have the
 right to form unions. While the Government permits this right in practice, it also
 seeks to place its own personnel in positions of influence inside unions and syn-
 dicates. The 1995 Labor Law (amended in 1997) provides both for the right to form
 unions and for the right to strike. For example, a strike is not allowed unless a dis-
 pute between workers and employers is "final" and "incontestable" (a prior attempt
 must have been made to settle through negotiation or arbitration). The proposal to
 strike must be submitted to at least 60 percent of all concerned workers, of whom
 
 
 1844
 25 percent must vote in favor of the proposal. Strikes for explicit "political purposes"
 are prohibited. In practice the law tends to discourage strikes. The law provides
 equal labor rights for women, and it renews the freedom of workers to associate.
 The Labor Law does not stipulate a minimum membership for unions, nor does it
 limit them to a specific enterprise or firm. Thus, citizens may associate by profes-
 sion or trade.
 The Yemeni Confederation of Labor Unions (YCLU) remains the sole national um-
 brella organization. The YCLU claims 350,000 members in 15 unions and denies
 any association with the Government, although it works closely with the Govern-
 ment to resolve labor disputes through negotiation. Observers suggest that the Gov-
 ernment likely would not tolerate the establishment of an alternative labor federa-
 tion unless it believed it to be in its best interests.
 By law civil servants and public sector workers, and some categories of farm
 workers, may not join unions. Only the General Assembly of the YCLU may dissolve
 unions.
 In September there was a 2-day strike by personnel of the Yemen-Hunt petroleum
 company.
 The YCLU is affiliated with the Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the for-
 merly Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1995 Labor Law provides
 workers with the right to organize and bargain collectively. The Government per-
 mits these activities; however, it seeks to influence them by placing its own person-
 nel inside groups and organizations. All collective bargaining agreements must be
 deposited with and reviewed by the Ministry of Labor; such agreements exist.
 Unions may negotiate wage settlements for their members and can resort to strikes
 or other actions to achieve their demands.
 The law protects employees from antiunion discrimination. Employers do not have
 the right to dismiss an employee for union activities. Employees may appeal cases
 of antiunion discrimination to the Ministry of Labor. Employees also may take a
 case to the labor courts, which are often favorably disposed toward workers, espe-
 cially if the employer is a foreign company.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there were no reports of its practice. The law does not spe-
 cifically prohibit forced or bonded labor by children, but such practices are not
 known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Child
 labor is common, especially in rural areas. Many children are compelled to work in
 subsistence farming because of the substandard economic situations of their fami-
 lies. Even in urban areas, children may be observed working in stores and work-
 shops, selling goods on the streets, and begging. The law does not specifically pro-
 hibit forced or bonded labor by children, but such practices are not known to occur
 (see Section 6.c.).
 The established minimum age for employment is 15 in the private sector and 18
 in the public sector. By special permit, children between the ages of 12 and 15 may
 work. The Government rarely enforces these provisions, especially in rural and re-
 mote areas. The Government also does not enforce laws regarding compulsory edu-
 cation for children, and the likelihood that many school-aged children are working
 instead of attending school is high.
 The results of the 1994 national census showed that 231,655 children between the
 ages of 10 and 14 years, or 6.5 percent of all children in that age group, were work-
 ing. Experts believe that the number has increased since 1994.-
 At the suggestion of the Swedish NGO Radda Barnen (Save the Children), the
 Government in late. 1997 established a national inter-ministerial committee to com-
 bat child labor. It is headed by the Minister of Labor and includes representatives
 of various government agencies and nongovernmental groups. The Government is
 working to develop a national strategy, a work plan, and a time frame for comple-
 tion of its activities. It is also consulting with the International Labor Organization
 in formulating its strategy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no established minimum wage for any
 type of employment. The Labor Law states that "it shall not be permissible that the
 minimal level of the wage of a worker should be less than the minimal wages of
 government civil servants." According to the Ministry of Labor, the average mini-
 mum' wage of civil servants for 1994-95 was approximately $45 to-$53 (6,000 to
 7,000 riyals) per month. Private sector workers, especially skilled technicians, do far
 better. The average wage does not provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and a family. A combination of inflation, the loss of government-provided subsidies,
 
 
 1845
 and an erosion in the exchange value of the national currency has eroded wages
 substantially during the past few years.
 The law specifies a 40-hour workweek with a maximum 8-hour workday, but
 many workshops and stores operate 10 to 12-hour shifts without penalty. The work-
 week for government employees is 35 hours: 6 hours per day Saturday through
 Wednesday, and 5 hours on Thursday.
 The Ministry of Labor has the responsibility for regulating workplace health and
 safety conditions. However, according to officials in the Ministry, the requisite legis-
 lation for regulating occupational health is nonexistent. They claim that many work-
 ers regularly are exposed to toxic industrial products and respiratory illnesses. Some
 foreign-owned companies implement higher health, safety, and environmental
 standards than the Government requires. Workers have the right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations and can challenge dismissals in court.
