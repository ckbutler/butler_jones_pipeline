 BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a multiparty democracy. The Constitution vests
 executive power in the President, currently Quett K. J.
 Masire, who was reelected in 1989 for a second full 5-year
 term. The President selects the Cabinet from the unicameral
 National Assembly. While there are several active political
 parties in Botswana, in practice the country's politics are
 dominated by the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP). All
 citizens, including whites, are free to participate fully in
 the economic and political life of Botswana.
 Botswana's army, the Botswana Defense Force (BDF), consists of
 5,200 soldiers. The National Police Force numbers about
 2,900. Both the BDF and the police are subordinate to
 civilian authority. Expansion of the army has continued, even
 though the justification of incursions by the South African
 Defense Force (SADF) against suspected African National
 Congress (ANC) targets in Botswana has been partially eclipsed
 by events in South Africa. Since 1989 the army has taken a
 lower profile in internal security operations but was a target
 of criticism in 1990 over two shootings that claimed civilian
 lives: one at a security checkpoint, the second near a
 military facility. In response to the public outcry over
 these shootings, the BDF changed its rules of.engagement to
 require stricter grounds for suspicion before opening fire.
 Botswana has a mixed economy and strongly encourages private
 enterprise. Fueled by the development of mineral resources,
 especially diamonds, the country's economy has grown at a
 rapid rate with real gross domestic product (GDP) growth
 averaging almost 9 percent annually since 1980. Since
 independence in 1966, per capita GDP has increased from $69 to
 approximately $2,000 in 1989. This is statistically illusory,
 however, since some 75 percent of Botswana's population lives
 in rural areas and remains largely dependent for its
 livelihood on subsistence farming and animal husbandry.
 Botswana's laws provide for a broad range of individual rights
 and freedoms which, in general, are observed in practice.
 However, women face significant legal and practical
 discrimination. Violence against women is an issue of
 increasing concern. Although offenders are sometimes
 penalized, police beatings of detainees remained a problem.
 Legal restrictions on trade unions were also a continuing
 problem, but Parliament was debating labor law reform at
 year's end. A rare occurrence of politically related violence
 occurred in August when 9 people were injured in clashes
 between police and opposition supporters protesting a
 by-election loss.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reported killings instigated either by the
 Government or opposition groups. The last casualty resulting
 from South African incursions against suspected ANC targets
 occurred in 1988, but a still unsolved murder in April 1990 of
 an Asian merchant and his family may have been linked to the
 political conflicts in South Africa.
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 There are continuing credible reports that police occasionally
 beat suspects and detainees, although the practice is not
 routine and has been condemned by the Minister of Presidential
 Affairs and the Police Commissioner. Police officers who are
 found to have abused suspects are subject to both internal
 disciplinary procedures and criminal prosecution. Attorneys,
 however, find that allegations of beatings against police are
 difficult to prove in practice. They state that if police
 beat suspects, they ensure suspects are detained for the full
 48 hours allowed by law before arraignment, so that marks can
 heal. Nonetheless, three policemen were convicted and were
 given prison terms of 9 and 18 months in August 1990 for
 torturing a suspect. Minister of Presidential Affairs Merafhe
 also recently revealed to Parliament that in 1988, 13
 policemen were disciplined for maltreatment of arrestees.
 Police also have been successfully sued in civil court for
 abusing arrestees. For example, in February a businesswoman
 won a suit dating to 1986 for mistreatment.
 There were no reports in 1990 of women being raped or
 subjected to other abuses while in custody. Flogging is
 commonly used as a sentence for men for a variety of offenses,
 including violation of prison rules, rape, armed robbery,
 burglary, and related offenses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Citizens are protected from arbitrary arrest under the
 Constitution. In most cases, police have 48 hours after an
 arrest within which the suspect must be charged before a
 magistrate. Once a suspect has appeared before a magistrate,
 he or she may be detained only if the magistrate issues a writ
 of detention, which is valid for 14 days and renewable every
 14 days thereafter. There are complaints that police and
 rangers from the Department of Wildlife sometimes hold people
 longer than the prescribed 48 hours, but it is not a general
 practice, and offending officers on occasion have been
 punished or sued successfully in civil actions. There were no
 reported examples of excessive detention in 1990.
 These detention provisions do not apply to those suspected of
 being illegal immigrants (generally Zimbabweans or Zambians),
 who are often held for up to 2 weeks before being charged or
 deported. Under an infrequently used provision, the
 Constitution allows the President to declare a person a
 prohibited immigrant and deport him from the country. No
 explanation is required nor is any normally given, and the
 order is not subject to judicial review. A prohibited
 immigrant can reenter Botswana only with the permission of the
 President or his designated representative. A Zambian
 journalist who had written articles critical of Zambian
 President Kaunda for a Botswana newspaper was deported in
 September, the first case under this provision since early
 1989.
 Additionally, persons charged under the National Security Act
 (NSA) must be arraigned before a magistrate within 96 hours,
 
 
 18
 BOTSWANA
 and suspects may be held indefinitely. However, this Act has
 been rarely invoked and was not applied in 1990. There is a
 functioning system of bail, and detainees have the right to
 hire attorneys of their choice at every stage, although there
 is no functioning system of public defenders for those unable
 to afford a lawyer. There is also no practice of incommunicado
 detention in Botswana. However, Botswana is not a signatory
 to the 1963 Vienna Convention on consular relations and does
 not always promptly or automatically notify embassies when
 foreign citizens are detained or arrested.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Botswana's judiciary is independent of the executive and
 legislative branches of government in both law and practice.
 Botswana has two court systems, the regular courts and the
 customary (traditional) courts. In the regular courts, a
 defendant's right to due process is provided for by law and
 largely honored in practice, although many defendants are not
 apprised of their rights in pretrial or trial proceedings.
 Most trials are held in public, and court records are public.
 However, trials under the National Security Act may be held in
 secret. As a rule, courts only appoint public defenders for
 those charged with capital crimes (murder and treason);
 lawyers in these cases serve on a pro bono basis. Thus, those
 charged with noncapital crimes are often tried without legal
 representation if they cannot afford an attorney. Defendants
 may confront witnesses and present evidence.
 Customary courts usually handle land, marital, and property
 disputes as well as minor crimes. There are clearly defined
 appeal procedures with separate courts of appeal in both
 systems, as well as the possibility of appeals to the High
 Court. Customary courts are open only to members of a tribe.
 The tribal chief presides over the court, and there are no
 attorneys for either side.
 There were no political prisoners in Botswana at the end of
 1990.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 These rights are safeguarded by law, and privacy in family
 matters is respected. Although search warrants are required
 of ordinary policemen, Botswana law allows police of the rank
 of sergeant and above to enter a building and seize evidence
 provided they believe "on reasonable grounds" that criminal
 activity is involved and that the evidence is later brought
 before a magistrate. In practice, this means that seizures of
 property are frequently made without resort to search
 warrants, especially because many members of the public are
 unaware of legal requirements. Such evidence can be
 admissible in courts although some judges disqualify it.
 There is no evidence of arbitrary surveillance of persons or
 their communications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are provided for in the
 Constitution and are respected in practice. Opposition
 viewpoints and criticism of the Government are freely
 expressed. At least once in 1990, the police attempted to
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 videotape political rallies, but the ensuing public criticism
 led to a halt in the practice.
 Although the Botswana Press Agency (BOPA) is part of the
 Department of Information and Broadcasting, it functions with
 a great deal of autonomy, and its editorials do not always
 reflect the Government's view. Both the Government and the
 independent press follow unwritten rules against criticizing
 senior officials directly or discussing the personal lives or
 financial affairs of important figures. In addition, access
 to government officials is difficult for the independent
 press, as civil servants prefer the "tame" reporters from
 BOPA. While opposition party meetings and statements receive
 press coverage in both government and independent media, the
 government media tend to give more space to ruling party
 viewpoints. The independent press tends to present more
 balanced coverage. In one 1990 instance, opposition members
 ejected government media reporters from a political rally.
 In the past, the Government has clashed with the independent
 press over the proper reporting of national security issues.
 There were, however, no cases in 1990 where such reporting was
 contested.
 Books and publications are not censored. Academic freedom is
 respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Botswana has a long history of peaceful assembly which is
 integral to traditional village life and is exemplified in the
 village meeting, the kgotla. During kgotla meetings, people
 freely question leaders and voice opinions on local politics.
 Permits are required for public meetings and demonstrations
 and are usually granted as long as the police believe public
 order will be maintained.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is practiced and encouraged. There is no
 state religion in Botswana, although the majority of the
 population claim a denomination of Christianity. Active
 groups of Hindus, Muslims, Baha'is, and others practice their
 faiths freely. There are no restrictions on religious groups,
 places of worship, the training of members of clergy,
 religious publishing, religious education, conversion or
 participation in charitable activity. Missionaries are
 allowed to enter the country and proselytize, and foreign
 clergy can enter and serve expatriate congregations. There is
 no discrimination based on religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Botswana has no restrictions on movement within the country,
 on foreign travel, emigration, or the right to return.
 Passports are easily obtained.
 Refugees documented by the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) are readily accepted into Botswana but
 are required to live in the refugee settlement at Dukwe.
 Refugees may be authorized to live'elsewhere for documented
 reasons. Due to past allegations from neighboring countries
 that refugees were using Botswana as a launching area for
 subversive operations against their home countries, Botswana
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 has declared that Dukwe refugees found off the settlement
 without permission will be considered to have abandoned
 refugee status and will be repatriated.
 The few remaining Zimbabwean refugees lost their refugee
 status in July 1989 when the UNHCR and the Governments of
 Botswana and Zimbabwe invoked the cessation clause of the U.N.
 Convention on Refugees, but the Government allowed those who
 were studying, working, or otherwise eligible for Botswana
 citizenship to remain. In the end, some 100 to 150 former
 refugees who did not fit into the above categories were
 deported to Zimbabwe in November 1989.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have the right peacefully to change their government
 through democratic means, although in practice one party, the
 BDP, has dominated Parliament since independence. Members of
 Parliament are elected by universal suffrage and secret
 ballot; the President is elected by the Parliament. Thirty-
 four of the 38 members of the National Assembly are elected
 every 5 years' the remaining 4 are appointed by the
 President. Following the October 1989 elections, the BDP
 holds 31 of the 34 elective seats in the National Assembly.
 At present there are eight active political parties. At the
 end of 1990, only the two major parties, the BDP and the BNF,
 were represented in Parliament.
 Women and minorities legally have the same political rights as
 the majority, but in practice the traditional patriarchial
 system has discouraged women from taking part in politics. At
 the end of 1990, there were two women in Parliament, one of
 whom was the Minister of External Affairs. Women hold some
 positions in local and district councils, and the trend in the
 number of positions held by women is increasing.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government permits local and international organizations
 involved in human rights advocacy to operate in Botswana,
 including the International Committee of the Red Cross, UNHCR,
 the International Labor Organization (ILO), and others. To
 date, there have been no international investigatons of human
 rights violations in Botswana. Government representatives
 have stated that they would cooperate if there were such an
 investigation.
 Organized in 1989, the Botswana Association for Human Rights
 had still not gained official registration by the end of the
 year. However, both the Attorney General and the Ministry of
 External Affairs have responded favorably to this private
 initiative. The goals of the Association are to focus
 national attention on those laws which need reform, to make
 recommendations to the national law reform committee, to
 heighten public awareness about human rights and their own
 specific rights, and to pressure the Government to ratify more
 of the existing international human rights instruments.
 Independent organizations dealing with the rights of women and
 rural dwellers also exist.
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Tswana majority, comprising an estimated 65 percent of the
 population, has a tradition of peacefully coexisting with the
 largest minority, the Kalanga, with approximately 25 percent
 of the population. Although ethnic differences are not
 entirely absent, no ethnic group suffers from serious
 discrimination. The most prominent complaint comes from the
 Government's refusal to allow instruction in minority
 languages in schools. Groups living in remote areas,
 including the Kgalagadi and the San (formerly called bushmen),
 have suffered discrimination in the past in access to
 government services and legal redress, partly because of their
 distance from settled areas and their nomadic lifestyle. They
 are still poorly represented in politics, but some are being
 resettled and are gaining better access to government services.
 The Constitution and penal code forbid discrimination based on
 color, race, nationality, or creed but do not mention
 discrimination based on sex. In fact, political, social, and
 economic opportunities for women are restricted by a number of
 laws and customs. For example, women married under either
 common law or customary (tribal) law are subject to practices
 in which wives assume a legal status equivalent to the
 husband's child. Essentially, this means that a woman may not
 make a legally binding agreement without her husband's consent
 or assistance. A women may enter a binding transaction as a
 public trader, but she may become a trader only with the
 consent of her husband. Under customary law the husband is
 permitted to have other wives after consulting first with the
 first wife and the families. Deference to the husband's
 wishes also carries over into the health field where a women
 is required to obtain her husband's permission for the use of
 contraceptives or for operations which would prevent
 conception. In addition, the Citizenship Act prevents a woman
 from passing her Botswana citizenship to her children if she
 is married to a foreigner.
 Domestic violence against women is increasingly being
 recognized as a problem in Botswana. However, no data to
 verify its extent exists. Under customary marital practices,
 men have traditionally held the right to physically "chastise"
 their wives, although this attitude is gradually changing.
 Because marital problems are considered to be a problem to be
 dealt with between the husband and the wife, the police are
 reluctant to intervene. Frequently problems are settled
 through the extended families, and as a result, few cases of
 domestic violence ever come before the courts. The incidence
 of rape is also increasing in Botswana. The maximum penalty
 is life imprisonment with mandatory corporal punishment; the
 average sentence is 4 years with corporal punishment. A form
 of female circumcision exists in Botswana, but it is rarely
 performed and only by a few traditional doctors.
 The Government has been slow to introduce reforms to improve
 the status of women. The governing party established a
 women's wing only in 1987 to focus on women's issues. Since
 1981 the Ministry of Home Affairs has had a women's affairs
 unit, which has published a woman's guide to the law and
 information on the citizenship law and undertaken research on
 maternity leave problems, teenage pregnancy, and various laws
 affecting women. The Attorney General maintains that women
 have no legal recourse to challenge sex discrimination cases.
 However, the case of a female attorney who challenged the
 
 
 22
 BOTSWANA
 Citizenship Act, claiming it discriminates against her because
 she is female, was heard in November; a decision is expected
 in 1991.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers, except for government employees, are free to
 establish or join labor unions. Government workers who are
 pensionable may not join unions although they may have
 associations that function as quasi-unions. Unions are well
 developed only in the mineral, railway, and bank sectors.
 There is one major confederation of trade unions, the Botswana
 Federation of Trade Unions (BFTU).
 Trade unions in Botswana are independent of government control
 or party affiliation, and they actively seek to represent the
 interests of their members. However, the Government requires
 that all elected union officials work full time in the
 industry the union represents. This requirement severely
 limits union organizational effectiveness and has been
 criticized by the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU). The ICFTU also criticized Botswana because
 "the dissolution of trade union organizations by government is
 possible under the law at all times."
 The law severely restricts the right to strike. Legal strikes
 are theoretically possible after an exhaustive arbitration
 process, but there has never been a legal strike. Several
 illegal wildcat strikes, including several in the construction
 industry, took place in 1990, although such strike activity
 was lower than in 1989. All of the strikes in 1990 were
 resolved after a few days, usually after the mediation of
 trade unions or the Department of Labor. Once a strike has
 been declared illegal by the Government, management has the
 right to dismiss employees, and strikers can be jailed. The
 Government has yet to employ these extreme measures against
 strikers.
 Unions may freely join international organizations, and labor
 representatives regularly attend international conferences.
 The BFTU is affiliated with the ICFTU. In addition, the
 Botswana Mine Workers Union belongs to a regional mine
 workers' union federation.
 In 1990 the Government began discussions with employers and
 trade unions over possible reform of labor laws.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Although employers are required under the Trade Union Act to
 bargain with any trade union that has organized at least 25
 percent of the work force, the actual frequency of collective
 bargaining depends upon the organizing strength of the union
 in a particular industry. Collective bargaining is common in
 sectors such as mining in which trade unions are relatively
 strong but is virtually nonexistent in others. Formerly,
 collective bargaining was limited by the Government's income
 policy, which set public sector salaries as a benchmark for
 private sector wage settlements. This policy was repealed by
 the Parliament in September.
 Although there are laws which prohibit employers from
 dismissing workers for union activities, there is some dispute
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 as to how well they are enforced. Other reasons are often
 given for dismissals so it is difficult for the dismissed
 employee to prove that union activities were the real reason.
 Dismissals may be appealed to labor officers or the civil
 courts, but labor officers rarely do much more than order 2
 months' severance pay, and most workers cannot afford civil
 litigation. Labor law and practice in Botswana's only export
 processing zone (EPZ), in Selebi-Phikwe, are the same as in
 the rest of the country. The Botswana Mine Workers Union is
 headquartered in Selebi-Phikwe. The EPZ involves only
 government financial incentives to locate there and includes
 no express or implied modification of labor laws.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is not practiced in Botswana and is
 specifically forbidden in the Constitution.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Botswana law prohibits the employment of children 12 years of
 age and under by anyone except members of the child's
 immediate family. No juvenile under the age of 15 may be
 employed in any industry, and only those over 16 may be
 employed in night work. No person 16 or younger is permitted
 to work in hazardous jobs, including mining. Botswana law
 also protects young people from recruiters for jobs outside
 the country. There are reports that scattered violations of
 these standards do occur, especially in small-scale
 enterprises, largely because the Department of Labor in the
 Ministry of Labor and Home Affairs is insufficiently staffed
 to enforce full compliance. Although education is not yet
 compulsory, it is almost universally available, and most
 children attend school at least through the primary grades.
 The Government has indicated it hopes to make 9 years of
 education compulsory by 1992.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages are established by law for all but agricultural
 and domestic workers. The minimum wage is approximately $90
 per month and is generally enforced. This amount is barely
 adequate for one person to maintain a decent standard of
 living, and in most cases, workers must supplement this amount
 through other means such as subsistence farming. Most
 families have more than one wage earner. The law mandates a
 maximum 48-hour workweek with provisions for overtime pay
 (time and a half) for work over 48 hours. Most major
 employers adhere to the workweek laws, but some smaller firms
 refuse to pay overtime, and no action is taken against them.
 The Government establishes basic job health and safety
 standards. Most industries adhere to the standards, although
 compliance by construction firms is sometimes lax. Industrial
 accident rates are not high on the whole. Workers who
 complain about hazardous conditions are legally protected from
 dismissal. Government enforcement of safety standards is
 divided between the Labor and Mines Departments and the
 Ministry of Health but has been hampered by inadequate
 staffing.
