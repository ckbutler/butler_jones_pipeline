 GUATEMALA
 In 1986 Guatemala completed an orderly and open transition
 from a military regime to a democratically elected, civilian
 government. On January 14, the President, 100 deputies, and
 330 mayors chosen in the 1985 general and presidential runoff
 elections took office, the first civilian government to assume
 power in Guatemala since 1966.
 The new government, headed by President Marco Vinicio Cerezo
 Arevalo, inherited a deeply divided country which for more
 than 20 years has suffered a Marxist-led guerrilla insurgency
 as well as political violence carried out by rightist death
 squads and government security forces. This situation is
 complicated by ethnic differences separating the Ladino and
 indigenous populations. The 23 different Indian dialect
 groups, which make up 50 percent of Guatemala's population,
 have historically lived on the margins of national life.
 Successfully organized by insurgents in the late 1970's,
 Indian participation in the insurgency gave the guerrillas the
 armed force and strategic position necessary to challenge the
 Guatemalan military. The resulting insurgency in the
 highlands was notable for its ferocity. Although both sides
 contributed to the carnage, reports of brutality and massacres
 committed by government security forces resulted in Guatemala
 being condemned and isolated by the international community.
 The Cerezo Government also inherited an economy struggling to
 recover from the ravages of a severe recession. Primarily an
 agricultural country, Guatemala is characterized by a badly
 skewed distribution of land and capital. The social tensions
 generated by such economic inequalities have been exacerbated
 by inflation and lack -of employment. Although the Government
 embarked on a small public works program in 1986, its ability
 to respond adequately to social needs is curbed by limited
 resources.
 Upon coming to power, the new Government announced that ending
 political violence and establishing the rule of law would be
 its top priorities. To that end, President Cerezo undertook a
 reorganization of the security forces and disbanded the
 Department of Technical Investigations, the plainclothes arm
 of the national police widely acknowledged to have engaged in
 extortion, robbery, and political kidnapings and
 assassinations. A new Supreme Court also embarked on a series
 of reforms designed to end corruption and improve the
 efficiency of the legal system. New laws are designed to give
 citizens legal recourse when they believe their rights
 threatened by the authorities. The Congress, in accordance
 with the Constitution, has established a Human Rights
 Committee. It recently approved legislation covering the
 duties of a human rights ombudsman.
 In 1986 political killings and kidnapings dropped to the
 lowest level in this decade. Human rights groups blame the
 security forces for the abuses that remain, but they have not
 produced evidence linking the new Government to these crimes.
 In 1986 the United Nations rescinded the mandate of its
 Special Rapporteur for Guatemala, noting the return to
 civilian government and the Government's commitment to end
 political violence.
 The decline in political violence has helped focus attention
 on the issue of accounting for past human rights abuses.
 Amnesty, available to insurgents since 1982, was expanded by
 decree by the outgoing military government to include anyone
 
 
 510
 GUATEMALA
 guilty of common crimes committed with political motivation.
 This applies to members of the security forces guilty of
 kidnaping and assassination. The Mutual Support Group (GAM),
 an organization of relatives of disappeared persons, has
 called on the Government to rescind the decree and set up a
 special presidential commission to investigate past abuses.
 President Cerezo told GAM members that only the judiciary is
 constitutionally competent to conduct such an investigation.
 He has urged GAM to bring charges in the courts against
 alleged violators of human rights, something which GAM so far
 has refused to do. This impasse has bred ill will between the
 Government and GAM and has contributed to the politicization
 of human rights issues in Guatemala.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Although criminal violence continued to be a serious problem
 in 1986, the number of murder cases in which a political
 motive cannot be ruled out declined significantly. Killings
 of civilian noncombatants with possible political implications
 declined for the fourth year in a row, dropping to 131 in
 1986, the lowest figure in this decade; the 1986 total
 compares with 280 such killings in 1985. Of these 131, 72
 were attributable to guerrilla forces, 3 to right-wing groups,
 and 56 to unknown assailants. Although GAM and some foreign
 groups claim that government security services continue
 summarily to execute insurgents and insurgent sympathizers,
 there is scant evidence linking officials to such acts. In
 only a few of the 131 cases did a family member or associate
 attribute the death to government forces.
 The decline in political killings can be attributed to the
 Cerezo Government's commitment to ending political violence,
 its reorganization of the security forces, and its stated
 determination to punish anyone using violence to undermine the
 democratic process. These actions signal the withdrawal of
 official protection and tolerance which previously allowed
 political violence to corrupt the political system.
 There was a dramatic increase in 1986 in killings for other
 than political reasons. High levels of unemployment and
 insufficient numbers of trained police appear to be primarily
 responsible for the upsurge in criminal violence. During
 1986, 1,832 people were murdered in Guatemala, compared to
 1,539 the year before. Assaults with intent to kill jumped
 from 2,813 in 1985 to 5,088, and armed robberies rose from
 1,727 to 2,570. Some observers point to this criminal
 violence as proof that political killings continue unimpeded.
 However, in few instances has a link been established between
 the killings and any political activity by the victims.
 President Cerezo told a foreign newspaper in September that
 outside observers have confused common crime with political
 violepce. Among the victims of such violence were members of
 the Armed Forces and the ruling Christian Democratic Party
 (DCG). At least four Army officers and several Army
 specialists attached to the General Staff were killed in
 Guatemala City in 1986. Other victims of criminal violence
 were local DCG officials in San Martin Jilotepeque, Department
 of Chimaltenango, and Villa Nueva and Villa Canales,
 Department of Guatemala.
 
 
 511
 GUATEMALA
 Among those ki'lled in 1986 were Justo Rufino Reyes, Secretary'
 General of the Municipal Workers Union (SCTM), and Emilio
 Guzman, head of the Street Vendors Union  Following Reyes'
 stabbing death, other unionists denounced the killing as an
 attempt to intimidate the trade union movement. However, at
 no time was it alleged that the killing was the work of the
 Government. Shortly after the murder, police arrested one
 suspect and announced the name of another. The second suspect
 was later found dead, and police tentatively labelled the
 crime an act of common violence. At the time of his murder,
 Reyes was trying to break the SCTM away from a leftist trade
 union confederation and align it with the AFL-CIO supported
 Guatemalan Confederation of Labor Unity (CUSG). Reyes had
 also fought and lost a bitterly contested race for Secretary
 General of SCTM with a leftist rival, an election which was
 later declared null by the Ministry of Labor after it uncovered
 evidence that Reyes' competitor had engaged in vote fraud.
 The Ministry called for a second election, for which Reyes was
 campaigning at the time of his murder.
 Guzman was reportedly knifed by two youths attempting to rob
 him. Police arrested the two shortly after the killing. Juan
 Francisco Alfaro, Secretary General of the CUSG, expressed
 concern at the killing of a second moderate union leader, and
 called on the Government to investigate the case.
 The four Marxist guerrilla organizations which have been
 waging the insurgency rejected the opportunity to participate
 in the elections and have continued their armed struggle
 against the civilian Government. Although armed encounters
 declined by approximately 50 percent from the 1985 level, 81
 guerrillas, 50 Guatemalan soldiers, and 19 civilians were
 reported killed in combat. Guerrilla forces also executed
 five military commissioners, civilian representatives of the
 Army in rural areas, and continued their campaign against
 members of the civil defense patrols, killing 10 in combat and
 executing 6 others. Their program of physical intimidation
 extended to other sectors of Guatemalan society. In March;
 guerrillas killed the auxiliary mayor of Santa Barbara,
 Suchitepequez. In El Peten, the mayor of La Libertad fled
 after receiving death threats from the Rebel Armed Forces
 (FAR). The FAR shot to death several farm administrators and
 farmworkers in Escuintla, and booby traps left by the
 Revolutionary Organization of People in Arms (ORPA) killed two
 farm workers in Suchitepequez. FAR gunmen shot and killed a
 Salvadoran businessman in the Peten area as he attempted to
 land his airplane on a FAR-controlled airstrip in the course
 of a holiday trip.
 b. Disappearance
 The Guatemalan police report 203 persons were kidnaped in
 1986. While most of the incidents appear to be criminally
 inspired, in 79 of the cases political motives cannot be ruled
 out. This total compares with 198 disappearances with a
 possible political motive recorded in 1985 and 425 in 1984.
 Historically, it has been difficult to assign responsibility
 for or motive to most disappearances and kidnapings. In
 Guatemala, personal vengeance or ransom can be as powerful a
 motive to kidnap as political differences, and abduction is a
 tactic used by individuals and groups for a variety of
 reasons. Nevertheless, prior to 1986, kidnaping and
 subsequent killing of victims were methods frequently used by
 security forces to capture, interrogate, and eliminate
 
 
 512
 GUATEMALA
 insurgents, their sympathizers, and others believed to pose a
 threat to the State. The distinctive modus operandi employed
 by the security forces and the ties of their more prominent
 victims to student, labor, or political groups, readily
 identified the Government as the probable author of such
 extrajudicial activities.
 In 1986, the "trademarks" of the government security services
 were largely absent from the cases of abduction that had
 possible political implications. For instance, two members of
 the National Congress, including Rudolfo Maldonado, the DCG
 head of the Foreign Relations Committee, were kidnaped in
 separate incidents and held for several hours. The same
 occurred to members of labor organizations such as SCTM and
 CUSG. However, in none of these incidents was the victim
 harmed or the Government implicated. In August, the mayor of
 Chiquimula, Jose Maria Garcia Portillo, a member of the
 rightist National Liberation Movement, was kidnaped. Still
 missing, his disappearance is believed to be the result of
 local intraparty rivalry. On May 12, Maria Elena Rodas
 Orellana, a University of San Carlos engineering student,
 disappeared in Guatemala City on her way to the university
 from her home in Chimaltenango. A police investigation
 indicates that Miss Rodas, who apparently was not involved in
 political activities at the university, was the victim of
 criminal foul play.
 Critics continue to charge military security forces with
 abducting people in and around conflictive zones (i.e.,areas
 where guerrilla forces are active), in order to question them
 about subversive activities. For instance, the April
 kidnaping of 7 farmworkers near Rio Bravo, Suchitepequez, and
 the abduction of 2 young men from a house run by the Bishop of.
 Coban have been blamed on security forces. Following a surge
 of guerrilla and criminal activity around San Luis, El Peten,
 soldiers at the military detachment in San Luis reportedly
 arrested Salome de Jesus Cano Rodriguez. Several weeks later,
 soldiers reportedly arrested Vicente Carrillo, Everado Solares
 Mejia, and Mateo Moterrose Revolorio in the nearby village of
 La Puente. None of these individuals has been seen since.
 Insurgent groups continue to use kidnaping-to commandeer labor
 and to punish government collaborators. On August 1, members
 of the FAR kidnaped four families from El Canaan, La Libertad,
 El Peten. In January, 3 of 4 men kidnaped from Malacatan, San
 Marcos, were found dead in a river near the Mexican border.
 One of the dead men wore a sign which read, "executed by ORPA
 for desertion." The Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP)
 continued to hold people in a small area in northern El Quiche
 to use as suppliers of food and labor. During 1986 several
 hundred people managed to escape from guerrilla-controlled
 areas.
 The decline in current cases of politically motivated
 disappearances and killings also has helped focus attention on
 the issue of accounting for past human rights abuses and
 highlighted the dispute between the Government and GAM. In
 May GAM submitted writs of habeas corpus on behalf of over
 1300 disappeared persons. The Supreme Court designated a
 judge to administer the entire writ process, reportedly the
 first time this has been done in Guatemalan judicial history.
 In October, the judge completed the preliminary phase of his
 investigation and announced that he had found 33 of the total,
 29 of whom were in jail, and 4 dead. He did not find any
 
 
 513
 GUATEMALA
 secret detention centers during his investigation, which he
 said will continue until all the remaining cases are clarified.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The civil and criminal codes expressly prohibit physical and
 mental torture. Nevertheless, the practice continues. In the
 past, torture was allegedly one of the means used by the
 government security forces to extract information from
 suspected insurgents and insurgent sympathizers. However,
 since very few of the people picked up by the security forces
 lived to tell their stories, the only evidence of such
 practices were the broken bodies found by the sides of the
 roads in Guatemala. With the decline in political violence,
 there has also been an apparent decrease in the incidence of
 torture. Guatemalan press reports occasionally refer to
 'signs of torture" being found on the bodies of some murder
 victims. However, according to the head of Guatemalan Medical
 Forensic Science, the unit of the judicial branch which is
 required to conduct autopsies in cases of violent or
 suspicious death, the incidence of torture has dropped
 dramatically within the last year. He has stated that he
 claims to know of only two such cases in 1986.
 Occasionally, individual police officers are accused of
 committing acts of brutality, sometimes to obtain confessions
 and sometimes to punish criminal suspects. In an effort to
 control this type of:abuse, the Government has initiated a
 series of reforms designed to professionalize the police
 force. Besides emphasizing the importance of respect for the
 constitutional rights of those detained, the importance of
 collecting and evaluating physical evidence from the scene of
 a crime is being stressed. Recently, the judicial branch of
 government sponsored seminars in which it taught over 3,000
 police officers the basic methods of legal arrest. The police
 force also has adopted a new hiring system designed to improve
 its educational level and to end cronyism. The Governments of
 Spain, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Venezuela,
 recognizing the importance of an effective civilian police
 force to the success of the civilian Government, have pledged
 material and technical assistance.
 Due to limited budgetary resources, Guatemala's prisons are
 characterized by overcrowding, rudimentary facilities and a
 lack of medical services. A new director has tried to better
 conditions at the central Pabon prison by involving the
 inmates in prison-improvement programs. There has been no
 repetition of the rioting which occurred in 1985, and, in
 comparison with previous years, there were no allegations of
 brutality by prison personnel. There is no policy of physical
 punishment for inmates at Pabon and other penal institutions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Persons may not be held for more than 6 hours without being
 brought before a judge and charged with a crime. Previously,
 the police had 48 hours to bring a person before a
 magistrate. This change, mandated by the new Constitution,
 has been criticized by the police as providing insufficient
 time to arrest, process, and bring suspected criminals before
 a judge, especially in the countryside where suspects must
 often be transported long distances. The police have been
 known to use this as a pretext to mete out frontier justice.
 For instance, following a robbery and shooting at a bar in
 
 
 514
 GUATEMALA
 Coatepeque, Department of Quetzaltenango, in which a police
 officer was wounded, police captured and summarily executed a
 suspect, tossing his body into a well. The Government
 responded quickly to this official abuse of power, arresting
 the police chief of Coatepeque and the officers who
 participated in the capture and execution.
 Some human rights groups have charged that the civil defense
 patrols, a local militia organized by the Army as part of its
 counterinsurgency program, are a form of uncompensated,
 obligatory service. Approximately 721,700 men participate in
 the civil defense patrols, about 13 percent of the entire
 population. According to the Constitution, service in the
 civil patrols is voluntary. Upon taking office, President
 Cerezo announced that each locality would be able to decide
 whether to keep or disband its patrol.
 Despite the decision of some villages to disband their
 patrols, there exists evidence that in conflictive zones of
 the country, service is required. Occasionally the military,
 through local military commissioners, applies pressure on the
 people to participate. Exemptions may be obtained, but
 usually only for medical reasons or by paying another man to
 perform the service. The Catholic Church, through a variety
 of spokesmen, has voiced opposition to what it calls the
 "obligatory service" of the patrols. Several Guatemalan
 congressman have also criticized the patrols. The Government
 maintains the civil defense patrols play an important role in
 the counterinsurgency program, and it is doubtful that they
 will be disbanded anytime in the near future.
 The Government does not use involuntary exile as a form of
 punishment, nor are critics arrested and convicted on
 unsubstantiated charges. Compulsory labor is prohibited by
 law and is not known to be practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair.Public Trial
 The Guatemalan legal system has been characterized by
 inefficiency and corruption. Although there has been little
 overt interference in the operation of the courts by the
 military or the executive branch, in the past many judicial
 officers reacted positively to indications of special interest
 in particular cases by high government or military officials.
 The practical effect of such influence was that the judicial
 system did not respond adequately in cases involving human
 rights violations committed by the authorities.
 In 1986 members of the new Supreme Court were chosen by the
 National Congress. The 9 magistrates of the court, who will
 serve a 6-year term, control the staffing and administration
 of the judicial branch of government.  They have embarked on
 an ambitious program to improve the efficiency of the court
 system and to reduce corruption. The magistrates have also
 set out to assert the judicial branch's independence from the
 executive. Among the first reforms is the creation of a
 special group of judges to supervise and direct police
 investigations and to evaluate and guard evidence. This
 measure, together with the creation of an investigative unit
 of young lawyers, is designed to improve the courts' ability
 to deal with criminal cases. According to the Minister of
 Interior, of the 30,000 persons arrested during 1986, 29,000
 were released for lack of evidence.
 
 
 515
 GUATEMALA
 Persons arrested in Guatemala are guaranteed the right to
 legal counsel at all hearings, and lawyers are provided by the
 State if the defendants cannot afford them. However, the
 lawyers provided are usually law students. Also, the majority
 of the nation's lawyers live in or near Guatemala City, and it
 is difficult to retain legal counsel in the countryside.
 Defendants may be released at the-discretion of the magistrate
 after posting bail. However, the judicial machinery is
 cumbersome and slow, and it is not unusual for defendants to
 spend several months in prison before the courts render a
 decision on their guilt or innocence.
 New laws protecting individual rights, including the right to
 a judicial determination of the legality of detentions, went
 into effect upon the installation of the civilian Government
 in January.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution guarantees the inviolability of the home and
 of personal correspondence and private papers.
 Charges that private correspondence is tampered with continue
 to be made. Postal authorities acknowledge this sometimes
 happens and blame dishonest employees. Letters bearing checks
 from relatives of Guatemalans living in the United States are
 a particular target of mail theft. There have also been
 allegations of mail tampering and telephone tapping by
 security forces.
 Although the security forces have an intelligence network,
 there is no organized system of government informers or
 neighborhood watch committees in urban areas. However, civil
 defense patrols have served as a means of reasserting
 government control over the countryside. The involvement of
 part of the rural population, especially in conflictive areas,
 obviously contributes to the Government's ability to monitor
 the movement of its citizens, an important function of the
 civil defense patrol in countering the insurgency. Guerrilla
 organizations have accused military commissioners as well as
 other rural government employees of being "informers."
 Insurgents have assassinated a number of such persons.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees these rights, and the Government
 affirms them in practice. In 1986, there were no indications
 of any attempt to prevent the media from freely airing diverse
 viewpoints and actively covering the spectrum of political
 opinion and debate. In fact, one of the major daily
 newspapers is owned by a former presidential candidate, and
 has emerged as the leading antigovernment newspaper.
 Present press freedom contrasts sharply with that of recent
 years when newspaper reporters and broadcast journalists were
 frequent targets of political violence. Lingering fears still
 serve to limit somewhat the exercise of press freedoms. While
 opposition views and criticism of the Government are aired
 freely and frequently, journalistic self-restraint results in
 only perfunctory coverage of topics dealing with the military,
 national security, official corruption, and police
 
 
 516
 GUATEMALA
 investigations. Journalists are not prevented from entering
 or covering events in conflictive zones, but they rarely do
 so. Guerrilla organizations and civil rights groups, GAM and
 many of GAM's foreign solidarity and support groups, all have
 access to the media through paid advertisements, communiques,
 and manifestos. The communist Guatemalan Workers Party (PGT),
 and the guerrilla-linked Guatemalan Human Rights Commission
 and Committee of Farmworker Unity (CUC) have also published
 messages in the press.
 Radio is Guatemala's most pervasive medium, with over 100
 privately owned stations operating throughout the country.
 There are five privately owned television stations. The
 Government owns and operates six radio stations and one
 television station which broadcast a variety of news,
 educational, and entertainment programs. Four major
 independent daily newspapers are published in the capital.
 The Government publishes one daily with official
 announcements, decrees, and selected news items.
 There is no censorship of either local or foreign books about
 Guatemala or other subjects. A few local writers and artists
 continue to live and work outside of Guatemala; however, their
 exile is voluntary.
 The main campus of the University of San Carlos (USAC) has
 been a center of violence, both political and criminal, in
 recent years. Although several USAC students and workers were
 killed or kidnaped in 1986, there is no evidence linking such
 violence to the political activities of the victims or to the
 Government. On the contrary, political activity on campus has
 increased since the advent of civilian government. During the
 campaign leading up to the June elections for rector, student
 organizations linked to the underground PGT participated on
 behalf of one of the candidates. Student organizations also
 took part in protest marches and published manifestos critical
 of the Government in the press. During a labor dispute in
 May, the USAC workers union took the acting Rector and
 Superior Council of the University hostage in an effort to
 force USAC to meet its salary demands. The hostages were
 freed without force, and no arrests were made or reprisals
 taken.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the rights of assembly and
 political association. These rights were exercised throughout
 the process of democratization that began with the July 1984
 Constituent Assembly elections and culminated with the
 election and installation of the civilian Government in
 January 1986. Since then, there has been a further increase
 in public political gatherings and demonstrations. GAM holds
 weekly demonstrations in front of the National Palace, and has
 twice staged sit-ins at the palace and forced its way into the
 Independence Day parade. Labor unions, organizations of
 housewives, and neighborhood groups have also gathered in the
 central plaza to protest the high cost of living and other
 issues. On May 2, the day after the first May Day
 demonstration since 1980, thousands of farmworkers who had
 marched from the south coast gathered in the central plaza to
 ask the Government to help them find land. The demonstrations
 took place without incident.
 Under the Constitution, workers have a right to organize,
 strike, and bargain collectively. Public workers also enjoy
 
 
 517
 GUATEMALA
 this right, although its exercise must "in no case affect
 state public service activities." However, the Congress is
 required to pass implementing legislation and to modify the
 labor code to bring it into compliance with the Constitution.
 Delays in this process have frustrated public sector workers,
 who have pushed ahead with organizing plans. Of the 29 work
 stoppages which have occurred since the inauguration of the
 civilian Government, 19 were carried out by government
 employees. Although the Government threatened legal action
 against the striking public employees, it never made good the
 threat.
 There are approximately 300 active labor unions in the country
 organized into three national trade union confederations. The
 largest and most significant is the Confederation of Labor
 Unity (CUSG), a democratic group associated with the AFL-CIO
 that espouses the principles of the free trade union movement
 and emphasizes economic unionism. In 1986, CUSG, an affiliate
 of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions,
 consisted of 20 federations and approximately 135,000
 workers. The second largest labor organization is the
 Christian Democratic-oriented Coordinating Committee of
 Guatemalan Workers (CTG), claiming 12,000 members. The third
 is the leftist Guatemalan Workers Union (UNSITRAGUA), which
 has 10,000 members. CTG and UNSITRAGUA have not yet gained
 legal status.
 In the past, Guatemala was cited by the International Labor
 Organization's (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Association
 because of abductions of trade union leaders and legal
 advisors. No such complaints were filed in 1986. The ILO
 also has cited Guatemala for noncompliance with Conventions 87
 and 98, which affirm public workers' right to strike and the
 right of unions to engage in partisan political activities.
 Guatemala received no such criticism in 1986.
 Aside from labor unions, there are numerous professional and
 trade associations in Guatemala. These groups operate
 autonomously, without government interference, and often
 exercise considerable political influence.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The rights of freedom of conscience and to free exercise of
 religion are recognized and respected in practice. Legal
 recognition is granted to all denominations.
 More than 70 percent of the population practices Roman
 Catholicism. Many Indians, however, combine Catholic tenets
 with elements of their traditional beliefs. Evangelical
 churches have grown rapidly, especially among Indians, and
 their followers now number about one-quarter of the
 population. There is also a small Jewish community.
 Foreign Catholic clergy and religious workers actively
 proselytize in Guatemala. Foreign Protestant evangelical
 clergy have been joined in their efforts by local
 representatives of Guatemala's growing evangelical movement.
 One result of this religious mixture has been some tension
 between Catholics and Protestants. Authorities deny any
 deliberate policy of discrimination. However, evangelicals
 have cited some cases of intimidation by the police and
 government officials.
 
 
 518
 GUATEMALA
 Catholics and evangelicals are free to preach and develop
 congregations. However, both Catholics and Protestants have
 suffered the effects of political violence. During the height
 of the counterinsurgency campaign in the highlands in the late
 1970's and early 1980's, 14 Catholic clergy and hundreds of
 catechists lost their lives. The radicalization of some
 clergy led to the creation of the Guatemalan Church in Exile,
 a small Mexico-based religious front for the insurgents.
 Although several priests working on the south coast and in the
 highlands have received death threats in 1986, no incidents of
 political violence involving Catholic clergy were reported.
 The evangelical community has not fared as well. During the
 first part of 1986, four evangelical pastors were killed in
 separate acts of violence in Guatemala City. This led the
 head of the Guatemalan Evangelical Alliance to charge that the
 killings were part of an attempt to intimidate evangelicals.
 However, no suspects were arrested, there were no further
 incidents, and the charge was not repeated.
 With the advent of a Christian Democratic government, the
 Catholic Church found itself in the unaccustomed position of
 working alongside a government which shared its social
 teachings. Nevertheless, the Church asserted its
 responsibility to speak for "those who have no voice" and
 reserved the right to criticize government actions. During
 1986 the Church continued to voice opposition to the civil
 defense patrols and the model village program. It also
 opposed the Government's family planning programs. The
 involvement of some clergy in a farm workers movement prompted
 the Archbishop to renew his call for a more just distribution
 of land.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government does not limit the freedom of movement of its
 citizens within the national territory. However, the
 Government continued in 1986 to set up roadblocks in the
 interior to check documents and search vehicles for security
 purposes. The Treasury Police also used roadblocks to search
 for contraband and to interdict smuggling across Guatemala's
 four borders. There are no restrictions on foreign travel or
 on the right to reenter the country. All citizens are free to
 migrate to other countries.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 estimated that approximately 38,677 Guatemalans, mostly
 Indians from areas afflicted by insurgent activities, continue
 to live as refugees in Mexico. Half live in camps in the
 border areas of the Mexican state of Chiapas; the rest have
 been moved to camps near the Bay of Campeche. Since 1982 the
 Government has followed a policy of encouraging "voluntary and
 orderly" repatriation of all displaced persons and assisting
 their reintegration into the country. The Cerezo Government
 has continued this policy. In several public statements, the
 President has encouragedrefugees to return to Guatemala,
 guaranteeing that they will face no official persecution.
 Recently, the Governments of Guatemala and Mexico agreed to
 set up a special commission to study the situation and work
 out a modus operandi to foster the voluntary return of
 Guatemalan citizens. The biggest problem facing the
 Guatemalan Government is not the security of returning
 citizens but lack of economic assistance. Although the
 Government has offered to use model villages temporarily to
 shelter refugees, it does not hav6 the resources necessary to

 GUATEMALA
 handle a sudden large influx. International organizations
 such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 and the Inter-Governmental Committee on Migration (ICM) are
 not established in Guatemala, and therefore Guatemala can
 count on little international assistance at this time to
 resettle returnees. However, the Guatemalan Government has
 held talks with ICRC and UNHRC representatives and recently
 joined ICM.
 Following a general decline in guerrilla activity and a
 decision by Mexico to relocate Guatemalan refugees in the
 Mexican states of Campeche and Quintana Roo, away from the
 border, some individuals began to return to Guatemala. The
 number is difficult to estimate, since most came in small
 groups and entered Guatemala the way they left, avoiding
 government immigration stations along the border.
 Nevertheless, it is believed that since 1981 approximately
 7,000 refugees have returned. So far this year, UNHCR and the
 Mexican Committee for Aid to Refugees have repatriated 260
 persons. The Guatemalan Government claims that 500 have
 returned.
 Some human rights groups contend that it is not safe for many
 of these people to return. They assert that returnees will be
 improperly identified as guerrillas and killed by security
 forces. The Government denies this. Not only are many of the
 villages along the border largely populated with people who
 returned safely from Mexican camps, but some very well-known
 voluntary political exiles have returned to Guatemala without
 suffering persecution. It must be noted, however, that the
 animosities created by the civil war in the highlands die
 hard, and villagers along the border have said that former
 insurgents could expect to be treated in the same manner as
 they had once treated their fellow villagers. There are no
 known cases of returnees being singled out for persecution by
 government security forces.
 The political umbrella group for the insurgent organizations,
 the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union (URNG), and
 several human rights groups, have called on the Cerezo
 Government to dismantle the model village program, alleging
 that it violates the right of freedom of movement by herding
 people into "concentration camps." This characterization is
 rejected by inhabitants of the model villages and most
 observers who have visited them. At present, less than 50,000
 people, or 1 1/2 percent of the highland population, live in
 model villages. Most of these villages were built on the
 sites of villages destroyed in fighting between government
 security forces and insurgents and are populated by
 inhabitants of the area. Some villages, especially in the
 Playa Grande Development Pole, one of the resettlement centers
 for displaced persons, are populated by people who cannot
 return to their land, either because it is still in a
 conflictive area, or because they are former guerrillas who
 fear vengeance at the hands of their former neighbors.
 Although the Government originally had planned to build 49
 model villages, at present it has completed approximately 14
 and is constructing another 10. Lack of funds and uncertainty
 over the future of the model village program have halted
 construction. Existing model villages are fully populated,
 and some, such as those of Acul and Chacaj, have been invaded
 by squatters. The services and security offered in the model
 villages attract many who have been living in conflictive
 zones in the highlands.

 GUATEMALA
 In addition to those who sought haven in Mexico, a major
 byproduct of the insurgency was the internal displacement of
 as many as 400,000 persons since 1981. Both government and
 private agencies working with displaced persons agree that the
 number of such persons has decreased substantially. A survey
 conducted by the Government in 1985 estimated the number of
 then-displaced persons at approximately 8,000. As one
 measure, the processing centers for displaced persons in El
 Quiche, one of the most conflictive of departments, contain
 approximately 4,000 people. These centers are designed to
 provide emergency health care for persons who have recently
 come out of the mountains, and to provide temporary shelter
 until they can be helped to relocate either to their own land
 or to one of the model villages. However, with the model
 villages full and no place else to go, many individuals have
 no choice but to stay on as semi-permanent residents of the
 processing centers.
 Insurgent groups continued to set up roadblocks during 1986,
 extracting war taxes and haranguing the people they stopped.
 In El Peten, they burned trucks, helicopters, and drilling
 equipment of oil exploration companies, forcing these
 companies to suspend operations.
 Following a pattern that began under the Rios Montt Government
 in 1982, Guatemalans living abroad in voluntary exile
 continued to return to the country in 1986. For instance, in
 August, President Cerezo announced the return of Mario
 Monteforte Toledo, one of the co-authors of Decree Law 900,
 the 1950's Agrarian Reform Law of the Jacobo Arbenz Government.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 On January 14, 1986, a democratically elected, civilian
 government took office in Guatemala, the first since the
 Mendez Montenegro regime in 1966. The return to civilian
 government dates from the March 1982 coup which deposed the
 Lucas Garcia regime and installed a military junta led by
 General Efrain Rios Montt. The Rios Montt Government was
 itself overthrown in an internal military coup in August 1983,
 partly because younger military officers perceived it was
 reneging on its pledge to return the country to civilian
 rule. The Constituent Assembly elections the Rios Montt
 regime had tentatively scheduled for July 1984 were held on
 time. Following the Assembly's completion of a new
 Constitution and electoral laws in the spring of 1985, the
 government of General Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores called
 general elections. Fourteen political parties, supporting
 eight presidential candidates, participated in the November 3
 election. The top two presidential contenders met in a
 run-off election on December 8. These two elections,
 characterized as efficiently run and free of fraud by
 international observers, attracted more voters than any
 election in Guatemalan history.
 The Constitution written by the Constituent Assembly also went
 into effect on January 14. It guarantees individual rights
 and provides for a legislative Human Rights Committee, to
 consist of a deputy from each party represented in Congress.
 The Constitution also requires the Congress to select a Human
 Rights Ombudsman to be chosen from a list of nominees
 submitted by the Human Rights Committee. The Congress
 recently passed legislation defining the powers and functions
 of the Ombudsman. The legislation gives the Ombudsman the
 
 
 521
 GUATEMALA
 immunities and prerogatives of a member of congress, and the
 powers to investigate and publicize alleged human rights
 abuses. With a separate budget and his own staff, plus
 representatives in each of the departments, the Ombudsman and
 his deputies will be able to visit government facilities
 without notice or a warrant, and will have access to all
 government files, with the exception of those dealing with
 current military operations and national diplomacy. Once
 selected, this official will provide the citizenry with access
 to an independent institution to which they can have recourse
 to denounce and publicize human rights abuses. The
 Constituent Assembly also drafted new laws protecting
 individual rights. These measures are designed to end official
 tolerance of human rights abuses and political violence in
 Guatemala.
 The Christian Democratic Party (DCG) dominates the new
 Government. It controls the presidency and, for most of the
 year until the defection of several deputies, held a majority
 of seats in the legislature. Through the appointive powers of
 the legislature, the DCG also played an important role in the
 selection of the Supreme Court justices. Of 330 mayors in
 Guatemala, 184 are members of the DCG. However, there are
 nine political parties represented in the Congress, and
 several national labor organizations and GAM have also emerged
 as opposition forces. Municipal elections are scheduled for
 1988, and general elections for a new President and Congress
 are scheduled for 1990.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The new Government extended an open invitation to human rights
 groups and other international organizations to visit
 Guatemala in 1986. Such visitors included the former UNHRC's
 Special Rapporteur for Guatemala, Americas Watch, the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission, the Faculty for Human
 Rights in El Salvador and Central America, and numerous
 religious groups.
 The most vocal opposition to the Cerezo Government came from
 GAM, which claimed that major human rights violations
 continued under civilian administration. GAM leader Nineth de
 Garcia alleged but has not substantiated that 6 political
 assassinations per day took place in Guatemala, and that 200
 people disappeared during the first several months of the new
 government. When GAM submitted its writs of habeas corpus to
 the Supreme Court, it did not include any cases from 1986.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Language,
 Religion, or Social Status
 Guatemala is a society in which most women play traditional
 roles. While not a matter of law, discrimination against
 women is rooted in centuries of cultural practice. Although
 figures show that over one-half of the female population has
 not been educated and that 94 percent of women residing in
 rural areas had less than 3 years of schooling in 1978, it is
 estimated that 30 percent of the students presently enrolled
 in Guatemalan universities are women. The number of women
 occupying professional and managerial positions is small but
 increasing.
 
 
 522
 GUATEMALA
 Several women have been named to high government positions.
 Ana Catalina Soberanis Reyes was named Minister of Labor by
 President Cerezo; she also plays an important role within the
 Christian Democratic Party. President Cerezo has also named
 women to head the government tourist and social welfare
 agencies. There are seven women deputies in the National
 Congress, including one Indian from the Department of
 Chimaltenango.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Guatemalan workers are protected by a variety of laws which
 establish minimum wages, minimum working age, and maximum
 working hours, and attempt to establish minimum safety
 standards at the workplace. However, regulations are
 frequently ignored by employers, and the Government has been
 unable fully to enforce these laws.
