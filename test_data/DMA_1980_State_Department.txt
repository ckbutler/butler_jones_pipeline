 DOMINICA
 Since it achieved independence from the United Kingdom
 in 1978, Dominica, a small island with a population
 of 80,000, has suffered from a combination of natural
 disasters and political unrest. Political turmoil
 in early 1979, culminating in the resignation of the
 government, was followed by the crippling Hurricane
 David of August 1979. The savage winds destroyed
 its main source of revenue and income, bananas. Just
 as Dominica began to recover financially, Hurricane
 Allen, in August 1980, again destroyed the banana
 crop and undermined efforts to revitalize the economy.
 On the political side, the key event of 1980 was the
 free and fair election of July. Four political parties
 contested the parliamentary elections, and the Dominica
 Freedom Party, formerly in opposition, scored a victory,
 garnering seventeen of twenty-one seats.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is not practiced and is expressly prohibited
 in Chapter 1, Section B of the constitution.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 .Punishment
 There have been no reports or such practices in Dominica.
 Such behavior is prohibited.
 c.   Disappearances
 There have been no reports of disappearances.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution provides that anyone arrested shall
 be brought before a court within 72 hours. Arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment are constitutionally prohibited.
 Dominica abides by these provisions.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Dominica provides for open trials before an independent
 and impartial court. There is a presumption of innocence
 and the defendant is allowed legal counsel. These
 provisions are fully respected in practice.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 The constitution prohibits arbitrary search and entry
 and they are not practiced.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education.
 Even before two consecutive years of natural disasters,
 Dominica was a poor country. Much of the inadequate
 infrastructure left by the colonial government was
 destroyed during Hurricane David in 1979. Government
 revenues have consistently fallen short of meeting
 
 
 410
 recurrent expenses. Inefficient and corrupt management
 by the previous government hampered Dominican efforts
 to improve the situation.
 The newly elected Freedom Party Government has moved
 to address the country's critical needs, but has been
 hampered by inadequate resources. The destruction
 of the banana prop in two successive years has dropped
 customs receipts and income taxes, the government's
 two chief sources of revenue, well below desirable
 levels.
 The government has identified rehabilitation of the
 transport network and housing as the two most urgent
 needs. Until the transport network is repaired, agri-
 cultural commodities move slowly to markets and frequent-
 ly arrive seriously damaged. Similarly, the government
 hopes to resettle those'families still residing in
 tents following the damage of Hurricane David. These
 two priorities do not detract from the government's
 desire also to accomplish progress in the areas of
 health, education, agricultural developnent and employ-
 ment. Hard choices are forced upon it by economic
 circumstances. There has been no indication of corrup-
 tion in the current government.
 Dominica remains a poor country with limited potential.
 Serious unemployment, scarce economic resources and
 the virtual absence of domestic capital will continue
 to hamper the government. The country cannot achieve
 even moderate success without substantial external
 assistance and investment, both public and private.
 Women are not discriminated against in matters of
 wages and employment.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Rights In-luding:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitutional guarantees in these areas were
 upheld before and during the 1980 elections. Dominica's
 independent newspapers have attacked government corrup-
 tion and contributed to the success of the opposition
 Freedom Party. The government announced in December,
 however, that it was moving against persons involved
 in the publication of non-registered newspapers, but
 stated that it had no intention of curtailing freedom
 of the press. The Church also played a restrained
 but active role in condemning corruption in the former
 government. Membership in the Rastafarian Section
 is prohibited by legislation known as the *Deed law."
 The Section is ostensibly outlawed because of its
 advocacy of marijuana use.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 These rights are guaranteed in law and honored in
 practice. The new Freedom farty �overnment, concerned
 over events in Grenada, abrogated an agreement with
 Grenada and St. Lucia eliminating passport requirements
 for inter-island travel.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All four political parties'participated actively in
 the last election.

 Women in Dominica suffer no legal impediments. The
 prime minister is a woman, as is the speaker of the
 house. While their participation in leadership positions
 is not proportional to their percentage of population,
 women play important roles in many areas of society.
 Labor unions are active, free and have the right to
 organize, bargain collectively and strike. They have
 been and remain a significant political force.
 4.   Goveroment Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Human Rights violations
 With the exception of the case of Desmond Trotter,
 an Amnesty International prisoner of conscience freed
 in July 1979, Dominica has not been the subject of
 international human rights commentary. There are
 no branches of international human rights organizations
 in Dominica, nor is there any local body publicly
 active in monitoring human rights violations. In
 September, Dominica ratified the Union Nations Conven-
 tion on the elimination of all forms of discrimination
 against women.
