 ITALY
 Italy is a democratic, multiparty republic with a directly-elected parliamentary
 government. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers, headed by
 the President of the Council (the Prime Minister). The Head of State (President of
 the Republic) selects the Prime Minister after consulting with leaders of all political
 forces n Parliament. The judiciary is independent of the executive, but continues
 to be subject to occasional political pressures.
 The armed forces are under the control of the Government and Parliament. There
 are four separate police forces under different ministerial or local authorities. Dur-
 ing the year there have been some credible reports of police maltreatment of individ-
 uals while in official custody.
 Italy has an industrialized market economy. Although heavy government owner-
 ship of the primary industrial sectors persists, privatization is well underway.

 Societal discrimination and some official abuses continued to be problems. There
 were sporadic acts of violence or discrimination aimed at ethnic or religious minori-
 ties and several instances of phyical abuse of prisoners by guards. The judicial sys-
 tem has moved slowly in punisbing the perpetrators. Moreover, the judciary itself
 is accused of abuses such as excessive use of preventive detention and of inordi-
 nately drawn-out proceedings. Politically motivated terrorist violence remained at
 low levels, but organized criminal elements continued to use terrorist tactics, albeit
 less frequently than in 1993.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In May the public prosecutor in
 Turin brought manslaughter charges against two police officers accused of beating
 a suspect to death after his arrest in December 1993; the trial began in November
 and was still in progress at year's end. Also begun in November and still in progress
 was the trial in Turin of two policemen accused of inflicting mortal injuries on an
 unarmed suspect they were apprehending. In October the judiciary in Padua com-
 mitted to trial an officer of the carabiniere police force who was accused of man-
 slaughter in the death of an 11-year-old Roma detainee in September 1993; a court
 hearing is scheduled for March 1995. The case of the Iranian opposition leader
 killed in March 1993 remains unsolved.
 There were no credible reports of death while in official custody in 1994.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture or Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-The
 law prohibits torture and cruel or degrading punishment. However, there have been
 credible reports that in several cases police abused detainees or prisoners during in-
 terrogation, usually by repeated kicks and punches or prolonged beatings with ba-
 tons. nFebruary a public prosecutor in Rome initiated proceedings against a police
 officer accused of il-treatment of a 13-year-old in September 1993.
 There also continue to be credible allegation--some proven true-of guards'
 abuse of prisoners. In November 1993 the director of a aiin.Pavia was suspended
 from duty and committed to trial on charges of having  aed in isolation a detainee
 for whom a medical doctor had instead recommended hospitalization; the trial is
 scheduled for January 1995.
 A report by Amnesty International in June cited specific instances of alleged ill-
 treatment of prisoners, including 13 formal complaints in February by inmates of
 Sulmona prison accusing the staff of maltreating prisoners and "committing acts of
 deliberate humiliation and extortion." The director of this prison was suspended
 from duty in early 1994; there is no confirmation that this action was taken as a
 result of these events, and Amnesty International has not received any response to
 its inquiry to date.
 In an open letter published by the press in February, inmates of Secondigliano
 prison claimed guards had repeatedly beaten a prisoner during a 2-day perioa just
 before his court hearing, and that they threatened him with further ill-treatment
 if he reported the beatings to the judges; the Government has not responded to
 these complaints. In December the Naples judiciary committed to trial 70 of the
 guards at this prison, including the chief warden, on charges of ill-treatment of
 some 300 inmates in early 1993; the trials are scheduled to begin in the spring of
 1995.
 In June six prison guards were held in preventive detention for 2 weeks and sus-
 pended from their jobs for 2 months for having beaten a prisoner in a Monza jail.
 The prison population exceeds the maximum capacity of the nation's prisons by
 some 50 percent-in some prisons the inmates number two or three times the capac-
 ity-and reportedly there are also problems of poor sanitation and inadequate medi-
 cal assistance in prisons. These conditions have continued to spark numerous hun-
 ger strikes in various prisons, and presumably were a factor prompting many of the
 more than 100 prison suicides in the past 2 years alone.
 Legislation in August 1993 made it easier for certain categories of offenders to re-
 ceive house arrest, pending conclusion of their trials, and to be sentenced to alter-
 natives to imprisonment.
 The Government permits independent monitoring of prison conditions by par-
 liamentarians, local human rights groups, the media, and other organizations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law requires police to obtain a judi-
 cial warrant in order to make an arrest, and to lodge charges within 48 hours. The
 law limits the maximum duration of preventive or investigative detention to 2, 4,
 or 6 years depending on the gravity of the crime. If a detainee is charged with addi-
 tional offenses, the detention can be extended beyond the original maximum dura-
 
 
 tion. In some cases, pre-trial detention is extended when the accused, already in de-
 tention on specific charges, is charged with additional offenses. This has often been
 the case during "clean hands" judiciary proceedings connected to kickbacks and cor-
 ruption over government contracts, which startedin Milan in February 1992 and
 have since spread throughout the country. Politicians of all parties as well as offi-
 cials of private and public companies have been implicated. Each offense with which
 "clean hands" defendants are charged allows a maximum preventive custody of 3
 months. Since most of the defendants are charged with more than one offense, some
 have remained in jail for longer than 3 months.
 In 1994 there continued to be considerable expression of public concern about the
 excessive use of preventive detention, particularly in the clean hands" investiga-
 tions, where detention was said to be used for purposes for which it was not in-
 tended, such as to obtain confessions or information on other investigations. Legisla-
 tion was introduced in Parliament to restrict the use of preventive detention. Politi-
 cal parties across the sp  m support such legislative proposals.
 There is no provision for bail, but judges often gat provisional liberty to sus-
 pects awaiting trial. As a safeguard against unjustified detention, panels of judges
 "liberty tribunals") review cases of persons awaiting trial and decide whether con-
 tinued detention is warranted. Despite these measures, as of mid-1994 over 40 per-
 cent of inmates were in prison because they were awaiting either trial or the out-
 come of an appeal, rather than because they had been convicted of an offense. The
 average waiting period for trials is about 18 months, but can exceed 24 months; pre-
 ventive detention thus sometimes runs longer than the penalty for the crime. The
 Constitution and law provide for restitution in cases of unjust detention.
 Detainees are allowed prompt and regular access to lawyers of their choosing and
 to family members. If a detainee is indigent, the State provides a lawyer.
 There are no political detainees. Pumshment by exile abroad is not practiced, and
 a 1993 law prohibits domestic exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for trials to be fair and public,
 and the authorities observe these provisions. Counsel is provided for the accused,
 at government expense if necessary. The law grants defendants the presumption of
 innocence. Trials are public, and defendants have access to an attorney sufficiently
 in advance to prepare a defense. Defendants can confront witnesses. All govern-
 ment-held evidence is normally made available to defendants and their attorneys.
 Defendants can appeal verdicts to the hi est appellate court.
 Although the authorities generally make good-faith efforts to provide due process,
 trials frequently last years, owing to cumbersome procedures. A revised Code of
 Criminal Procedure which took effect in 1989 sought to streamline the process, but
 it has proven ineffective; the Parliament is amending it, but progress has been slow.
 The judiciary is formally autonomous and independent of the executive. However,
 there is a broad public perception that magistrates are subject to political influence
 and that some are swayed by their political biases or personal interests. Since 1993
 some 200 magistrates have come under judicial investigation on charges of corrup-
 tion, collusion, or mafia-related crimes; so far, 13 have been arrested, of which at
 least 4 have been committed to trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 safeguards the privacy of the home, and the authorities respct thisprovision.
 Searches and electronic monitoring may be carried out only under judicial warrant
 and in carefully defimed circumstances. There have been no reports of any other
 kinds of violations of privacy.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and
 press, and the Government does not interfere with these rights. While there are
 laws against obscenity and defamation of state institutions, they have not been en-
 forced in the past several years.
 The public enjoys unhampered access to numerous newspapers and magazines,
 and to broadcasts by several state-run radio and television stations and by many
 private radio stations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government does not re-
 strict the right of peaceful assembly except in cases where national security or pub-
 lic safety is endangered. Permits are not required for meetings, but organizers of
 public demonstrations must notify the police in advance. Professional and employer
 associations organize and operate freely.
 While allowing general freedom of association, the Constitution and law prohibit
 associations that are clandestine; or that pursue political aims through paramilitary
 forces; or that revive the Fascist Party; or, since a 1993 decree, that incite racial,
 ethnic, national, or religious discrimination.
 
 
 854
 In May an authorized demonstration by 200 skinheads in Vicenza provoked wide-
 spread accusations that the Government and police were permitting a revival of
 Yascism. The Interior Minister promptly removed the city's Prefect and Chief of Po-
 lice; initiated judicial action that could lead to prosecution of all participants in the
 demonstration; and banned all further demonstrations by skinheads. The Justice
 Minister and police noted, however, that because the demonstration was peaceful,
 there were scant grounds for prosecution. The Vicenza Public Prosecutor, while ex-
 pressing the same view, requested Justice Ministry authorization to initiate pro-
 ceedings against 22 participants on charges of public defamation of the Republic; the
 Justice Minister granted this authorization in December.
 c. Freedom of  l- The Government does not interfere with the teaching or
 f      f fith. It subsidizes the Roman Catholic Church, the Adventist
 hrcZ and te Assemblies of God by allowing taxpayers to elect to designate a
 fixed small percentage of their tax payment to one or another of these. In November
 1993 the Buddhist community applied for the same funding, but the Government
 has not yet responded.
 Roman Catholic religions instruction is offered in public schools as an optional
 subject. Those students who do not want to attend the "hour of religion" may take
 an alternative course. Some schools allow free time as an option.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the County, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens may travel freely both within the country and abroad. Emigra-
 tion is unrestricted. Citizens who leave are guaranteed the right to return. The Con-
 stitution forbids deprivation of citizenshi for political reasons.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N    Iigh Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Italy usually does not grant
 asylum or permanent refugee status; rather, applicants are granted temporary resi-
 dence permits that must be renewed periodicaly and that carry no guarantee of fu-
 ture permanent status. The Government does not force applicants to return to coun-
 tries in which they presumably would face persecution, and there were no reports
 of forced expulsion of any having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 All citizens over the age of 18 have the right to vote, by secret ballot, for the 630
 members of the Chamber of Deputies. Those over 25 have the right to vote for 315
 of the 325 members of the Senate, which also has 10 non-elected members, such as
 former presidents of the Republic. Elections must be held every 5 years, or sooner
 if the President of the Republic so orders. The Parliament and a few representatives
 of rep"onal bodies jointly elect the President of the Republic for a 7-year term. The
 President nominates the Prime Minister, who upon election by the Parliament se-
 lects the other ministers.
 There are no restrictions in law on women's participation in government and poli-
 tics, but social restraints keep it lower than that of men. In 1994 women occupied
 1 of 26 cabinet positions- 29 of 325 Senate seats; and 86 of 630 in the lower house
 (up from 51 in 1993), including its presidency.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government freely permits nongovernmental or international organizations to
 investigate conditions in Italy and to publish their findings.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex (except with regard to
 hazardous work-see below), religion, ethnic background, or political opinion, and
 provides some protection against discrimination based on disability, language, or so-
 cial status. However, societal discrimination is still evident, especially regarding sex
 and ethnicity.
 Women.--Some laws that nominally are intended to protect women from hazard-
 ous work keep them out of jobs that some of them-perhaps many-are able and
 willing to undertake; e.g., women are not permitted to be employed underground in
 quarm'es, mines, or tunnels. Also, laws notwithstanding, employers generally con-
 tinue to pay higher salaries to men than to women doing comparable work, and to
 favor men over comparably qualified women in filling jobs, particularly those in
 management or likely to lead to it. Official data indicate that only 30 percent of
 adult women are employed outside the home, and that of these, only 0.1 percent
 hold top-level managerial positions.
 Women are underrepresented also in some public-sector professions; e.g., in the
 judicial branch, women account for barely more than one-fourth of all magistrates;
 
 
 855
 10 of the 725 executive positions; 9 of the 591 middle-management positions; and
 1 of 27 presidencies of minors' courts. Likewise, of the 27 public prosecutors in the
 minors' courts, only 3 are women.
 A recent study found that among workers up to age 30, women are paid on aver-
 age $9,700 (equivalent) a year less than men; in the 40-45 age bracket the disparity
 averages $17,400; and among workers at the end of their careers, women earn an
 average $34,200 a year as against $66,450 for men.
 No law prohibits sexual harassment; and although it is prohibited by labor agree-
 ments covering significant sectors (such as metalworking-the leading industrial
 sector-and public service), women who bring suit based on these provisions have
 generally not won their cases.
 Women enjoy legal equality with men in marriage and in property and inherit-
 ance rights.
 Various laws seek to protect women from physical abuse, especially from members
 of their family. Spousal rape is legally regarded as the same as other rape. Although
 there are no reliable data on the extent of domestic violence against women, meda
 reports of it are common and indicate it is widespread. Police and judges are not
 reluctant to bring perpetrators to justice, but victims often do not bring charges, due
 to fear, shame, or ignorance of the law.
 The Government provides a hot-line telephone service which helps abused women
 obtain legal, medical, and other assistance. In 1994 private associations of women
 made several houses available for sheltering battered women.
 The media have reported a number of cases of trafficking of women, usually in-
 volving forced prostitution. Most of these women are illegal immigrants, and so as
 a rule they do not contact the police. The police have male several arrests for these
 offenses.
 Children.--Societal abuse of children continued to be a problem. A nationwide,
 toll-free, privately financed telephone hot-line service to help abused children re-
 ceives an average of about 20 calls a day that report serious cases (along with 200
 a day that are not deemed serious). In 1994 it began to provide psychological assist-
 ance to minors involved in criminal proceedings. Social workers are authorized to
 take remedial or punitive action to protect children, and they can place abused chil-
 dren in family shelters.
 NationalIRacialIEthnic Minorities-Immigrants and other foreigners continued
 to face widespread societal discrimination, and some were subjected to racially moti-
 vated attacks.
 In February five skinheads on a bus boat and stabbed a Tunisian passenger while
 70 other youngsters watched; the five were apprehended, jailed for 9 days, and sen-
 tenced to 18 months in prison, but the sentence was suspended.
 Similarly, in June nine youths on a train beat a university student from Zaire;
 they were not jailed, and received suspended sentences of 20 months.
 Also in June, four skinheads attacked the Imam of the Islamic community in a
 small city, they were arrested, jailed, and 10 days later were given suspended sen-
 tences of up to a year.
 In July a fire of suspicious orig  destroyed a shantytown that was home to 2,200
 illegal immigrants from North Arica, while most of them were away doing their
 seasonal work as migratory farm laborers.
 In the most serious anti-Semitic incident, a Norwegian Jewish woman residing in
 Assisi was assaulted by several youths who, to date, have not been apprehended.
 The Forum of Foreign Communities, a new entity representing immigrants, in
 1993 registered 352 incidents of violence against 24 ethnic groups involving 504 im-
 migrants. Over two-thirds of the attacks occurred in Rome, and most perpetrators
 were below age 25. Preliminary 1994 data indicate there were slight reductions in
 these numbers. The Forum has arranged a telephone hot-line with a toll-free num-
 ber to report incidents of violence against foreigners.
 The only major act of violence against Roma during the year was a firebombing
 attack against a Roma encampment in Sardinia in October by three minors and an
 older youth; in December the latter was given a 6-month suspended sentence for
 throwing a "Molotov cocktail" into the camp. Firemen extinguished the blaze before
 it injured anyone. There have been sporadic demonstrations, so far peaceful, against
 the establishment of one of eight camps for Roma to be set up outside Rome. The
 first of these camps opened in December without significant local opposition.
 People With Disabilities.-A 1968 law requires   t all employers of 35 or more
 persons to staff 15 percent of their workforce with disabled persons, but as yet only
 about 4 percent of the employees in these firms are disabled.
 A 1971 law requires public buildings to be made accessible to the physically
 handicapped, but compliance in schools and other buildings is still not universal.
 
 
 856
 A 1992 law sets forth the rights of disabled persons, provides for various kinds
 of assistance to them, imposes fines on employers who do not comply, and author-
 izes the Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labor to enforce this law. However,
 a seminar in February 1994 concluded that this law had not yet significantly bene-
 fited the over 2 million permanently disabled people in Italy because the relevant
 institutions were still not equipped to implement it.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Workers' Statute of 1970 provides for the right
 to establish trade unions, to join unions, and to carry out union activities in the
 workplace. Trade unions are free of government controls, and no longer have ties
 with political parties. The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and this
 right is frequently exercised. A 1990 law restricts strikes affecting essential public
 services such as transport, sanitation, and health.
 The Workers' Statute prohibits employers of more than 15 workers (or in agri-
 culture, more than 5) from taking retribution against strikers other than deduction
 of wages for the duration of the strike. The Covernment enforces this effectively.
 Hiring of personnel to replace strikers is effectively prohibited.
 Italan unions associate freely with international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively, and the Government does
 not hamper this. By custom (though not by law), national collective bargaining
 agreements apply to all workers regardless of union membership; a July 1993 accord
 guaranteeing this has not yet been implemented as law.
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and orga-
 nizers. The law requires employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination to rem-
 state workers fired for union activities if the firm has more than 15 employees. A
 1990 law covering enterprises with 15 or fewer employees encourages workers in
 them to join unions, and requires that when a union member is fired, the employer
 must state the grounds in writing;, if the judges reject the grounds, the employer
 must either reinstate or compensate the worker.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and it does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law provides that no child
 under 15 years of age may be employed (with some specified exceptions). The Min-
 istry of Labor may authorize the employment of children aged 13 or 14 on certain
 jobs. There are also specific restrictions on employment of males under age 18, and
 females under age 21, in various hazardous or unhealthful occupations. Enforce-
 ment of the minimum-age laws is effective only outside the extensive "shadow" econ-
 omy; a recent study concluded that some 400,000 children below age 15 are em-
 ployed illegally, largely in agriculture in southern Italy.
 In August a legislative decree came into effect that provides for more severe fines
 on employers who violate child-labor laws, while it removes some minor violations
 from the Criminal Code.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages are set not by law but rather
 by national collective bargaining agreements. These specify minimum standards to
 which individual employment contracts must conform. When an employer and union
 fail to reach agreement the courts may step in to determine fair wages on the basis
 of practice in comparable activities or agreements.
 The law establishes standards for workhours, and collective labor contracts elabo-
 rate them. The Basic Law of 1923 provides for a maximum workweek of 48 hours,
 with no more than 6 days per week and 8 hours per day, except that the latter can
 be exceeded in some specified kinds of jobs. Most collective agreements provide for
 a 36- to 38-hour workweek. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours per day or an average
 of 12 hours per week.
 Basic health and safety standards and guidelines for compensation for on-the-job
 injuries are set forth in an extensive body of laws and regulations. A legislative de-
 cree in September incorporated into Italian law the eight European Union Direc-
 tives on Health and Safety, which had not previously been applied in Italy. They
 will take effect on various dates in 1995 and early 1996. Enforcement of health and
 safety regulations is entrusted to labor inspectors, who are either employees of local
 health units or of the Ministry of Labor and have the same status as judicial police
 officers; but the number of inspectors is too small to permit fully effective enforce-
 ment. The courts usually impose fines on convicted violators, but sometimes sen-
 tence them to prison.
 Because of high unemployment there is pressure on workers to accept unsafe con-
 ditions. There are many su   an rd workplaces (especially in the south). Following
 
 
 a serious accident in mid-1993, the Government announced it would establish a spe-
 cial agency to deal with industrial accidents, but this has not yet been done. How-
 ever, n 1994 Parliament revised the basic legislation on such accidents so as to pro-
 vide guidelines regarding dangerous production processes.
