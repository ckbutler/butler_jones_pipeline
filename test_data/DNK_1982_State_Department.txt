 DENMARK
 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a single chamber
 parliament called the Polketing. The 179 members of the
 Folketing represent nine political parties covering a wide
 spectrum of political philosphies.
 Folketing members are selected in free elections on the basis
 of universal suffrage of Danish citizens 18 years of age or
 older. The Constitution provides for the use of referenda.
 The Office of the Ombudsman, which is charged with preventing.
 arbitrary and unreasonable dispositions or acts, provides
 further protection of minority and individual rights..
 Changes in Government are effected by new elections or, as
 occurred in September 1982, by the resignation of the
 Government in power and the formation of a new Government
 composed of members already in Parliament. The current
 Government is a minority coalition composed of four parties
 under the leadership of the Conservatives.
 Denmark is a highly developed industrial society with a social
 welfare system designed to insure a high standard of living for
 all Danish citizens on an equitable basis.
 The Danish Constitution guarantees the integrity of the person
 and states that personal liberty shall be inviolable. Denmark
 also has shown its concern for the protection of human rights
 in other countries. Denmark has taken a leading role in
 international organizations in support of human rights
 throughout the world.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from;
 a. Killing
 Politically motivated killings have not occurred in the recent
 past in Denmark.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, or clandestine detentions do not
 occur in Denmark.
 c. Torture
 Protection against offenses committed by any person or the
 state against the integrity of another person is contained in
 the criminal code. There have been no allegations of torture
 in Denmark.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Protection against cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. Provisions of the
 criminal code prohibit cruel and unusual punishment and
 establish penalties against those who cause bodily harm. These
 provisions also cover offenses against persons in the form of
 medical and scientific experiments. Capital punishment,
 corporal punishment, and imprisonment with hard labor have been
 abolished.

 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 No Danish subject can be deprived of his personal liberty
 without due process of law. Persons taken into custody must be
 taken before a judge within 24 hours of their arrest. The
 judge has the authority to authorize detention or to decide
 whether the individual can be released on bail. If the person
 cannot be immediately released, the judge must decide within
 three days whether the individual should be committed to prison
 or is eligible for release on bail. The judge also has
 authority to determine the amount and the nature of bail.
 These judgments are subject to appeal procedures. The
 Constitution states that persons may not be-held in pre-trial
 confinement for offenses which would normally be resolved by
 payment of fines or by mitigated imprisonment (sentences of
 seven days up to six months) until sentence is imposed.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are open and public. The principle of public hearings
 may be limited to protect the parties and witnesses. Persons
 without means to hire legal assistance are guaranteed legal
 aid, and persons unfamiliar with the Danish language are
 provided with interpreter service. Greater emphasis is placed
 on obtaining the facts of a case than permitting legal
 technicalities to obscure the proceedings.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution provides for the protection of the home.
 Seizure and examination of letters or violation of the secrecy
 of postal, telegraph, and telephone communications, except
 under judicial order, is also prohibited. These legal
 provisions are respected in practice.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution states that any person may express his views
 in written or oral form, subject to his being held responsible
 in a court of law. Censorship and other preventive measures
 may not be introduced. Media representatives and private
 citizens make full use of these freedoms to express their
 opinions on any subject, including criticism of the Government
 and Government policies.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Danish citizens are free to assemble and to form associations
 for any lawful purpose. Police are entitled to be present at
 public meetings and to prohibit meetings or demonstrations
 which the Government believes might become disorderly or
 constitute a danger to the public peace. Freedom of
 association is particularly evident in the field of labor
 relations. Approximately 85 percent of Danish wage earners are
 organized into about 1800 trade unions. The most important
 employees' organization is the Federation of Trade Unions with
 a total membership of 1.3 million. The Confederation of Danish
 Employers has 22,000 members. Under the General Agreement of
 1960, workers and employers acknowledged each other's right to
 organize, and the desirability of collective agreements was
 affirmed. Labor agreements and legislation protect the rights
 of workers and employers. Joint industrial committees provide
 for employees' participation in consultations regarding
 
 
 887
 introduction of new technology. A special technology agreement
 states that employers must coordinate the introduction of new
 technology and, if the introduction results in loss of jobs,
 management must make provision for the workers, such as
 transfer to new duties or subsidizing retraining. The work
 environment is regulated by law to protect the workers.
 In June 1982, the Danish Government formulated and adopted new
 legislation to avoid conflict between human rights and union
 "closed shop" agreements. This action was taken as a result of
 decisions reached in the European Human Rights Commission
 involving United Kingdom citizens. This rapid adjustment of
 law reflects not only official concern for Danish workers, but
 also Denmark's continuing effort to abide by international
 standards for protecting human rights.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Evangelical Lutheran Church is the established church of
 Denmark. However, religious freedom is guaranteed by the
 Constitution. Persons may choose any religion they wish, so
 long as the organization does not teach actions which the
 Government views as against the public interest or well-being.
 These constitutional provisions are honored in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is complete freedom of movement, emigration, and foreign
 travel. Denmark's normal quota for admission of refugees is
 500 per year, with an additional allowance for refugees rescued
 at sea and persons seeking asylum status. Refugee assistance
 is coordinated through the Danish Refugee Council composed of
 12 public and private organizations. Among the groups
 represented on the Council are Amnesty International, Caritas,
 the Danish National Council of Women, and the Danish Jewish
 community. Refugee selection principles are agreed upon by a
 committee of representatives of the Ministries of Foreign
 Affairs, of Justice, and of Social Affairs, plus the Danish
 Refugee Council. Welfare assistance is based on the principles
 of Danish social law, as applied to Danish citizens, adapted to
 the individual needs of refugees. Welfare aid is designed to
 make refugees self-reliant in the community. The program
 includes counseling, financial aid, Danish language training,
 and assistance with housing, employment, and social contacts.
 Requests for asylum are handled by the Ministry of Justice and
 are channeled through the alien police. If the alien police
 report is negative, there is an informal hearing, in which the
 Danish Refugee Council participates, before the Ministry makes
 a final decision.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political life is carried out in a highly democratic fashion.
 Thirteen political parties, reflecting the full spectrum of
 political thought, participated in the 1981 general elections.
 There is respect for civil and political liberties, both on a
 theoretical level and in practice. Danish law guarantees trade
 unions the right to organize, strike, bargain collectively, and
 lobby. The labor movement, a powerful social and political
 force, fully protects the rights of both sexes, a policy
 supported by advanced and comprehensive public welfare
 legislation. The Danish Equal Status Council, which has a
 mandate to ensure equal status of men and women in society, has
 been instrumental in promoting the status of women and in
 
 
 888
 obtaining the adoption of laws which remove sex aiscrimation
 provisions. Danish women hold high and influential positions
 in virtually every area of society; they are cabinet ministers,
 parliamentarians, judges, and journalists, and are integrated
 into the government bureaucracy at all levels.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Denmark has, conceptually and in practice, been a leader in the
 field of human rights. It has supported human rights in
 international fora ano has been in the vanguard of those
 furthering the rights of women, the disadvantaged, and the.
 poor. Denmark is active in the UN Commission on Human Rights.
 Freedom House ranks Denmark among tne world's "most free"
 countries.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Denmark enjoys one-of-the highest standards of living in the
 world. Its per capita GNP is approximately $12,954. At birth,
 Danes may expect to live to be 75. The infant mortality rate
 is 8.8 per 1006 live births, and the fertility rate is 1.8.
 The population of 5,125,000 (1981) grows at the average rate of
 0.4 percent annually. All school-age children nave access to
 free public education, and the nation is 99 percent literate.
 The Danish diet is well in excess of nutritional requirements.
 Over b0 percent of the national budget is devoted to welfare,
 housing, labor, and education. Social benefits are available
 to all on an equal basis without regard to race, creed, or
 etnnic origin. However, unemployment among young women is
 roughly twice that of young men. Economic problems have
 brougnt: about a review of the welfare provisions in Denmark.
