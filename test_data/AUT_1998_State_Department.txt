 AUSTRIA
 Austria is a constitutional democracy with a federal parliamentary form of gov-
 ernment and an independent judiciary. Citizens choose their representatives in peri-
 odic, free, and fair multiparty elections.
 The police are subordinated to the executive and judicial authorities. The national
 police maintain internal security. The army is responsible for external security. The
 police are generally well trained and disciplined, although some members of the po-
 lice were responsible for instances of human rights abuses.
 Austria's highly developed, market-based economy, with its mix of technologically
 advanced industry, modern agriculture, and tourism, affords its citizens a high
 standard of living.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse.
 There were some reports of abuse by police, which involved occasional beatings but
 mainly involved verbal abuse and threats. Legislation went into effect to increase
 protection for women against domestic violence, which has been a problem and is
 considered to be greatly underreported.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits such practices, government statistics for 1997
 showed 321 complaints against federal police officials for illegal violations of per-
 sonal freedoms, such as intimidation, threats, abuse, and mistreatment, compared
 with 235 such complaints in 1996. In 1998 4 police officials were convicted of exces-
 sive physical force; 158 cases are pending. Types of abuse ranged from slander to
 kicking and hitting, resulting mainly in bruising. Some of the violence appeared to
 be racially motivated.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards and the Government
 permits prison visits by human rights monitors. In individual cases, investigating
 judges or prison directors have jurisdiction over questions of access to the defendant.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention and the Government observes this prohibition.
 In criminal cases the law provides for investigative or pretrial detention for up
 to 48 hours; however, in cases of charges of "aggressive behavior" an investigative
 judge may within that period decide to grant a prosecution request for detention of
 up to 2 years pending completion of an investigation. The grounds required for such
 investigative detention are specified in the law, as are conditions for bail. The inves-
 
 
 1126
 tigative judge is required to evaluate an investigative detention after 2 weeks, 1
 month, and every 2 months after the arrest.
 Forced exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of the
 press, and the Government generally respects this right in practice, although strin-
 ent slander laws tend to discourage reports of police brutality. Publications may
 be removed from circulation if they violate legal provisions concerning morality or
 public security, but such cases are extremely rare.
 The government monopoly in television and national radio is gradually being dis-
 mantled. A law passed in 1993 permitted licensing of regional private radio stations,
 but implementation of the law was delayed due to legal challenges by unsuccessful
 applicants for licenses. Rewritten radio frequency rules went into .effect on April 1.
 Since that date, several private radio stations began broadcasting.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, except for Nazi organizations and activities (an
 exception stipulated also in the Austrian State Treaty of 1955). The Law on the For-
 mation of Associations states that permission to form an organization may be denied
 if it is apparent that the organization will pursue the illegal activities of a prohib-
 ited organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution generally provides for freedom of reli-
 gion of individuals. However, the status of religious organizations is governed by the
 1874 -"Law on Recognition" of churches and by a January law establishing the status
 of "confessional communities." Officially, 75.3 percent of the populace is Roman
 Catholic, and there are 11 other recognized religious organizations. Religious rec-
 ognition under the 1874 law has wide-ranging implications, e.g., the authority to
 participate in the state-collected religious taxation program, to engage in religious
 education, and to import religious workers to act as ministers, missionaries, or
 teachers. Although in the past nonrecognized religious groups have had problems
 obtaining resident permits for foreign religious workers, administrative, procedures
 adopted in 1997 have addressed this problem in part.
 Previously, some nonrecognized religious groups were able to organize as legal en-
 tities or associations, although this route has not been available universally. Some
 groups even have done so while applying for recognition as religious communities
 under the 1874 law. Many such applications for recognition have languished in the
 Education Ministry, in some cases for years. Following years of bureaucratic delay
 and an administrative court order instructing the Education Ministry to render a
 decision, in 1997 the Ministry denied the request for recognition of Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses. Jehovah's Witnesses appealed this decision to the Constitutional Court.
 In January a new law went into effect that allows nonrecognized religious groups
 to seek official status as confessional communities without the fiscal and educational
 privileges available to recognized religions. To apply groups must have 300 members
 and submit to the Government their written statutes, describing the goals, rights,
 and obligations of members, membership regulations, officials, and financing.
 Groups a so must submit a -written version of their religious doctrine, which must
 differ. from that of any existing religion recognized under the 1874 law or registered
 under the new law, for a determination that their basic beliefs do not violate public
 security, public order, health and morals, or the rights and freedoms of citizens. The
 new law also sets out. additional criteria for eventual recognition according to the
 1874 law, such as a 20-year observation -period (at least 10 of which must be as a
 group organized as a confessional community under the new law) and membership
 equaling at least two one-thousandths of the Austrian population.  Many religious
 groups -and independent congregations do not meet the 300-member threshold for
 registration under the new law. Only Jehovah's Witnesses currently meet the higher
 membership requirement for recognition under the 1874 law.
 In. a decision issued in March, the Constitutional Court voided the Education Min-
 istry's decision on the Jehovah's Witnesses and ordered a new decision based on the
 January law on the Status of Confessional Communities. In July Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses received the status of a confessional community. According to the January
 
 
 1127
 law, they are now subject to a 10-year observation period before they are eligible
 for recognition.
 As of July 10, the Education Ministry had granted the status of "confessional com-
 munity" to eight religious groups, including for example, Jehovah's Witnesses, Bap-
 tists, and Seventh Day Adventists. The Church of Scientology and the Hindu
 Mandir Association withdrew their applications. The Ministry rejected the applica-
 tion of the Sahaja Yoga group.
 Proponents of the law describe it as an opportunity for religious groups to become
 officially registered as religious organizations, providing them with a government
 "quality seal." However, numerous religious groups not recognized by the State, as
 well as some religious law experts dismiss the purported benefits of obtaining status
 under the new law and have complained that the new law's additional criteria for
 recognition under the 1874 law obstruct claims to recognition and formalize a sec-
 ond-class status for nonrecognized groups. Experts have questioned the new law's
 constitutionality.
 In 1998 the Government continued its information campaign against religious
 sects considered potentially harmful to individuals and society. As part of the cam-
 paign, the Family Ministry initiated a new "Federal Office on Sects", which is re-
 sponsible for collecting and providing information on sects active in the country.
 The Austrian People's Party (OeVP) retained the policy it set in 1997 that party
 membership is incomptible with membership in a sect. This policy led to the res-
 ignation of a local Oe  official in 1997. In uly the city government of the provin-
 cial capital Innsbruck denied permission for a concert sponsored by Scientologists,
 referring to a "ban on Scientology-sponsored activities" stipulated in a 1997 city gov-
 ernment decision.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict movement, including emigration.
 Citizens who leave the country have the right to return at any time.
 Austria has signed the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status
 of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, but subscribes to the "safe countr' concept,
 which requires asylum seekers who have entered illegally to depart and seek refu-
 gee status from outside the country. In response to continuing criticism by the office
 of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other human-
 itarian organizations, the Government passed an amendment to the 1991 asylum
 law in July 1997 designed to bring some improvements to the "safe country" rule
 and the appellate procedure. The Government cooperates with the UNHCR and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. A Government ordinance
 declaring Austria's eastern neighbors as "safe countries" generated continued criti-
 cism by human rights and refugee advocacy groups throughout the fall of 1998. In-
 dividuals found to be true refugees by government authorities are not sent back to
 the countries from which they have fled. The Government established an appeal
 body for refugees-the "UBAS," of the Independent Federal Asylum Senate. Refu-
 gees who feel their cases are not being given due consideration can turn to this body
 for help
 Of Le estimated 95,000 Bosnian refugees who arrived in Austria between April
 1992 and July 1993, the Government provided temporary protected status (TPS),
 similar to first asylum, to 47,000, which made them eligible to receive government
 assistance without having to file asylum applications. Most of the other 48,000 refu-
 gees were deemed to have other means of support, either from families already
 resent in Austria or from nongovernmental organizations. The overwhelming num-
 er of all Bosnian refugees has been integrated in the Austrian labor market. They
 now hold "gastarbeiter" status, which means that their residency permit is evalu-
 ated each year on the basis of Austria's overall labor demand. Many of the refugees
 have chosen voluntarily to return to their homeland, a process that still continues.
 In 1997 4,200 Bosnians returned to their homeland; a similar figure was expected
 to have returned by the end of 1998.
 A September proposal by the Interior Ministry for a change of European asylum
 policy drew substantial criticism from human rights groups and opposition parties.
 While the Interior Ministry maintained that its objective had been to create a
 framework for newly developed concepts such as "temporary protected status" for
 persons fleeing civil war and ethnic conflicts, critics argued that the proposal was
 aimed at abolishing the legal right to asylum.
 Asylum applications dropped in 1997 to 6,719, a reduction of 272 from the pre-
 vious year; the approval rate remained constant with 639 applications approved dur-
 ing the year. This figure includes asylum seekers from Iraq (125), the Federal Re-
 public of Yugoslavia (99), Iran (97), Afghanistan (64), and Bosnia-Herzegovina (39).
 While asylum applications averaged approximately 500 per month in 1997, this fig-
 ure rose to 1,282 in August, of which 800 applications were from Kosovar Albanians.
 
 
 1128
 In reaction to the growing number of asylum applications from Kosovo, the Interior
 Ministry emphasized that the Government did not intend to create a "temporary
 protected status" program for Kosovar Albanians. Instead, the Government aims to
 set up European Union (EU) aid programs for Kosovo. There is no reported or ob-
 served pattern of abuse of refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully. Citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Approximately 25 percent of the members of Parliament and 4 of 16 cabinet mem-
 bers are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. In some cases, they
 have been dissatisfied with the information authorities have supplied in response
 to specific complaints.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law provides for protection against any of these kinds of discrimination in
 employment, provision of welfare benefits, and other matters, and the Government
 generally enforces its provisions effectively.
 Women.-Violence against women is a problem. Official data for 1997 show 11,539
 reported cases of violence against women, of which 472 were rapes and 381 other
 sexual assaults. Police and judges enforce laws against violence; however, less than
 10 percent of abused women are estimated to file complaints. In 1997 a Law on the
 Protection Against Violence in the Family went into force. The Law empowers police
 officials to expel abusive family members from family homes and prohibit them from
 returning for a 7-day period. This period can be extended to as long as 3 months
 by a court order. The Government also sponsors shelters and telephone help lines
 for women.
 Austria is affected significantly by the growth of East-West trafficking in women.
 It is both a transit and destination point, primarily for women from Eastern Europe
 and the countries of the former Soviet Union. Organized crime groups from these
 areas also are involved in trafficking. The country is particularly attractive to traf-
 fickers due to its geographical location and the fact that citizens of the Czech Re-
 public, Slovakia, and Hungary do not require visas to enter the country.
 While prostitution is legal, trafficking for the purposes of prostitution is illegal.
 The law calls for a jail sentence of up to 10 years for convicted traffickers. A witness
 protection program granting temporary resident status to women willing to testify
 against their traffickers went into effect on January 1. In the past, because so few
 witnesses agreed to testify against their traffickers, prosecution was difficult and
 those trafficked often simply were expelled from Austria. The witness protection
 plan is aimed at generating more support from witnesses so that police will be able
 to see concrete results from their efforts. Austrian NGO's, with the support of the
 Government, have begun to broaden their assistance and strong support for battered
 spouses to include those women seeking to flee from the prostitution traps created
 by criminal elements.
 In October the Government hosted an East-West conference on trafficking in
 women. The Minister of Women's Affairs has spoken out repeatedly about the prob-
 lem.
 Most legal restrictions on women's rights have been abolished. Women are still
 prohibited by law from night work in most occupations. Although this ban is some-
 times used as a pretext for not hiring women, it is supported by the Women's Affairs
 Ministry and women's organizations. (Nurses, taxi drivers, and a few other occupa-
 tions are exempted from this ban.) According to a 1994 ruling by the European
 Court of Justice, a sex-based prohibition of nighttime work is not permissible. The
 Government has been granted a transition period until 2001 to adapt its legislation
 to gender-neutral European Union regulations. Legislation revising this prohibition
 was still pending.
 In addition to the federal Women's Affairs Ministry, a federal Equality Commis-
 sion and a federal Commissioner for Equal Treatment oversee laws prescribing
 equal treatment of men and women. Sixty percent of women between the ages of
 15 and 60 are in the labor force. Despite substantial gains, women's incomes aver-
 
 
 1129
 
 age 30 percent less than those of men. As of April 1, women were allowed to serve
 in the military. Several female volunteers started serving on that date.
 Although labor laws providing for equal treatment extend to women in the civil
 service, they remain underrepresented. To remedy this circumstance, a 1993 law re-
 quires hiring women of equivalent qualifications ahead of men in civil service areas
 in which less than 40 percent of the employees are women; there are no penalties
 for failing to attain the 40 percent target.
 Women may be awarded compensation of up to 4 months' salary if discriminated
 against in promotions because of their sex. The Labor Court also can order employ-
 ers to compensate victims of sexual harassment.
 Women's rights organizations are partly politically affiliated, and partly autono-
 mous groups. In voicing their concerns, they receive wide public attention.
 Children.-Laws protect the vast majority of children's rights established in inter-
 national conventions and in some respects go beyond them. Each provincial govern-
 ment and the federal Ministry for Youth and Family Affairs has an "Ombudsperson
 for Children and Adolescents" whose main function is to resolve complaints about
 violations of rights of children.
 While 9 years of education are mandatory for all children, beginning at age 6, the
 Government also provides free education through the level of technical or vocational
 programs or university. Educational opportunity is equal for girls and boys. Com-
 prehensive, government-financed medical care is available for all children without
 regard to gender.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse against children, although heightened public
 awareness of abuse has led the Government to increase its efforts to monitor the
 issue and prosecute offenders. Reports of suspected sexual abuse of children in 1997
 increased to 895, up from the 1996 total of 738; the number of related convictions
 fell from 339 to 314.
 Stricter regulations on child pornography went into effect in 1997. Under the new
 laws, any citizen engaging in child pornography in a foreign country becomes pun-
 ishable under Austrian law even if the actions are not punishable in the country
 where this violation was committed. The new laws also entail more severe provi-
 sions for the possession, trading, and private viewing of pornographic materials. For
 example, exchanging videos is now illegal even if done privately rather than as a
 business transaction.
 In the context of its EU presidency, the Government advanced a muitiyear plan
 to prevent misuse of the Internet. In February 1997 authorities set up a 24-hour
 "tip line" for citizens to report leads on child pornography on the Internet and to
 lodge complaints. In December the Government announced its action plan to combat
 the promotion of child abuse and child pornography through the Internet.
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled individuals are protected by law from discrimi-
 nation in housing, education, and employment. In July 1997, Parliament passed an
 amendment to the Constitution explicitly requiring the State to provide for equal
 rights for the disabled "in all areas of everyday life." The law requires all private
 enterprises and state and federal government offices to employ 1 disabled person for
 every 25 to 45 employees, depending on the type of work. Employers who do not
 meet this requirement must pay a fee to the Government, and the proceeds help
 finance services for the disabled such as training programs, wage subsidies, and
 workplace adaptations. However, the law has *eceived some criticism, since many
 observers believe that penalties are too low to discourage companies from bypassing
 the requirement. No federal law mandates access for the physically disabled; some
 public buildings are virtually inaccessible to those unable to climb stairs.
 Mentally retarded women can be sterilized involuntarily at the request of parents,
 in the case of minors, or, by request of the responsible family member or by court
 order, in the case of adults. One political party called for more restrictive legislation
 to make it more difficult to sterilize mentally retarded women.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-According to a government report on right-
 wing extremism, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia, the number of complaints and inci-
 dents totaled 280 in 1997, 10 cases fewer than in 1996. Criminal convictions were
 obtained in 47 cases. In 1997 the Anti-Defamation League opened an office in Vi-
 enna for Central and Eastern Europe. The European Union opened an office against
 racism and xenophobia in Vienna on July 1.
 Legislation was passed in 1997 to provide law enforcement agencies with ex-
 panded investigative tools, such as electronic eavesdropping, merging of databases,
 and witness protection programs. Criminal investigations begun in 1995 against
 three Austrians for spreading fascist and extreme rightwing propaganda through
 the Internet were dropped in 1997 due to lack of sufficient evidence. In 1997 two
 Austrians were charged for similar offenses; both cases are pending.
 
 
 1130
 Religious Minorities.-The second suspect in the desecration of the Jewish ceme-
 tery in Eisenstadt in 1993 has not been apprehended.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to form and join unions
 without prior authorization, under general constitutional guarantees of freedom of
 association. In practice trade unions have an important and independent voice in
 the political, social, and economic life of the country. Fifty-two percent of the work
 force was organized into 14 national unions, all belonging to the Austrian Trade
 Union Federation (OGB), which has a highly centralized leadership structure. Indi-
 vidual unions and the OGB are independent of government or political party control,
 although formal factions within these organizations are closely allied with political
 parties.
 Although the right to strike is not explicitly provided in the Constitution or in
 national legislation, it is universally recognized. Historically, strikes have been com-
 paratively few and usually of short duration. This year there was one strike by em-
 ployees of the Finance Ministry. A major reason for the record of labor peace is the
 unofficial system of "social partnership" among labor, management, and govern-
 ment. At the center of the system is the Joint Parity Commission for Wages and
 Prices, which has an important voice on major economic questions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively. Almost all large companies, private or state-owned,
 are organized. Worker councils operate at the enterprise level, and workers are enti-
 tled by law to elect one-third of the members of the supervisory boards of major
 companies. Collective agreements covering wages, benefits, and working conditions
 are negotiated by the OGB with the National Chamber of Commerce and its associa-
 tions, which represent the employers. Wage and price policy guidelines are set by
 the Joint Parity Commission. A 1973 law obliges employers in enterprises with more
 than five employees to prove that job dismissals are not motivated by antiunion dis-
 crimination. Employers found guilty of this offense are required to reinstate work-
 ers. Labor and business representatives remain in a longstanding disagreement over
 how to comply with the obligation under the International Labor Organization's
 Convention 98 to provide legal protection to employees against arbitrary dismissals
 in firms with five employees or fewer.
 Typically, legal disputes between employers and employees regarding job-related
 matters are handled by a special arbitration court for social affairs. The OGB is ex-
 clusively responsible for collective bargaining. The leadership of the Chamber of
 Labor, the Chamber of Commerce, and the OGB are elected democratically.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 and is not practiced. The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children
 and enforces this prohibition effectively.
 Former forced laborers have fied suits against Austrian companies that used
 forced labor provided by the Nazi government. In October, the Government set up
 a commission to analyze several Nazi-era issues, including forced labor.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum legal working age is 15 years. The law is effectively enforced by the Labor
 Inspectorate of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The Government has adopted laws
 and policies to protect children from exploitation in the work place. The law pro-
 hibits forced and bonded child labor, and the Government enforces this prohibition
 effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated national minimum wage.
 Instead, nationwide collective bargaining agreements set minimums'by job classi-
 fication for each industry. The generally accepted unofficial minimum gross income
 is $14,000 per year. Every worker is entitled to a variety of generous social benefits.
 The average citizen has a high standard of living, and even the minimum wages
 are sufficient to permit a decent living for workers and their families.
 Although the legal workweek has been established at 40 hours since 1975, more
 than 50 percent of the labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements
 that set the workweek at 38 or 381/2 hours.
 Extensive legislation, regularly enforced by the Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry
 of Social Affairs, provides for mandatory occupational health and safety standards.
 Workers may file complaints anonymously with the Labor Inspectorate, which may
 bring suit against the employer on behalf of the employee; however, this option is
 rarely exercised, as workers normally rely instead on the Chambers of Labor, which
 file suits on their behalf.
 
 
 1131
 
 The Labor Code provides that workers have the right to remove themselves from
 a job if they fear "serious, immediate danger to life and health" without incurring
 any prejudice to their job or career.
