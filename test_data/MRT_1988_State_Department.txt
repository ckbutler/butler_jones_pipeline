 MAURITANIA
 The Islamic Republic of Mauritania has been governed since
 1978 by the Military Committee for National Salvation (CMSN).
 Colonel Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, President of the
 Committee and Chief of State, assumed power in 1984 after the
 bloodless ouster of the former president, Lt. Col. Mohamed
 Khouna Ould Haidalla. All 19 members of the Military
 Committee hold ministerial portfolios or occupy other key
 military or government positions. The Committee functions as
 a legislative body, whereas the President, assisted by a few
 close advisors, wields the executive power. Political and
 opposition parties are not allowed in Mauritania.
 The security forces number about 16,000 and, in addition to
 the regular armed forces, include the national guard, the
 gendarmerie (a specialized corps of paramilitary police), and
 the police. The national guard, gendarmerie, and police all
 have internal security functions. In 1987 and 1988, the
 Government purged security forces of hundreds of suspected
 dissidents.
 Mauritania continues to face massive economic and social
 problems: droughts and desertification, the Western Sahara
 conflict, ethnic tensions, extensive unemployment, one of the
 highest per capita foreign debts in Africa, poor
 infrastructure, inadequate health and education systems, and a
 mass exodus from rural areas. Although adequate rains fell in
 recent years, the prior drought years forced large numbers of
 nomads into towns. This forced migration resulted in urban
 refugee camps, a weakening of traditional Maur nomadic
 culture, and a severe strain on government resources.
 According to government estimates, 20 years ago 85 percent of
 the population was nomadic; in 1987 only 15 percent remained
 in the desert.
 President Taya has publicly advocated a harmonious,
 multiethnic society. The tensions between Mauritania's
 Toucouleur black African ethnic group and the ruling
 Arab-Berber population, however, continued in 1988 and
 resulted in serious human rights abuses. In the wake of the
 1986 unrest and the 1987 coup plot led by Toucouleur military
 personnel, the Government in several trials sentenced 3 to
 death and 78 to various prison terms including life
 imprisonment. The Government carried out the death sentences
 swiftly and moved all the convicted Toucouleurs to a prison in
 the remote desert town of Oualata. The Government also
 dismissed from the security forces several hundred Toucouleurs
 it suspected of involvement in the plot. Conditions at the
 desert prison in Oualata were so harsh that at least four
 Toucouleurs died since September 1988. During the first 6
 months of 1988, the Government imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew
 in Boghe, a predominantly Toucouleur urban area of over 30,000
 that is the hometown of many of the plotters, and imposed
 tight restrictions on travel to and from the city. Many
 Mauritanian black Africans interpreted the Government's
 actions to mean continued discrimination and domination by the
 Maurs of the country's political, social, and economic life.
 In 1988 the Government also faced opposition within the Maur
 community. In September it tried 16 alleged Baathist
 ringleaders for conspiring with a foreign power to threaten
 the security of the State.

 MAURITANIA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Mauritanian law proscribes the use of torture. There were,
 however, recurring credible reports during the summer of 1988
 that the security forces used torture to extract confessions
 from Baathist activists. Moreover, in an anticrime drive in
 Nouakchott, there were reports that police used torture to
 force suspects to admit to certain crimes. There were more
 reports of mistreatment of prisoners in 1988 than at any other
 time during the Taya regime.
 During most of 1988 the Toucouleurs imprisoned at Oualata were
 held in very harsh conditions. They were reportedly kept in
 chains in poorly ventilated cells and were only allowed to
 leave the cells for a few minutes each day. They were denied
 sufficient food, water, and adequate medical care, any change
 of clothing for months, and sanitary facilities, which forced
 them to use the cells as toilets and facilitated the spread of
 disease. The prisoners' families were denied permission to
 visit. In late 1988, at least four inmates died and several
 others were reportedly in serious condition. One of these .
 inmates, an elderly person already in poor health before his
 transfer to Oualata, may have died of old age. Another
 reportedly died of malnutrition, and a third of malaria.
 The cramped and unsanitary cells at Oualata are typical of all
 Mauritanian prisons. The poor medical care is largely
 attributable to the dearth of medical personnel and facilities
 in the remote desert town of Oualata. While some of the
 abuses were triggered by the poorly supervised guards, it
 appears the authorities in Nouakchott reacted slowly to
 reports about the deteriorating health of several prisoners.
 Moreover, the decision to deny the prisoners family visits was
 reportedly taken by the central authorities in Nouakchott.
 The Government has since announced steps aimed at correcting
 these problems. The responsible prison director has been
 dismissed and arrested and is awaiting disciplinary action. A
 doctor was sent to Oualata to treat the prisoners. A few
 weeks later, the Government transferred most of the Toucouleur
 prisoners to less remote prisons and provided better medical
 facilities. It also promised to let the prisoners receive
 family visits, although such visits had not taken place by the
 end of 1988.
 In the spring, high school students staged several days of
 violent demonstrations to protest modifications of the
 national university entrance examination. The police arrested
 several dozen students, some of whom were beaten before they
 were released.

 MAURITANIA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Mauritanian law assures expeditious arraignment and trial,
 access to legal counsel, and the right of appeal. The courts
 must review the legality of a person's detention no more than
 72 hours after his or her arrest. There is no system of
 bail. Compliance with the law is spotty, however. In late
 1987 and 1988, the Government detained persons, sometimes for
 prolonged periods, without formally filing charges against
 them. For example, in September 1987, the Government
 dismissed and detained without charge for more than 6 months
 the three top financial figures in the Government for their
 alleged involvement in the illegal transfer of funds abroad.
 Similarly, in late 1987 and 1988, the Government interrogated
 at length and detained without charge for days, in some cases
 for weeks, scores of Baathist and Toucouleur activists whom it
 suspected of subversion.
 Internal exile is a method of removing opposition figures from
 the public eye. Former President Haidalla and five of his
 associates who were arrested during the 1984 coup, but never
 formally charged, remain in internal exile in remote locations.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Taya Government continues to function under the Shari'a
 (Islamic law) put in place during the Haidalla regime. The
 Ministry of Justice plays the major role in administering the
 Shari'a and selecting judicial personnel. The Shari'a applies
 to most crimes and offenses, with the exception of commercial
 and banking offenses, traffic violations that cause bodily
 harm, and offenses against the security of the State. These
 three categories of offenses are all handled by the special
 court, which renders its judgments on the basis of laws
 modeled after French law. The Taya administration has urged
 the Islamic judges not to use extreme physical punishments,
 such as amputations, which'occurred during the Haidalla
 regime. The Taya Government is slowly eliminating a number of
 unqualified Shari'a judges who were appointed during the
 Haidalla years. By virtue of a recent government decision,
 judges cannot be tenured before 7 years.
 While trials in the ordinary courts are public, the State
 Security Court, which tries offenses against state security,
 may conduct secret trials. All defendants, regardless of the
 court, have the right to be present with legal counsel during
 the proceedings. If necessary, the latter is provided counsel
 at public expense. Defendants may confront witnesses and
 present evidence. They may appeal the sentences of the
 ordinary courts but not those of the security court. While
 the judiciary is nominally independent, some observers claim
 that judges sometimes take their cue from the Government when
 sentencing opponents of the regime.
 In September 1988, the State Security Court tried in an open
 proceeding 16 alleged ringleaders of Mauritania's clandestine
 Baathist Party. The defendants were accused of having ties
 with a foreign power, forming a clandestine organization
 within the armed forces that threatened the security of the
 State, and not denouncing subversive activities. The Court
 sentenced 13 of the accused to prison sentences of from 2 to 5
 years and acquitted 3 in a public trial that, in contrast to
 the security trials of 1986, many observers considered fair.
 
 
 MAURITANIA
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Government interference in private affairs is limited, except
 in instances where treason is suspected. Reflecting the
 nomadic penchant for privacy, the lack of sophisticated
 equipment to undertake surveillance, and the isolation of many
 parts of the country, the Government normally limits its
 surveillance to patrols on major highways and customs
 checkpoints, occasional nighttime inspections of vehicular
 traffic, and inspections of mail suspected of containing
 currency or prohibited items. Under Mauritanian law, the
 police require warrants to perform home searches, although
 this requirement is more often honored in the breach. During
 an anticrime drive in mid-1988, there were reliable reports of
 random beatings at checkpoints and frequent house searches,
 directed in particular at black Africans. The Government
 maintains an active informer system that closely monitors
 persons suspected of antiregime activities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press:
 Freedom of speech and press is restricted. Mauritanians
 criticize government policies in conversations with friends
 and relatives, and they do not appear especially inhibited in
 speaking with foreigners. Military personnel are under tight
 surveillance, however, and views expressed privately that
 could be construed as even mildly critical of the Government
 are likely to be the subject of intense interrogation by
 military security officers. The Government is quick to react
 to any public comments it thinks pose a threat to the security
 of the State, as evidenced by the crackdowns on Toucouleur and
 Baathist dissidents. Many of those arrested or convicted
 during the crackdowns, including journalist Ibrahima Sarr,
 former Minister of Health and Social Affairs Djibo Tafsirou,
 and university lecturer Saidou Kane, were targets because they
 had printed or distributed literature that criticized the
 Government. In particular, the Government responds sharply to
 any expression of ethnic dissatisfaction or questioning of the
 Government's legitimacy.
 Private discussions within the family or tribe are active and
 used as a vehicle to present dissenting views. President Taya
 invites views of traditional local leaders during his visits
 to rural areas.
 Mauritania's only daily newspaper and the radio and television
 stations are government owned and operated. In the past, the
 Government did not allow any media criticism of government
 policies or authority. But in 1987 and 1988, the Government
 experimented by permitting a panel to interview government
 officials on television. In these broadcasts, the authorities
 tolerated limited criticism of goverument decisions and
 policies. In early 1988, the Government authorized the
 ,publication of two privately owned monthly magazines,
 Mauritanie Demain and L'Evenement. While these publications
 have on.occasion discussed controversial social issues, they
 have refrained from any criticism of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association:
 Mauritanian law recognizes the rights of assembly and
 association, but since the 1978 coup the Government has banned
 
 
 216
 MAURITANIA
 all political movements and generally prohibited meetings of a
 political nature. Any formal grouping must be registered with
 the Minister of Interior. The Government usually does not
 interfere with assemblies and associations as long as they
 avoid political activity. The Government did, however, allow
 large but controlled demonstrations and rallies to take place
 during the 1986-87 and 1987-88 campaigns for local municipal
 councils.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion of Mauritania. Virtually all
 citizens are Muslim. Mauritanian Muslims are prohibited from
 entering non-Islamic houses of worship and from converting to
 another religion. Proselytizing by non-Muslims and the
 construction of Christian churches and other non-Islamic
 houses of worship are prohibited without government permission.
 The Roman Catholic community in Mauritania has five churches
 which operate freely as long as they restrict their services
 to resident'foreigners. However, in 1988 the authorities
 clamped down on the Catholic Church's programs, which started
 in 1982, to conduct catechism classes (and occasional masses)
 in a house the Church had rented for this purpose in one of
 Nouakchott's poorer neighborhoods. Those using the house were
 non-Mauritanian black Africans from several West African
 countries. In the summer, the police raided the house,
 confiscated some religious material, and detained several
 persons who were present at the site. While these persons
 were subsequently released, the authorities have since
 prevented the Church from using the house for religious
 purposes. The authorities have not given the Church any
 explanation for this change in policy.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation:
 There are habitually no restrictions on movement within this
 large country, where nomadism long was the prevailing way of
 life. Travelers, however, are subjected to routine police and
 customs checks along major highways and at the country's
 international and domestic airports.
 During times of political unrest, such as after the abortive
 Toucouleur plot of late 1987 or during the 1988 crackdown
 against Baathist dissidents, the Government imposes a curfew
 at night in the major cities. In addition, during the first 6
 months of 1988, the Government imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew
 in Boghe, a Toucouleur stronghold and the hometown of many of
 the plotters involved in the abortive 1987 plot.
 Since 1985 Mauritanians no longer need an exit visa to travel
 abroad. In 1987, however, the spouse of one of the Toucouleur
 prisoners held at Oualata was denied a passport when she
 sought to travel abroad. The Government has invited back the
 political leaders who fled into exile prior to 1985, and
 almost all have returned. During the 1988 crackdown on
 Toucouleur dissidents, some activists fled the country and are
 now in exile.
 
 
 217
 MAURITANIA
 As a result of the ongoing conflict in neighboring Western
 Sahara between Morocco and the Polisario Front, a small number
 of refugees from the Western Sahara have settled in Nouadhibou
 and other northern towns. There are, however, no acknowledged
 political refugees in Mauritania.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In practice, citizens of Mauritania are unable democratically
 to change their Government at the national level. All
 political power rests in the hands of the military regime.
 The Military Committee for National Salvation (CMSN) remains
 the "custodian of the-nation's sovereignty." All executive
 and legislative functions reside with the Committee.
 Membership is limited to military officers who occupy
 ministerial positions or important military and security
 posts. The CMSN is predominantly Maur, although several
 members of Mauritania's black African ethnic groups are
 members. The most prominent Toucouleur on the CMSN lost his
 position in the wake of the 1986 Toucouleur unrest.
 The Government uses a quasi-political organization, the
 Structure for the Education of the Masses (SEM), to mobilize
 the people to carry out local improvement projects, to relay
 policy statements, and to serve as a channel to discuss
 grievances. SEM's are found at all governmental levels down
 to villages and neighborhoods. In practice, most grievances
 are discussed at the family or tribal level and passed along
 to influential governmental figures of the same family or
 tribe.
 A limited move toward popular participation in local
 government has occurred since 1986 in a series of elections
 for city councils throughout the country. All Mauritanian
 residents of these localities aged 21 and over were entitled
 to vote; the ballot was secret. In most localities, two or
 more slates of candidates competed for the electorate's vote.
 The Government stipulated that each slate must comprise people
 from different ethnic groups and tribes. Campaigning was
 vigorous, and candidates were allowed to use the media to
 spread their views. Candidates could only discuss municipal
 issues, however, and could not address larger political
 issues. In most locations the elections appear to have.been
 fair, but there were credible reports that local authorities
 in several towns, including the Toucouleur town of Boghe,
 prevented some slates from holding rallies and denied their
 supporters the electoral cards they needed to vote.
 Despite these electoral shortcomings, the newly elected
 municipal councils have evolved into genuine decisionmaking
 bodies, handling most municipal issues wirth little central
 government interference. The Government  lans to hold further
 municipal elections in 164 rural communes in early January
 1989.
 A woman was recently appointed as Ministei of Women's Affairs,
 Crafts and Tourism, and a number of others have moved into
 senior or midlevel g6vernment positions. Although few women
 were on the lists of-municipal council candidates, large
 numbers of women turned out for the election rallies in
 support of their candidates.

 MAURITANIA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Taya Government is responsive to human right concerns, and
 it has cooperated with the U.N. Human Rights Commission
 Working Group on Slavery by allowing a representative to come
 to Mauritania to obtain information on this issue. In 1987
 the Government permitted representatives of Amnesty
 International (AI) to visit Nouakchott for discussions on the
 Toucouleur issue and in September 1988 allowed a
 representative of AI to attend the trial of the Baathist
 activists. Also in 1988, a delegation from the International
 Commission of Jurists and the Chairman of the African Jurists
 Association visited Mauritania to review human rights
 practices.
 As a result of President Taya's public commitment to an
 ethnically harmonious society and a return to basic human
 rights, the Mauritanian Human Rights League was formed in
 1986. The League, which is affiliated with the Paris-based
 International Federation of Human Rights, is staffed by
 volunteers who work within the government framework to address
 such concerns as eradicating the last vestiges of slavery,
 ensuring the uniform application of Shari'a law, promoting the
 status of women, and preventing abuses such as arbitrary
 arrest and torture. While constrained by a lack of financial
 resources and careful not to antagonize the Government, the
 League has nonetheless insisted that the rights of all
 prisoners be respected, and its observers monitored the
 security trials in 1987 and 1988. In November the League
 issued a public communique, published in the media, which
 criticized the Government for failing to allow the League or
 family members to visit the prisoners at Oualata and requested
 an official inquiry into the deaths of the four prisoners.
 Some black African Mauritanians, however, have alleged that
 the League, the majority of whose members are Maur, is biased
 against Mauritania's black African ethnic groups.
 In March the Mauritanian Human Rights League hosted the first
 Conference on Maghreban Human Rights, which was attended by an
 Algerian human rights organization and Moroccan human rights
 activists. Observers from the Mauritanian Ministry of Justice
 and AI also attended.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Mauritania is situated geographically and culturally on the
 divide between the Arabic-speaking Maurs of the north and the
 sedentary blacks of the African south. The interaction of
 these two groups produces the complex cultural diversity which
 fuels ethnic and racial tensions inherent in Mauritanian
 society. Recent movements of nomads to the south as a result
 of the drought have exacerbated tensions, culminating in the
 1986 Toucouleur agitation and the subsequent arrest of
 Toucouleur activists. Historically, and especially since
 independence in 1960, the Arabic-speaking white Maurs have
 dominated the political and economic system. Taken together,
 however, the Arabic-speaking black Maurs and Mauritania's
 black African groups (Toucouleur, Soninke, and Wolof)
 constitute a clear majority of the population. Although this
 black majority is by no means cohesive--the black Maurs, for
 example, identify in many ways more closely with the white
 Maurs--many blacks believe they are entitled to more political
 
 
 219
 MAURITANIA
 representation. The black population is represented at all
 levels of government, although it is underrepresented in
 relation to its proportion of the population.
 Many Toucouleurs also believe that white Maur domination in
 government, state enterprises, business, and religious
 institutions is a result of racial discrimination. Their
 grievances include such issues as language (Arabic rather than
 continued use of French), limitations on educational
 opportunities, and misapplication of the law on land reform.
 They view the Government's new land reform law as a means of
 allowing wealthy white Maurs access to potentially productive
 tracts of land in traditionally Toucouleur areas. The loss by
 some sedentary African blacks of large tracts of land in the
 Senegal River Valley area has resulted in a scramble by
 Toucouleurs and other southern blacks to register their land
 with the appropriate authorities, an alien practice for people
 who traditionally have looked upon land as community property.
 Women in conservative Mauritanian Muslim society are often
 limited to traditional roles, especially outside the few urban
 areas. Only half as many women as men avail themselves of
 educational opportunities. Nevertheless, the Government is
 encouraging the entry of women into the professions,
 government, and-business. In addition, the Government has
 been opening up new opportunities for employment in work
 traditionally reserved for men, e.g., .certain jobs in
 hospitals. According to Mauritanian labor laws, men and women
 must receive equal pay for equal work. Mauritania's two
 largest employers, the civil service and the state mining
 company SNIM, respect this law. In smaller private
 enterprises, wages are often determined by informal
 bargaining, leading to sometimes significant discrepancies in
 what two persons-are paid for the same work.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to establish unions at the local and national
 level. There are currently 33 trade unions in the country.
 All, however, must be affiliates of the Union of Mauritanian
 Workers (UTM), by law the country's only central labor body.
 The trade unions and the UTM elect their leadership
 democratically, and they are free to determine their programs
 and policies, provided .these avoid political issues. The UTM
 is an active member of the International Confederation of Arab
 Trade Unions and the Organization of African Trade Union Unity
 and represents Mauritanian workers in the International Labor
 Organization.
 Mauritanian law grants workers the right to strike. In
 practice, however, -the Government discourages strikes, and
 they rarely occur. Under Mauritanian law, tripartite
 arbitration committees, composed of union, business, and
 government representatives, may impose binding arbitration
 that automatically terminates any strike.
 The UTM, which once played a significant role in Mauritanian
 economic and social life, has been paralyzed for the past
 several years by bitter factional disputes. Under government
 prodding, however, the UTM planned to hold elections and a
 national UTM congress to resolve these disputes and elect a
 new national leadership, but these had not taken place by the
 end of 1988.
 
 
 220
 MAURITANIA
 b. The Rigot to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions are free to organize workers without government or
 employer.interference. The laws providing workers protection
 against antiunion discrimination are regularly enforced.
 Collective bargaining, notably to set wages, occurs informally
 between individual unions, employers, the Government, and the
 UTM. In addition, employees or employers may bring labor
 disputes to three-person labor courts that are overseen
 jointly by the Ministries of Justice and Labor. Labor leaders
 regard these courts as unbiased and effective. There are no
 export processing zones in Mauritania, and labor laws are
 applied uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The subject of forced labor is tied to the vestiges of slavery
 which exist in some areas of the country. Slavery in
 Mauritania was officially abolished in 1980. Nevertheless,
 some persons whose ancestors had worked without pay for
 generations for a particular family still occupied positions
 of servitude in 1988, in part because of the economic
 hardships they would have encountered had they left. In
 certain remote areas, however, persons were sometimes held
 against their will and forced to perform unpaid labor. The
 authorities stop such practices when they come to their
 attention. The Taya regime is making a systematic effort to
 appoint members of the former slave caste to high government
 and military positions as a visible indication of the end of
 slavery.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Education is not compulsory in Mauritania; however, by law no
 child may be employed before the age of 14 in the agricultural
 sector without the permission of the Minister of Labor and the
 National Labor Council, nor before the age of 15 in
 nonagricultural sectors. The law provides that employed
 children aged 14 to 16 years should receive 70 percent of the
 minimum wage, and those from 17 to 18 receive 90 percent of
 the minimum wage. Although there are no figures available,
 child labor (except in the family owned agricultural sector)
 is not widespread.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 In 1988 the guaranteed minimum wage for adults was equivalent
 to $70 per month. These wages barely enabled the average
 family to meet its minimum needs. The standard, non-
 agricultural workweek in Mauritania cannot exceed either 40
 hours or 6 days without overtime compensation, which is paid
 at the following rates: 41-48 hours--115 percent; 49-54
 hours--140 percent; 55-plus hours--150 percent of the base
 wage. However, information on actual wage levels is scanty
 and often unreliable. Enforcement of the labor laws is the
 responsibility of the Labor Inspectorate, Ministry of Labor,
 but in practice is limited by the shortage of trained
 personnel.
