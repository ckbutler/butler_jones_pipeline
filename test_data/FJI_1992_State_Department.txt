 FLJI
 Fiji's system of parliamentary democracy, inherited when the country gained inde-
 pendence from Great Britain in 1970, was interrupted in October 1987 with the in-
 stallation of a military regime following two bloodless coups. Former Prime Minister
 Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara then took over the reins of government and focused on re-
 vitalizing the economy and drafting a new constitution. The interim government ad-
 ministered the country from December 1987 until an election was held in late Mar
 1992. Ethnicity plays a major role in Fiji's political and economic system. Fiji's mul-
 tiracial society is about evenly dividedbetween indigenous Fijians and ethnic Indi-
 ans. Indians dominate the economy and professions and are well represented in the
 lower and midlevels of the public service, while ethnic Fijians make up the bulk of
 the nation's military services and control the political structures.
 In 1991 Major General Sitiveni Rabuka the officer who led the 1987 coups, re-
 signed as commander of the Fiji Military Forces (FMF) and entered the May 1992
 election (in which nearly 80 percent of Fiji's registered voters-both ethnic Fijians
 and Indo-Fijians-participated). He was overwhelmingly elected to Parliament by
 his local constituency. The President selected him to be Prime Minister after
 Rabuka demonstrated that he commanded majority support in the House of Rep-
 resentatives. His backers included 13 Indo-Fijians from the F ji Labour Party (FLP),
 whose support was given in exchange for a pledge, inter alia to review the 1990
 Constitution, which ensures political dominance by ethnic Fijians. In December
 Rabuka surprised Parliament with a proposal to create a new government of na-
 tional unity which would include Indo-Fijians. Initial reaction was favorable but it
 was not possible for major developments on it to occur in the short time left in 1992.
 The small but professional Fiji Military Forces (FMF) include a naval division and
 an air wing. Fiji also has a separate police force. The military and police forces re-
 port to and are under the control of the Minister for Home Affairs and, ultimately,
 
 
 563
 the President. Total military expenditures for 1989, the last year for which the US.
 Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were $26
 million. The Government has been reducing its armed forces over the past several
 years. Further reductions are unlikely in the short term, given Fiji's major commit-
 ment to United Nations peace-keeping forces. In 1990 the Government established
 the Fiji Intelligence Service, with lmi~e powers to search people and property, tap
 telephones, and open mail.
 Sugar and tourism onstitute the mainstays of the economy, accounting for almost
 half of the nation's foreign exchange earnings. The economy has recovered from the
 effects of a severe decline following the 1987 coups, despite series of strikes and
 other industrial actions. The Government is promoting light manufacturing for ex-
 port to diversify the economy and lessen its dependence on sugar and tourism.
 Principal human rights problems in 1992 included constitutionally imposed and
 ethnically bsed plitical discrimination, continuing restrictions on freedom of the
 press, continuing delays in bringing criminal and civil cases to trial, and violence
 and discrimination against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrqjudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by the Government or any political group.
 b. Dippearance.-There were no reports of disappearances in 1992.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Desradng Treatment or Punishment.-
 Police sometimes physically abuse detainees; the offending officers have been pun-
 ished in some instances, although punishments have been light. In September 1991,
 the new Police Commissioner announced the creation of a new internal affairs unit
 to expedite the investigation of such cases. Headed by an Assistant Commissioner
 of Police, the unit took disciplinary action against several officers in 1992. Its inves-
 tigations resulted in criminal charges being filed in 5 cases which were before the
 courts at year's end. Corporal punishment is permitted by law as a enalty for
 criminal acts; strokes of the cane are administered under medical supervision.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In Fiji the law governing arrest and de-
 tention broadly follows the British model. Generally, a person may be arrested only
 if there is a reasonable belief that a breach of the criminal law has been or is about
 to be committed. Arrested persons must be brought before a court without "undue
 delay." This is taken to mean within 24 hours, with 48 hours the exception (such
 as when an arrest is made over the weekend). Rules governing detention are de-
 signed to insure fair questioning of suspects. Defendants have the right to a judicial
 review of the grounds for arrest; in urgent cases application ma be made to a judge
 at any time, whether he is sitting or not. Incommunicado and arbitrary detention
 are illegal, and none occurred in 1992.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial structure was reorganized under the
 1990 Constitution but remains similar to the British system. The principal courts
 in Fiji are the Magistrate Courts, High Court, the Court of Appeal, and the Su-
 preme Court, which is the court of final appeal The Court of Appea has an enor-
 mous backlog of cases because of the Government's failure to appoint a president
 for it until December 1991 and its consequent inability to convene before that time.
 There are no special courts; military courts try only members of the armed forces.
 Magistrate Courts continue to try the large majority of cases. In addition to its juris-
 diction in serious civil and criminal cases, the High Court is granted special jurisdic-
 tion on behalf of the public and is empowered to review alleged violations orindivid-
 ual rights guaranteed under the 1990 Constitution.
 The judiciary remains independent under the new Constitution. Rights of due
 process are similar to those found in English common law. The right to public trial
 is guaranteed and defendants have the right to counsel. Trials in the High Court
 provide for the presence of assessors (akin to a jury); cases in the Magistrate Court
 do not. In litigation involving lesser complaints, a public legal advisr assists
 indigents in domestic or family law cases. The right of appeal exists but is ham-
 pered by increasing delays in the appeals process. Normal bail procedures mean
 that most defendants do not experience any pretrial detention. There are no political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In gen-
 eral, privacy of the home is respected since the 1987 coups. However, the Fiji Intel-
 ligence Service has limited powers to search people and property, open mail, and
 tap telephones within specific operational guidelines outlined in the government de-
 cree which created it. There is no evidence that these powers are being abused. Sur-
 
 
 564
 veillance of persons believed to represent a security threat is carried out to some
 degree. Many political dissidents believe their telephones and mail are monitored,
 but concrete evidence is lacking.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech has largely been restored.
 Political figures and private citizens can and d spek out against the Government.
 Although the Public Order Act and other acts prohibit any actions which are likely
 to incite racial antagonism, no arrests for making any kindof public statement were
 reported in 1992.
 The Government has broad discretionary powers to impose restrictions on press
 freedom, and it has sometimes done so. Legislation pertaining to the press is con-
 tained in the Newspper Registration At (NRA) and the Press Correction Act
 (PCA). Under the NRA all newspapers which are sold and published in Fiji must
 be registered with the overnment  fore they can begin publishing. The PCA gives
 the Minister of Information sole discretionary power to order a newspaper to publish
 a "correcting statement" if, in his opinion, a false or distorted article has been pub-
 lished. Should the newspaper refuse to publish the Minister's correction, it can be
 taken to court and, if found guilty, fined up to $700 (individual persons convicted
 under the Act may be fined up to $150 an or imprisoned for 6 months). The PCA
 allows the Government to arrest anyone who publishes "malicious' material. This
 includes any false news which ouldcreate or foster public alarm or result in the
 "detriment of the public."
 Privately owned broadcast and print media operate without prior censorship but
 with considerable self-censorship. Newspapers usually refrain from printing edi-
 torials severely critical of the Government and do little investigative reporting.
 Statements about the political situation by opposition fiures and foreign govern-
 ments are reported, however. Journals such as the Fiji Labour Sentinel are often
 highly critical of the Government. In March 1991, the opposition coalition published
 a critique of the 1990 Constitution entitled "A Fraud on the Nation." This publica-
 tion was freely available in local bookstores. The letters columns of the two daily
 newspapers also frequently carry political statements by persons opposed to the
 Government, its p      ,  and the Constitution.
 The Government [ook with disfavor on criticism of the traditional chiefly system.
 In 1992 a senior government official rebuked the press for publishing reports about
 the President's ill health prior to his medical evacuation to the United States on
 the grounds that, since the President is a paramount chief, speculation about his
 health was discourteous and potentiall destabilizing.
 Labeling her a "prohibited person, immigration officials barred an Australian
 journalist from entering Fiji in February to cover a visit by the Australian Foreign
 Affairs Minister, several months later she was allowed to enter Fiji to cover the gen-
 eral election.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Assembly for political purposes
 is allowed but subject to restriction in the interest of public order. Public gatherings
 require permission from the Government's district officers, who may obtain prior as-
 sessment and advice from the police on the anticipated crowd size and the ability
 of the police to ensure public safety. Permits for large outdoor political meetings or
 demonstrations are not always granted. In response to opposition political activity
 on the part of University of the South Pacific (USP) staff, the USP Council, under
 government pressure, issued new rules restricting political involvement by USP
 staff.
 The Government did not interfere with political activities during the May general
 election. Permits were routinely issued for rallies organized by political parties, reli-
 giousgroups, and groups opposed to the Government. Several new parties were cre-
 ated in 1991 and 1992 to contest the election. All opposition party headquarters re-
 main open and fully operational. Political organizations are allowed to operate and
 issue public statements. They did so repeatedly and openly throughout 1992.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution
 and honored in practice. The preamble to the Constitution emphasizes the impor-
 tance of Christianity to the Fijian people, but provides for protection for all reli-
 gions. No significant restrictions affect foreign clergy and missionary efforts or other
 typical activities of religious organizations.
 At the opening session of Parliament in 1992, Prime Minister Rabuka spoke in
 favor of declaring Fiji a Christian state while preserving the full rights and liberties
 of all other religions, as enshrined in the 1990 Constitution. Several other par-
 liamentarians subsequently supported the concept of a constitutional provision de-
 claring Fiji a Christian nation.
 
 
 565
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the country
 or abroad. Occasional detentions at the airport occur, but the courts do not hesitate
 to order redress. Fiji citizens are free to emigrate. According to the best available
 estimates, about 36,000 have done so since May 1987. Most of the emigrants are
 Indo-Fijians, many of them professionals, but some ethnic Fijians and others also
 have left. Several thousand have claimed refugee status, especially when applying
 for admission to Canada, but neither the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees nor
 any government has recognized those claims. In 1991 and 1992, as the economic
 downturn in Australia and New Zealand continued and Fiji moved toward restora-
 tion of accountable government several hundred prominent Indo-Fijians who had
 emigrated in the pstcoup perioA returned to FIJL There are no refugees in Fiji, and
 no forced resettlement programs.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of citizens to change their government is abridged by the provisions of
 the 1990 Constitution ensuring political dominance by ethnic Fijians, primarily by
 establishing rac-based representation in Parliament. Moreover, the Constitution
 was promulgated by an unelected interim government and was never approved by
 a national referendum.
 The Constitution guarantees ethnic Fijian dominance of the Government by pro-
 viding indigenous Fijians with 37 of 70 seats in the elected lower house of Par-
 liament. Indo-Fijians are accorded 27 seats, Rotumans (culturally distinct Polyne-
 sians) 1, and other races 5. In the Senate (an appointed body with essentially review
 powers and the right to veto legislation), indigenous Fijians hold 24 of the 34 seats,
 Rotumans 1, and the other groups 9. Other constitutional features designed to en-
 sure indigenous Fijian-political dominance include a requirement that the Prime
 Minister be an ethnic Fian and selection procedures which virtually ensure that
 the President will also be an ethnic Fijian.
 The Constitution also incorporates a bill of rights, prviding for freedom of speech,
 assembly, religion, and other universally accepted rights and freedoms. The section
 setting forth these rights provides that they may not be altered by Parliament ex-
 cept with the approval of two-thirds of the lower house. However elsewhere in the
 Constitution, Parliament is also given the authority to pass special acts to deal with
 certain specified emergency situations, notwithstanding human rights guarantees
 found in other sections of that document. The Attorney General's office has taken
 the view that any legislation introduced under the emergency powers provision
 would require two-thirds approval by the lower house but critics of the Constitution
 maintain that only a simple majority would be needed. Critics thus claim that indig-
 enous Fijians in the lower house would be able, solely on the strength of their own
 numbers, to abrogate constitutional human rights protections.
 The President is selected by the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC), a traditional
 Fijian leadership body. He appoints Fijian members of the Senate on the advice of
 the GCC and the provincial councils, and according to his own judgment with regard
 to the nine members of other races. He appoints the one Rotuman senator on the
 advice of the Rotuman Council. The Prime Minister, who along with the Cabinet
 holds most of the executive authority, is chosen by the President from among the
 Fijian members of the lower house on the basis of his ability to command majority
 support within that body.
 Elections are held by secret ballot, with voting only by communal constituencies.
 The Constitution calls for elections every 5 years, but the Government may call an
 election at any time. Significantly, the Constitution (Article 161) provides for a for-
 mal review of its provisions within 7 years of its promulgation and every 10 years
 thereafter.
 The 1992 general elections were contested by a dozen political parties and were
 both free and fair. Four of the parties are predominantly Ind-Fijian. The major
 ones, the National Federation Party (NFP) and the FUi Labour Party (FLP), iledged
 to continue their opposition to the Constitution in the Parliament. Following the
 Prime Minister's surprise December 4 proposal to create a government of national
 unity, the NFP and the FLP gave their preliminary endorsement to the concept sub-
 ject to further discussions with the Prime Minister.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no human rights groups as such in Fiji, but the women's rights move-
 ment, the labor movement, and various political groups are involved in promoting
 a number of human rights causes. There are also several small foreign-based organi-
 
 
 566
 zations which concentrate on human rights causes in Fiji, including the Coalition
 for Democracy in Fiji (with offices in New Zealand and Australia) and two United
 Kingdom-based groups, the International Fiji Movement and the Movement for De-
 mocracy in Fiji.
 The Government has opposed investigations of the political and human rnhts sit-
 uation by external human rights organizations. However, in August it did allow
 former South Australia Premier Don Dunstan, President of the Australian Move-
 ment for Democracy in Fiji, to attend the FLP convention in Fiji as keynote speaker.
 Dunstan roundly criticized the Constitution. His opinions were fully and promi-
 nently covered in the press.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Se, Religion, Languqge, or Social Status
 The stated purpose of the 1987 military coups was to ensure the political suprem-
 acy of the indigenous Fijian people and to protect their traditional way of lie and
 communal control of land. To this end, a number of measures have been taken that
 favor indigenous Fijians over other ethnic groups. The most obvious are the reappor-
 tionment of the Parliament to guarantee a preponderance of Fijians and constitu-
 tional provisions ensuring selection of an ethmc-Fijian President and Prime Min-
 ister. The Government is also committed to raising the proportion of Fijians and
 Rotumans in the public service to 50 percent or more at all levels. Current pro-
 motion and hiring policies in the public service favor ethnic Fijians.
 Although the Constitution also provides specific affirmative action provisions to
 improve the conditions of those disadvantaged as a result of race, sex, place of ori-
 gin, political opinion, color, religion, or creed, the Government practices sexual dis-
 crimination in the recognition of spousal and offspring rights. Spouses of Fi.'i citizen
 women are not automatically granted citizenship, whereas spouses of Fiji citizen
 males are. Offspring of female ethnic Fijians married to nonethnic Fijians are not
 entitled to regtry in the document governing who shares in income from communal
 ownership of native lands. Men, however, pass on ethnic-Fijian status to their off-
 spring, regardless of the wife's ethnic background.
 Control of land is a highly sensitive issue in Fiji. About 84 percent of the land
 is held communally by indignous Fijians. Most cash crop farmers are Indo-Fijians,
 who lease their land from the Fijian villages. The present land ownership arrange.
 ments were instituted by the British to protect the interests of the indigenous
 Fijians. Freehold land title is not an indigenous concept; lands owned currently by
 the State (8 percent) and by individuals (8 percent) were transferred from cus-
 tomary owners during the colonial period. Many Indo-Fijians, particularly farmers,
 believe that the absence of secure land tenure discriminates against them.
 Indo-Fijians are subject to occasional harassment and crime based on race, which
 is compounded by inadequate police protection. More rarely, similar acts of vandal-
 ism have been reported against Chinese farmers in remote rural areas. There have
 been no credible allegations of government involvement in such incidents, and the
 police have investigated and, where possible, arrested lawbreakers.
 Women in beth the Fijian and Indo-Fijian communities have functioned primarily
 in traditional roles, although some women rise to prominence in the public service,
 politics, and business. Women can also attain high status in Fiji's traditional chiefly
 system. The former Prime Minister's wife is, in her own right, Fiji's second highest
 ranking traditional chief. In general, women in the Fijian community are more like-
 ly to gain recognition in their own right than are women in the Indo-Fijian commu-
 nity. Women have full rights of property ownership and inheritance, and a number
 have become successful entrepreneurs. Women are generally paid less than men, a
 discrepancy that is especially notable in the garment industry.
 Garment workers, most of whom are female, are subect to a special minimum
 wage, considerably lower than that in other sectors. In December 1991, the leader
 of the women's wing of the local labor confederation charged that women in the gar-
 ment industry were being sexually harassed at the workplace, especially when
 working overtime. The Government has taken no action to address these charges.
 There is a small but active women's rights movement, which has pressed for more
 serious treatment of rape in the courts. The crime tends to draw prison sentences
 of only a few years. Continued admonitions by the Chief Justice in 1991 resulted
 in some increase in the average prison term for rape. The law allows corporal pun-
 ishment for rape, but this is generally used only in cases of offenses against minors.
 Domestic violence is also a problem in Fiji and is a second major focus of the
 women's movement. The authorities are generally reluctant to intervene in cases of
 domestic violence unless it is necessary to save the woman's life. Few cases result
 in prosecution, as the victim generally does not press charges. The Government has
 not been active in dealing with domestic violence.
 
 
 567
 Suva, the capital, has a privately funded women's crisis center which offers coun-
 seling and assistance to women in cases of rape, domestic violence, and other prob-
 lems, such as child support payments. There is, overall, a growing awareness that
 women's issues are deserving of greater attention, but the issue has been over-
 shadowed by the political events stemming from the 1987 coups.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers' rights to form and join unions, elect their
 own representatives, publicize their views on labor matters, and determine their
 own policies are protected by law and observed in practice. However, the law per-
 mits restrictions to be applied on government employees, in the interests of defense,
 public safety, public order, public morality, or public health, or to protect the rights
 and freedoms of other persons.
 All unions must register with, but are not controlled by, the Government. The
 only central labor body is the Fiji Trade Union Congress (FrUC), which was closely
 associated with the opposition FLP until mid-1992. The labor movement is led large-
 ly by ethnic Indians. Persons with close ties to the Government have started rival
 unions primarily for ethnic Fijians; these unions are more willing to cooperate with
 the Government. The FTUC is free to associate internationally and does so.
 Following several years in which labor-government relations were marred by
 confrontational tactics, the new Government's establishment in June appears to
 have brought about a more amicable relationship.
 In November 1991, the interim Government passed Decrees 42, 43, and 44 which
 unilaterally changed the role of the labor unions. The decrees established stricter
 definitions of preconditions for a strike, more complex machinery for settlement of
 labor disputes, and other guidelines to control labor union activity. The decrees also
 eliminated the dues check-off system through which nearly all unions received their
 operating funds. (In December the Cabinet reinstated the automatic dues check-off
 syestem, satisfying a pressing demand of the FTUC.) The trade unions rejected the
 ecrees and sought support from the international labor movement to convince the
 Government to rescind the reform package. In the initial outline of its program, the
 Government promised to look for ways to reestablish a dialog with the unions. In
 November the International Labor Organization issued a detailed review of a com-
 plaint brought with respect to the 1991 decrees and, while stating that some of the
 provisions of the decrees were compatible with internationally recognized worker
 rights, called on the Government to amend the legislation with regard to registra-
 tion requirements, strike bans, and other limitations.
 In September 1992, the new Minister for Labour and Industrial Relations took
 concrete steps to address the unions' concerns. These included formal recognition of
 the FTUC, a public pledge to review the 1991 labor reforms decreed by the interim
 government, and a further pledge to eliminate those aspects of the decrees consid-
 ered objectionable by labor. He announced plana to reestablish the tripartite forum
 of employers, unions, and government which oversaw labor negotiations until 1985.
 Strikes are legal in Fiji and the ongoing industrial action at the Vatukoula gold
 mine continued in 1992. This dispute has impaired production at the mine since it
 began in February 1991. As a major atep towards breaking the deadlock, the Gov-
 ernment in 1992 ordered management of the mine to recognize the Mine Workers'
 Union, following a determination by the Ministry for Labour and Industrial Rela-
 tions that more than half the mineworkers are registered with the union. Rather
 than comply, the mine management filed for an injunction that would declare that
 the Ministry's finding was illegal.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-The law reognizes the right
 to organize and bargain collectively. Employers are required to recognize a union
 if more than half the employees in a workplace have joined it. Recognition is deter-
 mined by union membership numbers rather than by an election. The Government
 has the power to order recalcitrant employers to recognize unions. Key sectors of
 the economy, including sugar and tourism, are organized. Following the May elec-
 tion, the Government lifted wage guidelines, and unrestricted collective bargaining
 on wages is now the norm.
 Wage negotiation are not conducted on an industry-by-industry basis, and a gov-
 ernment proposal to introduce the practice has been opposed by employers and
 unions. Union leaders fear that straight market-based wage bargaing would open
 unacceptably large wage gaps between skilled and unskilled workers. Until 1984 a
 tripartite forum of employers, unions, and government oversaw labor negotiations.
 In that year however labor withdrew from the forum and it was abolished. The res-
 toration of the b edy has been a key demand of the FTUC, and the Government an-
 nounced plans in September 1992 to reconstitute the forum.
 
 
 568
 Antiunion discrimination is specifically prohibited by Fijian law, which provides
 for complaints to be riled with the Registrar of Trade Unions. In practice, the unions
 are generally successful in preventing discrimination against workers for union ac-
 tivities.
 Fiji's export processing zones are subject to the same laws as the rest of the coun-
 try, and many of their firms have unions which have negotiated collective bargain-
 ing agreements.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, and there is no indication that it is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Children under 12 may not be em-
 ployed in any capacity. Children (under age 15) and young persons (ages 15-17)
 may not be employed in industry or work with machinery. Enforcement by the Min-
 istry for Labour and Industrial Relations generally is effective, except in the case
 of family members working on family farms or businesses.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-No national minimum wage has been estab-
 lished. Certain setors have minimum waes set by the Ministry for Labour and In-
 dustrial Relations. The minimum wage, which is effectively en'orced, will generally
 support a barely adequate standard of living for workers and their families in all
 sectors except the garment industry. In the garment industry, the starting wage is
 based on the assumption that workers are young people or married women living
 at home and not supporting a household.
 Fiji has no regulation specifying a standard workweek for adult males. Women
 are prohibited from night work in factories (other than overtime work in the gar-
 ment industry) and underground work in mines. Certain industries, notably trans-
 portation and shipping, have problems with excessive hours of work. A number of
 atal bus accidents-have been attributed to driver fatigue caused by excessive work.
 ing hours. Indo-Fijians, who generally require a cash income to survive, are more
 vulnerable to pressure to worklong hours than ethnic Fijians. Many ethnic Fijians
 readily return to a noncash economy wayof life in their villages rather than work
 what they consider excessive hours. Fiji has workplace safety regulations, a Work-
 men's Compensation Act, and an Accident Compensation Plan. Awards for workers
 injured on the job are set by a tribunal. Government enforcement of safety stand-
 ards under the direction of the Ministry for Labour and Industrial Relations suffers
 from a lack of trained enforcement personnel, but the unions do a reasonable job
 of monitoring safety standards in organized workplaces. A 1989 study of working
 conditions in the garment industry resulted in the Government ordering many em-
 ployers to improve working conditions. Union leaders complained that the Govern-
 ment's action was too mild and that the employers should have been subject to
 criminal prosecution.
