 MOLDOVA
 Moldova gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. In 1994 it adopt-
 ed a Constitution that provides for a multiparty representative government with
 power divided among a president, cabinet, parliament, and judiciary. On January
 15, former parliamentary speaker Petru Lucinschi was inaugurated as President for
 a 4-year term. International observers considered the presidential elections, held in
 the fall of 1996, to be free and fair. President Lucinschi ran as an independent and
 in late January appointed a new government under the leadership of Prime Min-
 ister Ion Ciubuc. Although Ciubuc had not served as a minister in the previous gov-
 ernment, a number of ministers were retained. During the second half of the year,
 political parties started to prepare for the parliamentary elections to be held in the
 spring of 1998. Although increasing in independence, the judiciary is still subject to
 the influence of the prosecutor's office.
 Moldova remains divided, with    mostly Slavic separatists controlling the
 Transnistrian region along the Ukranian border. This separatist regime has entered
 negotiations with the national government on the possibility of a special status for
 the region. Despite the signing of a memorandum on the bases for normalizing rela-
 tions in May, progress has been blocked by the separatists' continuing demands for
 "statehood" and recognition of Moldova as a confederation of two equal states. The
 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Russian Federa-
 tion, and Ukraine act as mediators. The two sides have generally observed the
 cease-fire of July 1992, which ended armed conflict between them, but other agree-
 ments to normalize relations have often not been honored. A Christian Turkic mi-
 nority, the Gagauz, enjoys local autonomy in the southern part of the country.
 The Moldovan Ministry of Internal Affairs has responsibility for the police. The
 Ministry of National Security controls other security organs, including the border
 guards. The Constitution assigns to Parliament the authority to investigate the ac-
 tivities of these ministries to ensure that they comply with legislation in effect. A
 protective service, which guarded the President, the Prime Minister, and the Speak-
 er of Parliament, was abolished shortly after President Lucinschi took office because
 of allegations of politicization under former President Snegur.
 While Moldova has recently made considerable progress in financial stabilization
 and economic reform, real growth in the economy continues to be slow. Hence, for
 many, prosperity remains elusive. In Transnistria the economic situation is even
 worse. The local authorities have not implemented any significant economic reforms,
 and there is substantial evidence of widespread corruption.
 Moldova, whose economy is largely based on agriculture, continued to make
 progress in economic reform. A law governing the sale and purchase of land went
 into effect in September. Citizens and foreign investors can buy land, which is
 bought and sold at market prices. However, foreigners cannot buy agricultural land,
 nor can agricultural land be resold for a period of 5 years. A government-backed for-
 eign-financed program is now facilitating the breakup of agricultural joint stock as-
 sociations and the issuance of land titles to their former members. The Government
 has privatized 72 former collective farms and plans to extend this program to an
 additional 500 farms in 1998. The gross domestic product is officially estimated at
 about $440 per capita. According to government statistics, about 80 percent of the
 population lives below the poverty level, and 10 percent of the rural population has
 a per capita income of less than one-quarter of that level. A majority of citizens can-
 not afford to buy fish, meat, milk, and other dairy products on a regular basis. The
 average monthly inflation rate was under 1 percent. Moldova's external borrowings
 totaled over $600 million. The economic situation is worse in Transnistria.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, however,
 there were problems in some areas. The police occasionally beat detainees and pris-
 oners. Prison conditions remain harsh, with attempts to improve them hampered by
 lack of funding. The judiciary remains subject to the influence of the prosecutor's
 office. The Constitution potentially limits the activities of political parties, religious
 groups and the press. Societal discrimination against women persists. Addressing a
 minority concern, the Constitution allows parents the right to choose the language
 of education for their children.

 The Transnistrian authorities continue to be responsible for abuses, including
 questionable detentions, restrictions on freedom of religion pressure on the media,
 and discrimination against Romanian/ Moldovan speakers.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings either in Moldova or its separatist region.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed or unconfirmed reports of disappear-
 ances of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment. There were no allegations of torture by the authorities, but there
 were credible reports that police sometimes beat prisoners or suspects.
 Conditions in most prisons remain harsh, with serious overcrowding. Cell sizes do
 not meet local legal requirements. Conditions are especially harsh in prisons used
 to hold people awaiting trial or sentencing. These prisons suffer from overcrowding,
 bad ventilation, and a lack of recreational and rehabilitation facilities. Conditions
 for those serving sentences are only marginally better. The incidence of disease, es-
 pecially tuberculosis, and malnutrition is high in all facilities. Abuse of prisoners
 by other prisoners or jailers themselves, ostensibly for disciplinary reasons, has been
 reduced by the dismissal or retirement of some of the worst offending guards. The
 Ministry of Justice now administers the prison system, having taken over from the
 Ministry of Interior in 1996. Attempts to improve prison conditions are frustrated
 by a lack of financing. Human rights monitors are permitted to visit iprisons.
 After questionable trials, four Moldovans are serving sentences in Transnistria for
 terrorism-related crimes (see Section 1.e). The International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC), which visited these prisoners on two occasions (1992 and 1993) in
 Tiraspol, has been unable to visit them since, despite numerous representations to
 the Tiraspol authorities.
 Requests by human rights monitors to visit prisons in Transnistria have been re-
 fused.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The former Soviet Code on Penal Proce-
 dure remains in force with some amendments. Prosecutors issue arrest warrants.
 Under the Constitution, a suspect may be detained without charge for 24 hours. The
 suspect is normally allowed family visits during this period. The 24-hour time limit
 is not always respected, especially if a person is arrested late on a Friday or on a
 weekend. If charged, a suspect may be released pending trial. There is no system
 of bail, but in some cases, a friend or relative, in order to arrange release, may give
 a written undertaking that the accused will appear for trial. Suspects accused of vio-
 lent or seriou s ces are generally not released before trial. The Constitution per-
 mits pretrial arrest for an initial period of 30 days, which may be extended up to
 6 months. In exceptional cases, Parliament may approve extension of pretrial deten-
 tion on an individual basis of uap to12 months. The accused has the right under
 the Constitution to a hearing before a court regarding the legality of his arrest. Ac-
 cording to figures provided by the Ministr of Justice in October, of a prison popu-
 lation of 10,521, 1,530 persons were held in confiement awaiting trial (these statis-
 tics do not include persons held in Transnistria).
 According to the Constitution, a detained person must be informed immediately
 of the reason for the arrest and must be made aware of the charges "as quickly as
 possible.n The accused has the right to a defense attorney throughout the entire
 process, and the attorney must be present when the charges are brought. Many law-
 yers point out that access to a lawyer is generally granted only after a person has
 been detained 24 hours. If the defendant cannot afford an attorney, the State re-
 quires the local bar association to provide one. Because the State is unable to pay
 ontsing legal fees, a lawyer who is less than competent or energetic is often chosen.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. Although the prosecutor's office still has undue influence, independence of the
 judiciary has increased sinc he hedissolution of the Soviet Union. Since July prosecu-
 tors were given the right to open and close investigations without bringing the mat-
 ter before a court. The Constitution provides that the President, on the nomination
 of the Superior Court of Magistrates, appoints judges for an initial period of 5 years.
 They may be reappointed for a subsequent 10-year period, after which they serve
 until retirement age. This provision for judicial tenure is designed to increase judi-
 cial independence.
 
 
 1195
 The judiciary consists of lower courts of the first instance, five appellate courts
 (tribunals), a Higher Court of Appeals, a Supreme Court, and a Constitutional
 Court. The Higher Appeals Court and the Supreme Court, which serves as a final
 court of appeal, are both in Chisinau. The Supreme Court supervises and reviews
 the activities of the lower courts.
 By law defendants in criminal cases are presumed innocent. In practice prosecu-
 tors recommendations still carry considerable weight and limit the defendant's ac-
 tual presumption of innocence. Trials are generally open to the public. Defendants
 have the right to attend proceedings, confront witnesses, and present evidence. De-
 fense attorneys are able to review the evidence against their clients when preparing
 cases. The accused enjoys a right to appeal to a higher court. Because of a lack fund-
 ing for adequate facilities and personnel, there is a large backlog of cases at the tri-
 bunal and Higher Appeals Court levels. Court decisions involving the restitution of
 salary or a position are not always implemented.
 To date no pattern of discrimination has emerged in the judicial system. The Con-
 stitution provides for the right of the accused to have an interpreter both at the trial
 and in reviewing the documents of the case. If the majority of the participants
 agree, trials may take place in Russian or another acceptable language instead of
 Romanian/Moldovan.
 There continue to be credible reports that local prosecutors and judges extort
 bribes for reducing charges or sentences. Such charges were brought against a judge
 and prosecutor in Cainari in October. Prosecutors occasionally use bureaucratic ma-
 neuvers to restrict lawyers' access to clients.
 There were no reports of political prisoners outside Transnistria.
 In Transnistria, four Moldovans, members of the "Ilascu Six," (one of whom, Ilie
 Ilascu, is an elected member of the Moldovan Parliament but has never been able
 to take his seat) remain in prison following their conviction in 1993 for allegedly
 killing two separatist officials. International human rights groups raised serious
 questions about the fairness of the trial; local organizations alleged that the
 Moldovans were prosecuted for political reasons, solely because of their membership
 in the Christian Democratic Popular Front, a Moldovan political party that favors
 reunification with Romania. Family members have been allowed access. A group of
 Moldovan doctors was refused access in October. The Transnistrian "authorities"
 have refused access to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) under
 standard ICRC terms and conditions, such as requesting a private meeting.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Both
 judges and prosecutors issue search warrants. In some instances searches are con-
 ducted without warrants. Courts do not exclude evidence that was illegally obtained.
 There is no judicial review of search warrants.
 The Constitution specifies that searches must be carried out "in accordance with
 the law," but does not specify the consequences if the law is not respected. It also
 forbids searches at night, except in the case of flagrant crime.
 It is widely believed that security agencies continue to use electronic monitoring
 of residences and telephones without proper authorization. By law the prosecutor's
 office must authorize wiretaps and may do so only if a criminal investigation is
 under way. In practice, the prosecutor's office lacks the ability to control the security
 organizations and police and prevent them from using wiretaps illegally.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and the law provide for free-
 dom of speech and press, although with some restrictions. The Government does not
 abridge freedom of speech, and the print media express a wide variety of political
 views and commentary. National and city governments subsidize a number of news-
 papers, but political parties and professional organizations, including trade unions,
 also publish newspapers.
 Although the number of media outlets that are not owned and operated publicly
 by the State or a political party is growing, most of these "independent" media are
 still in the service of a politician or political movement, commercial interest, or for-
 eign country, and secure large subsidies from these sources. There are several inde-
 pendent radio stations, including one that broadcasts religious programs. Two inde-
 pendent television stations broadcast in the Chisinau area. The larger independent
 outlet in Chisinau maintains a news staff and conducts a number of public interest
 programs. The Government owns and operates a television channel that covers the
 whole country and several of the major radio stations. A number of regional centers,
 including Gagauzia, operate local television and radio stations. In contrast, there is
 only one private radio station, which broadcasts religious programs outside of
 Chisinau.
 
 
 1196
 Restrictions on press freedoms forbidding "disputing or defaming the State and
 the people" and political parties that "militate" against the country's sovereignty,
 independence and territorial integrity remain in the Constitution. They lack imple-
 menting legislation and are not invoked. The press law includes an article that al-
 lows public figures to sue for defamation without distinguishing between their pri-
 vate and public persons and leads the journalists to practice some degree of self-
 censorship. In cases where suits have been filed against journalists and media or-
 gans, the plaintiffs almost always lose.
 The Government does not restrict foreign publications. However, foreign publica-
 tions do not circulate widely since they are very expensive by local standards. Rus-
 sian newspapers are available, however, and some publish a special Moldovan week-
 ly supplement. Moldova receives television and radio broadcasts from Romania and
 Russia. Cable subscribers receive Cable News Network , Euro-News, British Broad-
 casting System Prime, National Broadcasting Company Super Channel, Pro-TV (Ro-
 mania) and a number of other news and entertainment networks, but there are only
 approximately 600 customers.
 Of the two major newspa ers in Transnistria, one is controlled by the regional au-
 thorities and the other by the Tiraspol city government. There is also an independ-
 ent newspaper in the northern Transnistrian city of Ribnitsa. The latter two criti-
 cize the regime from time to time. Other print media in Transnistria do not have
 large circulations and appear only on a weekly or monthly basis. Nonetheless, some
 of them also criticize local authorities. Among them is a new newspaper that is re-
 portedly financed and largely written by the local "Ministry of State Security." The
 one indeendent television station is t ing to enlarge its broadcast radius. Resist-
 ance to this move comes from the loca    icial Transnistrian television, which up
 until now has enjoyed a virtual monopoly of advertising revenues. Most Moldovan
 newspapers do not circulate in Transnistria. Circulation of all print media in
 Transnstria is hampered by the closed nature of society and the local economic cri-
 sis, which is more severe than in the rest of Moldova.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the right
 to peaceful assembly, and authorities respect this right in practice. The mayor's of-
 fice issues permits for demonstrations; it may consult the national Government if
 the demonstration is likely to be extremely large.
 The Constitution states that citizens are free to form parties and other social and
 political organizations. Private organizations, including political parties, are re-
 quired to register, but applications are approved routinely. The Constitution de-
 clams unconstitutional parties that "militate against the sovereignty, independence,
 and territorial integrity of Moldova."
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government generally permits the free practice of
 religion. However, a 1992 law on religion that codifies religious freedoms, contains
 restrictions that could inhibit the activities of some religious groups. To date these
 restrictions have not been enforced. The law provides for freedom of religious prac-
 tice, including the right to profess one's religion in any form. It also provides for
 alternative military service for conscientious objectors, protects the confidentiality of
 the confessional, allows denominations to establish associations and foundations,
 and states that the Government may not interfere in the religious activities of de-
 nominations. The law prohibits proselytizing. However, the law also requires that
 religious groups register with the Government in order to hire noncitizens.
 Some Protestant denominations are concerned that the prohibition on proselytiz-
 .ing could inhibit their activities. To date the authorities have not taken legal action
 against individuals for proselytizing. The Salvation Army, however, was unable to
 register in 1996 as a religious denomination because it did not meet the require-
 ment of having a Moldovan citizen as the organization's legal head. Similarly, on
 technical grounds Jehovah's Witnesses were unable to register in Tiraspl.
 Although Eastern Orthodoxy is not designated in the law on religion as the offi-
 cial religion, it continued to be a strong religious force and exerted significant influ-
 ence. In 1992 a number of priests broke away from the Moldovan Orthodox Church,
 which is subordinate to the Moscow Patriarchy, in order to form the Bessarabian
 Orthodox Church. The Bessarabian Orthodox Church, which sees itself as the legal
 and canonical successor to the pre-World War II Romanian Orthodox Church in Bes-
 sarabia (the part of Moldova between the Dniester and Prut rivers), subordinated
 itself to the Bucharest patriarchy of the Romanian Orthodox Church. The Govern-
 ment has consistently refused to register the Bessarabian Church, citing unresolved
 property claims as the principal reason. The issue has political overtones as well,
 since it raises the question whether the Orthodox Church should be united and ori-
 ented toward Moscow or divided with a branch oriented toward Bucharest. A ruling
 by the Court of the First Instance in 1996 that the Bessarabian Church had a right
 
 
 1197
 to be registered was upheld by the Higher Appeals Court on August 19.. The Gov-
 ernment appealed the case to the Supreme Court which overturned it on a tech-
 nicality on December 9. In a meeting with the Patriarchs of Constantinople, Mos-
 cow, and Tblisi in Odessa at the end of September, President Lucinschi urged that
 the dispute be settled within the Orthodox Church in order to prevent further
 politicization of the issue. There were ongoing discussions on the problem between
 the Patriarchs of Moscow and Budapest.
 The authorities in Transnistria rescinded the registration of two houses of wor-
 ship of Jehovah's Witnesses in the region; 13 congregations still meet in private
 homes.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict travel within the country, and there
 are no closed areas. Citizens generally are able to travel freely; however, there are
 some restrictions on emigration. Close relatives with a claim to support from the
 applicant must give their concurrence. The Government may also deny permission
 to emigrate if the applicant had access to state secrets. Such cases, however, are
 very rare, and none were reported in 1997.
 Travel between Transnistria and the rest of the country is not prevented. There
 are regularly scheduled buses and trains, however, the separatist "authorities" often
 stop and search incoming and outgoing vehicles.
 Moldova is not a party to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the
 Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. The issue of providing first asylum has
 never arisen formally. The Government has no processing procedures for potential
 refugees resident in the country. The UNHCR opened an office in August and held
 discussions with the Government. There were no reports of the forced return of per-
 sons to a country where they feared prosecution. The Government finally decided
 not to renew the 3-month visa of an Iraqi Kurd and his family, who were seeking
 refugee status in Moldova earlier in the year. The person in question has since fied
 for refugee status with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in Turkey
 after a stay in Bulgaria.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens voted in the first multiparty parliamentary elections in 1994, and in the
 country's second presidential election in 1996. Former parliamentary speaker Petru
 Lucinschi, who had run as an independent, was inaugurated on January 15. Inter-
 national observers considered the elections to have been free and fair. The peaceful
 transition of presidential power represents further progress in the transition to de-
 mocracy.
 The Constitution adopted in 1994 provides for the division of power among the
 oularly elected President, the Cabinet, the Parliament, and the judiciary. The
 resident, as Head of State, in consultation with the Parliament, appoints the Cabi-
 net and Prime Minister, who functions as the Head of Government. However, a min-
 ister can only be dismissed with the assent of the Prime Minister. Some observers
 believe that the Constitution does not adequately define how executive powers are
 to be shared between the President and the Prime Minister.
 The political fragmentation and realignment that began before the presidential
 elections in 1996 continued throughout the year in anticipation of the parliamentary
 elections to be held on March 22, 1998.
 The Constitution states that citizens are free to form parties and other socio-polit-
 ical organizations. A controversial article states, however, that those organizations
 that "are engaged in fighting against political pluralism," the "principles of the rule
 of law," or "the sovereignty and independence or territorial integrity of the Republic
 of Moldova," are "unconstitutional." Opposition parties, some of which favor rapid
 or eventual reunification with neighboring Romania, have charged that this provi-
 sion is intended to impede their political activities.
 On a local level, authorities of the Gagauz autonomous region refused to allow the
 winner of a local mayoral election to take his seat. The matter is now under adju-
 dication.
 In 1991 separatist elements, assisted by uniformed Russian military forces in the
 area and led by supporters of the 1991 coup attempt in Moscow, declared a
 "Dniester Republic" in the area of Moldova that is locate between the Dniester River
 and Ukraine. Fighting flared briefly in 1992, but ended after Russian forces stepped
 in, and a truce has held since. Russian, Ukrainian, and OSCE mediators have at-
 tempted to encourage the two sides to reach a settlement that preserves Moldovan
 sovereignty  and independence while granting a measure of autonomy        to
 Transmstria. On May 8, the Transnistrians signed a Memorandum of Understand-
 ing with the Government that encompasses these objectives. Since then, however,
 
 
 1198
 
 further negotiations were inconclusive and there was no further progress towards
 a settlement by year's end.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice barring the participation of women
 or minorities in political life. However, women are generally underrepresented in
 leading positions of political parties. Women hold only 4 of 104 parliamentary seats.
 The Association of Moldovan Women, a socio-political organization, competed in the
 1994 elections, but was unable to gain parliamentary representation. Russian,
 Ukrainian, Bulgarian, and Gagauz minorities are represented in Parliament, with
 deputies elected from nationwide party lists rather than local districts. Debate takes
 place in either the Romanian/Moldovan or Russian language, with translation pro-
 vided.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several local human rights groups exist. The local Helsinki Watch organization
 maintains contacts with international human rights organizations, as does the Hel-
 sinki Citizens Assembly, whose President until December was the Chairman of the
 Parliamentary Human Rights Commission. Human rights groups operate without
 government interference.
 In July Moldova ratified the 1950 European Convention for the Protection of
 Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. According to the Constitution, inter-
 national treaties and conventions ratified by Moldova have precedence over
 Moldovan law. Citizens may now appeal to the European Court in Strasbourg if
 they think that their rights have been violated or if Moldovan laws are not in ac-
 cordance with the convention. Most citizens, however, are unaware of the convention
 as well as their rights to legal remedies in general.
 The Government has cooperated with the ICRC in the past, permitting visits to
 prisoners from the 1992 conflict (since released). The Transnistrian separatist au-
 thorities have not allowed the ICRC access to the four members of the original
 "Ilascu Six" who have remained in prison since 1993 (see Section i.e.). The four
 were visited by a team of Moldovan and Transnistrian doctors in December.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that persons are equal before the law regardless of race,
 sex, disability, religion, or social origin. There are remedies for violations, such as
 orders for redress of grievances, but these are not always enforced.
 Women.-Women abused by their husbands have the right to press charges; hus-
 bands convicted of such abuse may receive prison sentences (typically up to 6
 months). Public awareness of the problem of violence in families is not very high
 and no special government programs exist to combat spousal abuse. According to
 knowledgeable sources, women do not generally appeal to police or the courts for
 protection against abusive spouses because they are embarrassed to do so and are
 not convinced that the authorities will react positively, as the police generally do
 not consider spousal abuse a serious crime. Through September the Ministry of In-
 ternal Affairs recorded 176 cases of rape or attempted rape, down 13.3 percent from
 the previous year when there were 276 cases reported in the first 9 months of the
 year. Women's groups believe that the numbers of rapes and incidents of spousal
 abuse are underreported.
 The law provides that women shall be equal to men. However, according to statis-
 tics, women have been disproportionately affected by growing unemployment. By
 law women are paid the same as men for the same work. Although still victimized
 by societal discrimination, anecdotal evidence suggests that women are more em-
 ployable than men (being seen as more flexible, better workers), and are working
 because of economic necessity. There are a significant number of female managers
 in the public sector and in banking; the president of Moldova's largest bank is a
 woman.
 Children.-There is extensive legislation designed to protect children, including
 extended paid maternity leave and government supplementary payments for fami-
 lies with many children. Ten years of basic education are compulsory, followed by
 either technical school or further study leading to higher education. The health sys-
 tem devotes extensive resources to child care. Although child abuse does occasion-
 ally occur, no special problems came to light in 1997. There are no statistics on child
 abuse. Child support programs suffered from inadequate funding along with other
 government programs.
 An estimated 1,000 children are living in the streets in Chisinau and other large
 urban areas.
 
 
 1199
 People With Disabilities.-There is no legal discrimination against people with dis-
 abilities. However, there are no laws providing for accessibility to buildings, and
 there are few government resources devoted to training people with disabilities. The
 Government provides tax advantages to charitable groups that assist the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The population is about 4.3 million, of which
 65 percent are ethic Moldovans. Ukrainians (14 percent) and Russians (13 percent)
 are the two largest minorities. A Christian Turkic minority, the Gagauz, lives pri-
 marily in the southern regions of the country. They are largely Russian-speaking
 and represent about 3.5 percent of the population.
 The 1990 Citizenship Law offered an equal opportunity to all persons resident in
 Moldova at the time of independence to adopt Moldovan citizenship. The OSCE's Of-
 fice of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights described the law as being very
 liberal. The law permits dual citizenship on the basis of a bilateral agreement, but
 no such agreements are in effect.
 In 1994 the Parliament voted to delay until 1997 the implementation of the lan-
 guage testing called for in the Language Law of 1989, which was due to begin in
 1994. According to the law, a citizen should be able to choose which language to
 use in dealing with a government official or a commercial entity. Officials are there-
 fore obligated to know Russian and Romanian/Moldovan "to the degree necessary
 to fulfill their professional obligations." Since many Russian speakers do not speak
 Romanian/Moldovan (while educated Moldovans speak both languages), they argued
 for a delay in the implementation of the law in order to permit more time to learn
 the language. The law was not put into force because Parliament has postponed im-
 plementation plans indefinitely. Addressing a minority concern, the Constitution
 grovides parents with the right to choose the language of instruction for their chil-
 lren.
 In the separatist region, however, discrimination against Romanian/Moldovan
 speakers continued. Schools are required to use the Cyrillic alphabet when teaching
 Romanian. Many teachers, parents, and students objected to the use of the Cyrillic
 script to teach Romanian. 'They believe that it disadvantages pupils in pursuing
 higher education opportunities in the rest of Moldova or Romania. (Cyrillic script
 was used to write the Romanian language in Moldova until 1989, since "Moldovan,"
 as it was then called, was officially decreed during the Soviet era to be a different
 language from Romanian, which is written in the Latin alphabet. The 1989 Lan-
 guage Law reinstituted the use of the Latin script.) As a result of an agreement be-
 tween the Government of Moldova and the separatist authorities, 8 schools in the
 separatist region obtaned permission to use the Latin alphabet, with salaries and
 textbooks to be supplied by the Moldovan Ministry of Education. These schools are
 considered private schools by the local authorities. They must pay rent for their fa-
 cilities and meet local curriculum requirements, building codes, and safety stand-
 ards. The Government has no budget allotted for the high rent asked for these facili-
 ties. As a result, classes were held in local homes or run in shifts in the few avail-
 able buildings.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1990 Soviet Law on Trade Unions, which was
 enacted by Moldova's then-Supreme Soviet and is still in effect, provides for inde-
 pendent trade unions. Laws passed in 1989 and 1991, which give citizens the right
 to form all kinds of social organizations, also provide a legal basis for the formation
 of independent unions. The 1994 Constitution further declares that any employee
 may found a union or join a union that defends workers' interests. However, there
 have been no known attempts to establish alternate trade union structures inde-
 pendent of the successor to the previously existing official organizations that were
 part of the Soviet trade union system.
 The successor organization is the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU).
 The GFTU's continuing role in managing the state insurance system and its reten-
 tion of previously existing official union headquarters and vacation facilities provide
 an inherent advantage over any newcomers who might wish to form a union outside
 its structure. However, its industrial or branch unions are becoming more independ-
 ent entities; they maintain that their membership in the GFTU is voluntary and
 that they can withdraw if thby wish. Virtually all employed adults are members of
 a union.
 Government workers do not have the right to strike, nor do those in essential
 services such as health care and energy. Other unions may strike if two-thirds of
 the members vote for a strike in a secret ballot. There were several labor actions
 for payment of wage arrears, including a number of strikes by teachers and health
 workers in various parts of the country.
 
 
 1200
 Unions may affiliate and maintain contacts with international organizations. In
 December the GFTU was accepted as a member of the International Confederation
 of Trade Unions (ICTU).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law, which is based on
 former Soviet legislation, provides for collective bargaining rights. However, wages
 are set through a tripartite negotiation process involving government, management
 and unions. On the national level, the three parties meet and negotiate national
 minimum wages for all categories of workers. Then, each branch union representing
 a particular industry negotiates with management and the government ministries
 responsible for that industry. They may set wages higher than the minimum set on
 the national level and often do, especially if the industry in question is more profit-
 able than average. Finally, on the enterprise level, union and management rep-
 resentatives negotiate directly on wages. Again, they may set wages higher than ne-
 gotiators on the industry level.
 There were no reports of actions taken against union members for union activi-
 ties. The 1990 Soviet Law on Trade Unions provides that union leaders may not be
 fired from their jobs while in leadership positions or for a period after they leave
 those positions. This law has not been tested in Moldova.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 and compulsory labor, and it is not known to occur. The Government specifically
 prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and there were no reports that it oc-
 curred.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for unrestricted employment is 18 years. Employment of those ages 16 to
 18 is permitted under special conditions, including shorter workdays, no night
 shifts, and longer vacations. The Ministry of Labor and social protection is primarily
 responsible for enforcing these restrictions, and the Ministry of Health also has a
 role. Child labor is not used in industry, although children living in rural areas
 sometimes assist in the agricultural sector. The Government specifically prohibits
 forced and bonded labor by children, and there were no reports that it occurred (see
 Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is a legal minimum monthly wage of
 *3.92 (18 Moldovan lei) but this is used primarily as a basis for calculating fines.
 The average monthly wage of (approximately $42 (193 Moldovan lei) does not pro-
 vide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. Lowest wages are in the
 agricultural sector, where the monthly average is $24. 62 (113 Moldovan lei). Due
 to severe budgetary constraints, the Government and enterprises often do not meet
 payrolls for employees. However, this situation has improved over the past year.
 The Constitution sets the maximum workweek at 40 hours, and the Labor Code pro-
 vides for at least 1 day off per week.
 The State is required to set and check safety standards in the work place. The
 unions withinthye GFwU also have inspection personnel who have a right to stop
 work in the factory or fine the enterprise if safety standards are not met. Further,
 workers have the right to refuse to work but may continue to draw their salaries
 if working conditions represent a serious threat to their health. In practice, how-
 ever, the depressed economic situation has led enterprises to economize on safety
 Thment and generally to show less concern for worker safety issues. Workers
 oendo not know their rights in this area.
