 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multiparty
 political system and free elections. The legislature (the
 Knesset) can limit the government and force its dissolution.
 Israel has an independent judiciary. There is no formal,
 written constitution, but a series of basic laws defines the
 responsibilities of government institutions. Cabinet ministers
 have authority over police and security agencies and are
 expected to answer to the Knesset for the activities of these
 agencies. Public debate on issues of concern to Israelis is
 open and lively. A vigorous free press scrutinizes all
 aspects of Israeli life and politics.
 Israel enjoys a relatively high standard of living. It has a
 predominantly market economy with substantial government
 participation and subsidized prices for basic commodities.
 Economic policy has a strong orientation toward social welfare.
 Since Israel's founding in 1948, only one Arab state, Egypt,
 has concluded a peace treaty with Israel (1979). This hostile
 situation, reflected in several Arab-Israel armed conflicts
 and terrorist incidents within and outside Israel, contribute
 to a continuing sense of insecurity on the part of many
 Israelis. Emergency regulations have been in effect since
 1948. Israel has occupied the territories of the West Bank,
 the Gaza Strip, the eastern sector of Jerusalem, and the Golan
 Heights since the 1967 war. Government-sanctioned Jewish
 settlements in the occupied territories have heightened
 tension with Palestinian residents. In southern Lebanon,
 Israel maintains a residual military presence and supports a
 local militia, the "Army of South Lebanon." Arab citizens of
 Israel, who constitute approximately 17 percent of the
 population, do not share fully in the rights granted to, or
 the duties levied on, Jewish Israeli citizens. They are
 clustered at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale.
 The most significant human rights problem for Israel in 1988
 derived from the uprising of Palestinians in the West Bank and
 Gaza against the Israeli occupation, which began in December
 1987 and continued throughout 1988. (For detailed discussion,
 see the separate report on the occupied territories.)
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Israeli authorities do not sanction or practice political
 killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 *Because the occupied territories are a distinct entity, where
 the legal, political, and human rights environments differ
 sharply from those of Israel, the situation in the territories
 is addressed in a separate report following the report for
 Israel.

 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Israeli laws and administrative regulations clearly prohibit,
 and provide specific penalties for, such activities. However,
 where security concerns predominate, these strictures have
 been violated. The Landau Report of 1987 held that the general
 security service, Shin Bet, had routinely used physical and
 psychological mistreatment to obtain confessions. (For
 further discussion, see the separate report on the occupied
 territories.)
 d. Arbitrary Arrestj Detention, or Exile
 Israeli law and practice guarantee against arbitrary arrest or
 imprisonment. Writs of habeas corpus and other procedural and
 subatantive safeguards are available. Defendants are
 considered innocent until proven guilty. Administrative
 detention, without charge or trial, may be imposed under
 emergency regulations, within procedural guidelines. The
 detention order is signed by the Minister of Defense, and the
 detainee must be brought before the appropriate district court
 within 48 hours of being taken into custody. On review of the
 case, the judge may confirm, shorten, or overturn the detention
 order. Absent this review, the detainee must be released. If
 the detention is confirmed, further judicial review must take
 place at least every 3 months. The detainee may appeal the
 determination of the district court to the Supreme Court and
 may be represented by counsel at each stage of the review and
 appeal process. However, detainees are not presented with
 formal statements of charges, and evidence may be presented by
 the Government in the review process which is withheld from
 the detainee and his counsel.
 In 1988 seven Israeli Arabs were held in administrative
 detention. By the end of 1988, most of them had been
 released, one of them to house arrest.
 As a result of the significant increase in administrative
 detention of Palestinians, Israel established an Emergency
 Detention Center in Israeli territory, at Ketziot in the Negev
 desert. (For a discussion of the detention camp at Ketziot,
 see the separate report on the occupied territories.)
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a hearing by an impartial tribunal with
 representation by counsel is guaranteed by law. The judiciary
 is independent and effectively insulated from political
 interference. All nonsecurity trials are open. Security
 cases may be tried before a military court and may be partly
 or wholly closed to the public. The burden of justifying
 nonpublic proceedings falls to the prosecution. Defense
 counsel is present, even during closed proceedings, but may be
 denied access to some evidence on security grounds.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Privacy of the individual and the sanctity of home life and
 correspondence are protected by law within Israel. However,
 some Israeli Arab political activists have expressed suspicion
 that their mail is delayed or confiscated. There are effective
 legal safeguards against arbitrary invasion of the home.

 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press, protected rights in Israel, are
 limited by security-based censorship provisions. Licenses,
 required of newspapers, are routinely issued. All newspapers
 are privately owned and managed. Israeli radio and television
 are run by the independent Israel Broadcast Authority (IBA).
 The Government helps to fund the IBA and appoints its governing
 board, but it has little direct control over programming. The
 board's members are appointed by political parties and tend to
 support their parties' views. The independence of the IBA is
 protected by law, subject to censorship provisions. Movies
 and theater productions are subject to censorship if deemed
 pornographic, otherwise offensive to religious or social
 mores, or likely to disturb public order. Censorship board
 actions, rarely imposed, may be appealed in the courts.
 According to the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1948, it is
 illegal to possess, for purposes of inciting support for
 organizations defined as terrorist, or to distribute
 literature considered hostile to Israel or that issued by
 illegal Palestinian organizations, to display Palestinian
 nationalist symbols, or publicly to express support for the
 Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Israelis representing almost any point of view are free to
 assemble and associate. The law and court rulings protect
 these rights. However, contact by Israelis with the PLO, its
 subdivisions, or other organizations classified by the
 Government as terrorist, or with individual members of such
 organizations, is illegal. In 1988 four Israelis were
 convicted of violating the Prevention of Terrorism Law for
 meeting PLO members. An Israeli who had met with PLO leader
 Yasser Arafat was interrogated by the police and released on
 bail, but he had not been formally charged as of the end of
 1988.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All citizens are assured freedom of religion by law.
 Approximately 82 percent of Israeli citizens are Jewish.
 Muslims, Christians, and Druze, and members of other minority
 religions make up the remaining 18 percent. The law of return
 of 1950, which abolished restrictions on Jewish immigration,
 and the citizenship law of 1952, which granted every Jew the
 right to citizenship on arrival in Israel, confer advantages
 to Jews in matters of immigration, residence, and citizenship.
 Each recognized religious community in Israel is governed in
 personal status matters, not by civil law, but by its own
 religious law. A system of religious courts coexists with the
 civil. The religious courts have jurisdiction in matters of
 marriage, legitimacy, inheritance, and conversion, thus
 imposing in such matters the values of the dominant tradition
 within each religious community on all its members.
 Women's rights are limited in some religious communities.
 Some Jewish and Christian cgngregations have complained that
 zoning regulations are used to prevent their establishment or
 expansion. Missionaries are allowed to enter Israel. A 1977
 antiproselytizing law prohibits the offering and receipt of
 material benefits as an inducement to conversion. The Justice
 Ministry ruled in 1979 that the law is not intended to restrict
 
 
 1369
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 any community's religious freedom or pursuit of educational or
 philanthropic activities, but Christian groups are uneasy.
 Since its enactment, the law has not been employed. However,
 whether because of concern for that law or because of the
 practical difficulty of attracting converts across the lines
 of the three major faiths represented in Israel, missionaries
 usually proselytize within the boundaries of their own major
 faith. Missionaries, or persons claiming to be missionaries,
 have occasionally been physically attacked by individuals and,
 in some cases, have been harassed by Jewish religious
 extremists. The police have actively protected missionary
 groups. The Ministry of Religious Affairs cooperates with and
 gives financial support to various interfaith groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Israeli citizens can move freely within Israel except in
 military or security zones, or in cases where they may be
 confined to their neighborhood or village by administrative
 order under emergency regulations. In 1988 two Israeli Arabs
 were thus confined. Both were also administratively detained
 in 1988. Israeli citizens are free to travel within the
 occupied territories, except in those sections temporarily
 declared closed military areas.
 Palestinian residents of the occupied territories are generally
 free to travel within Israel. Residents of the territories
 working in Israel need permits to stay overnight, although
 this provision is often not enforced.. On occasion in 1988,
 they were forbidden to enter Israel. Palestinians, especially
 young men, were occasionally prevented from entering Jerusalem
 on Friday, the Muslim holy day. Israeli citizens are free to
 travel abroad and to emigrate, provided they have no
 outstanding military obligations or are not- restricted by
 administrative order. However, travel restrictions on two
 Israeli Arabs, both officials of the Progressive List for Peace
 Party, were renewed in 1988. These restrictions applied to
 travel abroad and to the occupied territories. The Israeli
 Government did not provide official reasons for these
 restrictions.
 The Israeli concept of repatriation, as it applies to Jews,-is
 influenced by the right of return and citizenship for all Jews,
 including those Israeli citizens who have emigrated from
 Israel. Those Arab residents of mandatory Palestine who left
 the area that became Israel in 1948 have no guaranteed right
 to return.  Israel has rejected United Nations General Assembly
 Resolution 194 of 1948 which called on Israel to permit the
 return of Arabs who left in 1947-1948, or to compensate them
 for their losses if they choose not to return. Israel has
 justified its rejection of Resolution 194 on the grounds that
 the losses of Jews who left Arab states at that time have not
 been compensated. Israel has allowed the return of some
 Arabs, on the principle of family reunification, but has
 rejected the great majority of requests for return.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy, with a multitude of
 parties representing a wide range of political views. Even
 relatively small parties regularly win seats in the Knesset.
 However, in the 1988 elections the Kach Party was disqualified
 from running by a panel of the High Court on the grounds that
 
 
 1370
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 the party was racist. All adult Israeli citizens have the
 right to participate in the political process and to vote.
 Participation of eligible voters in national elections,
 including Israeli Arabs, is high by Western standards. In the
 1988 elections, Israeli Arabs, representing both Zionist and
 non-Zionist parties, won 6 of 120 Knesset seats. Israeli
 Arabs actively participate in local (municipal) elections.
 Municipal councils, which function throughout Israel, serve in
 Arab towns as well, and all participate in Israeli regional
 councils. Women participate actively in Israeli politics. In
 1988 they constituted over 40 percent of political party
 membership, won seven Knesset seats in the 1988 elections, but
 hold no cabinet posts in the new Government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Israel is responsive to international and nongovernmental
 interest in its human rights situation. The Ministries of
 Foreign Affairs and Justice have specially designated Human
 Rights offices, and other ministries have officials who
 respond to human rights inquiries. Human rights groups such
 as the Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights and the
 Association for Civil Rights in Israel, as well as political
 action groups such as Peace Now, operate openly and without
 government interference. The Government investigates and
 responds to most inquiries by such organizations as Amnesty
 International.
 The Government permits visits to Israel and the occupied
 territories by representatives of private international human
 rights groups, as well as such international bodies as the
 United Nations Economic and Social Council, the World Health
 Organization, and the International Labor Organization (ILO).
 In 1988 Israel accommodated a vastly increased number of visits
 from organizations and persons inquiring into human and civil
 rights issues associated with the uprising in the occupied
 territories.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women's rights in Israel are protected by the Equal Opportunity
 Law, which forbids sex discrimination. For example, it
 requires employers to pay male and female workers equal wages
 for equal work. Other laws and regulations protect the rights
 of women employees concerning pregnancy, childbirth, and child
 care. The Government includes a senior adviser on the status
 of women, and the civil service commission and several
 government ministries have officers responsible for womens
 rights. Nongovernmental women's organizations work actively
 in promoting women's rights and welfare. Women are well
 represented in higher education and the work force--they
 comprise 40 percent of university graduates, 39 percent of the
 overall work force, 52 percent of civil servants, and
 approximately two-thirds of teachers. One (previously 2) of
 12 Supreme Court Justices is a woman. Women are drafted into
 the army but do not fill combat-related positions. Women are
 underrepresented at the higher levels of government and the
 civil service, although there is debate whether this is a
 result of discrimination or of career patterns different from
 those of men.
 
 
 1371
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Israeli Arabs have made substantial educational and material
 progress since the founding of Israel. A few have risen to
 responsible positions in the Civil Service, generally in the
 Arab departments of government ministries. However, despite
 laws which guarantee them nearly the same rights as Israeli
 Jews, and despite government and private efforts to bridge the
 gap between Israeli Arabs and Jews, there is little interaction
 between the two communities, and many Israeli Arabs feel
 estranged from the mainstream of Israeli life and politics.
 Israeli Arabs have not attained the same quality of education,
 housing, or other services as Israeli Jews. Although they
 make up approximately 17 percent of the population, Israeli
 Arabs comprise less than 3 percent of the university student
 population and are virtually unrepresented in the higher-level
 professional, academic, and business ranks. The Arabic-
 speaking community has access to local and foreign Arabic
 newspapers and magazines, internal and external Arabic
 television programming, and Arabic-language radio services.
 The Israeli Druze and Circassian communities, at their
 initiative, are subject to Israel's military draft, and some
 Bedouin Arabs serve voluntarily in special units. However,
 most Israeli Arabs are not subject to the draft and do not
 volunteer. Of the few who do volunteer, most are disqualified
 on security grounds. Consequently, they have less access than
 do other Israelis to such social and economic benefits as
 housing and new-household subsidies, government employment,
 and university scholarships, for which military service is
 either a prerequisite or an advantage.
 Section & Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Israeli workers and employers have freely established
 organizations of their own choosing. Israel has a powerful
 free trade union movement, the General Federation of Labor in
 Israel (Histadrut), and a much smaller rival federation.
 About 80 percent of employed Israelis (including 70 percent of
 employed Arab Israelis) are members of Histadrut trade unions
 or covered by its collective bargaining agreements.
 Aside from its trade union role, Histadrut owns and operates a
 quarter of Israel's industry and business, much of the health
 care, vocational training, and child care systems, and most of
 the health insurance and pension systems. It also includes
 the largest women's organization. About 60 percent of adult
 Israelis (55 percent of adult Israeli Arabs) are Histadrut
 members.
 Histadrut members democratically elect their national and
 local officers and those of its affiliated trade unions and
 women's organization, choosing between political party lists.
 Plant or enterprise committee members are elected individually.
 Histadrut generally provides very effective representation,
 despite its role as an employer and its ties to the Labor
 Party, which has participated in most Israeli governments.
 Histadrut participates in the meetings of the ILO, to which
 Israel belongs. Histadrut is affiliated to the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and its individual member
 unions are affiliated to many of the Western international
 trade secretariats. Histadrut officials also have some
 contacts with the Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade
 Unions.
 
 
 1372
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Palestinian residents of Jerusalem have the same rights of
 labor association as Israelis.
 About 100,000 Palestinian workers living in the West Bank and
 Gaza work in Israel. They and a few thousand foreigners
 working temporarily in Israel may not join Histadrut or other
 independent unions, but, if employed in the organized sector,
 they are entitled to union representation by Histadrut and are
 covered by current collective bargaining agreements at their
 workplace. A 1 percent union agency fee is deducted from the
 wages of those hired legally through the Israeli employment
 service. They are not eligible to vote or run for office in
 the elections of Histadrut or its national unions, but they
 can vote for and serve on plant or enterprise workers'
 committees. Indeed, Histadrut asks them to choose one or more
 committee members (proportionate to their number) wherever
 there are 20 of them, or at least 10 percent of the work
 force. (There are about 5,000 to 6,000 of these committees
 with 3 to 11 members at most workplaces, 30 to 70 members at
 multiplant enterprises, conglomerates, or large public sector
 bargaining units.)
 The right to strike is exercised frequently. There is a legal
 obligation to give 15 days' notice prior to a strike or
 lockout, unless otherwise specified in the collective
 bargaining agreement. Strikes often erupt without prior'notice
 or Histadrut authorization, although Histadrut tries to
 maintain discipline with a central strike fund. The Government
 may, and occasionally does, appeal to labor courts for back-to-
 work orders to restore essential public services while
 negotiations continue, but these orders are temporary and not
 always granted. Labor courts include employer and employee
 representatives.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of Israelis to organize and bargain collectively is
 enshrined in law and freely exercised. The majority union
 (generally Histadrut) is the exclusive bargaining agent.
 Palestinian residents of Jerusalem have the same rights under
 Israeli law. Nonresident workers, mostly Palestinians from
 the West Bank and Gaza, may not organize and bargain
 collectively on their own, but they are entitled to the
 protection of collective bargaining agreements and
 representation by the bargaining agent. However, a sizable
 minority work in the unorganized sector, without this
 protection, mostly in seasonal agriculture and small
 construction sites, restaurants, and garages.
 The labor legislation is applied uniformly throughout the
 country. There are no export processing zones in Israel.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Israeli citizens are not subject to forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 By law, children under age 15 may not be employed. Those aged
 15 may not be employed if subject to compulsory education,
 except during vacations, or in apprenticeships, or with a
 permit from the Labor Minister under special conditions. The
 Minister may also allow an artistic performance by a child
 under age 15, with safeguards. Employment of children aged 16
 
 
 1373
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 to 18 is restricted to ensure time for rest and education. A
 labor inspection service enforces these provisions, but
 enforcement may be lax in seasonal agriculture and at small
 construction sites, where labor contractors from the West Bank
 and Gaza bring work crews, and in small garages and
 restaurants. Israeli labor exchanges in the West Bank and
 Gaza do not permit those under 17 to be employed legally in
 Israel.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Wage income in Israel is generally sufficient to provide
 workers and their families a decent standard of living.
 Legislation in 1986 established a minimum wage at 45 percent
 of the average salary, calculated each April, with interim
 cost-of-living adjustments. An October 1988 adjustment raised
 it to about $410 per month. Most wages and salaries are
 established in collective bargaining agreements. The Labor
 Minister frequently uses the 1957 Collective Agreements Law to
 extend private sector wage settlements to the public sector
 and sectoral wage settlements to other, uncovered enterprises.
 Along with union representation, the Labor Inspection Service
 enforces labor, health, and safety standards in the workplace.
 By law, maximum hours of work are 47 per week, 8 per day, 7
 the day before the weekly rest, which must be at least 36
 consecutive hours and should include the Sabbath (Saturday for
 Jews, Sunday for Christians, Friday for Muslims). Exceptions
 may be approved by the Labqr Ministry but not to exceed 10
 hours per day, or an average of 47 hours per week. By
 national collective agreements, the public sector moves to a
 5-day, 42 1/2-hour week in April 1989, while the private
 sector established a maximum 45-hour week in August 1988 and
 an April 1900 deadline for all firms to institute the 5-day
 week. The normal weekly rest, Friday noon to Sunday morning,
 is changing to Thursday evening to Sunday morning. Those
 needed at work then receive equivalent rest periods on other
 days. Labor law provides 14 to 18 days' paid vacation per
 year, depending on length of service, and many paid holidays.
 Palestinian residents of Jerusalem have the same rights under
 Israeli law and union contract and are entitled to the same
 working conditions as Israelis.
 About half the West Bank and Gaza Palestinians working in
 Israel find employment legally through Israeli Employment
 Service labor exchanges in West Bank and Gaza towns. Employers
 pay wages and social contributions for these workers to the
 Service. It deducts taxes, employee social contributions, and
 a 1 percent union fee-, and pays the balance to the workers.
 The same percentage is deducted from the pay of West Bank and.
 Gaza Palestinians working legally in Israel as is deducted
 from the pay of Israeli workers for social contributions, and
 they receive equivalent pensions. However, they do not receive
 the same benefits from the National Insurance Institute
 (NII-similar to US. social security), because many NII
 benefits require residence in Israel. Thus, only 1.2 percent
 of the pay of the workers from the West Bank and Gaza goes to
 the NII, compared to 5.35 percent for an Israeli. The other
 4.15 percent is an equalization deduction to keep labor costs
 equivalent. It goes to a special Finance Ministry fund to-be
 used only for social and development costs in the West Bank
 and Gaza. Palestinians estimate that this amounts to hundreds
 of millions of dollars since 1970 and complain that the
 Government of Israel has not accounted for whether or how the
 
 
 1374
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 money has been spent in the territories. The Government of
 Israel says that these and other expenditures in the
 territories are accounted for internally, in the budget for
 the territories, but not made public.
 Nonresident Palestinian workers in Israel are covered by the
 minimum wage law and by Histadrut contracts if they work in
 organized firms. Those hired legally receive a pension
 through the Labor Ministry at age 65 after at least 10 years'
 employment in Israel, based on earnings and years worked (the
 conditions and benefits of their pensions are equivalent to
 those of the Histadrut pensions granted to Israelis.) Legal
 nonresident Palestinian workers are also entitled to sick
 leave, severance pay, and paid vacations of 14 to 28 days per
 year, under law or Histadrut contract. The NII provides them
 workers' compensation (including disability, dependent, and
 survivor pensions) for occupational injury or illness and
 employer bankruptcy insurance. These workers are also entitled
 to maternity benefits (free hospital care and a small lump sum
 payment for female workers or workers' wives, plus 12 weeks'
 paid maternity leave for the former) but only for births in
 hospitals in Israel.
 Nonresidents are ineligible for NII old-age, survivors, and
 disability pensions (smaller, flat rate pensions) received by
 most Israeli retirees in addition to their Histadrut pensions
 (like U.S. social security pensions), unemployment
 compensation, or insurance for long-term care or injury in
 nonoccupational accidents. They are also ineligible for NII
 children's allowances, funded only by employer contributions,
 and for NII-administered welfare programs funded by Israeli
 taxpayers through the budget (income support benefits for
 widows, orphans, mothers of dependent children, victims of
 disaster, those incapable of working, etc.).
 The 1988 report of the ILO Director General reviewed the
 situation of nonresident Palestinian workers in Israel and
 reiterated the recommendations that there be full application
 in practice of the principle of equal treatment for these
 workers with respect to working conditions and social security
 treatment. Histadrut has been unsuccessful in ensuring that
 West Bankers and Gazans working in Israel receive their full
 legal rights and benefits and in persuading many to present
 claims, despite Arabic-language broadcasts, pamphlets, and
 workplace posters explaining rights, benefits, and procedures.
 In 1988 Histadrut began to hold seminars on this subject for
 these workers and for Arab employees of Israel's West Bank and
 Gaza labor exchanges. Histadrut has succeeded in reinstating
 only a small percentage of nonresident Palestinian workers
 dismissed for absences during the uprising. It has been more
 successful in helping them get severance pay.
 About half the West Bankers and Gazans who work in Israel come
 illegally, with labor contractors or individually, evading
 taxes and social contributions (which their employers also
 evade), but losing social benefits. In unorganized
 enterprises, their wages and working conditions are often
 below Israeli legal standards, particularly in seasonal
 agriculture and small restaurants, garages, and construction
 sites. In 1988 the Labor Ministry began enforcing the
 requirement that they be hired through labor exchanges. Labor
 Ministry inspectors detected about 12,000 illegal workers from
 the West Bank and Gaza and over 4,000 employers hiring them
 illegally, and filed criminal court complaints against the
 employers. The Civil Administration assesses small fines
 
 
 1375
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 against the illegal workers. In January the Labor Ministry
 instituted fines of about $280 per worker against employers as
 a quick and efficient alternative to long and difficult
 criminal cases.
 Most workers from the West Bank and Gaza are required to return
 home each night. Since the uprising began in December 1987,
 an increasing number stay overnight in Israel during the week,
 often on the employer's premises. Israeli government policy
 is now to grant permits to sleep in Israel to all who seek
 them, and the number of permits has more than doubled to about
 6,000, according to the Employment Service. The Labor Ministry
 inspects employers to ensure decent accommodations before
 issuing permits to them for their West Bank employees to sleep
 on the premises. Many of those who work illegally also stay
 overnight illegally in Israel, often in unsatisfactory
 quarters. Labor Ministry inspectors recently took action
 against some workers staying overnight without permission.
 
 
 1376
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 The West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and the Gaza
 Strip are areas occupied by Israel in the 1967 war which remain
 under Israeli occupation. The West BanK and Gaza continue
 under military government; Israel has unilaterally annexed East
 Jerusalem; and it has extended its civilian law, jurisdiction,
 and administration to the Golan Heights.
 The United States considers Israel's occupation to be governed
 by The Hague Regulations of 1907 and the 1949 Fourth Geneva
 Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in
 Time of War. Israel denies the applicability of the Fourth
 Geneva Convention to the West Bank and Gaza, but states that
 it observes the Convention's humanitarian provisions in those
 areas. Israel applies Jordanian law in the West Bank and
 British mandate law in Gaza, as well as its own military
 orders which have changed these laws significantly.
 The Israeli Ministry of Defense, which is responsible for the
 government of the occupied territories, functions through a
 civil administration (CIVAD) under the Defense Ministry.
 Personnel from the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), the National
 Police, the Internal Security Service (Shin Bet), the Border
 Police, Israeli Civilian Ministries, and Palestinian employees
 participate in this apparatus. There are no Palestinian
 elected political bodies above the municipal level. Municipal
 elections, last held in 1976, were discontinued, and many
 elected officials were later removed or deported for alleged
 security reasons.
 This report differs from many others in this compilation
 because of the greater detail available on the situation in
 the occupied territories by virtue of Israel's open and
 democratic society. The human rights situation described in
 this report also differs from all others in this compilation
 in that most of the occupied territories remain after 21 years
 under military government, and are, therefore, subject in part
 to military law. That circumstance, in turn, was one of the
 consequences of the 1967 war between Israel and its neighbors.
 Since 1948 only Egypt has concluded a peace treaty with Israel
 (1979), as a result of which Israel withdrew from the Sinai
 Peninsula. Although the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation
 Organization (PLO), which most Palestinians support, has
 stated that his organization recognizes Israel's right to
 exist and renounces terrorism, there are Palestinian factions
 which have not done so. The PLO has called for the uprising
 in the West Bank and Gaza to continue, and the future status
 of the occupied territories is now the central issue in the
 Arab-Israeli conflict.
 Civilian unrest, reflecting Palestinian opposition to the
 occupation, has resulted in a number of outbreaks of violence
 during the last 21 years, which in turn have led periodically
 to sharp crackdowns by Israeli military forces. Beginning in
 December 1987, the occupation entered a new phase, referred to
 as the intifada, when civilian unrest became far more
 widespread and intensive than at any time heretofore. The
 active participants in these civil disturbances were primarily
 young men and women motivated by Palestinian nationalism and a
 desire to bring the occupation to an end. They gathered in
 groups, called and enforced strikes, threw stones and firebombs
 at Israeli security forces and civilian vehicles, or erected
 barricades and burned tires so as to interfere with traffic.
 The Israeli Government has regarded the uprising as a new
 
 
 1377
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 phase of the 40-year war against Israel and as a threat to the
 security of the State. The Israeli Defense Forces, caught by
 surprise and untrained and inexperienced in riot control,
 responded in a manner which led to a substantial increase in
 human rights violations.
 The West Bank (including East Jerusalem) had been annexed by
 Jordan in 1950. Even after the occupation of these areas by
 Israel in 1967, Jordan considered them its territory,
 recognized Palestinian residents of these areas as citizens of
 Jordan, and continued to provide financial support to the West
 Bank. Israel tacitly accepted these arrangements. A marked
 change occurred, however, in July 1988, when King Hussein
 announced a significant reduction in administrative and
 financial support for the West Bank and Gaza. Since July the
 Israeli Government has taken additional steps to deny the PLO
 access to the territories and to crack down harder on
 expressions of Palestinian nationalism.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Political killing is not condoned by Israel and is not
 practiced by the Israeli Government in the occupied
 territories.
 In hundreds of confrontations between IDF troops and
 Palestinians throwing stones or Molotov cocktails or engaging
 in other forms- of disorder, however, the IDF frequently
 responded w.ith gunfire in which casualties resulted. Precise
 figures on casualties are not available and estimates vary
 depending on the source and counting criteria. Figures
 compiled from press, Palestinian, and Israeli government
 sources indicate that 366 Palestinians were killed in 1988 as
 a result of the uprising, most of them by the IDF, some by
 Israeli settlers. Thirteen Palestinians were killed by other
 Palestinians for suspected collaboration with Israeli
 authorities. Over 20,000 Palestinians were wounded or injured
 by the IDF. Eleven Israelis have been killed in the intifada.
 According to IDF statistics, approximately 1,100 Israelis have
 been injured.
 Most Palestinian deaths resulted from the use of high
 velocity, standard service round bullets by the IDF during
 attempts to halt incidents involving stones, firebombs, or
 fleeing suspects. According to IDF regulations, live fire is
 permitted when soldiers' lives are in real and immediate
 danger. Only a specific attacker may be shot at; fire is to
 be directed at legs only; and it may be used against fleeing
 suspects only if a serious felony is suspected and as a last
 resort. Soldiers may fire only after exhausting all other
 means--including tear gas, rubber bullets, and warning shots.
 These guidelines were often not followed. Soldiers frequently
 used gunfire in situations that did not present mortal danger
 to troops, causing many avoidable deaths and injuries.
 In September IDF policy was changed to allow the firing of
 plastic bullets in order to stop demonstrations or instigators
 of demonstrations in situation that do not threaten the lives
 of security forces and to increase injuries. The IDF claims
 plastic bullets are less lethal than lead bullets. While no
 
 
 1378
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 precise figures are available, several deaths were attributed
 to plastic bullets, and nonlethal casualties increased after
 they were introduced. Other fatalities included at least 13
 reported deaths by beating and at least 4 deaths from tear gas
 used by the IDF in enclosed areas. Exact figures are
 unavailable and estimates vary. There have been reports of
 several instances in which Palestinian wounded died because of
 IDF delays of ambulances or because, for whatever reason,
 there were delays in moving the wounded to a hospital. There
 were five cases in 1988 in which unarmed Palestinians in
 detention died under questionable circumstances or were
 clearly killedby the detaining officials.
 Israeli authorities in some cases prosecuted or took
 disciplinary action against security personnel and settlers
 who killed Palestinians in violation of regulations. However,
 regulations were not rigorously enforced; punishments were
 usually lenient; and there were many cases of unjustified
 killing which did not result in disciplinary actions or
 prosecutions.
 b. Disappearance
 Israel does not sponsor or condone disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by Israeli law, and Israeli authorities
 claim they do not condone it. In 1987 the report of a special
 judicial commission headed by ex-Supreme Court President Landau
 confirmed that the Shin Bet had for many years illegally used
 physical and psychological pressure to obtain confessions from
 security suspects. The report recommended that limited and
 clearly delineated "physical and psychological pressure"
 (which it defined in a secret annex) should be allowed to be
 applied in appropriate circumstances. Reports of beatings of
 suspects and detainees continue, as do reports of harsh and
 demeaning treatment of prisoners and detainees. Palestinians
 and international human rights groups state that other
 practices, including forcing prisoners to remain in one
 position for prolonged periods, hooding, sleep deprivation,
 and use of cold showers have continued since the Landau
 report. Many convictions in security cases are based on
 confessions. Attorneys are normally not allowed to see
 clients until after interrogations are completed. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross is allowed access 14
 days after arrest.
 Since the uprising began in December 1987, the number of
 Palestinian prisoners has risen from about 4,700 to about
 10,000. According to IDF figures released November 28, 5,656
 Palestinian were being held in prisons or detention centers.
 Seven military detention centers were added to two existing
 facilities, but there is serious overcrowding. Conditions at
 military detention facilities vary. Abuse of prisoners was
 particularly severe at the new facility at Dahariya, but
 conditions there improved after personnel changes were
 effected and disciplinary measures were taken. There was
 widespread beating of unarmed Palestinians in early 1988 in
 uprising incidents and of persons not participating in violent
 activities. On January 19, the Minister of Defense announced
 a policy of 'force, might, and beatings" to put down the
 uprising. He later said there was no policy of "beating for
 beating's sake" and that some soldiers were exceeding orders.
 
 
 1379
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Nevertheless, in late January and February Palestinian and
 foreign physicians, human rights organizations, and the
 international and Israeli press reported widespread incidents
 in which IDF troops used clubs to break limbs and beat
 Palestinians who were not directly involved in disturbances or
 resisting arrest. Soldiers turned many people out of their
 homes at night, making them stand for hours, and rounded up
 men and boys and beat them in reprisal for stone-throwings.
 At least 13 Palestinians have been reported to have died from
 beatings. By mid-April reports of deliberate breaking of
 bones had ended, but reports of unjustifiably harsh beatings
 continued. The Attorney General of Israel criticized this
 policy and declared it illegal.
 IDF personnel are subject to discipline for violating
 procedures in beating cases. Four such cases have been
 publicized. A total of 66 soldiers have been accused of
 abuses in connection with their service in the occupied
 territories. Of these, 36 were convicted and sentenced, 2
 were acquitted, and 28 are awaiting trial. Those convicted
 received light punishment ranging from suspended sentences to
 imprisonment for 2 1/2 months.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Thirty six Palestinians were deported in 1988, compared to
 nine in 1987. These deportations contravene the Fourth Geneva
 Convention in the view of the United States. The Israeli
 Supreme Court has disagreed in a formal decision..
 The use of administrative detention greatly increased in
 1988. While the peak number of administrative detainees at
 any one time is uncertain, the number was 2,600 in September
 1988. As 'of November 28, Israeli government figures put the
 number at 1,590. Most were detained for 6 months, although 20
 percent of detention orders were renewed. Administrative
 detentions are ordered by district military commanders. In
 March regulations were changed to suspend temporarily the
 automatic review of administrative detention after 96"hours,
 as formerly required, although a detainee may appeal to a
 military judge. Secret evidence is often used as grounds for
 administrative detention, and it is not made available to
 detainees and their lawyers on grounds that confidentiality is
 required for security reasons. Such rulings can be appealed
 to the High Court, which has the right to review the secret
 evidence, but there have been no reversals. According to the
 IDF, as of early October 1988 there were 587 cases in which
 detention periods had been shortened or canceled.
 Israeli authorities maintain that administrative detention is
 used only against persons recently and repeatedly engaged in
 actions threatening security, and that political views and
 activities are not grounds for detention. However, Israel
 defines "security" very broadly, and in many cases individuals
 appear to have been detained for political activities which
 the authorities regard as a security threat. Many
 individuals, including academics, journalists, and human
 rights workers, who have not engaged in or advocated violence
 or other acts threatening security, have been detained,
 including many members of "popular committees," banned
 organizations which support the uprising in various ways,
 including nonviolent activities. Israeli officials have
 confirmed that in some instances, release of a detainee
 depends upon the behavior of the people in the area where the
 detainee lives.
 
 
 1380
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Since March the IDF moved over 2,000 administrative detainees
 at various times from the occupied territories to a detention
 camp in the Negev desert near Ketziot inside Israel. At its
 maximum in 1988, the camp held nearly 3,000 detainees but by
 the end of 1988 the number had dropped to approximately
 1,200. Transferring prisoners from occupied territories, in
 the view of the United States, contravenes the Fourth Geneva
 Convention. However, the Israeli Supreme Court, in dismissing
 a petition brought by Ketziot detainees, held the Convention's
 provisions could not be enforced by an Israeli Court since
 they have not been incorporated into domestic Israeli law.
 The Court held, on the basis of a 1988 order relating to
 military detention and a section of a 1987 law amending and
 continuing emergency regulations, that Israeli military
 commanders were empowered to order detention inside Israel
 proper and that detainees may be held in Israel if the order
 is issued in Israel. Conditions at Ketziot are rigorous and
 there is overcrowding. Prisoners are required to live in
 tents not designed for extended periods of confinement.
 Persons arrested for common crimes in the occupied territories
 are usually provided the opportunity for bail, access to an
 attorney, and a statement of charges, although these rights
 are sometimes delayed. Individuals may be held in custody
 without a warrant for 96 hours, and may be held without formal
 charges for up to 18 days. The normal detention period after
 charges are filed is 60 days before trial. A High Court judge
 may approve 3 months extensions.
 Security detainees are usually not allowed bail and are
 usually denied access to counsel for 18 days. Access may be
 denied indefinitely for security reasons if officials believe
 granting access would impede the investigation. Many security
 suspects are arrested without warrants. The law permits this
 for up to 96 hours. Officials at times have declined to
 confirm detentions to consular officers who have inquired on
 behalf of nationals of their countries. Denial of notification
 of arrest-to third parties, including immediate family members,
 is common and under the law can be extended for up to 14 days.
 Section 78(D) of Military Order 1220 of March, 1988, permits
 incognito detention for a period of 8 days if a court order is
 obtained. Despite improvements in record keeping, the
 authorities had difficulty keeping track of all detainees. At
 times families of some detainees did not know if or where
 relatives were being held. Detainees are often not told the
 reasons for their detention.
 The IDF greatly expanded the use of curfews, including
 confinement to houses, in Palestinian areas where violence had
 erupted, or where the authorities believed there was potential
 for violent protests. Curfews, often prolonged, caused severe
 hardship to all residents.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Palestinians accused of nonsecurity offenses are tried
 publicly in local courts by Palestinian judges, except when
 jurisdiction has been transferred by military order.
 Palestinians accused of security offenses, which are loosely
 defined under Israeli law, are normally tried in Israeli
 military courts and are entitled to counsel. Charges are
 brought by military commanders. In 1988, because of the large
 number of uprising-related security offenses, the military
 courts were heavily overburdened with thousands of cases,
 resulting in long delays before trial. Most military trials
 
 
 1381
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 are public, though access is controlled and is limited in some
 cases; defense attorneys are always present. Consular
 officers are allowed to attend military court proceedings
 involving foreign citizens, but there have been delays in
 gaining admission. Palestinian minors are treated as adults
 in security offenses. Acquittals are rare in security cases.
 The great majority of convictions in military courts are based
 on confessions. These are recorded in Hebrew, which many
 defendants are unable to read. There are numerous affidavits
 that confessions are often obtained by physical and
 psychological coercion. The 1987 Landau Commission report
 confirmed such practices on the part of the Shin Bet, as well
 as systematic perjury before the military courts. There is no
 appeal of military court verdicts to the Supreme Court, except
 on broadly interpreted procedural grounds, although the area
 commander may commute a sentence. The Ministry of Defense has
 ordered the establishment of a military appeals court by
 January 1, 1989. Nonjudicial administrative orders of the
 military government may be appealed to area military commanders
 and to the Supreme Court. The court almost never reverses
 CIVAD or military orders when security is the rationale.
 Most Israeli residents of the occupied territories accused of
 security and ordinary offenses are tried in the nearest
 Israeli district court under Israeli law. These courts are
 presided over by professional judges, and standards of due
 process and admissibility of evidence are stricter than in
 military courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Military authorities may enter private homes and institutions
 without a warrant in pursuit of security objectives. In 1988
 forced entries often resulted in beatings and destruction of
 property, as well as arrests. Security officials frequently
 questioned Palestinians about their political views, and such
 interrogation in some cases involved short-term detention.
 At least 154 houses of Arabs were demolished or sealed for
 security reasons, affecting over 1,000 people. Of the 154,
 101 were totally demolished, 7 partially demolished, 43
 totally sealed, and 3 partially sealed. Israeli authorities
 took these actions after the occupants were accused of
 involvement in security incidents, but prior to trial and
 conviction. Demolitions sometimes cause inadvertent damage to
 neighboring houses. The decision to demolish or seal a house
 is made by the area military commander. In the West Bank
 village of Beita in April, the IDF demolished 16 houses before
 obtaining the legally required orders. Twelve of the house
 owners have accepted the CIVAD's offer of compensation ranging
 from 10 to 100 percent. The other four are continuing
 negotiations. The occupants, who are often served with the
 demolition order only hours before it is to be carried out,
 have no right of appeal. If they learn of the order in time,
 they can apply to the High Court for an injunction. In 1988
 the court granted temporary injunctions, but overturned no
 orders. Owners are not allowed to rebuild their homes without
 a permit, making the punishment one of indefinite duration.
 House demolition as punishment of families is enforced only
 against Arabs in the occupied territories. It contravenes the
 Fourth Geneva-Convention in the view of the United States.
 The Israeli Supreme Court has held it is lawful under proper
 circumstances.
 
 
 1382
 
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Mail and telephone conversations in the West Bank, Gaza and
 East Jerusalem are sometimes monitored. In April, Israel cut
 off international telephone service for Palestinians in the
 West Bank and Gaza, citing security reasons. The Supreme
 Court upheld the order. Individuals may appeal to the
 military commander for special permits for telephone service.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 As part of the effort to halt the uprising, the Israeli
 authorities imposed increasing restraints on freedom of
 expression and press in 1988, citing security reasons.
 Palestinians believe that these restraints are arbitrary and
 politically motivated. The international law of occupation
 permits an occupying power to restrict freedom of expression
 and the press. Some criticism of Israeli policies by the
 Arabic press, most of which is located in East Jerusalem, was
 allowed. On at least three occasions there was a temporary
 ban on the distribution of East Jerusalem's Arab press in the
 West Bank and Gaza. Palestinian publications are required to
 submit to the military for precensorship all copy relating to
 the security, public order, and safety of Israel and the
 occupied areas. In practice, this requirement is very broadly
 defined. Some reports and editorials related to the uprising
 and Palestinian political goals were permitted, but censorship
 increased, and hundreds of articles and editorials were
 expurgated. Israeli authorities administratively detained at
 least 39 Palestinian journalists and editors for alleged
 security reasons, and numerous others were interrogated. The
 major Palestinian news agency was closed for 6 months in
 March, and the order was extended for 1 year in September. An
 Arabic news magazine was closed indefinitely, and all four
 Arabic dailies were banned at least once from distribution in
 the West Bank and Gaza for periods of up to 45 days.
 A permit is required for publications imported into the
 territories. Imported materials may be censored or banned for
 anti-Semitic or anti-Israel content or support for Palestinian
 nationalism. Possession of banned materials, such as uprising
 leaflets, is outlawed. The IDF periodically declared the
 occupied territories or certain areas closed in order to
 exclude local and international journalists; IDF personnel in
 the territories often issued such orders on the scene to bar
 access by journalists. Reports by foreign journalists are
 subject to censorship under a system of self-regulation.
 Israeli authorities temporarily suspended the credentials of
 five foreign correspondents for alleged violations of
 censorship regulations.
 Israeli authorities closed all Palestinian universities in the
 West Bank and in Gaza all year for alleged security reasons on
 grounds that they were contributing to violence. All
 vocational, secondary, and elementary schools in the West Bank
 had been closed for over 6 months, the major part of two
 semesters, but began to reopen on December 1. Schools in Gaza
 were open for most of the school year. Alternate, off-campus
 classrooms organized by parents and teachers were sometimes
 banned on security grounds. Displaying the Palestinian flag
 or its colors or Palestinian nationalist slogans is proscribed,
 as is publicly expressing support for the PLO. Individuals
 have been detained, or beaten, or forced to take down flags
 and erase nationalist graffiti. Property owners can be fined
 for not removing graffiti. At present, it appears that no one
 
 
 1383
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 has been charged with a crime for this offense. The IDF
 spokesman has stated that displaying flags or possessing
 nationalist literature, including intifada leaflets, can be
 construed as membership in a popular committee, an offense
 punishable by up to 10 years in prison. There have been no
 known prosecutions for this offense.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties and other groups viewed as primarily
 political are not permitted. Public meetings of more than 10
 people require permission. Palestinians often ignore this,
 but various meetings were broken up or prevented by the IDF.
 In 1988 public services by municipalities and the civil
 administration were curtailed by a sharp decline in tax
 revenues caused by strikes, a tax boycott, and economic
 dislocations related to the uprising. As a result,
 Palestinian charitable, community, professional, and self-help
 organizations assumed greater roles to provide alternate
 services. Israeli authorities took increasingly strict
 measures to curb such organizations because of concern they
 were supporting the uprising and the PLO and encroaching on
 municipal and CIVAD authority. Activities banned included
 home classes organized because of forced school closures and
 relief to families with relatives killed, injured, or detained
 in the uprising. Individuals involved in such activities were
 sometimes placed in administrative detention, interrogated, or
 denied permission to travel on grounds they were supporting
 the uprising. The Association for Defense of Civil Rights in
 Israel expressed concern over a military order banning
 "popular committees," local organizations which support the
 uprising in various ways, including nonviolent activities.
 The Federation of West Bank Professional Unions was closed for
 a year, for alleged security reasons.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion exists in the occupied territories. No
 group or sect is banned on religious grounds. Muslim and
 Christian holy days are freely observed. Both faiths operate
 various private schools and institutions. Religious
 publications circulate freely. Israel protects Muslim and
 Christian holy places and assures freedom of access. Security
 forces entered the Haram Ash-Sharif, sacred to Muslims, once
 in 1988 to break up demonstrations. Tear gas was fired into
 the Al-Aqsa mosque once, but security forces largely restricted
 their activities to monitoring access of worshipers to the
 area. Israel facilitates travel into Jordan for Muslim
 pilgrims to Mecca by expediting exit clearances and extending
 hours of bridge operation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement was restricted periodically in the West
 Bank and Gaza by scores of IDF curfews (the Palestinian legal
 rights organization al-Haq estimates as many as 1,600), which
 were often prolonged to discourage protest activities.
 Durations of curfews ranged from a few hours to several weeks.
 During prolonged curfews, with one week-long exception, people
 were usually allowed to leave their houses to obtain food and
 medical care for short, defined periods. Curfews caused
 severe hardship.
 
 
 1384
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 On at least three occasions, the IDF issued orders, blockaded
 villages for long periods, or took other measures to prevent
 farmers and merchants from harvesting and selling produce or
 exporting it to Jordan. Israeli authorities asserted that the
 measures were taken to persuade residents to stop stone
 throwing and other uprising activities or to reveal the
 whereabouts of suspects.
 Approximately 100,000 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
 travel daily to work in Israel. Workers need permits to stay
 overnight, but this requirement is not always enforced. Many
 workers stayed home during general strikes called by the
 uprising leadership, some because of coercion, but in most
 cases voluntarily.
 Thousands of Palestinians in the territories travel abroad
 each year, but Israeli authorities imposed increasing
 restraints on travel in 1988. Some political activists were
 forbidden to travel abroad by military commanders' orders or
 faced delays in obtaining exit visas or laissez passers.
 There are no obstacles to emigration. Israel sometimes
 refuses to renew laissez passers of Palestinians from the
 territories who live or work abroad, on the ground that they
 have abandoned their residence, although they may not have
 acquired foreign citizenship. Those who obtain foreign
 citizenship are ordinarily not allowed to resume residence in
 the occupied territories. They are permitted to return as
 tourists only, and sometimes are denied entry entirely.
 Enforcement of the 3-month limit for tourist visas for stays
 by Palestinians appears to be ad hoc. Requests for family
 reunification are granted only on a restricted basis. Persons
 who marry Palestinians in the occupied territories generally
 are not allowed to take up residence there. Entry or
 residency permission is frequently denied spouses, relatives
 and children, following the emigration of the head of the
 household. Israel has also denied the return of many former
 West Bank Palestinians who were not present in the territories,
 for whatever reason, at the time of the 1968 census conducted
 after the June War. Palestinians claim many thousands of
 family reunification requests are pending. According to the
 Government of Israel, in 1988, 300 applications for family
 reunifications were approved, involving 607 people. Israeli
 officials acknowledge that family reunification is limited for
 demographic and political reasons and assert that the laws of
 occupation do not require Israel to permit immigration into
 the territories. Restrictions on residence, reentry, and
 family reunification do not apply to Jews, whether or not they
 are Israeli citizens.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The West Bank and Gaza are ruled under occupation by the
 Israeli Ministry of Defense through a military governor and
 civil administration. Palestinians are not permitted to
 participate in significant public policy decisions concerning
 land and resource use and planning, taxation, trade, and
 industry. Municipal elections were last held in 1976, and
 various mayors were dismissed thereafter on security grounds.
 Only four elected mayors remain. In 1985 Israel appointed
 Palestinians to fill vacancies, but some have resigned or
 ceased working because of the uprising, and, in some cases,
 threats from Palestinians. There was an attempt to
 assassinate one appointed mayor in 1988. No Palestinian
 
 
 1385
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 political parties or overtly political organizations are
 permitted.
 Jerusalem is governed as part of Israel. Arab residents of
 East Jerusalem are permitted to vote in municipal elections;
 about 20 percent voted in 1983.
 As a result of King Hussein's July 1988 announcement, West
 Bank Palestinians lost representation in Jordan's Parliament.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Israel normally permits international human rights groups to
 visit the occupied territories. It states that it cooperates
 with a number of such organizations, and officials are
 generally available for meetings with internatibnal
 organizations on human rights issues. However, those
 organizations often consider Israel's responses to be
 inadequate, not all inquiries receive answer&, and some
 groups' requests for meetings with officials or access to
 detention facilities have been denied.
 The Government of Israel stepped up pressure on indigenous
 human rights organizations in 1988. Five field workers of Al
 Haq, a Palestinian legal rights organization, either were
 detained administratively or had detention orders renewed. In
 addition, two members of the Palestinian Human Rights
 Information Center and two Gaza human rights lawyers were
 detained.
 Many local groups, Israeli and Palestinian, are concerned with
 human rights. Their publications and statements are generally
 allowed to circulate in the occupied territories.
 Coordination between Arab and Israeli human rights groups
 continued to grow in 1988.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Jewish settlers in the occupied territories are subject to
 Israeli law while Palestinians are subject to Israeli military
 occupation law. Under the dual system of governance applied
 to Palestinians and Israelis, Palestinians are treated less
 favorably than Jewish settlers in the same areas on a broad
 range of issues, such as the right to legal process, rights of
 residency, freedom of movement, sale of crops and goods, land
 and water use, and access to health and social services.
 Jewish settlers involved in security violations have generally
 been treated more leniently than Palestinians guilty of similar
 offenses. Crimes against Israelis are often prosecuted more
 vigorously than offenses against Palestinians. In June the
 Supreme Court upheld Israel's authority to deny residency to
 and deport a Palestinian political activist, born in East
 Jerusalem, who had acquired foreign nationality. Jews retain
 residency rights under the Israeli law of return, regardless
 of having acquired foreign nationality.
 The use of land by Israeli authorities for military purposes,
 roads, settlements, and other Israeli purposes which restrict
 access by Palestinians, discriminates against Palestinians and
 adversely affects their lives and economic activities.
 Approximately 2.5 percent of the total area of the West Bank
 and East Jerusalem has been turned over to Israeli nationals
 
 
 1386
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 for residential, agricultural, and industrial use by settlers.
 Palestinians do not participate in the Higher Planning Council,
 which plans land use in the territories and exercises certain
 powers transferred from local, municipal, and village councils
 in 1971.
 Israel funds basic services for Palestinians, primarily from
 tax revenues collected in the occupied territories. In 1988
 revenues dropped sharply because of the economic disruption of
 the uprising and a Palestinian tax boycott. As a result,
 Israel announced cutbacks in regular services to Palestinians.
 In July fees at government hospitals for Arabs in the
 territories were doubled, and referrals to Israeli hospitals
 were curtailed. Israeli settlers have ready access to Israeli
 hospitals. Palestinians and persons of Arab descent entering
 Israel at the airport or the West Bank at the Jordan River
 bridges, regardless of citizenship, are subject to extensive
 searches, and many complain of harsh or humiliating treatment.
 Israel limits funds visitors may bring into the occupied
 territories for Palestinian use to $1,100 per person every 2
 months unless Israeli authorities grant permission in
 advance. Arab residents of the territories returning from
 travel may bring in amounts over $550 only with advance
 permission. Undeclared funds were frequently seized from
 Arab-Americans at points of entry and confiscated.
 Restitution is taking place. There is no limit on funds for
 Israeli use.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 The applicable sections for West Bank and Gaza Palestinians
 working in Jerusalem and Israel are contained in the country
 report for Israel. Palestinian residents of Jerusalem have
 the same rights and are governed by the same law as workers in
 Israel.
 a. The Right of Association
 Palestinians working in the West Bank are covered by the 1960
 Jordanian labor law, which permits any group of 20 or more in
 a single trade or establishment to form a union. In 1988
 approximately 100 unions functioned in the West Bank; of
 these, 31 were licensed by the Israeli Civil Administration.
 Many are affiliated with one of three umbrella federations.
 Any person can hold union office who has not been convicted of
 a crime. West Bank unions must submit lists of candidates to
 the CIVAD 30 days before elections; a candidate convicted of a
 political offense may be banned from running for office.
 Similar rules apply in Gaza.
 In 1988 Israeli authorities, citing security concerns,
 actively discouraged union activities in the West Bank.
 Israeli authorities state that the West Bank umbrella
 federations and many individual unions are fronts for illegal
 political organizations rather than trade unions. Israel
 claimed that no legitimate union activities were disrupted,
 and that its actions were intended to prevent illicit
 political activity.
 Palestinian workers in the West Bank have the right to strike.
 There were no strikes by unions during 1988 on strictly labor
 issues. The commercial strikes and stop-work actions which
 Palestinians mounted in the territories came in the wider
 political context of the uprising.
 
 
 1387
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 The West Bank umbrella labor federations have no direct
 affiliations to any external regional or international
 organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Jordanian law applies in the West Bank; Palestinian unions in
 the West Bank have the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. Under the prevailing circumstances of the
 uprising, it is clearly impossible to engage in collective
 bargaining. Unions have tended to limit their activities to
 educating workers about their rights, representing them in
 shop floor disputes, and.providing members with health
 insurance and legal advice. The situation is similar in Gaza,
 where Egyptian law applies. There are no export processing
 zones in the occupied territories.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in the occupied
 territories. Under existing law applicable to the occupied
 territories, there is no statutory ban on forced labor.
 Forced labor is, however, banned (except under certain
 exceptional circumstances) by the Fourth Geneva Convention.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 A 1978 ordinance of the Israeli authorities raised the minimum
 working age in the West Bank and Gaza to 14 years.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 In the West Bank, Jordanian law allows a maximum workweek of
 48 hours, except for certain hotel, food service, and cinema
 employees, whose workweek is 54 hours. There is no minimum
 wage provision in the West Bank or Gaza, nor is there
 effective enforcement of the maximum hours law.
