 CROATIA
 The Republic of Croatia is in principle a constitutional parliamentary democracy,
 with a powerful presidency. The ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) has main-
 tained power since independence in 1991, using its majority position to deny opposi-
 tion parties the ability to compete on fair and equal terms in elections. President
 Franjo Tudjman was reelected in June 1997 for a second 5-year term in an election
 that observers considered "fundamentally flawed." The President serves as the head
 of state and commander of the armed forces, chairs the influential National Defense
 and Security Council, appoints the Prime Minister who leads the Government, and
 approves certain appointments in local and regional government. The extensive con-
 stitutional powers of the presidency, the overwhelming dominance of the HDZ, its
 absolute control of television, the continuing concentration of power within the one-
 party central Government, and government influence that circumscribes and weak-
 ens the judiciary combine to make the country's nominally democratic system in re-
 ality authoritarian.
 The Ministry of Interior oversees the police, and the Ministry of Defense oversees
 the military. Civilian police have no authority over the military police or over uni-
 formed military personnel. The national police have primary responsibility for inter-
 nal security but, in times of disorder, the government may call on the army to pro-
 vide security. The civilian authorities generally maintain effective control of the pro-
 fessional security forces, although the police sometimes committed human rights
 abuses.
 The transition to a market-based, free enterprise economy is proceeding slowly.
 While agriculture is mostly in private hands and family-owned small enterprises are
 multiplying, industry and media enterprises are largely either still controlled by the
 state or deliberately were transferred in nontransparent, noncompetitive processes

 to individuals sympathetic to the ruling party. Unemployment remained high at 16
 percent and higher in the areas affected by the war, and the standard of living for
 most of the population has yet to recover to prewar levels. The economy showed un-
 derying weakness throughout the year, especially in the financial sector. Several
 banks collapsed and illiquidity worsened considerably, squeezing hundreds of thou-
 sands of depositors, employees, and small entrepreneurs.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor although improvement
 was measurable in certain areas, serious problems continued in others. Police com-
 mitted one extrajudicial killing and occasionally beat persons. The Government does
 not always respect due process provisions for arrest and detention. Lengthy pretrial
 detention is a problem. The judicial system is subject to executive and political influ-
 ence, and the court system suffers from such a severe backlog of cases and shortge
 of judges that the right of citizens to address their concerns in court is seriously
 impaired. Cases of interest to the ruling party are processed expeditiously, while
 others languish in court, further calling into question the independence of the judici-
 ary. The courts sometimes deny citizens fair trials. The Government at times in-
 fringed on citizens' privacy rights.
 The Government restricted press freedom, using the courts and administrative
 bodies selectively to shut down or restrain newspapers, radio, and television stations
 critical of the Government or simply outside of its control. The functioning of the
 Telecommunications Council, which is dominated by the HDZ, is opaque, and the
 Council arbitrarily denies operating licenses to applicants not favored by the ruling
 party. Government intimidation induced self-censorship by journalists; some 900
 criminal and civil cases against journalists are ongoing. There were incidents of
 overt censorship of the e    ea           Government restricted freedom of as-
 sembly, and circumscribed freedom of association by a law that prohibited groups
 from forming or meeting unless expressly authorized to do so by means of an intru-
 sive registration process. The Government seriously limited citizens' right to change
 their government peacefully. It used the manipulation of laws, harassment, eco-
 nomic pressure, and its almost total control of the electronic media to control the
 political process. The Government's record of cooperation with international human
 rights and monitoring organizations was mixed, and it remained uncooperative in
 the search by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)
 for evidence on alleged crimes committed during the Croatian military operations
 "    tFlash" and "Storm" in 1995, Cases of abuse from the 1995 military actions, includ-
 ing the alleged murder  ds  e    of cilians by government forces, remain large-
 ly unsolved.
 In a positive development, the Government enacted in May procedures by which
 refugee citizens previously barred from returning to Croatia-mosty ethnic Serbs--
 might exercise that right. The pace of implementation, while initially slow, in-
 creased markediy in September. In June the Government adopted a progr to fa-
 cilitate the return of homeowners to their property upon their return to Croatia, al-
 though implementation of the program was uneven and marred by bureaucratic con-
 fusion.
 Violence and discrimination against women remained problems. The Government
 discriminates against Muslims. Ethnic minorities, including Roma, also faced con-
 tinued discrimination. Government commitments to foster reconciliation among eth-
 nic groups and overcome the war's strong legacy of animosity have not been met
 completely. Although the Government made progress in establishing civil authority
 in the former occupied areas, and physical violence declined overall, some abuses,
 such as harassmn  men th  reats,     e instances, even beatings still occurred,
 particularly in the areas of the former conflict. Police performance improved overall,
 but in a significant number of cases when the victim was an ethnic Serb, the police
 either did not investigate thoroughly or failed take effective action against the
 criminal activity.
 with the end of the mandate for the United Nations Transitional Administration
 for Eastern Slavonia ( NTAES) on January 15, the Government regained full au-
 thority over the Danubian region. The Government's record on the continued peace-
 ful reintegration of the region was mixed. While no large-scale violence or mass de-
 parture of Serb inhabitants occurred, there was a steady exodus of thousands of
 Croatia's Serb citizens throughout the year. A lack of economic opportunity certainly
 was a factor, but international observers pointed to the Government's failure to ac-
 tively fulfil the commitments it undertook to reassure and reintegrata the popu-
 lation. Housing and employment regulations were administered in a manner biased
 against ethnic Serbs; incidents of intimidation and harassment increased, and the
 administration of justice was biased in favor of ethnic Croats. Some violent incidents
 were reported, generally connected with disputes over housing. While some of the
 region's remaining inhabitants were able to return to their homes in the rest of Cro-
 
 
 1202
 atia, the Government took little effective action to resolve the cases of those whose
 homes were damaged or occupied, which it had committed to solve in 1997.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government officials. However, police in Sibenik beat an Italian tourist
 to death in an extrajudicial killing in September. The Government initiated an in-
 vestigation, which remained ongoing at year's end, and the officers involved were
 removed from the force.
 Isolated reports continued of ethnically motivated killings in the formerly occupied
 areas, which, although small in number, discourage individuals of all ethnicities
 from returning to areas where they would be a minority.
 Of the many major crimes committed by both sides during the conflict, the Gov-
 ernment has been much more vigorous in the prosecution of those committed by eth-
 nic Serbs during the occupation than those committed by ethnic Croats at or near
 the time of Croatia's military operations in the summer of 1995. Other than the pro-
 ceedings underway against nine Croatian military and paramilitary members in-
 volved in the murders in Pakracka Poljana in 1991, no progress was made in some
 of the most well-known cases, such as the Grubori murders. In an August report
 by Amnesty International, prosecutors responsible for the Grubori case claimed to
 have no knowledge of any investigation or proceedings underway. This directly con-
 tradicts the Government s assertions that these cases were receiving urgent atten-
 tion and were a high priority.
 In June Slavko Dokmanovic, the former Serb mayor of Vukovar, committed sui-
 cide in his cell in a United Nations (U.N.) detention facility in the Netherlands. He
 was awaiting trial before the ICTY on charges of committing war crimes and crimes
 against humanity, including the massacre of over 200 unarmed men outside
 Vukovar Hospital in 1991.
 In June the remains of 938 persons were exhumed from a mass grave in Vukovar
 (see Section 1.b.).
 In December the Government indicted Dinko Sakic, commander of Croatia's
 Jasenovac concentration camp in 1944, for crimes against humanity in the deaths
 of more than 2,000 persons. Sakic was extradited to the country in June from Ar-
 gentina.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 As of November, government figures showed that 1,824 persons still were missing
 in cases unresolved from the 1991-92 military conflicts. However, this number does
 not reflect another 800 to 900 Croatian Serbs also listed as missing. While the dia-
 log continued with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) Commission on Miss-
 ing Persons, results were few and the cases remained outstanding at year's end.
 With the resumption of government authority over the former UNTAES region on
 January 15, significant progress was made on the exhumation and identification of
 bodies in the Danubian region. In the city of Vukovar, some 938 bodies ranging in
 age from 6 months to 104 years were exhumed from the new cemetery alone, of
 whom 133 thus far were on the list of the missing. An estimated 1,200 persons were
 buried at the site. Exhumations also took place in other parts of the Danubian re-
 gion, including Beli Manistir, Tenja, Lovas, Dalj, Celije, Djeletovci, Ilaca, Tovarnik,
 and Hrvatska Kostajnica in central Croatia.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture or cruel or degrading punishment; however, there
 were occasional credible reports that police beat persons and that these cases were
 not always investigated properly. For example, a Serb convicted of war crimes in
 April alleged that he was beaten and tortured while in custody in 1997. Despite the
 repeated urgings of the defense counsel and internationa human rights organiza-
 tions, no investigation of those allegations had yet taken place at year's end.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards. Jails are crowded, but
 not excessively so, and family visits and access to counsel are generally available,
 albeit not consistently at all phases of the criminal proceedings (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution contains prvisions to
 protect the legal rights of all accused persons, but the Government does not always
 respect these rights in practice. The Government's application of a general amnesty
 for rebel Serbs in 1996 remained highly problematic, and the issuance in the spring
 of a list of 13,575 persons to whom amnesty had been granted by the Osijek County
 Court further clouded the issue. This list, combined with official statements that
 there  the le no new arrests other than those 25 persons convicted in absentia
 
 
 1203
 for war crimes, led to confusion and uncertainty since arrests of Serb refugees who
 did not appear on the list of 25 continued sporadically throughout the year. This
 largely undermined any positive effects that the amnesty had generated. Credible
 evidence emerged that the Government reworded charges for amnestiable offenses
 in order to uphold prosecutions as either common crimes or war crimes. For exam-
 ple, in one case in Split, the U.N. Center for Human Rights noted that charges had
 been revised three times in order to keep one defendant in custody.
 Police normally obtain arrest warrants by presenting evidence of probable cause
 to an investigative magistrate. Police may carry out arrests without a warrant if
 they believe a suspect might flee, destroy evidence, or commit other crimes. Such
 cases are not uncommon. The police then have 24 hours in which to justify their
 decision before the local investigative magistrate. However, inspectors working
 under the auspices of the Ministry of Finance (the so-called "financial police") do not
 require a warrant in order to enter premises and examine records, actions which
 can lead to the unilateral shutdown of the organization in question in advance of
 any due process (see Section 2.a.). For example, one nongovernmental organization
 (NGO) in the Danubian region was given 3 days to shut its doors in July after the
 financial police determined that it had exceeded its authority in approving small
 business loans. However, the order was not carried out after international interven-
 tion on behalf of the NGO.
 Detainees must be given access to an attorney of their choice within 24 hours of
 their arrest; if they have none and are charged with a crime for which the sentence
 is over 10 years' imprisonment, the investigative magistrate appoints counsel from
 a list of public defenders. The investigative magistrate must, within 48 hours of the
 arrest, decide whether sufficient cause exists to hold a person in custody pending
 further investigation. Investigative detention usually lasts from a few days to few
 weeks, but the Supreme Court may extend the deadline (for a total period of not
 more than 6 months) in exceptional cases. Once the investigation is complete, de-
 tainees are released on their own recognizance pending trial, unless the crime is a
 serious offense, the accused are considered a public danger, or the court believes
 that they may flee.
 However, persons held under investigation often were denied the right to have an
 attorney present during all parts of the investigative stage or appeal of investigative
 detention. In practice detainees almost always are bound over or investigation un-
 less it is clear that no case exists against them, and there have been several cases
 of lengthy pretrial detention, including individuals who are awaiting appeal of their
 acquittal by the state prosecutor. While- there are provisions for posting bail after
 charges are brought, the practice is not common. The International Committee of
 the Red Cross estimated that approximately 70 ethnic Serbs were still in detention
 for acts related to the conflicts in 1995.
 Full control of the police in Eastern Slavonia reverted to the Government after
 the UNTAES mission departed on January 15. The United Nations maintained 180
 international police monitors in the region to assess activities of the local police
 until October 15, when that function was assumed by the Organization for Security
 and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). While there were isolated incidents of behavior
 in favor of returning Croat displaced persons, the U.N. Police Support Group
 (UNPSG) and the OSCE Police Monitoring Group (after October 15) reported that
 police behavior was adequate overall.
 The Constitution prohibits the exile of citizens. In a positive step, the Government
 in May established procedures by which Croatian Serb refugees who had fled the
 country in 1995 might regulate their citizenship status and return to Croatia. This
 provided a possible end to years of effective exile for some 200,000 Croatian citizens
 ving abroad as refugees. Implementation of these procedures was initially slow,
 but gained momentum as the year progressed, with over 3,000 persons in Serbia-
 Montenegro receiving confirmation of citizenship by September and another 700 in
 Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Government influence seriously weakens the
 nominally-independent judiciary. In practice both bureaucratic inefficiency and po-
 litical influence mar the system. The court system has a backlog of over 1 million
 cases.
 The judicial-system consists of municipal and district courts, a Constitutional
 Court (which both determines the constitutionality of laws and governmental acts
 and serves as the court of final appeal for-individual cases), a Supreme Court, and
 an Administrative Court. A parallel commercial court system handles all commer-
 cial and contractual disputes. The State Judicial Council (consisting of a president
 and 14 members) is a body independent from both the judiciary and the Ministry
 of Justice charged with both the appointment and discipline, including removal, of
 judges, court presidents, and public prosecutors. The upper house of Parliament
 
 
 1204
 nominates persons for membership on the Council, and the lower house elects the
 members for 8-year terms. The 11 judges of the Constitutional Court are elected for
 8-year terms in the same manner, while-all other judges are appointed for life.
 Under legislation adopted in 1993, the State Judicial Council (SJC) concluded its
 review of judicial appointments early in the year. While judges are prohibited by
 the Constitution from being members of any political party, critics charge that the
 Council (whose members are appointed by the HDZ-dominated Parliament) is a po-
 litical tool of the executive branch. Some judges not reappointed after the Council's
 review maintained that this was due more to their independent views or ethnicity
 than their qualifications. While the Council is authorized to act independently in the
 appointment and review of judges, it occasionally has defied Constitutional Court
 rulings. For example, the Council refused to acknowledge a Constitutional Court de-
 cision in late 1997 that maintained that it had exceeded its authority in declining
 to process all applicants for open judicial appointments. The Council claimed that
 the Court did not have jurisdiction, despite the Constitutional Court's basis in law
 as the arbiter in jurisdictional disputes between the branches of government and its
 obligation to ensure that the constitutional rights of citizens are protected. The issue
 remained unresolved at year's end. The 1997 dismissal of the former head of the
 Supreme Court, Krunislav Olujic, for (among other charges) impugning the honor
 and dignity of the Court, was overturned by the Constitutional Court in April for
 unconstitutional procedural violations. However, in October the SJC upheld his en-
 suing dismissal as the head of the Supreme Court.
 Low pay for judges, combined with cumbersome and opaque selection procedures
 by the State Judicial Council, and its apparent reluctance to process all applicants
 for open positions, left the courts with atleast a 30 percent shortage in the number
 of judges. The judicial system also suffers from a massive case backlog. Cases in-
 volving average citizens drag on for years, while criminal libel suits or other cases
 affecting high-level government officials are heard within weeks under "urgent pro-
 ceedings" (see Section 2.a.).
 Although the Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial and a variety of
 due process rights in the courts, the courts sometimes deny citizens fair trials. Local
 authorities often refused to implement court decisions. For example, little or no
 progress was made in the numerous cases of illegal evictions where the legal owner
 a a positive court decision, yet was unable to gain access to his property (see Sec-
 tion -1.f.). Many of these cases involve either current or former members of the Cro-
 atian military or police forces, and local authorities refuse to act against them on
 behalf of the rightful occupant. The only recourse for the defendant is to return to
 court to demand implementation of the fnrt decision, a time-consuming and costly
 procedure that still may not result in implementation. Meanwhile, in a clear double
 standard, after the departure of the UNTAES mission in January, the OSCE re-
 ported that the court governing the affected region were flooded with cases in
 which the original owner (an ethnic Croat) sought and received a court order install-
 ing a lien on the property of the ethnic Serb occupying the Croat's home in the Da-
 nubian region. Cases in the region in which the plaintiff is an ethnic Croat are
 heard and decided in a matter of days or weeks; however, cases in which the plain-
 tiff is an ethnic Serb often drag on for months or years.
 One NGO in Eastern Slavonia cited the total absence of any administrative court
 decisions in more than 1,000 appeals of denied citizenship. Of the 200 cases that
 were resolved positively during the year, all were administrative reversals of the
 original decision by the Ministry rather than action on the appeals filed in the court.
 In the remaining 800 appeals, many of which date back more than a year, the court
 remained silent. The NGO noted that the court's failure to act called into question
 "the existence of any meaningful judicial remedy for legal errors committed by ad-
 ministrative bodies."
 In another significant example, the Constitutional Court in May ruled that sev-
 eral sections of the existing pension law were unconstitutional and should be abol-
 ished. It further required that pensioners be compensated retroactively for their lost
 income. However, changes to the legislation only occurred after a sustained attack
 on the Court in the press and calls by senior government officials to curb its powers.
 Nor did the Government respond to statements by the President of the Supreme
 Court that neither the Supreme Court nor any courts under its jurisdiction were ob-
 ligated to respect decisions by the Constitutional Court, calling into question the
 Government's willingness to defend constitutional provisions regarding the judici-
 The Government continued to apply questionable legal standards in the imple-
 mentation of the general amnesty adopted in 1996. There was credible evidence that
 crimes for which persons should have received amnesty were recategorized as either
 common crimes or war crimes. International monitors, including the U.N. Center for
 
 
 1205
 Human Rights, cited several prominent cases in which the evidence presented
 should not have led to any conviction, let alone one for a war crime. The appeal of
 Milos Horvat (sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment for genocide in 1997 based on
 what international monitors described as questionable standards of evidence) was
 heard by the Supreme Court in December, 18 months after it was initially filed. No
 decision was handed down by year's end. Prisoners in Split went on a hunger strike
 in the spring to protest the court's inaction in processing their appeals and, in sev-
 eral cases, the initial hearing of their cases.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-At
 times the Government infringed on these rights. The Constitution declares the home
 inviolable. Only a court may issue a search warrant, which must state the justifica-
 tion for the search. Police may enter a home without a warrant or the owner's con-
 sent only if necessary to enforce an arrest warrant, apprehend a suspect, or prevent
 serious danger to life or property. While the authorities generally complied with
 these norms, there were notable exceptions in which the Government and, in par-
 ticular, the military did not respect private property in practice. Despite developing
 a mechanism by which property could, in theory, be restored to the original owner,
 the Government failed to implement this program vigorously. Further, there are no
 provisions for those individuals, primarily citizens of Serb ethnicity, who lost ten-
 ancy rights to their dwellings during the war, to return to their previous homes.
 In the second half of the year, the Ministry of Interior acknowledged accusations
 that the Agency to Protect Constitutional Order (SZUP) had been tapping the tele-
 phones of some independent journalists (among others), but denied that there was
 any impropriety in either its actions or motivations, which the Ministry claimed
 were justified under the Constitution (see Section 2.a.).
 Despite the October 1997 ruling by the Constitutional Court that several elements
 of the Law on the Temporary Takeover of Specified Property (LTTP) were unconsti-
 tutional, the vast majority of Serb property owners displaced by that legislation in
 favor of ethnic Croat refugees remained unable to access their property. In June the
 Government adopted a program for return, which included mechanisms for property
 restitution. However, the establishment of these mechanisms was slow. Throughout
 the remainder of the year, only a small number of cases of property restitution was
 recorded as both central and local authorities declined to take steps to displace tem-
 porary occupants in favor of the original owners, as stipulated in the return pro-
 gram. Despite exhortations from the central Government, many local authorities did
 not take steps to regulate permits authorizing or revoking occupancy rights or to
 initiate lawsuits against individuals who refused to vacate occupied premises, a situ-
 ation that remained largely unchanged throughout the year. Numerous returning
 ethnic Serb displaced persons and refugees continued to remain shut out of their
 homes, although in many cases the Croat's house had been reconstructed and there
 was no impediment to his return. In general in such cases, the Government failed
 to furnish reconstructed houses with basic utilities. For example, local officials in
 Topusko estimate that some 400 houses belonging to ethnic Croats have been recon-
 structed, yet the Croats continue to occupy the homes of ethnic Serbs, thus blocking
 the Serbs' return.
 Housing commissions in the Danubian region in contrast were established quickly
 and proceeded to issue eviction notices to occupants, primarily ethnic Serbs.
 Throughout the year, the UNPSG, the OSCE, and numerous local human rights or-
 ganizations reported forcible evictions of ethnic Serbs on an almost weekly basis. Po-
 lice response was mixed, due in part to conflicting instructions from higher authori-
 ties. Despite direct intervention by senior government officials to halt the evictions
 and clarify police instructions early in the year, homeowners were allowed to harass
 occupants until they were, in effect, forced to leave. In many cases, the actions of
 local officials in the Danubian region called into question their impartiality in mak-
 ing public statements or, as occurred in Ilok, in arriving at the property in question
 with the Croat homeowner. While estimates vary widely, responsible international
 estimates claim that some 20,000 ethnic Serbs left the region since the end of the
 UNTAES mandate (generally for the FRY), with some 3 to 5 families departing
 every day. In addition to the serious underlying economic and social situation, many
 left in the face of intense pressure and blatant discrimination.
 No progress was made to resolve the thousands of cases of Croatian citizens, for
 the most part ethnic Serbs who, due to their absence of more than 6 months during
 the war, lost tenancy rights. Ethnic Serbs were disproportionately affected because
 no mechanism existed by which they could return to Croatia in order to claim their
 property or because they had lived in the occupied parts of the country and missed
 the chance to purchase their previous apartments.
 
 
 1206
 The Ministry of Defense also continued to pursue numerous, arbitrary revocations
 of tenancy rights involving individuals who had lived in their apartments for dec-
 ades. The authorities justified their actions either by the 6-month absence provision,
 or if the primary tenant was ruled to have "acted against the interests of the Repub-
 lic of Croatia." Membership in the Yugoslav Army at any time by the primary ten-
 ant was deemed sufficient by the Ministry of Interior to brand that individual as
 an "enemy of the state." Surviving family members' rights to maintain tenancy of
 the property of a deceased or divorced spouse often were denied, even though that
 right is provided for specifically under the law. Although courts often declared such
 evictions illegal (after lengthy legal proceedings-see Section I.e.), the occupier sel-
 dom was removed from the premises. The case in Split of Hasim Begovic still re-
 mains unresolved, despite a total of eight unsuccessful eviction attempts to date.
 In February and March, numerous incidents of arson were reported in the
 Banovina region. While police determined that these fires were, for the most part,
 inadvertent incidents resulting from careless field clearing, international and local
 NGO's pointed out that the dozens of destroyed homes belonged almost exclusively
 to ethnic Serbs and seriously questioned the thoroughness and impartiality of the
 police investigations. The summer months saw a rise in the number of violent inci-
 dents overall, particularly in the Danubian region and in former Sector South. The
 use of explosives and booby traps caused property damage and instilled fear (see
 Section 1.f.). For example, in Benkovac several houses belonging to ethnic Serbs
 were destroyed over the summer. In the Danubian region, the majority of the re-
 ported incidents were related to disputes over housing.
 The Constitution provides for the secrecy and safety of personal data, and this
 provision generally was respected. However, there was very credible evidence that
 requests made by ethnic Serbs to return to their original homes in the formerly oc-
 cupied areas were used by individuals to vandalize or in some cases destroy the
 property in order to prevent the Serb from returning. Reports also persisted, al-
 though fewer in number than in 1997, that local housing commissions allowed au-
 thorizations for temporary accommodation to be transferred among temporary users,
 thus keeping a residence occupied even after the original owner's intention to return
 was known.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom  of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom   of
 thought and expression, specifically including freedom of the press and other media,
 speech, and public expression, as well as the free establishment of institutions and
 public communication; however, the Government controls or influences much of the
 print media, controls most of the electronic media (in particular, television), and in-
 fluences and manipulates the judiciary. All this, combined with the Government's
 continued harassment-through job loss or banishment from the airwaves, overt
 censorship, intimidation, and criminal prosecution--of those journalists who criticize
 the ruling party, stifles many of these freedoms in practice. The Government main-
 tained an unofficial campaign of harassment of the independent media throughout
 the year, and some 300 criminal and 600 civil prosecutions of journalists are ongo-
 ing, most brought by government officials or their close relatives or associates. The
 law gives the public prosecutor the right to appeal an acquittal, thereby potentially
 exposing journalists to double jeopardy. During the second half of the year, the Min-
 istry of Interior acknowledged accusations that the Agency to Protect the Constitu-
 tional Order was tapping the telephones of some independent journalists (among
 others) but denied that there was any impropriety in either its actions or motiva-
 tions, which the Ministry claimed were justified under the Constitution (see Section
 I.f.).
 Despite continued domestic and international protest, the Government took no
 steps to revise articles of the Penal Code that authorize the criminal prosecution
 of journalists who publish "state secrets" or insult the honor or dignity of the Presi-
 dent, the Prime Minister, the Speaker of Parliament, or the Chief justices of either
 the Supreme Court or the Constitutional Court. In April the former editor in chief
 of Globus, Davor Butkovic, was acquitted of criminal liability in a suit brought by
 23 ministers, including the Prime Minister, for citing in an article a report by a for-
 eign company that alleged corruption in the Cabinet. The state prosecutor appealed
 the acquittal, as he has in the ongoing criminal liability case against the Feral Trib-
 une for slandering the honor of the President. Further, under the law the publisher
 of the offending article may be subject to a separate civil suit for causing mental
 anguish.
 Individuals may criticize the Government, although not always without reprisal.
 Lawsuits brought against a leading human rights activist and a prominent politi-
 cian in 1997 for the "dissemination of false information with the intent to incite
 
 
 1207
 public instability" remained unresolved. In bringing these suits, the public prosecu-
 tor failed to acknowledge that these individuals (and others) made similar state-
 ments in previous years with no ensuing public disorder.
 The Government (through the privatization board) and, in particular, business-
 men with close ties to the HDZ enjoy a virtual monopoly on printing and distribut-
 ing newspapers and magazines. Fees of 20 percent of gross sales (payable in ad-
 vance), combined with slow payment (or nonpayment) of proceeds from the distribu-
 tor to the publication and prompt payment requirements for the printer, have
 caused acute cash flow problems for many independent publications. The slow pace
 of the judicial process (see Section .e.), makes it extremely difficult for these publi-
 cations to seek timely redress of their payment difficulties in the courts. Journals
 and publications also complained that they had little control over where their publi-
 cations were sent, with large quantities at times being sent to remote villages, leav-
 ing the bigger, urban markets undersupplied.
 The ruling party's control of the electronic media is pervasive. The majority party
 in the Sabor (currently the HDZ) controls 5 of the 9 seats on the Telecommuni-
 cations Council, the government body that allocates or revokes private radio and tel-
 evision concessions. Concession fees are inordinately high, but are not paid by Cro-
 atian State Radio and Television (HRT). Decisions by the Council are arbitrary, lack
 transparency, and are generally biased in favor of proprietors backed by the HDZ.
 For example, in Rijeka the opposition party mayor and his backers were unable to
 get a concession for a local television station because the only frequency the Council
 was prepared to issue in that area belonged to another "station"--one that had
 never broadcast in the 2 years that it held the concession-in direct violation of the
 law, which mandates broadcasting within 2 years of frequency issuance. However,
 the stalemate finally ended when a frequency was awarded in October.
 The HRT is the only national network in the country and is the main source of
 news for approximately 90 percent of the population. It broadcasts on three national
 television and radio channels. Technically under the control of Parliament, the HRT
 is, in practice, run by the ruling HDZ Party; its director is a prominent member
 of the lParty. The Government controls the state network through the HRT Council
 which, like the Telecommunications Council, also is dominated by the HDZ. The
 HRT Council directly supervises operations and editorial content of state-run radio
 and television, effectively restricting access by opposition parties to criticize govern-
 ment policies and consistently preventing even the semblance of impartial reporting
 during election campaigns (see Section 3). A new law on the HRT was adopted by
 Parliament in October, which reduced the number of Members of Parliament
 (M.P.'s) on the HRT Council from 14 of 18 to 10 of 23. However, this minor modifica-
 tion did virtually nothi.ng to address the fundamental problem of government control
 over the state televison network because Parliament retained the ability to nomi-
 nate and confirm all other appointments to the Council.
 Both public and private radio and television stations coexist, although independ-
 ent broadcasters are forbidden by law from either broadcasting nationally or from
 "networking" to achieve national coverage. Revenue collection is also greatly skewed
 in favor of the HRT, which receives subsidies from government taxes on television
 (accounting for some two-thirds of the HRT's gross aunual revenues), as well as
 some 80Opercent of advertising revenue. These subsidies create an unfair advantage
 for the HRT over any independent television station that tries to compete, as the
 idpendents' ability to purchase progranmning, etc., is far less than that of the
 HR. Siilar. problems exist in radio broadcasting. The enforcement arm of the
 Mi.   y of Fiance, the financil police, often is used by the Telecommunications
 Cuncil to shut down stations deemed too critical of the Government. The financial
 police may enter any premises without a warrant and, at any time, demand access
 an organization's financial records (see Section 1.d.). The punishments meted out
 b4y the financial police and the Telecommunications Councl of en far exceed the se-
 rousness of the infraction. For example, TV Moslavina, known for its "provocative"
 news stories, was shut down in May when it moved to a new location and failed
 to renew its license with its updated address. Government influence over the court
 system exacerbates these problems. Journaists who sought reform of the HRT from
 within routinely were silenced and in many cases taken off the air while still on
 theHlhT payroll. In July a new director of HRT was appointed who reinstated sev-
 eral of these journalists in November. However, censorship of their new program
 "One Plus One" commenced almost immediately. In December the HRT director cut
 a scheduled segment on an opinion poll that was unflattering to the ruling party
 on the grounds that airing the poll "could create precedents which HRT, as the most
 influential media outlet. ., cannot afford."
 Foreign newspapers and journals were available in larger urban areas throughout
 the county, altoug cost makes them prohibitively expensive for most persons.

 While academic freedom generally is respected, scholars reported that they were
 reluctant to speak out on political issues. Some scientists believe that the Govern-
 ment exerted subtle pressure on them through its control of research funds.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly; however, the Government at times exercised arbi-
 trary control to restrict this right during the year and adopted measures that tem-
 porarily restricted the right of peaceful public assembly in the former UNTAES re-
 gion.
 Numerous rallies and demonstrations took place throughout the country during
 the year, many of which were led by workers protesting poor social conditions and
 pay. However, under legislation regulating public protests, local officials in the cap-
 ital denied labor unions the right to demonstrate in the main square on two occa-
 sions in the first half of the year, once in January and again in February. On both
 occasions, demonstrators who decided to hold their gathering despite the Govern-
 ment's prohibition were met with overwhelming force. In February some 5,000 po-
 lice shut down the center of the city for over 6 hours, injuring some 30 demonstra-
 tors and 6 police officers. This completely disrupted traffic, the grounds on which
 the Government had denied the permit in the first place (see Section 6.a.). In March
 the authorities banned all public demonstrations in Eastern Salvonia until August
 in response to an anti-Serb rally organized by the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP)
 in Borovo Selo.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association; however, legislation adopted
 in 1997 increased the government's ability to restrict this right. The Law on Asso-
 ciations gives the government broad powers to prevent the founding of an associa-
 tion and to monitor all aspects of an association once founded. Further, an associa-
 tion's activities may be suspended administratively based on only a "well-founded"
 suspicion that the group's activities contravene the Constitution or law. Until such
 time as the association proves itself innocent in a court of law, the Government can
 keep it closed indefinitely and appoint someone to manage and dispose of the asso-
 ciation's property. Many local and international NGO's find themselves in a precar-
 ious position, as the reregistration process is proceeding only slowly. According to
 the law, in the absence of any formal notification to the contrary, an NGO is to con-
 sider itself reregistered. However, without written confirmation of registration from
 the Ministry of Administration, NGO's face significant obstacles in their day-to-day
 functioning.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of conscience and
 religion and free public profession of religious conviction, and the Government re-
 spects these rights in practice. No formal restrictions are imposed on religious
 groups, and all religious communities are free to conduct public services and to open
 and run social and charitable institutions. Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox
 Christianity, and Islam are the major faiths, and a small Jewish community is ac-
 tive. While some organizations claimed that Orthodox priests encountered difficul-
 ties in obtaining Croatian citizenship and travel documents, there is no evidence of
 any specific discrimination against the Orthodox clergy beyond that faced by other
 ethnic Serb Croatian citizen refugees abroad (see Section 2.d.).
 No formal restrictions are imposed on religious groups. Croatian Protestants from
 a number of denominations, as well as foreign clergy, actively practice and pros-
 elytize, as do representatives of Eastern-based religions. The Government tightened
 its residence permit and visa issuance policy in 1997, but this was a general policy
 shift and not directed at religious workers (although they were among those af-
 fected).
 While the state has no official state religion, the dividing line between the Catho-
 lic Church and the state often was blurred, and the ruling party throughout the
 year attempted to closely identify itself with the Catholic Church. However, the
 Church more frequently sought an independent role for itself and was at times
 openly critical of the prevailing political situation. The new head of the Catholic
 Church, who took office in January, became more active in publicly promoting rec-
 onciliation and the return of refugees and in both January and December delivered
 strong messages against corruption and promoting the need for civic virtue, dialog,
 and mutual respect between groups.
 The Government requires that religious training be provided in schools, although
 attendance is optional. Schools are allowed to offer classes in minority religions if
 they fill the necessary quota of minority students. However, the lack of resources,
 minority students, and qualified teachers usually impeded catechism courses in mi-
 nority faiths, and the Catholic catechism was the one predominately offered. Accord-
 ing to numerous reports, although not obligatory, students felt pressured to attend
 religious training.
 
 
 1209
 
 The Government continued to discriminate against Muslims in the issuance of
 citizenship documents. The Ministry of Interior frequently uses Article 26 of the
 Law on Citizenship to deny citizenship papers to persons otherwise qualified to be
 citizens (see Section 5). In January Muslims, Albanians, and Slovenes also were
 dropped as recognized national minorities from the Constitution's preamble on the
 grounds that they were not indigenous groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution generally provides for these rights, with certain re-
 strictions. All persons must register their residence with the local authorities. Under
 exceptional circumstances, the Government legally may restrict the right to enter
 or leave the country if necessary to protect the "legal order, health, rights, or free-
 doms of others."
 While there are no reports that the Government revoked citizenship for political
 reasons, the failure to act expeditiously to verify the citizenship of hundreds of thou-
 sands of ethnic Serbs who fled the country after the military actions in 1995 re-
 mained a cause for concern in the first half of the year. However, after 3 years in
 which only a small fraction of these essentially stateless persons were able to gain
 citizenship documents, the Government in May adopted procedures by which these
 individuals could confirm their citizenship and, if they so desired, return to Croatia.
 This very positive step was undercut somewhat by the Government's initial slow
 and uneven implementation of these procedures. However, by October the U.N.
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that the pace of approvals had
 increased and that some 3,000 individuals had been cleared. Similarly, the Joint
 Working Group (JWG) established in 1997 continued to work throughout the year
 on returning displaced persons in Eastern Slavonia to their homes elsewhere in Cro-
 atia but made no significant progress in resolving any of the outstanding "hard
 cases" (persons living in the former UNTAES region whose homes either were occu-
 pied or destroyed) remaining from the previous year. Muslims also found it difficult
 to confirnm their citizenship. There were several notable cases during the year of de-
 portation proceedings against male members of mixed marriages involving Muslims.
 A significant number of internally displaced persons remain, although not all of
 these persons are under the Government's direct care. While the Government re-
 ported some 100,000 persons (74,000 internally displaced and approximately 30,000
 refugees, mostly from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the FRY) with refugee or dis-
 placed person status as of December, this number does not reflect fully an addi-
 tional 140,000 former refugees who have become citizens of Croatia (not always of
 their own free will), nor does it include thousands of ethnic Serb displaced persons
 in the Danubian region whom the Government does not recognize.
 While estimates vary, international organizations generally agree that some
 47,000 ethnic Serbs left Croatia since 1996, with some 20,000 departing in 1998
 alone. While many left for economic reasons, most also reported that the level of
 harassment and discrimination and, most significantly, pressure put upon them by
 the imminent return of ethnic Croat owners of the homes to which they had been
 displaced in the former UNTAES region, led them to the conclusion that they had
 no future in Croatia. Ethnically motivated incidents included verbal and legal har-
 assment, forcible evictions, and beatings. The UNPSG, which monitors police behav-
 ior in the region, reported an average of 54 incidents per week in May. That number
 jumped to nearly 70 by July, with many more incidents going unreported.
 Official government policy is that all citizens are free to return to their homes of
 origin throughout the country. However, in practice ethnic Serbs who successfully
 repatriated aced open discrimination and numerous bureaucratic hurdles in order
 to regain their property and the financial and health benefits to which all returnees
 are entitled under the law. Incidents of beatings and even arson and bombing at-
 tacks against Serbs were reported, albeit less frequently than in previous years (see
 Sections l.a., 1.f., and 5). Many also reported discrimination in employment, and
 there were persistent but isolated reports that humanitarian assistance is not dis-
 tributed fairly by government agencies. The Government allows free access to all
 displaced persons by domestic and international humanitarian organizations and
 permits them to provide assistance.
 At year's end, the official estimate of displaced ethnic Serbs in Eastern Slavonia
 was approximately 5,000 to 6,000. The Government estimated in September that at
 least 100,000 ethnic Croats are still displaced from their homes throughout the
 country, having been driven out by rebel Serbs in 1991. Government figures claim-
 ing that as many 26,000 ethnic Croats have returned to their homes in the former
 UNTAES region cannot be verified by international observers. The Government
 housed displaced Croats and refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina in hotels along
 the coast and in collective centers around the country, as well as in private "aban-
 doned" homes of ethnic Serbs who fled during the military action.
 
 
 1210
 Freedom of movement was severely hampered by the occupation of homes belong-
 ing to Croatian citizens of Serb ethnicity by refugees from neighboring Bosnia and
 Herzegovina and the FRY, as well as "priority category" ethnic Croat citizens, i.e.,
 active duty or former members of the military, widows, and orphans. Ethnic Croats
 wishing to return to Eastern Slavonia were also unable to return to homes occupied
 by Serbs. Many Serb returnees were prevented from moving into looted and dev-
 astated homes that the Government defined as habitable. In all only a handful of
 ethnic Serb owners were able to repossess their occupied properties through the re-
 turn program mechanisms during the year.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the UNHCR and other humani-
 tarian organizations assisting refugees. The Government is a party to the 1951 U.N.
 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol although it has
 not yet passed legislation to implement these conventions. The Office for Displaced
 Persons and Refugees (ODPR) reports that the Government granted first asylum to
 30,000 persons from the various parts of the former Yugoslavia as of September and
 that it was supporting financially another 100,000 displaced persons (not counting
 displaced ethmc Serbs in the former UNTAES region). There were no reports of the
 forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Both the law and the ruling party's continued domination of Parliament seriously
 limit the right of citizens to change their government. All citizens over 18 years of
 age have the right to vote by secret ballot. The President, elected for 5 years, exer-
 cises substantial power, authority, and influence but is limited constitutionally to
 two terms. Parliament comprises the House -of Representatives and the House of
 Counties. The HDZ holds a majority in both houses, and HDZ President Franjo
 Tudjman was reelected President in June 1997 in an election judged to be "fun-
 damentally flawed" and "free but not fair" by the OSCE. The President's extensive
 powers, the HDZ's dominance, the Government's influence over the judiciary, and
 its control of the media combine to make the country's nominally democratic system
 in reality authoritarian. Opposition political parties and the press alleged that dur-
 ing the October 11 Dubrovnik County election, the HDZ won its only single-can-
 didate district seat, Metkovic, through vote fraud. They report that approximately
 30 busloads of Bosnian Croat voters arrived in town on election day and that a
 number of them were employees of the HDZ candidate's military supply company.
 The Government made no progress in addressing issues raised in an OSCE elec-
 tion report following the 1997 presidential elections, which prompted the OSCE's
 judgment that the presidential elections were flawed and unfair. The Government
 also failed to make any progress in implementing the recommendations of any pre-
 vious OSCE/COE reports documenting the flaws in the electoral system. Some flaws
 in the electoral legislation infringe directly on the rights of citizens to change their
 government. The most egregious is the method by which the Citizenship Law and
 electoral legislation grant citizenship, and thereby the franchise, based purely on
 ethnic grounds to ethnic Croats abroad with no genuine link to the country. The
 electoral system contains a provision allocating seats (10 percent of lower house
 seats) to diaspora voters, 90 percent of whom voted for the HDZ in the 1995 elec-
 tions, despite criticism from the OSCE. The HDZ, maintaining its clear parliamen-
 tary majority in 1998, did not take action to reverse or amend legislation that al-
 lowed for this and other flawed practices.
 On October 9 the Constitutional Court ruled to permit the monitoring of future
 elections by domestic nonpartisan observers. The Court ruled in favor of an appeal
 by the Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights and the Citizens' Initiative
 to Monitor Elections. Both had been refused access to polling stations by the State
 Electoral Commission.
 In addition to the liberal interpretation and implementation of laws to suit the
 Government's agenda, the Government used its control of the electronic media to
 control the political process. It failed to take any measures to address concerns
 noted by the OSCE in its postelection report about government and party control
 of the media. Senior HDZ members sit on the hoard of directors of the state tele-
 vision network, the only nationwide television station, and their influence not only
 restricted the ability of opposition parties to criticize government policies and activi-
 ties, but limited the opposition's ability to fully engage the Government and the
 public in an open political dialog (see Section 2.a.). At its Fourth Party Congress
 in February, the HDZ elected several prominent journalists to leading party func-
 tions.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on participation by women or minorities
 in the political process, they are represented in only small numbers in Parliament,
 
 
 1211
 the executive branch, and the courts. In the 195-member Parliament, 14 women
 hold seats.
 Election law requires minority representation in Parliament, with proportional
 representation for any minority that makes up more than 8 percent of the popu-
 lation. Currently, no minority meets that criterion. However, representation for Cro-
 atia's Serb minority is based on government estimates of the number of Serbs who
 fled Croatia between 1991 and 1995 and the assumption that they would not return.
 There are still three Serb M.P.'s in the lower house; in 1997 Tudiman appointed two
 Serbs to the upper house as well. There were no Muslim representatives in Par-
 liament, despite the fact that the Muslim minority is the next largest after the
 Serbs. Amendments to the Constitution passed by the HDZ-dominated Parliament
 in DRecember 1997 were adopted in January. The amendments excluded Muslims as
 a recognized minority and ensured discrimination in the application of minority rep-
 resentational and voting rights (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups throughout the country worked to prevent human rights
 abuses and brought their concerns to the attention of local and national authorities,
 as well as to that of domestic and international media. The government-appointed
 Ombudsman met most frequently with human rights representatives; the response
 of other ministries varied. In general most groups reported that, while they may re-
 ceive a response in a specific case, the Government generally failed to remedy the
 underlying institutional problems that were the root cause of many of the problems.
 For example, numerous NGO's repeatedly raised the issue of the government's fail-
 ure to issue instructions to ministries and local authorities to implement the Law
 on Convalidaon n (konvalidacjia) adopted in October 1997 (which would allow docu-
 ments issued in the formerly occupied areas to be recognized or "convalidated" by
 government offices). Despite numerous promises from the central Government and
 a steady stream of complaints from local NGO's and international organizations, the
 Government failed to address fully this issue until September, leaving thousands of
 citizens unable to validate pensions, register marriages, births, deaths, etc. (see Sec-
 tion 5).
 The Government exercised its prerogative to shut down an NGO under the Law
 on Associations adopted in 1997 for the first time in the spring. A leading NGO pro-
 moting women's rights came under vehement attack in the progovernment press
 (which criticized it as an "anti-Croat organization") after its organizers criticized
 government policies on women's issues during a televised debate.
 Under the law, it is difficult for NGO's to solicit contributions or donations to sup-
 port their work. This is due in part to the fact that there is no tax benefit to the
 potential donor, who pays tax on the donation; the NGO also must pay tax on con-
 tributions received if it can be classified as income. Thus, many human rights
 groups rely solely on international donations in order to continue their work. In Oc-
 tober the Government established an office for cooperation with NGO's to improve
 the legal framework for their operation. It instituted a more transparent system for
 financing NGO operations by undertaking a competitive tender process for their
 funding from the state budget. Another significant problem is the public perception
 of human rights organizations. Senior government officials promote the view that
 any criticism of the state or the ruling party is disloyal, engendering suspicion of
 NGO's among the general population.
 International organizations, including the European Community Monitoring Mis-
 sion (ECMM), the OSCE, and the UNHCR among others, operated freely in Croatia,
 and there were no reported instances of monitors being denied visas or the ability
 to move freely around the country. While international organizations reported an
 overall satisfactory level of cooperation with officials in Zagreb, they also identified
 a notable lack of follow-through on central government commitments by local au-
 thorities. For example, despite repeated assurances from senior government officials
 that defendants on the list of 25 individuals convicted in absentia for war crimes
 could await their retrial in freedom, in August police in Osijek arrested 3 persons
 from that list. While those arrested were released in response to international criti-
 cism, this was viewed as yet another blow to the confidence of local Serbs, who re-
 peatedly pointed out their fear of prosecution for war crimes despite the general am-
 nesty as one the leading constraints on refugee return (see Section 1.d.). The U.N.
 police Support Group (UNPSG) operated freely in the former UNTAES region until
 October, monitoring the performance of the multiethnic police force in the region.
 In October its task was transferred to the OSCE. While cooperation was satisfactory
 overall, there were several incidents in which local police refused international mon-
 itors' requests to review or fully investigate cases. For example, the Government re-
 
 
 1212
 fused a U.N. Civilian Police monitors' (UNCIVPOL) request to review a murder in-
 vestigation of a young Serb who had been reported missing and later was found
 dead with gunshot and stab wounds. As with local NGO's, the Government gen-
 erally failed to respond substantively to international NGO reports of human rights
 abuses and tended to treat any specific case brought to its attention as an isolated
 incident.
 Although the Government in general cooperated with international monitoring or-
 ganizations, throughout the spring and summer many organizations and NGO's
 ound themselves the target of a barrage of criticism in the state-controlled press
 claiming (variously) that international organizations were: Pro-Serb, anti-Croat, vio-
 lating Croatian sovereignty, or planning to send Bosnian Croats abroad for resettle-
 ment. Hard-line government officials, both in Zagreb and at the local level, fueled
 this negative attitude toward international organizations and NGO's with unhelpful
 statements calling for the Government to react strongly to what was viewed as inap-
 propriate meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. The head of the Su-
 preme Court in May issued instructions to all members of the lower courts that they
 were to have no contact with members of the international community. This lack
 of access to the judiciary, coupled with the hostility and suspicion fueled by the
 statements in the press, made monitoring more difficult in some areas. In Knin a
 local human rights worker was beaten in the early summer and there were reports
 that local staff at some international organizations had been threatened.
 The government-appointed Ombudsman worked constructively throughout the
 year to address cases brought to his attention by the international NGO community
 and local NGO's. However, the office remained weak, due to the small size of its
 staff and the Ombudsman's lack of legal authority to rectify problems directly. This
 left the office as little more than a forum. Despite this situation, the Ombudsman
 continued to present reports to the Parliament on issues of concern and played a
 helpful role in the analysis of legislation deemed to be detrimental to human rights
 causes. In several cases, he lodged complaints with the Constitutional Court to have
 such legislation amended or abolished. The Ombudsman's office raised workers'
 rights cases, including the issue of unpaid salaries and wrongful dismissal (see Sec-
 tion 6.b.). While the Government was perhaps somewhat more responsive to the
 Ombudsman than to NGO's, the overall response by the Government to the underly-
 ing problems raised by the Ombudsman remained unsatisfactory.
 Committees in the Parliament and in the Government are specifically tasked with
 human and minority rights issues. The Government committee, despite agreeing to
 meet with a leading human rights NGO to exchange views and information on a
 monthly basis, did not carry out this pledge. Neither body played an active role in
 promoting human rights during the year.
 The Government's record of cooperation with the ICTY was poor during the year,
 despite the voluntary surrender of 10 Bosnian Croats in 1997. The Government also
 vigorously pursued through the courts its efforts to avoid compliance with ICTY re-
 quests for information that would assist in the prosecution of ethnic Croats; nor did
 it provide any significant information on events that occurred in Croatia during the
 military operations "Flash" and "Storm" in 1995, denying the Tribunal's authority
 to investigate these events. In several cases the Government failed to take adequate
 steps to protect witnesses (especially ethnic Croats) of interest to the Tribunal, sev-
 eral of whom found themselves harassed by local inhabitants and even officials and
 in one case the subject of a bombing attack. At least four such individuals are
 known to have fled the country.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution specifies that citizens shall enjoy all rights and freedoms, re-
 gardless of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or
 social origin, property, birth, education, social status, or other attributes. It adds
 that members of all national groups and minorities shall have equal rights. While
 the majority of these rights are observed in practice, serious deficiencies continued
 with regard to equality among various national/racial/ethnic groups. Early in the
 year, the Government deleted Muslims, Albanians, and Slovenes from the list of mi-
 nority groups recognized by the Constitution, which raised the prospect of the insti-
 tutionalization of some of these problems. The Constitution provides for special
 "wartime measures" in case of need, but states that restrictions shall be appropriate
 to the nature of the danger and may not result in the inequality of citizenship with
 respect to race, color, sex, language, religion, or national or social origin.
 Women.-Although the Government collects only limited statistics on the problem,
 informed observers believe that violence against women, including spousal abuse, is
 common. One women's NGO cited police statistics to the effect that violent incidents
 
 
 1213
 
 against women rose more than 11 percent in 1997 and noted that this trend had
 not changed in 1998. Alcohol abuse is cited commonly as a contributing factor.
 A  leading NGO    promoting women's rights came under attack        in  the
 progovermnent press (which criticized it as an "anti-Croat organization") after its
 organizers criticized government policies on women's issues during a televised de-
 bate (see Section 4).
 In another negative development, amendments to the Penal Code went into effect
 on January 1 that removed violence perpetrated within the family (except against
 children) from the categories of crimes to be prosecuted automatically by the state
 attorney. The victim now must file the request, thereby severely curtailing efforts
 by health care workers and police to act on suspected cases of violence in the home.
 However, positive changes also occurred in that spousal rape now is acknowledged
 in the law as a crime. The law does not specifically prohibit sexual harassment.
 The law does not discriminate by gender. However, in practice women generally
 hold lower paying positions in the work force. However, considerable anecdotal evi-
 dence suggests that women hold by far the preponderance of low-level clerical and
 shopkeeping positions, as well as primary and secondary school teaching jobs.
 Women are often among the first to be fired or laid off.
 While there is no national organization devoted solely to the protection of women's
 rights, many small, independent groups were active in the capital and larger cities.
 One of the most active was B.a.B.e. ("Be Active, Be Emancipated"). This group held
 public discussions with political party representatives, in which it debated con-
 troversial topics of interest to women.
 In 1997 the Government adopted a policy for equality promotion that outlined an
 ambitious program aimed at improving the status of women in all spheres of society.
 Government statistics show that, while women constitute roughly 50 percent of the
 work force, they occupy few jobs at senior levels, even in areas such as education
 and administration where they are a clear majority of the workers. The Government
 sponsored conferences and information campaigns throughout the year to raise pub-
 lic awareness of women's issues.
 Children.-The Government is strongly committed to the welfare of children. Edu-
 cation is mandatory through age 14. Schools provide free meals for children, daycare
 facilities are available in most communities even for infants, medical care for chil-
 dren is free, and the Labor Code authorizes a full year of maternity leave and 3
 years' leave for women with twins or more than two children.
 The majority of students continue their education to the age of 18, with Roma
 being the only group reporting any notable exclusion. The Government blamed the
 problems of Roma largely on linguistic and cultural differences that make their inte-
 gration in schools difficult. Romani children face some discrimination and problems,
 due largely to these cultural and linguistic barriers at school. The Government's
 commitments to children suffered from less funding than in the past, as priorities
 such as reconstruction and economic development took a larger portion of govern-
 ment resources.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children. While comprehensive data are
 difficult to find, the State Institute for Statistics and Social Welfare Services noted
 a decline in the volume of reported child abuse during the year.
 People With Disabilities.-No legislation mandates access to buildings or govern-
 ment services for people with disabilities, and access to such facilities is often dif-
 ficult. While people with disabilities face no openly discriminatory measures, job op-
 portunities generally are limited. Special education also is limited and poorly fund-
 ed.
 Religious Minorities.-Religion as a reflection of ethnicity was frequently used to
 identify non-Croats and as another way of singling them out for discriminatory prac-
 tices. This close identification of religion with ethnicity caused religious institutions
 to be targets of violence. In Beli Manistir, an Orthodox cross was the target of a
 bomb in early July, and churches of both Catholic and Orthodox denominations
 came under attack by vandals in the Danubian region. A leading human rights or-
 ganization also documented incidents throughout the country of the damage and de-
 facement of Serbian Orthodox tombstones and graveyards but in much smaller num-
 bers than in previous years.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Constitutionally, ethnic minorities enjoy the
 same protection as other self-identified ethnic and religious groups. However, in
 practice a pattern of often open and severe discrimination continues against ethnic
 Serbs and, at times, other minorities in a wide number of areas, including the ad-
 ministration of justice, employment, housing, and freedom of movement The Gov-
 ernment often maintained a double standard of treatment based on ethnicity. Mem-
 bers of minority groups in principle have equal constitutional protections with Croat
 citizens, and their ethnic rights are provided for in the preamble to the Constitution.
 
 
 1214
 However, the Government's definition of what constitutes a minority group is dis-
 criminatory. Early in the year, the Parliament decided to omit Muslims, Albanians,
 and Slovenes from those minorities listed in the Constitution on the grounds that
 they are not considered indigenous groups. Muslims are currently the second largest
 minority group in the country after Serbs, and their elimination from the Constitu-
 tion effectively denies them rights stipulated in the (albeit partially suspended) Con-
 stitutional Law on the Rights of Ethnic and National Communities or Minorities.
 In a potentially positive step in January, a Council on National Minorities was es-
 tablished as an independent body for the expression of minorities' views on govern-
 ment proposals and recommendations concerning minority issues.. However, the
 Council was not active in practice.
 The Constitution provides the legal basis and rights for education in the lan-
 guages of national minorities and communities. The well-documented pattern of the
 discriminatory application of laws and administrative regulations was also evident
 in education. For example, in textbooks the history of the former Yugoslavia was
 omitted in favor of a more nationalistic Croat interpretation, and new textbooks
 tend to use derogatory adjectives in reference to minorities. In addition, apart from
 the Danubian region, there are still very few classes for Serb pupils that follow the
 approved Serbian school program. Serb students countrywide continued to use mate-
 rials and follow the curriculum of the Croat students, and the provision of Serb lan-
 guage textbooks in the Danubian region, previously agreed to by the Ministry of
 Education, remained problematical thoughout the year. In the fall, Croatian re-
 turnee parents in Beli Manastir pulled their children out of school and succeeded
 in forcing the dismissal of several ethnic Serb teachers.
 The Law on Citizenship distinguishes between those who-have.a claim to Croatian
 ethnicity and those who do not. The "Croatian people" are eligible to become citizens
 of Croatia, even if they were not citizens of the-former Socialist Republic of Croatia,
 as long as they submit a written statement that they consider themselves Croatian
 citizens. Others must satisfy more stringent requirements through naturalization in
 order to obtain citizenship, even if they were previously lawful residents of Croatia
 as citizens of the former Yugoslavia (see Section 1.d.). This double- standard in
 granting citizenship led to discrimination in other areas, in particular the right to
 vote (see Section 3). While an application is pending, the applicant is denied rights
 such as social allowances, including medical care, pensions, free education, and em-
 ployment in the civil service. Denials were frequently based.oniArticle 26 of the Citi-
 zenship Law (which stipulates that citizenship can be denied to persons otherwise
 qualified for reasons of national interest) and Article 8 (which requires that a per-
 son's actions demonstrate that they are "attached to the legal system and customs
 of Croatia" and that -they have maintained a permanent residence, on the territory
 of Croatia for the 5 years- preceding the application for citizenship). The citizenship
 status of many Muslims in the area around Slunj continues to be unresolved, with
 several hundred cases still in the courts, and in some -cases entire villages remain
 stateless.
 To obtain citizenship by naturalization, Serbs and other minorities must deal with
 economic as Well as administrative disparities. The Law on Administrative Fees
 specifies different treatment, based on national origin, for persons who receive citi-
 zenship by naturalization, i.e., citizens who are members of the Croatian nation are
 exempt from the tax, whereas. citizens who are non-Croats must pay the tax, ap-
 proximately $250 (1,500 kuna). Minorities also suffer other types of economic dis-
 crimination. Unemployment among Serbs continues to be significantly higher than
 the national average, and a disproportionate number of layoffs and firings involve
 ethnic Serbs (see Section 6.b.). The Slavonska Banka discriminated against Serbs.
 The state-controlled bank, under the direction of former Osijek-Baranja county gov-
 ernor Branimir Glavas, pursued aggressively the prewar debts of Serbs and put
 liens on their property for nonpayment. Interest and penalties often exceeded the
 amount of the original loans- More than 200 Serbs (but no Croats) complained to
 the OSCE about the bank's practices.
 Committees established in 1997 to promote reconciliation between Croats and
 Serbs failed to initiate and carry out, concrete programs that would contribute sig-
 nificantly to the peaceful reintegration of populations. Throughout the year, a right-
 wing political -party, the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), mounted an aggressive
 campaign to mobilize public opinion against the return of Serbs. In February this
 party held a rally in Bel Manistir that incited anti-Serb violence and caused gen-
 eral chaos in the surrounding area. The police response to this very public incident
 was swift,-and 40 arrests were made for disturbing the peace.
 SProperty destruction and other forms of harassment usually arose from disputes
 between home occupiers of one ethnicity and returning homeowners of another. Eth-
 nically motivated incidents included verbal and legal harassment, forcible evictions,
 
 
 1215
 and beatings (see Section 2.d.). Reports of arson increased significantly in former
 Sector North early in the year, and the summer months saw a rise in the number
 of incidents in the formerly occupied areas overall, albeit at a lower level than in
 previous years. For example, during the summer, houses belonging to ethnic Serbs
 were destroyed in Benkovac. In another example in Western Slavonia in June, two
 grenades were thrown into the yard of returnees in a village near Okucani. The
 bombings were preceded by weeks of verbal abuse by Bosnian Croat neighbors and
 a fairly serious physical assault. The police made no arrests in these cases, leading
 to a perception in these areas that local officials have stopped responding to claims
 made by Serbs and, in some areas, tacitly condone such behavior. According to the
 OSCE monitoring mission, reports of the harassment of ethnic Serbs in Eastern
 Slavonia continue to be numerous and incidents have become increasingly violent
 (although mostly aimed at intimidation rather than injury). In the fall, incidents of
 grenade-throwing occurred several times per month. In cases throughout the coun-
 try, regardless of ethnicity, incidents of looting by the person occupying a home
 upon his or her departure were common.
 While there was an overall decrease in physical assaults countrywide, harassment
 in the form of intimidation and forced evictions increased sharply in the Danubian
 region. The UNPSG and the OSCE reported that police in the region responded to
 complaints made by Serbs, but those responses were often inadequate due to con-
 flicting government instructions on how to handle disputes over housing. The bias
 of some local government officials and the inability of police to rectify the problems
 underlying the constant harassment left many incidents unreported, as Serbs sim-
 ply chose to relocate abroad.
 Despite the adoption in October 1997 of legislation that would allow the recogni-
 tion of legal and administrative documents issued by the rebel Serb para-state, this
 legislation was not put into practice because several ministries failed to adopt im-
 plementing instructions. For example, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (the
 ministry governing pensions and other social benefits) adopted regulations only in
 September, despite the legal deadline of April 1999 for the convalidation of all docu-
 ments. Without the convalidation conferred by the law, citizens (almost exclusively
 ethnic Serbs) were unable to resolve a wide range of problems including pensions,
 disability insurance, unemployment benefits, the recognition of births, deaths, and
 marriages, and even confirmation of time served in prison. This made resumption
 of a normal life almost impossible for this group (see Section 4). Serb property own-
 ers displaced by the law on the temporary takeover of specified property in favor
 of ethnic Croat refugees remained unable to access their property for much of the
 year. By year's end, despite the adoption in July of the program for return, which
 included multiethnic bodies to implement property restitution, a lack of alternative
 housing in many areas and political will to evict ethnic Croat refugees in favor of
 Serb owners resulted in only a handful of successfully restored properties outside
 of Eastern Slavonia (see Section 1.f1). However, Croat homeowners in the former
 UNTAES region had much less difficulty in achieving repossession of their property,
 since international monitors reported that most housing commissions in the region
 were active in revoking temporary occupancy, immediately issuing eviction orders,
 and offering the Serb displaced persons accommodation in collective centers.
 The situation of other minority groups--Slovaks, Czechs, Italians and Hungar-
 ians-did not reflect significant discrimination to the same extent as that of the
 Serb community. Roma continued to face societal discrimination and official inaction
 when complaints were filed. However, public awareness of the difficulties that Roma
 face in society was raised by several public forums, including roundtable and panel
 discussions with government and civic leaders.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers are entitled to form or join unions of
 their own choosing without prior authorization. There is an increasingly active labor
 movement with three major and three minor national labor federations and inde-
 pendent associations of both blue- and white-collar members. Approximately 70 per-
 cent of workers are members of unions of one type or another. In general unions
 are independent of the government and political parties.
 The law prohibits retaliation against strikers participating in legal strikes. How-
 ever, this came into question during a 1-day teachers' strike in May, when the Min-
 ister of Education ordered principals to get signed statements from all teachers indi-
 cating whether or not they were union members. However, the order was withdrawn
 in the face of union protests. Workers only may strike at the end of a contract or
 in specific circumstances mentioned in the contract. Most importantly, the Supreme
 Court ruled that workers may not strike for nonpayment of wages, an increasingly
 
 
 1216
 serious problem that affects over 100,000 workers. The only recourse in the event
 of nonpayment is to go to court-a process that may take several years.
 When negotiating a new contract, workers are required to go through mediation
 before they can strike. Labor and management choose the mediator together. If they
 cannot agree, the Labor Law calls for a tripartite commission of labor, business, and
 government representatives to appoint one. However, nearly 3 years after this law
 became effective, the tripartite commission had not established the required list of
 mediators, and union requests for their' appointment went unanswered. Arbitration
 is never mandatory but can be used only if both sides agree. Only after submitting
 to mediation and formally filing a statement that negotiations are at an impasse
 is a strike legal. If a strike is found to be illegal, any participant can be dismissed,
 and the union held liable for damages.
 The right to strike is provided for in the Constitution with these limitations and
 with additional limits on members of the armed forces, police, government adminis-
 tration, and public services. During the first half of the year, strikes occurred fairly
 frequently and increasingly without government sanction. Central and city authori-
 ties continued to refuse to permit demonstrations in Zagreb's main square or the
 square in front of Parliament. A major protest was held in late January, when be-
 tween 4,000 to 5,000 members of the Autonomous Trade Union (UATUC) attempted
 to march on Parliament, protesting "labor and social failures" by the Government
 in 1997. An even larger protest occurred in February, When some 12,000 to 15,000
 demonstrators converged on Zagreb's main square, also to protest poor social condi-
 tions and-low wages. In both instances, police barricaded all entrances to the dem-
 onstrators' destinations (see Section 2.b.), ostensibly to maintain public order. In the
 February demonstration, some 5,000 police closed the city center for over 6 hours,
 and several policemen and demonstrators were injured in what was viewed largely
 as a repressive tactic to deny unionists the right to express their views.
 As the unions were unable to agree in 1997 on the distribution of Communist-
 era union property, in January the Government confiscated it, as Parliament
 warned that it would. The unions appealed to the International Labor Organization
 (ILO); a decision is pending. The ILO ruled against the Government in the case of
 the railroad strike in 1997, during which the Government unilaterally declared 90
 percent of all rail traffic essential, then deemed the strike illegal and dismissed
 workers when service fell below that level. The ILO decision stated that the Govern-
 ment must alter its law on railroads to establish what level of operation was "essen-
 tial" in cooperation with the unions, rather than in an arbitrary determination by
 the Ministry of Transportation. The Supreme Court later issued a similar ruling.
 Unions may affiliate freely internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected by law and practiced freely. The Labor Code governs collective bargaining
 contracts, protection for striking workers, and legal limitations on the ability of em-
 ployers to conduct "lockouts" during labor disputes.
 The transition to private enterprise and a free market economy kept labor unions
 under pressure at the same time that they were making progress towards establish-
 ing themselves as genuine trade 'unions, representative of their members rather
 than the government. General unemployment remained the most significant hurdle,
 starting at approximately 16 percent for most of the year. However, in some war-
 affected areas the figure was as high as 80 to 90 percent. Over 100,000 workers fail
 to receive their salaries on time: Also, when salary payments are not made, pay-
 ments into the social welfare system lag as well, thereby denying workers health
 coverage. In July the ILO declared these failures to provide health insurance a vio-
 lation of Convention 102.
 The Labor Code directly deals with antiunion discrimination issues. It expressly
 allows unions to challenge firings in court. However, according to persistent reports,
 ethnicity was used as grounds for dismissal. For example, in the Danubian region,
 international organizations and NGO's reported that-ethnic Serbs were being offered
 less favorable contracts of a shorter duration than returning ethnic Croat displaced
 persons. Company and local officials still have not addressed firms' refusal to close
 or validate the work books of ethnic Serb employees who remained in the occupied
 areas during the war, thus disadvantaging them in pensions and health care bene-
 fits for the time in question (see Section 5). 'An individuars ability to rectify his
 grievance is severely limited by the already overburdened court system, where cases
 languish for months or years before they are resolved (see Section 1.d.). The Govern-
 ment occasionally employs coercion or other questionable methods to induce striking
 employees to return to work. For example, wher! teachers began a strike in June,
 the Government unilaterally pronounced the end of the school year a week early
 rather than meet the strikers' demands. Further; the minority of teachers who did
 
 
 1217
 
 not participate in the walkout were rewarded with the promise of a $300 (2,000
 kuna) bonus, equivalent to 3 weeks' salary.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there were no documented instances of it. While legislation
 does not explicitly cover children, the constitutional ban provides blanket coverage
 in this area, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively. The Ministry
 of Labor and Social Welfare is the agency charged with enforcing the ban on coerced
 or forced labor.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age for the employment of children is 15 years, and it is enforced by the Min-
 istry of Labor and Social Welfare. Under the Constitution, the provisions of which
 the Government enforces, children may not be employed before reaching the legally
 determined age, may not perform forced or bonded labor (see Section 6.c.), an are
 not allowed to perform work that is harmful to their health or morality. There is
 no known pattern of abuse of child labor. Workers under the age of 18 are entitled
 to special protection at work and are prohibited from heavy manual labor and night
 shifts. Education is free, universal, and mandatory up to the age of 14. Children
 generally finish secondary school at a minimum, and a high proportion go on to uni-
 versity.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In March the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Welfare signed a collective agreement establishing a minimum wage of $220 (1,370
 kuna) per month. While the initial document was signed on behalf of only a portion
 of the work force, the Minister extended the agreement to cover all full-time workers
 nationwide. The Government Bureau of Statistics estimated that the average net
 monthly wage was approximately $410 (2,626 kuna), which is not sufficient to pro-
 vide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 National regulations provide for a 42-hour workweek including a 2-hour daily
 break, a 24-hour rest period during the week, and a minimum of 18 days of paid
 vacation leave annually. Workers receive time-and-a-half pay for any hours worked
 beyond 42.
 Health and safety standards are set by the government and are enforced by the
 Ministry of Health. In practice industries are not diligent in meeting standards for
 worker protection. It is common, for example, to find workers without hard hats at
 construction sites and equipment with safety devices removed. Workers can in the-
 ory remove themselves from hazardous conditions at work. Workers would have re-
 course to the courts in a situation where they felt that they had been wrongfully
 dismissed for doing so.
