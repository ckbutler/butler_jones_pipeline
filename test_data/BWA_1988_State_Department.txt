 BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a multiparty democracy. Under the Constitution,
 executive power is vested in the President, currently Quett K.
 J. Masire, who was elected in 1984. The President selects the
 Cabinet from the unicameral National Assembly. While there
 are several political parties in Botswana, one party continues
 to dominate the country's politics: the Botswana Democratic
 Party (BDP), which has held a majority in the National
 Assembly since independence in 1966 and currently controls 28
 of the 34 elective seats. All citizens,.including whites who
 accepted Botswana citizenship, are free to participate fully
 in economic and political life.
 Botswana has a small defense force of 4,300 soldiers and a
 police force, numbering about 2,900. Both are subordinate to
 civilian authority. While adequate for internal security
 purposes, the army is not able to prevent incursions by the
 South African Defense Forces (SADF) against suspected ANC
 (African National Congress) targets in Botswana.
 Botswana has a mixed economy and strongly encourages private
 enterprise and free trade. Botswana's real gross domestic
 product has averaged an annual 11 percent increase since 1979,
 fueled by development of the country's mineral resources.
 Annual per capita gross domestic product increased from $69 in
 1966 to an estimated $1,500 in 1988. Almost 75 percent of the
 population continues to live in rural areas and is partially
 dependent for livelihood on subsistence farming and animal
 husbandry.
 Botswana's human rights record generally is very good.
 Citizens receive equal protection under the law; domestic
 political violence is rare; and public debate, including that
 in the press, is lively. Pressure from South Africa in 1988
 continued to increase tensions between the two countries. An
 SADF raid in March resulted in the deaths of .three Botswana
 citizens and one South African refugee. An aborted South
 African operation in June resulted in the arrest of two South
 African commandos and several South Africans living in
 Botswana, all of whom were charged with treason. These were
 the first arrests under the 1986 National Security Act.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of government involvement in political
 killings. However, on several occasions since 1985, South
 African security forces have engaged in politically motivated
 killings in Botswana. The March attack on a house in Gaborone
 that allegedly sheltered ANC members resulted in the deaths of
 four people, three of whom were citizens of Botswana.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 in 1988.
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There have been reports and allegations of improper treatment
 by the police of persons in custody. Lawyers and others have
 stated that the police routinely beat up arrestees, but they
 also have indicated that the number of such illegal incidents
 is decreasing due to increased public and governmental
 awareness of the law. Systematic abuses are not officially
 condoned, and officials have been punished.
 Flogging is permitted for infractions of prison rules and is
 mandatory punishment for rape, attempted rape, armed robbery,
 burglary, and related offenses. Traditional tribal courts
 presided over by a chief, where jurisdiction is limited to
 minor offenses, may also sentence persons to be flogged.
 Currently, only men can be flogged, although the punishment
 has been proposed for women as well.
 Prison conditions allow for adequate diet, health care, and
 visits from family members.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.
 The Constitution contains a provision protecting citizens from
 arbitrary arrest. This provision still applies despite the
 passage of the 1986 National Security Act, which inter alia
 allows the Government to hold persons suspected of treason for
 an indefinite period. Preventive detention is illegal, and
 prisoners have a right to have the legality of their detention
 determined by-a magistrate. Police are required to bring a
 suspect before a magistrate to be charged within 48 hours of
 arrest. There is a functioning system of bail, and defendants
 have access to lawyers of their own choosing. There are no
 public defenders in Botswana, although some attorneys are
 willing to take certain cases pro bono. In security cases not
 covered under the 1986 Act, the suspect must be arraigned
 within 96 hours of arrest. In nonsecurity cases, suspects
 must be released after 48 hours unless the magistrate issues a
 warrant of detention, which is valid for 14 days. Every 14
 days the police must appear before the magistrate to show that
 they are making progress in the case. To date there have been
 no known abuses of this system.
 The Constitution allows the President to declare a person a
 prohibited immigrant and deport him from the country. No
 explanation is required nor is any normally given, and the
 order is not subject to judicial review. A prohibited
 immigrant can reenter Botswana only with the permission of the
 President or his designated representative. In the past, this
 authority has rarely been used, but in 1988 several South
 African refugees were declared prohibited immigrants, possibly
 due to South African Government pressures. Botswana is not a
 signatory to the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations
 and does not promptly or automatically notify embassies when
 foreign citizens are detained or arrested.
 with regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.
 The right to a fair public trial is provided by law and
 honored in practice; trials involving national security,
 however, may be closed to the public. Defendants are entitled
 to counsel, and consultation between defendants and counsel
 
 
 21
 BOTSWANA
 may be held in private. There are clearly defined appeal
 procedures. The judiciary is independent of the executive and
 the legislature and consists of a High Court (which is the
 trial court with general civil and criminal jurisdiction),
 Court of Appeals, local magistrate courts, and the customary
 courts. The High Court has ruled that the right against
 self-incrimination exists in the courts (silence cannot be
 construed as guilt). While the burden of proving guilt is on
 the prosecution in ordinary criminal cases, certain broadly
 worded provisions of the National Security Act of 1986 appear
 to shift the burden to the accused to establish his innocence
 in security cases. It is not clear how the Act might be
 construed in practice, however; in the one case where charges
 were brought under the Act, the High Court judge dismissed
 them.
 Botswana created a customary court of appeal in 1986,
 permitting cases tried in the traditional court system (which
 exists alongside the magistrate courts) the right to appeal
 judgments in familial and property cases. Since the court
 began operation, several hundred cases have been appealed.
 There are no political prisoners in Botswana. However, two
 South African commandos and several south Africans living in
 Botswana were arrested under the National Security Act in
 June, following an aborted South African commando operation,
 and charged with treason. The Government has followed
 established judicial procedures in handling their cases, e.g.,
 open hearings. The trial began in October in the High Court
 at Francistown and resulted in sentences of 10 years in prison
 and eight strokes with the cane for causing grievous
 injuries. The national security charges were dropped.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 These rights are safeguarded by law and respected in
 practice. A search warrant issued by a magistrate is required
 for an official to enter a private residence, except in cases
 of suspected diamond theft, drug trafficking, or national
 security matters. There were no reported instances in which
 this authority was used for diamond or drug-related cases in
 1988. The Government did not state whether the new National
 Security Act powers to search without warrant were used in
 several of the cases arising from the South African commando
 operation in June.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press are provided for by the
 Constitution and are respected in practice. People speak
 freely both in public and in private, and debate is open in
 the National Assembly. The government-owned newspaper and
 radio continue to report statements by all opposition
 parties. Three independent weekly newspapers publish articles
 on a wider range of views than the government-owned media.
 However, they exercise some self-censorship, particularly on
 matters concerning the military and national security issues.
 Academic freedom is respected.

 BOTSWANA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is a well-established tradition in
 Botswana, as exemplified by the Kgotla, a communal gathering
 conducted similarly to a New England town meeting, in which
 citizens freely question leaders and voice opinions on local
 politics. Kgotla meetings are regularly used by political
 candidates and Members of Parliament, including ministers, to
 explain their programs. Large gatherings of people require
 local police approval, which is routinely given. Group
 demonstrations are permitted as long as order is maintained,
 but organizers of such demonstrations must submit a detailed
 plan in advance and are held personally responsible for
 ensuring the plan is followed.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The open practice of religion is permitted and encouraged.
 There is no state religion. While most residents identify
 themselves with Christian denominations, active groups of
 Hindus, Muslims, Baha'is, and others practice their faiths
 freely. Religious affiliation is neither an advantage nor a
 disadvantage politically or socially. Religious conversion is
 permitted, and missionaries are allowed to enter the country
 and proselytize. Foreign clergy are also permitted to enter
 Botswana and serve expatriate congregations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Botswana citizens are subject to virtually no restrictions on
 emigration or repatriation. Domestic and foreign travel is
 unrestricted, and passports are easily obtained. Refugees
 documented by the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) are generally required to live in the
 settlement at Dukwe in northern Botswana where conditions are
 relatively good. Refugees may be authorized to live elsewhere
 for documented reasons such as employment and schooling but
 are not permitted to accept jobs which could be filled by
 local citizens. Due to allegations from some neighboring
 countries that refugees are using Botswana as a sanctuary in
 which to pursue activities against their respective home
 countries, Botswana has declared that Dukwe residents found
 outside the settlement without permission will be considered
 to have abandoned refugee status and will be repatriated as a
 deterrent to prohibited activities by other refugees.
 Since a visit to the Dukwe settlement by Joshua Nkomo in May,
 pursuant to the unity agreement between the two main political
 parties in Zimbabwe, many of the almost 4,000 Zimbabwean
 refugees have been voluntarily repatriated from Dukwe without
 incident. The status of the remaining refugees is unclear at
 this time. Many of those who remain have lived in Botswana
 for more than 10 years and may apply for Botswana citizenship.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Botswana is ruled by a government freely elected every 5
 years. In the 1984 national election to the National Assembly
 (the fifth since Botswana became independent), an estimated 70
 percent of the eligible voters registered, and 86 percent of
 
 
 23
 BOTSWANA
 the registered voters cast their ballots. In 1986 and 1987
 Botswana held important byelections in which opposition party
 candidates won considerable majorities despite hard-fought
 campaigns by the country's ruling party.
 There are five registered political parties in Botswana, three
 of which are represented in the country's National Assembly.
 Opposition parties are particularly strong in the urban areas,
 including Gaborone, Francistown, and Jwaneng. However, the
 Botswana Democratic Party continues to dominate the country's
 politics, having held a substantial majority in the National
 Assembly since independence in 1966.
 The political rights of women and minority groups are
 generally observed. There are two female Members of
 Parliament: the Minister of External Affairs, and the
 Executive Secretary of the majority party. Several members of
 minority ethnic groups are also represented in the National
 Assembly; the speaker of the National Assembly is white, and
 several cabinet ministers are from small minority ethnic
 groups.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Botswana's Department of Labor has consistently responded
 promptly and forthrightly to inquiries on the human rights
 situation in Botswana. The Government usually refrains from
 public comment on alleged human rights violations in
 neighboring countries, but consistently condemns apartheid and
 strongly advocates positive socioeconomic development in South
 Africa. There are no groups in Botswana whose primary purpose
 is to monitor human rights developments. Botswana cooperates
 with international agencies concerned with human rights, most
 notably the UNHCR, which maintains offices in Botswana. The
 African Association on Human and Peoples' Rights in
 Development is based in Botswana, and a local chapter has been
 set up to monitor human rights in Botswana.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Ethnic differences exist in Botswana, though they play a
 marginal role in the country's politics. Ninety-five percent
 of the population is made up of Tswana who are divided into 8
 subgroups. Only the approximately 50,000 Basarwa, or Bushmen,
 remain generally unrepresented in government. Most of the
 Basarwa have begun the process of assimilation into society
 and have full voting rights. However, because the Basarwa
 live primarily in remote rural areas and have little contact
 with the population centers of Botswana, they remain far
 behind in terms of governmental educational and economic
 assistance programs, and consequently have participated only
 marginally in the country's political life. The Government
 announced plans in 1988 to move the remaining traditional
 Basarwa hunters--approximately 1,200 tribespeople--from the
 central Kalahari game reserve to other settlements.
 Women hold at least 25 percent of the paid jobs in Botswana.
 An estimated 40 percent of the central government employees
 are women, some of them in high-level positions. While there
 is little overt discrimination, social custom elevates the
 rights and privileges of men above those of women. Due in
 part to a high birthrate out of wedlock and the absence of
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 many men as migrant laborers in South Africa, some 40 percent
 of rural households are headed by women. Generally speaking,
 women's economic opportunities--access to capital, labor,
 draft animals, seeds for farming--are significantly less than
 those of men. Women may choose between civil marriage, in
 which all property is held in common, or customary marriage,
 which recognizes individual property brought to a marriage.
 However, most women are not aware of the implications of these
 alternatives. Often a married woman is unable to get a bank
 loan without the signature of her husband, and an unmarried
 woman must get the signature of her father. Under the
 citizenship laws, a woman cannot transmit Botswana citizenship
 to her child unless she is. unmarried. This can cause
 hardships for children born to noncitizen fathers,
 particularly refugees. Although women's rights are not yet a
 major public issue in Botswana, this is a recognized area of
 potential future social conflict. Some initiatives undertaken
 by the Government include assistance in the publication of a
 women's rights handbook, efforts to involve more women in
 development activities, and the establishment of preference
 points for women seeking government-sponsored development
 loans.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to establish or join labor unions. Unionsare
 important in the country's large mining sector and in related
 industries but have not developed a substantial base in other
 areas of the economy. Unions freely associate with
 international organizations, and members regularly attend
 major international conferences. The Botswana Federation of
 Trade Unions (BFTU) is affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and is also a
 member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 the South African Trade Union Coordination Council.
 Unions have the right to strike, but that right is limited by
 a requirement for government arbitration. In practice,
 strikes are relatively rare and usually quickly settled.
 Independent of government control or party affiliation, unions
 in Botswana actively strive to represent their members.
 Government regulations, however, require that all union
 leaders work full time in the trade their union represents, a
 practice criticized by the ICFTU. The ICFTU has also noted
 that "the dissolution of trade union organizations by
 government decree is possible under the law at all times."
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions have the right to organize and to bargain
 collectively. Collective bargaining is common in the mining
 sector (where workers are organized) and uncommon elsewhere as
 workers are not organized. The Botswana Federation of Trade
 Unions is working on provisions to prevent antiunion
 discrimination. Although workers can be dismissed with two
 months' pay, this tactic is rarely used.
 Unions have chafed under government regulations which prohibit
 financial contributions to unions from outside Botswana.
 Labor laws apply uniformly throughout the country. There are
 no export processing zones in Botswana.
 
 
 BOTSWANA
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is not practiced in Botswana and is
 specifically prohibited in the Constitution.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Botswana law prohibits the employment of children 12 years and
 under by anyone except members of the child's immediate
 family. No juvenile under the age of 15 may be employed in
 any industry, and only those over 16 may be employed in night
 work. No person 16 or younger is permi.tted to work in
 hazardous jobs, including mining. Moreover, Botswana law
 protects young people from recruiters for jobs outside the
 country. There is no evidence that child labor laws are
 regularly breached. Although education is not compulsory, it
 is almost universally available, and most children attend
 school at least through the primary grades.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The law provides for minimum working standards, including job
 safety, a maximum 48-hour workweek, and a minimum wage of
 approximately $85 per month. This amount is barely adequate
 for one person to maintain a decent standard of living, and in
 most cases workers must supplement this amount through other
 means, such as subsistence farming. Most Botswana families
 have more than one wage earner. Women are not permitted to
 work as miners because of the dangers of that occupation. For
 some jobs during certain seasons, (such as in agriculture
 during the harvest season), Botswana law permits a workweek
 longer than 48 hours. Most major manufacturers adhere to the
 labor laws, including payment of overtime wages (time and a
 half). Some smaller employers, however, fail to pay overtime,
 and no action is taken against them.
