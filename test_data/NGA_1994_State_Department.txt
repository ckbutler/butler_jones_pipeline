 NIGERIA
 General Sani Abacha, who seized power in a palace coup on November 17, 1993,
 remained Head of State throughout 1994. Under Abacha, the main decisionmaking
 organ is the military-dominated Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), which rules by
 decree. The PRC oversees the 32-member Federal Executive Council composed of
 some of Nigeria's most prominent politicians. Like previous military regimes,
 Abacha and the PRC claimed they would eventually hand over power to a civilian
 government, but the PRC did not reveal a timetable, although it initiated a "con-
 stitutional conference" over which it had strong influence. Pending a new constitu-
 tion, some provisions of the 1979 Constitution were observed, although the decree
 suspending it was not repealed. The regime failed to clarify, however, which aspects
 of the Constitution remained in effect. Although the regime occasionally made ref-
 erence to rights or guarantees outlined in the Constitution to suit a particular pur-
 
 
 189
 pose, it just as often reminded the public of the continued suspension of constitu-
 tional rights.
 Despite several positive initial steps, the PRC showed little respect for human
 rights after its first month in power, and the political and economic climate steadily
 deteriorated throughout 1994. New political forces steadily gathered in support of
 Chief Moshood K. 0. Abiola, who on June 12, 1993, had won the presidential elec-
 tion, in what national and international observers characterized as the most free
 and fair election in Nigeria's history, but which was quickly annulled by then mili-
 tary head, General Ibrahim Babangida. In particular, opposition figures united in
 a new organization called the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), which
 campaigned for an immediate return to civilian rule through a "sovereign" national
 conference. Abiola declared himself President of Nigeria on June 11, 1994.
 The Government continued to enforce its authority through the Federal Security
 System (the military, the state security service, and the national police-all of whom
 were responsible for serious human rights abuses) and through decrees blocking ac-
 tion by the opposition in the courts. Starting in May and June, the Government
 cracked down hard on the opposition, arresting NADECO members. With Abiola in
 prison awaiting trial, General Abacha convened a constitutional conference, but the
 labor movement, led by the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers
 (NUPENG) and the National Labor Congress (NLC), responded with massive strike
 action, demanding that General Abacha release Abiola and hand over power to a
 civilian government. The ensuing strikes brought economic life in Lagos and much
 of the southwest to a standstill for almost 8 weeks.
 By the middle of September, the military Government became increasingly con-
 fident, escalating further the crackdown on its opponents. In the face of the Govern-
 ment's tough actions, most striking workers, fearing arrest and dismissal, soon re-
 turned to work, and most of the fight went out of organized labor. At the end of
 the year, the economy continued its downward slide. While Nigerian elites contin-
 ued to prosper, unemployment, underemployment, and inflation increased markedly.
 Nigeria depends on oil exports for over 90 percent of its foreign exchange earnings
 and 75 percent of its budget revenues. In order to cope with reduced oil revenues,
 Nigeria implemented an indigenous structural adjustment program (SAP) from 1986
 to 1991. While the SAP was a success in some respects, economic conditions for the
 average Nigerian remained very difficult, and successive military governments in-
 creasingly abandoned reform by printing money that fueled inflation.
 Nigeria's human rights record remained dismal in 1994. General Abacha's policies
 heightened episodic civil unrest in urban areas. Security forces used excessive force
 to control the situation, killing and wounding a number of persons, including peace-
 ful protesters. The Abacha Government regularly relied on arbitrary detention and
 mass arrest as a means of silencing its many critics. To consolidate its hold on
 power, the regime in August announced a series of harsh decrees restricting press
 freedom and civil liberties which, like other military decrees, contained clauses pro-
 hibiting judicial review of any government action. Security services steped up rou-
 tine harassment of human rights and prodemocracy groups, including labor leaders,
 journalists, and student activists.
 Other human rights problems throughout the year included extrajudicial killings;
 police torture; dangerous and unsanitary prison conditions with many deaths; vio-
 lence and discrimination against women; and infringements on freedom of speech,
 press, travel, and political and labor affiliation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-As in previous years, police and se-
 curity services commonly engaged in extrajudicial killings and excessive use of force
 to quell antimilitary andprodemocracy protests. The most deadly incidents occurred
 in July and August after the Government deployed police and military units to put
 down protests in Lagos and other cities in the southwest. There were credible re-
 ports that security forces may have killed from 20 to 50 people in the Lagos area
 alone. Government reports of deaths resulting from the riots were much lower, and
 the Government asserted that security forces intervened only when confronted by
 violent criminals. While the victims included hoodlums and looters, who used the
 protests as cover to engage in violent criminal activities, eyewitness accounts indi-
 cated that security forces often fired randomly into crowds, killing innocent bystand-
 ers and peaceful demonstrators.
 Nigerian human rights groups maintain that scores of people die annually while
 in police custody, though there are no definitive statistics, and the claims are dif-
 ficult to substantiate. They are, however, accepted by the Nigerian public and re-
 
 
 190
 
 main consistent with other credible reports of police abuse, including the use of tor-
 ture to extract confessions. The Civil Liberties Organization (CLO), a nongovern-
 mental organization (NGO), publicized the case of Anthony Imo, who died while in
 police custody in February. Police arrested Imo, a "patent medicine" seller in Kano
 and accused him of selling fake pharmaceuticals. Reportedly tortured by poice while
 in custody for several hours, Imo was taken by police to a local hospital where he
 later died, apparently from brain damage.
 The Government seldom holds police and security services accountable for the use
 of excessive, deadly force or the death of individuals while in custody; it made no
 effort to investigate the conduct of security forces during the July and August
 prodemocracy protests and denied that protesters died at the hands of government
 forces. The Government has thus fostered a climate of impunity in which these
 abuses flourish.
 According to the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights (CDHR) and the
 CLO, in January a poie patrol in Delta state shot seven men they suspected of
 being armed rbbers. The plie maintain the seven fired upon them while trying
 to run a checkpoint near Warn. In an exchange of fire, the police shot two of the
 men and arrested the rest of the party. The police then reportedly executed all
 seven prisoners soon after, including a 70-year-old man.
 Extrajudicial kiling remained ommon in eastern Nigeria, particularly as conflict
 between members of the Movement for the Survival o the    goni People (MOSOP)
 and government forces escalated throughout the year. In April, spurred by increased
 violence in the oil-producing area, the overnment deployed large numbers of police
 and military to Ogoniland. Credible reports of increased killings and beatings at po-
 lice checkpoints and other areas accompanied the deployment. To quell the upsurge
 of violence in the area, the military administration of Rivers state promulgated a
 draconian decree imposing the death sentence for "civil disturbances occasioning
 death," and also for crimes such as "attempted murder." The administration set up
 a special court, the Civil Disturbances Tribunal, to try such cases.
 Human rights groups and the press corroborated MOSOP claims that hundreds
 of people died in the violence which continued unabated despite the military pres-
 ence and the actions of the Rivers state government. The commander of the military
 forces in Ogoniland, Major Paul Okuntimo, admitted publicly his forces killed six
 people from June to August, stating that two were shot when they fired on soldiers,
 one while trying to escape from detention, and "the remaining three * * * as a de-
 terrent to their like.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances;
 however, government detention practices have the effect of causing many detainees
 to be "missing" for extended periods (see Section 1.d.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1979 Constitution (suspended) and the 1989 Constitution (never implemented)
 prohibit torture and mistreatment of prisoners and provide criminal sanctions for
 such excesses, and the Evidence Act of 1960 prohibits the introduction of evidence
 obtained through torture. Nevertheless, detainees frequently die while in custody
 (see Section La.), and there were credible reorts that police seeking to extract con-
 fessions regularly beat and torture suspects. For example, reports circulated in Sep-
 tember that the military beat and nearly tortured to death detained NADECO mem-
 bers. Detainees are regularly kept incommunicado for long periods of time (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.).
 In its early months in power, the Abacha regime formed the Lagos State Environ-
 mental Task Force as part of its "war on indiscipline and corruption." Under the
 direct supervision of the Lagos state administrator, Colonel Olagunsoye Oyinlola,
 the Task Force grew increasingly brutal in its attempts to rid Lagos of illegal street
 traders and mountains of garbage. Task Force soldiers routinely beat and arrested
 anyone they perceived as being "undisciplined," usually unarmed market women
 and traders, but also including jaywalkers, errant drivers, children, and young trad-
 ers who hawk goods on Lagos streets. The Constitutional Rights Project publicized
 the case of one of its lawyers, Kolawole Olaniyan, who was beaten and
 horsewhipped after protesting being pressed into a work gang by Task Force sol-
 diers on March 16. Armed soldiers reportedly stopped the bus in which he was com-
 muting and forced the occupants to clean up piles of refuse nearby. Soldiers also
 targeted young women in short skirts or trousers, humiliating them and sometimes
 stripping them naked for wearing "immodest clothing." The Government neither ac-
 knowledged nor denied that such practices occurred; the perpetrators went
 unpunished.
 Conditions in Nigeria's prisons remain life threatening. Lack of potable water,
 sewage facilities, and medical supplies contribute to deplorable sanitaiy conditions.
 Disease runs rampant in the cramped, poorly ventilated facilities. Prison inmates
 
 
 are seldom allowed outside their cells for recreation, and many must provide their
 own food. In those cases, only those with money or whose relatives bring food regu-
 larly have something to eat. Poor inmates rely on handouts from others to survive.
 There are credible reports that prison officials and police deny inmates food and
 medical treatment as a form of punishment or to extort money from them. For ex-
 ample, the prison authorities denied Ken Saro-Wiwa, leader of MOSOP, who suffers
 from a heart condition, access to medical care and food appropriate to his medical
 condition during his detainment in January and again during his subsequent deten-
 tion, while ignoring continued requests by Saro-Wiwa's personal physician to see
 him (see Section 1.d.). There were also credible reports that prison officials kept
 Saro-Wiwa in chains for at least part of his detention.
 Severe overcrowding in Nigerian prisons remains a serious problem. For example,
 Ikoy prison in Lagos, built to house about 800 inmates, holds over 2,000. The
 CDHR estimated that 2,OO0 people die each year in prisons from disease, although
 the Government admits only to a much lower mortality rate. A correspondent for
 the Vanguard newspaper reported the death of 40 inmates from tuberculosis in the
 Warri federal prison since the end of 1993. The Ita Oko detention camp was most
 likely reopened to ease the burden on other overcrowded facilities.
 The Government derives considerable savings from the practice of leaving many
 children born in prison with their jailed mothers rather than placing them in foster
 homes.
 d. Arbitray Arrest, Detention, and Exile.-The regime repeatedly engaged in arbi-
 trary arrest and detention (see below). Police are empowered to make arrests with-
 out warrants if there is reasonable suspicion of an offense and often abuse this
 power. Nigerian law requires the arresting officer to inform the accused of charges
 at the time of arrest and take him or her to the station for processing within a rea-
 sonable time. Suspects must be given the opportunity to engage counsel and to post
 bail. However, police do not generally adhere to these safeguards. They often hold
 suspects incommunicado under harsh conditions for extended periods without
 charge; arbitrary detention occurs frequently. Police also commonly place relatives
 and friends of wanted suspects in detention without charge in an effort to induce
 the accused to turn themselves in.
 The State Security (Detention of Persons) Decree of 1984 (Decree Two) provides
 that the Government may detain without charge persons suspected of acts preju-
 dicial to state security or harmful to the economic well-being of the country. Men
 invoked by the Vice President, the decree suspends the detainee's civil liberties and
 precludes judicial review. Many Nigerians still consider Decree Two the main threat
 to their basic freedoms because the judicial ouster clause encourages arbitrary de-
 tention and fails to define what constitutes acts prejudicial to state security or the
 nation's economic well-being.
 During the year, the Government expanded its authority to detain opponents by
 promulgating a series of new decrees. One of them, Decree 11, authorizes the PRC
 ice Chairman or the Commissioner of Police to detain persons for up to 3 months.
 Another, Decree 14, forbids courts to order the Government to produce prisoners in
 court, effectively suspending the right of habeas corpus. The PRC relied heavily on
 arbitrary arrest and detention throughout the year in an effort to silence its critics.
 In February, after the Government announced a ban on regional political organiza-
 tions, security forces arrested and detained without charge retired general and
 former presidential candidate Shehu Musa Yar'Adua. In March the Government
 cracked down on human rights groups' activities throughout the nation. The au-
 thorities arrested Femi Falana, chairman of the National Association of Democratic
 Lawyers and two members of the Campaign for Democracy (CD) in Lagos on March
 11, but never charged them. Security operatives earlier in the month arrested Oyo
 state chairman of the CD Gbenga Awosode, and Kwara state CDHR chairperson,
 Josephine Okei. Security torces broke up an antiwar rally organized by the CD on
 March 15 and arrested and detained eight CD members, including Femi Falana and
 founding member Frederick Fasehun.
 In the wake of protests against the constitutional conference in May and June,
 the Government expanded its crackdown, arresting hundreds of prodemocracy agi-
 tators. In the wave of arrests, the Government detained and charged with treason
 several former senators, who declared they had reconvened the disbanded National
 Assembly, including Senate President Ameh Ebute and Senators Bola Tinubu,
 Polycarp Nwite, N.. Okorofor, and Abu Ibrahim. They were released on bail, but
 the charges against them remained pending. The authorities also arrested and re-
 leased Tokunbo Afikuyomi, member of the disbanded House of Representatives and
 former aide to General Abacha's Minister of Foreign Affairs Baba Gana Kingibe,
 and a number of NADECO members, such as former governor of Plateau state Air
 Commodore Dan Suleiman; former governor of Benue state Air Commodore Jonah
 
 
 Jan, former governor of Anambra state C.C. Onoh; former governor of Oyo state
 Bola Ige; and the highly respected politician and statesman, Anthony Enahoro. The
 authorities detained hurmn~ rights figures around the country, including CD chair-
 man and NADECO member B eko Ransome-Kuti, who went on a hunger strike to
 protest the conditions of his detention.
 The Government arrested on charges of treasonable offenses in late June Chief
 Moshood K.O. Abiola, widely believed the winner of the annulled June 12, 1993,
 elections, who declared himself President and Commander in Chief of the Armed
 Forces o Nigeria The Government kept Abiola in isolation for weeks before moving
 him to Abuja and commencing his trial (see Section i.e.). Credible reports emerged
 that Abiola had been h          n      custody, and that his family and dotor
 were only sporadically allowed access to him. In September the regime allowed
 Abiola's personal physician and other doctors to examine him. Despite the doctors'
 fidings of a serious heart condition, the regime refused pleas from his family and
 others that he be released for urgent tests that could be performed only in Lagos
 or abroad.
 In August and September the regme continued to silence opposition to its rule.
 It arrested again Chief Anthony Enahoro on August 18, jailing him in the Port Har-
 court prison. His family complained that security forces refusee
 him and that his doctor was unable to assess the 75-year-old Enahoro's medical con-
 dition. Enahoro was released without charge in late December after being moved to
 the Port Harcourt military hospital. Beko Ransome-Kuti was again arrested without
 charge on September 15, after security operatives entered the ofices of the CDHR
 with a warrant and seized a number of  omen. After holding Ransme-Kuti in-
 communicado for 1 week, the Government charged him with writing threatening let-
 ters to the managing directors of Agip and Shell oil companies and released him
 on bail. In early November, the federalHigh Court in Lagos ruled that only the fed-
 eral Attorney General could prosecute cases of treasonable felony, and that because
 the Government's case against Ransome-Kuti had been fied at the state court level,
 it was invalid. The Government ignored the ruling, rearresting Ransome-Kuti on
 November 9, this time also accusing him of receiving 6 million Naira from Abiola
 to "bomb government installations and strategic buildings." The new Attorney Gen-
 eral of the Federation, Michael Agbamuche, defended the Government's actions, say-
 ing that the Government had the right to overturn judicial decisions "in certain cir-
 cumtances." Ransome-Kuti was released on bail soon after, and the case continued
 at year's end Noted civil rights activist and lawyer oani fawehinmi was arrested
 on October 1 after announcing the formation of a new political party, the National
 Conscience (NC). He was released several days later.
 ThrougHourt the ear hovernment forces harassed and detained from time to time
 other members of 1OS   , including Ken Saro-Wiwa's brother, Owens Wiwa. Saro-
 Wiwa also remained in prison at year's end, without access to a lawyer, his family
 or a doctor. In November the Government announced the formation of a military
 tribunal to try Saro-Wiwa and other MOSOP members for complicity in the murders
 of four Ogoni chiefs (see Section 5).
 The labor movement confirmed that the following labor leaders were in detention
 at year's entai Frank Kokori, General Secretary of NUPENG; R. Addo, first president
 of the Petroleum  and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association (PENGASSAN); P.
 Aidelomon, a PENGASSAN branch chairman; Wariebi Aoj Aamene, president of
 NUPENG; and Olu Aderibegbe, Chairman of the Edo state NLC.
 The above cases were not isolated. The Government routinely detained human
 rights monitors, journalists (see Section 2.a.), and political opponents throughout
 the year for making or publishing statements critical of the Government. Most often
 the authorities did not charge the detainees with a crime, held them for brief peri-
 ods, and questioned them about their activities and statements. Nigeria's total pris-
 on population is estimated at 65,000. Human rights groups estimate that as much
 as 4 percent of this population awaits trial A precise figure for the number of per-
 sons detained without charye is unavailable, and there are no credible estimates of
 the number of political detainees.
 There were no known instances of forced exile as a means of political control, al-
 though several NADECO members were in self-imposed exile in the United States
 and the United Kingdom at year's end
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.in its efforts to suppress opposition to its rule,
 the regime first bypasssed the regular courts in favor of "tribunals" and then de-
 oareditself above the law by prohibiting court review of any government action (see
 below).
 Decree One of 1984, the Basic Constitution (Modification and Suspension) Decree,
 the first decree promulgated by the military officers who overthrew the civilian re-
 gime of President Shagari in 1983, left the institutional framework of the judiciary
 
 
 193
 relatively intact. However, it established a parallel system of military tribunals with
 sole jurisdiction over certain offenses, such as coup plotting, corruption armed rob-
 bery, and illegal sale of petroleum. A 1991 decree amendedDecree One by providing
 that only sitting or retired civilian judges nmy preside over tribunals hearing non-
 military cases. The PRC retained the tribunal framework.
 In moat cases before the tribunals, the accused have the right to legal counsel,
 bail, and appeal, though some tribunals substitute a presumption of guilt for the
 presumption of innocence, and conviction rates in the tribunals reportedly exceed
 cnviction rates in the regular courts. Sentences are generally severe. The Govern-
 ment's reliance on tribunals, which operate outside the constitutional court system,
 seriously undermines the judiciary's independence and often results in legal pro-
 ceedings that deny defendants due process.
 The Governments frequent refusal to respect court rulings also undercuts the
 independence and integrity of the judiciary. in November the federal Government
 circumvented a ruling by the Kaduna High Court granting Abiola bail by filing an
 appeal to the Supreme Court, further calling into question the relevance of judcial
 decisions. The Government ignored court orders in July requiring that it allow
 Punch, a daily newspaper closed down by security forces, to reopen. In Augst a fed-
 eral High Court ruled the Government in contempt of court for ignoring the ruling.
 The Court declared the closure of the paper illega and unconstitutional and ordered
 the polie to vacat   e premises, which they did after an additional 11 days. Within
 2 weeks, the Government shut down Punch by decree.
 SSeriously dama ing the shred of credibility the judiciary retained, the regime in
 August declared itself above the law. Decree 12 of 1994, enacted on August 18,
 states that "no act of the federal miltary government may be  estioned henceforth
 in a court of law," and "divests all courts of jurisdiction in all matters concerning
 the authogty of the federal government." When Attorney General Olu Onagoruwa
 criticized the decrees as being unonstitutional, the PRC fired him.
 The regular court system is composed of bth federal and state trial courts, state
 appeals courts, the federal Court of Appeal, and the federal Supreme Court. Under
 the 1979 Constitution, courts of the first instance include magistrate or district
 courts, customary or area courts, Shari'a (Islamic) courts, and for some specified
 cases, the state high courts. The nature of the case usually determines which court
 has jurisdiction. In principle, customary and Shari'a courts have jurisdiction only if
 both plaintiff and defendant agree to it. In practice, fear of legal costs, delay, and
 distance to alternative courts encourage many litigants to choose these courts.
 Criminal justice procedures call for trial within 3 months of arraignment for moat
 categories of criminals. Inefficient administrative procedures, ptty extortion2 bu-
 reaucratic inertia, por communication between police and prison officials, and inad-
 equate transportatin continue to result i consderable delays, often stretching sev-
 eral years in bringing suspects to trial
 Trials in the regular court system are public and generally respect constitu-
 tionaliy protected individual rights, including a presumption of innocence, the right
 to be present, to confront witnesses, to present evidence, and to be represented by
 legal counsel.
 There are no legal  prvisions barin  women or other groups from testifying in
 civil court or giving their testimonyr less weight. The testimony of women is, how-
 ever, accorded less weight in Shari a courts, There is a widespread perception that
 Vjudges are easily bribed, or "settled," and that the curts cannot be reied upon to
 render an impartial judgment. An internal government report submitted to General
 Abacha in June, later printed in the press, called the judiciary a "disaster institu-
 tion" and recommended that the federal Goveent correct the institution's lack
 of independence and funding, as weil as put an end to corruption and bribery among
 Thnumber of poitical prisoners (as distinct from poitical detainees) held by the
 Government was also unknown. At year's end, MK.O. Abiola remained in prison,
 despite a November ruling by the Kaduna federal High Court of Appeals granting
 him bail on the condition that he rnot disturb the peace." The regime refused to
 honor the ruling, however, and a ppealed the decision to the Supreme Court. Abiola's
 t   on treason charges remained suspended indefinitely on orders from the regime.
 ther lone-term political detainees, such as Ken Sar-Wiwa, continued to be held
 without trial.
 f. Arbitrary Intrferne With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Provi
 sions of the 1979 and   1989n Constitutons provide for he rights to privacy in the
 home, in correspondence, and in oral electronic communications. However, the mili-
 tary Government regularly interfered in the lives of its citizens, and if the authori-
 tiesdesired to use a warrant in a particular search case, they often secured it from
 a military tribunal rather than a regular court. Human rights leaders reported that
 
 
 security agents regularly followed them and cut or tapped their organizations' tele-
 phones.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press-There is a large and vibrant press, which is fre-
 quently critical of the Government. Nonetheless, the Government directly owns or
 controls many newspapers and has shut down several others. The Government
 granted broadcasting rights to private radio stations for the first time in 1994. Con-
 stitutional prvisions providing for freedom of speech and the press are not enforce-
 able since no constitution is in effect. The Abacha regime often publicly declared its
 support for these freedoms; however, the Government attempted to confine public
 political dialog to the constitutional conference. The regime also increased its sys-
 tematic intimidation of the press through legal and extralegal means throughout
 1994.
 The regime used a variety of methods to muzzle its many critics. In January it
 seized the entire print run of the weekly newsmagazine Tell, and soon after indicted
 the editor in chief of Razor magazine for sedition and three Newswatch magazine
 executives on other spurious charges. During the week building up to the anniver-
 sary of the June 12 election, the Government detained and otherwise harassed doz-
 ens of journalists, along with premocracy activists. Security forces on June 11 oc-
 cupied the offices of M.K.O. Abiola's Concord group newspaper Punch, charging that
 the buildings were used to store weapons. On August 14, security forces occupied
 the offices of the Guardian, Nigeria's most respected daily newspaper, disrupting its
 production.
 Following a number of court decisions favoring the press over the summer, in Au-
 gust the Government issued a series of decrees prscribing for 6 months three news-
 paper publishing houses. These new decrees granted the Abacha regime and its
 agents legal immunity from challenges to any actions taken to implement the d-
 crees, even when the action predated the deree itself. In December the Government
 extended the decrees indoeinitely.
 The Government also summarily deported foreign journalists, including two cor-
 respondents of Cable News Network.
 The military Government used a number of other means to intimidate the press.
 These included a regulation banning government offices from advertising in non-
 government media, periodic directives to government offices forbidding the purchase
 of certain publications, personal attacks in government-controlled media against
 journalists and others who challenged government policies, and threats of harass-
 ment against potential advertisers and financial backers of antigovernment news-
 papers and magazines.
 While academic freedom is generally respected, the military Government closed
 universities sporadically due to continued social unrest and strikes by the Academic
 Staff Union of Universities and other university unions callng for implementation
 of the June 12, 1993, elections, a return to civilian democracy, and improved fund-
 ing for the university system. Some student groups believe university authorities
 foow  Government directives to suspend or expel activist students.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assciation.-The two Constitutions provide
 citizens the right to assemble freely and associate with other persons in political
 parties, trade unions, or other special interest associations. However, the Govern-
 ment prscribed all political activity one day afr coming into power in 1993. On
 August 17, Goneral Abacha announced that "individuals or groups may hencforth
 canvass poltical ideas, but they cannot form poltical parties or now.
 Permits are not normally required for public meetings indoors, and permit re-
 quirements for outdoor pubic  nctions are often ignored. However, the Abacha
 Government retained the authority of Decree Five of the Babangida government,
 which banned gatherings whose political, ethnic, or religious overtones might lead
 to unrest. Open-air religous services away from places of worship remain prohibited
 in most states due to religious tensions in various parts of the country.
 Religios, professional, and other organizations need not register with the Govern-
 ment and are generally permitted free association with other national and foreign
 bodies. The PRC retained a ban on several political organizations which it con-
 tended were founded primarily along ethnic, tribal, religious, or other parochial
 lines for the purpose ofspensoring various political candidates.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Decree One (suspending most of the 1979 Constitution)
 and the suspended 1989 Constitution prohibit federal and state governments from
 adopting an official state religion. The PRC reaffHmed the secular nature of the
 State in its instructions to the constitutional conference. The 1979 and 1989 con-
 stitutional provisions for f   iredom of beief, practice, and education inad  t reli-
 gion are generally respected. The Government instituted a ban in 1987 (which is
 
 
 195
 still in effect) on religious organizations on campuses of primary schools, though in-
 dividual students retain the right to practice their religion in recognized places of
 worship.
 Distribution of religious publications is generally unrestricted. There is a lightly
 enforced ban on published religious advertisements, and religious programing on
 television and radio remains closely controlled by the Government. Both Christian
 and Muslim organizations allege that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Immi-
 gration Department continue to restrict the entry into the country of certain reli-
 gious practitioners, p  cularly persons suspected of proselytizing. While it has not
 officially outlawed the practice, the Government discourages proselytizing in the be-
 lief that it stirs up religious tensions, particularly in the north.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The two Constitutions entitle citizens to move freely throughout the
 country and reside where they wish. However, increasing violent crime in many
 parts of the country prompted police to set up roadblocks and check ints, where
 officials commonly engaged in extortion, violence, and excessive use of orce.
 Those Constitutions also prohibit expulsion or the denial of exit or entry to any
 Nigerian citizen. However, women must often provide permission from a male fam-
 ily member before they are granted a passport, and the Government, like its prede-
 cessors, occasionally prevented travel for political reasons.
 For example, in July the Government seized the passport of an opposition leader,
 Chief Sbo Sowem Imo, as he attempted to exit the country through the Lagos air-
 port. In September the Government confiscated the national passport of noted social
 critic and Nobel Laureate Wole Sayinka, who, a few days before, had filed a suit
 against the Abacha regime challenging its legal right to rule. In October immigra-
 tion authorities again prevented S       from leag the country, seizing the U.N.
 laissez-passer issued to him as a U   SO    gwill ambassador. Soyinka subse-
 quently left the country clandestinely. In November the Government seized Bar As-
 sociation President Priscilla Kuye's passport, preventing her from traveling after
 she had already bearded an international Ilight.
 Journalists reported harassment at the nation's airports by security officials
 throughout the year, including having to fill out a special exit and entry form detail-
 ing their movements abroad, reasons for making their trip, and friends and associ-
 ates overseas. Security officials temporarily confiscated the passports of journalists
 who refused to complete the form.
 Nigerian law and practice permit temporary refuge and asylum for political refu-
 gees from other countries. The Government cooperates with the Lagos office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in dealing with an esti-
 mated 3,000 Liberian and an undetermined number of Chadian refugees. There
 were no reported cases of forced repatriation of refugees in 1994.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens could not exercise this right in 1994, and there was little indication that
 General Abacha's military regime was willing to permit them to do so on any basis
 other than a process tightly controlled by the regime. Throughout the year, the re-
 gime committed numerous, repeated, and egregious human rights abuses in its ef-
 fort to prevent citizens from opping it by peaceful political means.
 After coming to power, the Provisional Ruling Council headed by General Abacha
 promised a return to civilian, democratic rule but did not provide a timetable. The
 regime instead announced the convening of a constitutional conference to prepare
 a transition program. Citizens were not to be given the opportunity peacefully to
 change their government at any level until the constitutional convention completed
 its work. As protests against the regime mounted in May and June, the Government
 arrested a number of ex-politicians who attempted to reconvene disbanded demo-
 cratic institutions. Those -arrested included Chief M.K.O. Abiola, the acclaimed win-
 ner of the aborted June 12, 1993, election, who declared himself President on June
 11.
 In July the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers called a strike
 demanding that General Abacha release Abiola and hand over power to a civilian
 government. Other unions joined NUPENG, and the ensuing strikes brought life in
 s and much of the southwest to a standstill for almost 8 weeks, while rioting
 an civil disobedience erupted throughout the country, particularly in the south-
 west. By September the regime cracked down on its opponents, andmost elements
 of resistance dissolved. As noted, it committed numerous, repeated, and egregious
 human rights abuses in its effort to prevent citizens from opposing it by peaceful
 political means.

 At the end of the year, the regime continued to consolidate its hold on power, al-
 though General Abacha indicated that he might lift the ban on political activity
 early in the new year. He also repeated his commitment to "respect the decision of
 the constitutional conference" regarding a transition to civilian rule, but stated that
 the Government "reserved the right" to review any decision made by the conference.
 His promises encouraged many members of the so-called political class to form asso-
 ciations and quasi-political parties in anticipation of another transition program.
 However, most Nigerians, preoccupied by increasing economic hardship and ethnic
 polarization, and weary of repeated military promises of democratic rule, remained
 politically impassive.
 Nigerian politics remain dominated by men. However, there are no legal impedi-
 ments to political participation or voting by women or any other minority group.
 One woman served in the 91-member Senate, and 6 women served in the 589-mem-
 ber House of Representatives. There is one woman in the PRC's Federal Executive
 Council.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government permitted local human rights groups to operate but often inter-
 fered with their activities, detaining their members and preventing them from criti-
 cizing the Government's human righta record (see Sections 1.d. and 2.a.). High-level
 government officials regularly denounced the activities of Nigeria's human rights
 community, often accusing its members and the independent press of participating
 in foreign-inspired plots to destabilize the country.
 Notwithstandng the Government's hostile attitude, human rights groups remained
 engaged in a vocal and public campaign for the promotion of human rights. Among
 the most active are: The Civil Liberties Organization; the Committee for the De-
 fense of Human Rights; the Campaign for Democracy; the Constitutional Rights
 Project- the National Association of Democratic Lawyers; Human Rights Africa; the
 Legal esearch and Resource Development Center, the National Association of Uni-
 versity Women; the International Federation of Women Lawyers; and the Human
 Rights Committee of the Nigerian Bar Association. A number of prominent authors,
 including Nobel Laureate Wole Soyka, artists, educators, and jurists, in addition
 to professional and labor organizations, spoke out frequently on human rights issues
 as well.
 The Government sometimes prevented foreign human rights monitoring groups
 and individuals from visiting Nigeria or mistreated them while they were there. For
 example, in April the Government refused visa requests by representatives of the
 Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization, invited by Shell Oil and MOSOP
 to investigate the situation in Ogoniland. In June security agents beat and detained
 for 4 days Nick Ashton-Jones, a representative of the British environmental aware-
 ness group Pronatura, and two Nigerian human rights activists, Oronto Douglas
 and Uche Onyeagocham, reportedly for meeting with detained MOSOP secretary
 Leedum Mitee in Port Harcourt. The Government admitted Amnesty International
 representatives to the country in December but denied them access to detainees.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Both the 1979 and 1989 Constitutions provide citizens the right to freedom from
 discrimination based on "community, place of origin, ethnic group, sex, religion, or
 poitical opinion." However, customary and religious discrimina"tion against women
 persists, while tension between the Government and disaffected minority ethnic
 groups is on the rise.
 Women-There are no laws barring women from particular fields of employment,
 but women often experience discrimination because the Government tolerates cus-
 tnary and religious practices which adversely affect them. While the number of
 women in the formal sector increases every year, women do not receive equal pay
 for equal work and ofen find it extremely difficult to acquire commercial credit or
 obtain tax deductions or rebates as the heads of households. While some women
 have made considerable individual progress, both in the academic and business
 world, most are underprivileged. Though women are not legally barred from owning
 land, under customary land tenure systems in some parts of Nigeria only men own
 land, and women gain access to it through marriage or family. In addition, many
 customary practices do not recognize a woman's right to inherit her husband's prop-
 erty, and many widows are rendered destitute when their in-laws take virtually all
 of the deceased husband's property. In other areas, the widow herself is considered
 part of the property, and she too may be "inherited" by the husband's eldest male

 relative. Polygyny is widely practiced among all ethnic groups in both Christian and
 Islamic communities.
 Reports of wife abuse are common, especially wife beating in polygynous families.
 Police do not normally intervene in domestic disputes, and they are seldom dis-
 cussed publicly. In more traditional areas, it is questionable whether the courts and
 police actively intervene to protect women who formally accuse their husbands if the
 evel of alleged abuse does not exceed customary norms in the area. Purdah, the Is-
 lamic practice of keeping girls and women in seclusion from men outside the family,
 is prevalent in parts of Nigeria's far north. Women also bear the brunt of attacks
 for social and religious reasons, particularly for "immodest" or "inappropriate! be-
 havior.
 Children.-The Government only occasionally condemns child abuse and neglect
 and makes little effort to stop customary practices, such as the sale of children into
 marriage. It remains only sporadicall committed to children's welfare. While the
 amount of money spent on children's health projects has increased in recent years
 laws designed to protect the rights of children are often obsolete, inadequate, and
 seldom enforced. Although the law stipulates that "no child shall be ordered to be
 imprisoned," juvenile offenders are routinely denied bail and incarcerated along
 with hardened criminals.
 There are credible reports that poor families often sell their daughters into mar-
 riage as a means of supplementing their incomes. There are also reports that many
 young girls are forced into marriage as soon as they reach puberty, regardless of
 age to prevent "indecency" associated with premarital sex.
 The Government publicly opposes female genital mutilation (FGM), and Nigeria
 cosponsored a resolution at the 46th World Health Assembly calling for the elimi-
 nation of harmful health practices, including FGM. However, it has taken no action
 to abolish the procedure, and nearly all ethnic grops  bject young females to it.
 Nigerian experts estimate that as many as 50 percenT of Nigerian women, primarily
 in the Christian south but less in the Muslim north, have undergone FGM, which
 varies from simple removal of the clitoral hood or labia minora to excision of the
 clitoris and the most painful and harmful form, infibulation.
 The age at which females are subjected to FGM varies from the first week of life
 to after a woman delivers her first child. The federal Ministry of Health and NGO's
 sponsor public awareness and education projects to inform communities of the
 health hazards associated with FGM, and the press openly condemned the practice
 on a number of occasions.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-There is no official policy of discrimination
 against any of Nigeria's 250 ethnic groups, and laws do not favor one group over
 another. However, Nigeria has a long history of tension among its diverse ethnic
 groups. Clashes continued between rival ethnic groups in Delta, Rivers, Benue,
 Cross River, and Taraba states, often resulting in bloodshed. Tradition continues to
 impose considerable pressure on individual government officials to favor their own
 ethnic group, and ethnic favoritism persists.The Ogoni, an ethnic group indigenous
 to Rivers state in eastern NigeriaNgeria's oil-preducing region), maintain that the
 Government continues to engage in a systematic campaign to deprive them of their
 land and its wealth.
 The Ogonis claim that the Government seizes Ogoni property without fair com-
 pensation, ignores the environmental impact of oil production on Ogoni land, and
 fails to provide adequate social services, such as water and electricity. MOSOP,
 which campaigns for greater Ogoni autonomy, often describes government policy to-
 wards the Ogeni as genocide. The confrontation between the Government and the
 Ogoni has increasingly turned violent (see Section l.a.), and Ogoni concerns about
 environmental degradation and the quality of social services in the oil-producing re-
 gion have some merit. Despite this, accusations that the Government is engaged in
 a genocidal campaign against the Ogoni are unfounded.
 Other ethnic minorities, particularly in Delta, Rivers, and Akwa Ibom states, have
 echoed Ogoni claims of environmental degradation and government indifference to
 their development. Groups such as the Ijaw, Itsekiri, and Urhobo have grown in-
 creasingly vocal in expressing their unhappiness, while the prevalence of ethnic con-
 flict and confrontation with government forces increased in these areas.
 Religious Minorities.-Nigerian law prohibits religious discrimination. Nonethe-
 less, it is commonly reported that government officials often discriminate against
 persons practicing a religion different from their own. Religious tensions often lead
 to violence as in April when clashes between Muslims and Christians in the north-
 ern city o? Jos resulted in hundreds of deaths and the partial destruction of the
 city's main market. A predominantly Christian city in a Muslim-dominated part of
 the country, Jos had long been championed as an example of Nigerian religious tol-
 erance. Residents in an overwhelmingly Christian part of the city rioted when the
 
 
 198
 military administrator of Plateau state (a Muslim from Kano) chose a Muslim rath-
 er than a Christian for the position of local government administrator. In September
 Muslims attacked and killed some Christian residents of the northern town of
 Potiskum, capital of Yobe state. In response the Christian Association of Nigeria
 issued a strong statement condemning the killigs and alleging official indifference
 to the incident.
 People With Disabilities.-While the Government called for private businesses to
 institute policies ensuring fair treatment to the 2 percent of the work force that it
 claims is disabled, it has not enacted any laws, including on accessibility to build-
 ings and public transportation, nor formulated any policy which specifically ensures
 the right of the disabled to work.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Abacha Government has left basic labor legisla-
 tion in place, essentially the 1974 Labor Decree. However, there are no constitu-
 tional safeguards preventing the Government from interfering in the administration
 of labor unions, and the Government added new decrees further restricting worker
 rights. Nigeria has signed and ratified the International Labor Organization's (ILO)
 Convention on Freedom of Association. On November 3 and 4, the ILO Committee
 on Freedom of Association heard a complaint by the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions the World Confederation of Labor, and the Organization of Afri-
 can Trade Union Unity against the Nigerian Government's labor policy. The ILO
 ruled that the Government's interference in the administration of labor unions and
 its restriction of worker rights is in direct contravention of ratified conventions. The
 Committee recommended that the Government remove appointed administrators
 from labor bodies, restore suspended union executives and allow them access to the
 premises of union headquarters, and restore dues check-off. At year's end the Gov-
 ernment had not responded.
 Workers, except members of the armed forces and employees designated essential
 by the Government, may join trade unions. Essential employees include firefighters,
 police, employees of the central bank, the security printers (printers of currency,
 passports, and government forms), and customs and excise staff. In May 1993, the
 vernment promulgated the Teaching Essential Services Decree, declaring edu-
 cation an essential service. The Decree did not, however, proscribe education sector
 unions. The National Labour Congress (NLC), Nigeria's umbrella labor federation,
 has repeatedly called on the Government to reinstate unions in all sectors of the
 economy except for the armed forces, firefighters, and the police.
 The vast majority (approximately 72 percent) of the work force is employed in ag-
 riculture. Agricultural workers are not unionized. Most of the informal sector and
 practically all small industries and businesses remain nonunionized. Approximately
 11.5 percent of the total work force belong to unions.
 In contravention of the ILO Convention on Freedom of Association, the Govern-
 ment has decreed a single central labor body, the NLC, and deregistered other
 unions. Government interference makes it difficult for the NLC to represent Nige-
 rian workers effectively. The NLC claims 3 million members out of a total work
 force of 30 million, but this figure is difficult to verify. The Government continued
 to resist attempts by senior government staff to form and register as an independent
 labor association the Senior Staff Consultative Association of Nigeria (SESCAN).
 The right to strike is recognized by law, except in the case of essential services.
 There are no laws prohibiting retribution against strikers and strike leaders, but
 strikers who feel they are facing unfair retribution may submit their cases to the
 Industrial Arbitration Panel, whose decisions are binding on all parties.
 In 1994 the labor movement engaged in large-scale strike action, including two
 general strikes, in support of K.O. Abiola and the prodemocracy movement. in re-
 sponse, the Government enacted decrees dismissing the executives of the NLC,
 PENGASSAN, and NUPENG and prohibiting legal challenges by offended unions to
 these decrees. The courts subsequently cited the latter in dismissing an NLC legal
 suit asking the courts to declare these decrees null and void.
 The crippling strike by petroleum workers began on July 4 and officially ended
 on August 17, when the Government dismissed the petroleum unions' executives. In
 the strike's aftermath, the Government continued to detain petroleum union lead-
 ers, including NUPENG General Secretary Frank Kokori and a number of other
 ranking labor leaders. By September, petroleum workers, frustrated by a lack of
 support from other Nigerians, returned to their jobs.
 Under the labor laws, any nonagricultural enterprise which employs more than
 50 employees is obliged to recognize trade unions and must pay or deduct a dues
 checkoff for employees who are members. The NLC has complained that some em-
 ployers deliberately organize their industries into multiple units employing less
 
 
 199
 than 50 workers to avoid unionization. The Government threatened to withdraw the
 dues checkoff provision and make the payment of union dues completely voluntary
 if unions pursue strikes. This was the case in Auust 1993 when the NLC called
 a general strike and again in September 1994 at The conclusion of the petroleum
 strike.
 In August 1991, the Government's Decree 32 amended a policy in effect since
 1975 that permitted international labor affiliation only with the Organization of Af-
 rican Trade Union Unity and affiliated pan-African labor federations. Decree 32 al-
 lowed affiliation with non-African international labor organizations but only for
 training and educational assistance. Since Decree 32, the NLC and SESCAN opened
 negotiations with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions seeking for-
 mal affiliation. The removal of the NLC executive and the protracted political con-
 frontation have precluded further progress on these applications.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Colletively.-The labor laws provide for
 both the right to organize and the right to bargain collectively between management
 and trade unions. Collective bargaining is, in fact, common in many sectors of the
 economy. Laws further protect workers against retaliation by employers for labor ac-
 tivity through an independent arm of the judiciary, the National Industrial Court,
 which handles complaints of antiunion discrimination. The NLC has complained,
 however, that the judicial system is often slow to handle labor cases and that this
 constitutes a denial of redress to those with legitimate complaints.
 There have been no significant reforms in labor practice since January 1991,
 when the Government abolished the uniform wage structure for all government en-
 tities. This allowed each tier of government-federal, state, local, and state-owned
 firms--freedom to negotiate its own level of wages, benefits, and conditions of em-
 ployment. As a result, negotiations previously conducted on a nationwide basis
 under the direct supervision of the Labor Ministry, are now conducted on a local,
 often plantwide, basis with less government involvement.
 At year's end, there were no fuinctioning export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1974 Labor Decree and the
 1989 Constitution prohibit forced or compulsory labor. While this prohibition is gen-
 erally observed in practice, the Lagos Task Force soldiers used forced labor to clean
 up community streets (see Section 1.c.). The ILO, noting that with the 1989 Con-
 stitution suspended Nigeria may not be able to enforce the ILO Convention against
 Forced Labor in the absence of constitutional guarantees, pressed the Government
 for its views on this pint, but at year's end the Government had not replied.
 d Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The 1974 Labor Decree prohibits
 employment of ciidrn under
 15year of age in'commerce and industry and restricts other child labor to home-
 basedagricultural or domestic work. The law further stipulates that children may
 not be employed in agricultural or domestic work for more than 8 hours per day.
 The Decree allows the apprenticeship of youths aged 13 to 15 under specific condi-
 tions. The Government does not specifically regulate service of apprentices over the
 age of 15.
 Primary education is compulsory, though rarely enforced, and recent studies
 showed declining enrollment due mainly to the continuing deterioration of public
 schools. This lack of sufficient primary school infrastructure has ended some fami-
 lies' access to education, forcing them to place their children on the employment
 market. The ILO and the U.N. Children's Fund, in consultation with the NW, have
 concluded that child labor, while not yet endemic, is increasing and could become
 a serious problem (see Section 5).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The 1974 Labor Decree sets a minimum w
 which is reviewed on an ad hoc basis. The last review in 1991 was undertaken y
 a tripartite group consisting of representatives of the NLC, the Nigeria Employers'
 Consultative Association, and the Ministry of Labor. It raised the monthly minimum
 wage from 250 naira to 450 naira per month, but the rapid fall in the true market
 rate of the naira (down to approximately 100 to the dollar by year's end), rendered
 the legislation essentially meaningless. The minimum wage as currently stipulated
 does not keep pace with inflation and does notprovide a decent living for a worker
 and family. The deteriorating economy, coupled with a high inflation rate, has re-
 duced the buying power of workers, leading to a marked decline in their standard
 of living. The high inflation rate is a frequent cause of strikes demanding large
 wage increases.
 The 1974 Labor Decree also establishes a 40-hour workweek, prescribes 2 to 4
 weeks of annual leave, and stipulates that workers are to be paid extra for hours
 worked over the legal limit. The Decree also states that workers who work on Sun-
 days and statutory public holidays must be paid a full day's pay in addition to their
 normal wages. There is no law prohibiting excessive compulsory overtime.
 
 
 200
 The 1974 Decree contains general health and safety provisions, some aimed spe-
 cifically at young or female workers. Employers must compensate injured workers
 and dependent survivors of those killed in industrial accidents. The Labor Decree
 does not provide workers the legal right to excuse themselves from dangerous work
 situations without loss of employment. The Labor Ministry which is charged with
 enforcement of these laws, has been largely ineffective, and violations are common
 and go largely unpunished. The Government has failed to act on various ILO rec-
 ommendations since 1991 to update its moribund inspection and accident-reporting
 program.
