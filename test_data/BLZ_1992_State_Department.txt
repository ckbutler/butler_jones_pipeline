 BELIZE
 Belize is a parliamentary democracy organized under a Constitution enacted in
 1981 upon independence from the United Kingdm. It is governed by a Prime Min-
 ister, a Cabinet of Ministers, and a Legislative Assembly. A Governor General rep-
 resents Queen Elizabeth II in the largely ceremonial role of Head of State. Both
 local and national elections are scheduled on a constitutionally prescribed basis.
 The Belize Defence Force (BDF) consists of regular and reserve infantry and small
 air and maritime wins. Defense spending has remained fairly constant over the
 past several years aabout $ million annually; there ae no plans to reduce it. The
 750-member Police Department is responsible for law enforcement and maintenance
 of order. It is responsible to and controlled by civilian authorities.
 Belize is a developing nation with an economy dependent primarily on agriculture.
 The Government fivors free enterprise and actively encourages increased invest-
 ment, both foreign and domestic. In 1991 the gross domestic product grew by 4.3
 percent in real terms, and the per capita gross domestic product was $2,051.
 Constitutional protections for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individ-
 ual, including women and all ethnic groups, are upheld by the judiciary. An active
 press and, increasingly, independent radio and television stations buttress the peo-
 ple's civil and political rights. However, there were a number of credible reports of
 police abuse and mistreatment during the year. In rpnse, the Government an-
 nounced the establishment of a Police Complaints Board n May. In addition, there
 continued to be credible reports of employer mistreatment of undocumented immi-
 grant workers in the banana industry.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated or other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punshment.-
 Torture or other cruel inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are ex-
 pressly forbidden by the Constitution. This prohibition is generally respected in
 practice, but there are occasional credible reports of mistreatment and abuse by po-
 lice. Allegations ofpolice abuse are investigated by the plice department, the new
 Police Complaints Board and on occasion, by special independent commissions ap-
 pointed by the Prime Minister. No police officer was charged for alleged human
 rights violations in 1992.
 in December 1990 the Government announced the formation of a Commission of
 Inquiry to investigate charges that the police had tortured a Guatemalan, Luis
 Arevalo, before deporting him in late October. The Commission held public and pri-
 vate hearings on the case and concluded in October 1992 that there was no evidence
 that Arevalo had been tortured or that the police had done anything improper. The
 Human Rights Commission of Belize (HRCB) was dissatisfied with the Arevalo re-
 port, alleging that the Commission's inquiry was not thorough.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest or detention, and these provisions are respected in practice. A detainee must
 be informed of the cause of detention within 48 hours of arrest and must be brought
 before a court within 72 hours. In practice, detainees are normally informed imme-
 diately of the charges against them. Bal is granted in all but the most serious
 cases. However, many detainees cannot make bail, and backlogs in the judicial sys-
 tem often result in considerable delays and postponements of hearings, resulting in
 overcrowded prisons and prolonged incarceration without trial.
 Exile is forbidden by the Constitution and does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Persons accused of civil or criminal offenses have
 constitutional rights to presumption of innocence, protection against self-incrimina-
 tion, defense by counsel, public trial, and appeal. Trial by jury is mandatory in cap-
 ital cases. Those convicted by either a magistrate's court or the Supreme Court of
 Belize may appeal to the Court of Appeal. In some cases, including those resulting
 in a capital sentence the convicted party may make a final appeal to the Queen's
 Privy Council in the United Kingdom.
 These constitutional guarantees are respected in practice, although the judiciary's
 independence of the executive branch has been questioned by observers who note
 
 
 336
 that judges must negotiate their contracts with the Government and may thus be
 vulnerable to political interference. The Supreme Court and magistrate courts suffer
 backlogs aggravated by the inability to maintain a full complement of judges.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitary Ineerence with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.--Con.
 stitutional provisions for the protection of personal property, privacy of home and
 person, anI recognition of human dignity are generally honored by the Government.
 Police are required to obtain warrants before searching private yroperty except
 when they have a reasonable suspicion that a crime is being committed and do not
 have time to obtain a warrant. This requirement is obeyed in practice. Customs offi-
 cers do not require a warrant to search private property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and the press are protected
 under the Constitution and by local custom. In practice, all viewpoints are publicly
 presented without goernment interference. Five privately owned weekly news-
 papers, two of them fiercely partisan, engage in lively debate of the issues. The op-
 position press is a frequent critic of government officials and policies. All news-
 papers are subject to the constraints of libel laws.
 With the introduction n 1990 of Radio KREM, Belize's first privately owned com-
 mercial raio station, the government monopoly of radio ended. The Belize Broad-
 casting Network was removed from direct government control, restructured as an
 autonomous corporation, and renamed the Broadcasting Corporation of Belize (BCB)
 in September 1990. Since then, broadcast media have become considerably more
 open.The popular call-in programs on the private radio station are lively and fea-
 ture open criticism of and comment on government and political matters. Continu-
 ing indirect government influence over the BCB, which depends on government fi-
 nancial support, sometimes affects editorial decisions regarding news and feature
 n privately owned television broadcasting stations, including several cable
 networks, o  rate in Belize. Of these, only the BCB's Channel 3 and the recently
 inaugurated independent Channel 5 produce local news and feature prog         .
 Broadcasting in Belize is regulated by the Belize Broadcasting Authority  BA)
 which asserts its right to authorize certain broadcasts, such as those with political
 content, and to delete any defamatory or personally libelous material from the polit-
 ical broadcasts of both parties before these are aired. As far as is known, the BBA
 did not exercise this authority during 1992.
 Academic freedom is provided for by law and respected in practice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly is con-
 stitutionally assured and honored in practice. Political parties and other groups with
 political objectives freely hold rallies and mass meetings. The organizers of public
 meetings must obtain a permit 36 hours in advance of the meetings; such permits
 are not denied for political reasons. Under the Constitution Belizeans are free to
 form and join associations of their choice, both political and nonpoliticaL
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion in Belize. All groups may wor-
 ship as they choose, and all groups and churches may establish places of worship,
 trai clergy, and maintain contact with coreligionists abroad. There is an active mis-
 sionary presence. In church publications and from the pulpit, church leaders com-
 ment on government and political policies as these affect the social welfare of the
 country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country Foreign Travel,  t'.twn and Re.
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within te country.
 Foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation are unrestricted.
 As many as 40,000 Central Americans from neighboring countries have taken up
 residence in Belize since 1980 many of them entering illegally and living in Belize
 without documentation. The dovernment of Belize has been generous in conferring
 refugee status on many of the new arrivals and providing them with assistance.
 However, the sheer number-of refugees and other immigrants strained government
 social services, while the highly visible presence of recent immigrants in the labor
 force and the marketplace provoked widespread resentment among native-born
 Belizeans.
 The Government continues to address these problems. Working with the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Belize has undertaken a vari-
 ety of projects aimed at defusing resentment of the refugees. In 1991 the Govern-
 ment enacted legislation implementing the provisions of the 1951 United Nations
 Convention on Refugees, which Belize ratified in 1990. The refugee law clarified the
 distinction between refugees and illegal immigrants and established an Office on
 Refugee Affairs within the Foreign Mimstry. The HRCB complained that law en-
 
 
 337
 forcement authorities sometimes arrested and deported as illegal aliens refugees
 who were not in possession of their refugee identification cards, and who were not
 given the opportunity to prove their legal status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citiens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Belize is a functioning democracy governed by a Legislative Assemby, with execu-
 tive direction coming from a Cabinet of Ministers headed by Prime Minister George
 Price. By constitutional mandate, the Governor General instructs the leader of the
 majority party of the Legislative Assembly to form a government following national
 elections, which must be-held at least once every 5 years. Municipal and town board
 officials are elected in local contests at 3-year intervals.
 All elections ae by secret ballot, and suffrage is universal for Belizean citizens
 18 years and older. National political parties include the People's United Party
 (PUP), the United Denoatic Party (UDP), and the National Alliance for Belizean
 Rights (NABR).The Government change handsf for the second time since inde-
 when the PUP won a majority of parlamentry seats on September 4,
 UDP and PUP dominate Belizean political life, and each    s member-
 ship includes all segments of Belie's diverse n   grouping. Women hld appoint-
 re offices-the Governor General and the President of the Senate-as well as other
 important positions in the public sector, but women in elected office are rare.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local and international human rights groups operate freely, and the Government
 cooperates with independent investigations ofhuman rights conditions in Belize.
 The Human Rights Commission of Belize (HRCB), a nongovernmental organiza-
 tion that opened offices in late 1987, cooperates with Amnesty International and is
 affiliated with regional human rights organizations. The HRCB was active in 1992
 on a rane of issues, including refugee and agricultural workers' rights, cases of al.
 leged police abuse, and cases of alleged illegal deportations of Central American na-
 tionls.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Belize is a multiracial, multiethnic country, and the Government actively pro-
 motes tolerance and cross-cultural understanding. Discrimination on ethnic or reli.
 gious grounds is illegal and is not common, although ethnic tension, particularly re-
 sentment of Central American immigrants, continues to be a problem.
 Despite constitutional provisions of equality, Belizean women face some social and
 economic prejudices. For example, women can find it more difficult than men to ob-
 tain business and agricultural financing and other resources. Most employed women
 are concentrated in female-dominated occupations with traditionally 16w status and
 wages. The Government worked to ameliorate this problem by funding a Women's
 Bureau, charged with developing programs to improve the status of women in
 Belize. Founded in 1981, the Women's Bureau was upgraded in 1986 to a depart-
 ment within the Ministry of Labor and Social Services. A number of officially reg.
 istered women's groups work closely with various government ministries in promot-
 social awareness rogma.Women have access to education and are active in
 alr-pher of nationa life, but relatively few are found in top managerial positions.
 While the law mandates that women receive equal pay for equal work, women wage
 earners often earn less than men in similar jobs. Women am not impeded from own-
 ing or mana"ging land or other real property.
 omestic violence against women is a   e  c problem. In 1985 a group of Belize
 City residents formed the Belize Women Against Violence Movement (WAV), which
 now has branches elsewhere in the country. The group runs a shelter for battered
 wives and a hotle for rape victims and has obtained cooperation from the Min-
 istries of Home Affairs and Education. The Government's commitment to increasing
 prtection for women is affirmed in its Policy Statement on Women, the effective
 policy guidance for the work of the Women's Bureau. Landmark legislation on do-
 mestic violence was passed by the National Assembly in November 1992.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-By statute and in practice Belizean workers ame free
 to establish and join trade unions. Thirteen independent unions, with an estimated
 9.8 percent of the labor force, represent a cross-section of white-collar, bluecllar,
 and professional workers, including most civil service employees. The unions are
 recognized by the Ministry of Labor after they file with the 0fice of Registry. Mem-
 bers are empowered to draft the by-laws and constitutions of their unions, and they
 ame free to elect offiers from among the membership at large. Unions which choose
 
 
 338
 not to hold elections may act as representatives for their membership, but the Na-
 tional Trade Union Congress of Belize (NTUC) only permits unions which hold free
 and annual elections of officers to join its ranks. By both law and precedent, unions
 are effectively protected against dissolution or suspension by administrative author-
 Although no unions are officially affiliated with political parties, several are clear-
 ly allied with one or the other of the two main parties. Unions freely exercise the.
 right to form federations and confederations and affiliate with international organi-
 zations. Unions are legally permitted to strike, but unions representing essential
 services may strike on  after giving 21 days' notice to the Ministry concerned. In
 July the Public Service Union (PSU) and several independent observers charged the
 Government with interference in the internal affairs of the union during a salary
 dispute. The union claimed that the Government encouraged an 'ad hoc committee
 within the union to urge acceptance of a government wage offer, thereby undercut-
 ting the union leadership's efforts to negotiate pa raises. Following a vote in favor
 of accepting the offer by  SU member who attened the adhoc cmmittee meeting,
 the Government instituted the wage increase.
 b. The Right to Organize and argain Colectively.--Coll_cive bargaining is pro-
 tected in law and freely practiced throughout the country. Wages are set in free ne-
 gotiations between employers and unions or, more commonly, simp~ly offered by em-
 ployer. In practice, the Labor Commissioner acts as a conciliator in deadloked col-
 lective bargaining negotiations between labor and management, offering nonbinding
 counsel to both sides. Historically, the Commissioner's guidance has been volun-
 tarily accepted. However, should either union or management choose not to accept
 the conciliator's decision, both are entitled to a legal hearing of the ase, provided
 that it is linked to some valid provision of civil or criminal law.
 The Constitution prohibits antiunion discrimination    before and ater the
 union is registered. Theoretically, unions may freely organize. In practie, however,
 employers are not legally required to recognize a union as a bargaining agent, and
 some employers have been known to block union organization by terminating the
 employment of key union sympathizers, usually on grounds purportedly unrelated
 to union activities. Effective redress is extremely difficult in suh situations. Tech-
 nically, a worker may file a complaint with the Labor Department, but it has been
 virtually impossible to prove that a termination was due to union activity.
 Belizes two export processing zones are not exempt from the Labor Code. There
 are no unions in the exprt processing zones, however, reflecting the general weak-
 ness of organized labor inthe country, as noted above.
  . Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Fored labor is forbidden by the
 Constitution and is not known to occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chi/dren.-The minimum age of employment
 in Belize is 14 years, or 17 years for employment near hazardous machinery. Ijspec-
 tots from the Ministries of Labor and Education enforce this regulation, although
 in recent years school truancy officers, who have historically borne the brunt of the
 enforcement burden, have been less active. Children between 5 and 14 are required
 to attend school. In practice, there ae ar many truants and dropouts.
 e. Acceptable Condtons of Work-In 1992 the Government established new mini-
 mum wages for manual workers and for agricultural workers. Domestic workers,
 shop assistants and workers paid on a piece-work basis are not covered by the mini-
 mum wage           Ministry of Labor is charged with enforcing the legal minimum
 wage, which is generally respected in practice. The minimum wage as a sole source
 of income is inadequiate to provide a uecent standard of living for a worker and his
 family. Most salaried workers receive more than the minimum wage.
 No worker is obliged to work mere than 6 days or 45 hours per week. Payment
 for overtime work is obligatory, as is an annual paid vacation of 2 weeks. A path-
 work of health and safety regulations covers numerous industries, and these regula-
 tions are enforced in varying degrees by the Ministries of Labor and Public Health.
 Enforcement is not universal countrywide, and in 1992 the limited inspection and
 investigative resources wern committed principally to urban and more_ accessible
 rural areas where labor, health, and safety complaints had been registered.
 There continued to be reports of employers who routinely fail to pay workers. Un-
 documented foreign workers, especially in the banana industry, are particularly vul-
 nerable to this practice. The working conditions of undocumented Cntral American
 banana workers in Stann Creek District are a cause of major concern to labor and
 human rights officials. Workers have complained to the Human Rights Commission
 of Belize about impure drinking water, lack of electricity, inadequate schooling, and
 poor medical care, in addition to nonpayment of wages. In 1992 a government iabor
 inspector was assigned to the area to promote improved living conditions and to re-
 solve wage disputes.
