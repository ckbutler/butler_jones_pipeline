 MACAU
 Macau, a tiny enclave comprised of a peninsula and two islands on the south
 China coast andencompassing only 6 square miles, is recognized by both China and
 Portugal as Chinese territory under Portuguese administration. The "Organic Stat-
 ute" of 1976, which serves as Macau's constitution, grants it considerable adminis-
 trative, financial, and legislative autonomy. Legislative power is shared by the Por.
 tuguese Government and the territory's Legislative Assembly. Macau's Governor,
 appointed by the Portuguese President, holds expansive powers under the statute.
 Portuguese Metropolitan Law serves as the basis for the legal system, which fea-
 tures an independent judiciary and jury trials. legislation this year provided for the
 establishment of a Supreme Court of Justice. The police force is firmly under the
 control of the civilian authorities. Macau's economy is fueled by legalized gambling,
 which has produced a thriving tourist industry, and by the export of textiles and
 other light industrial products. With a population of less than half a million people,
 Maau has a per capita gross domestic product of over $8,000.
 Under the 1987 Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, Macau will become a Special
 Administrative Region (SAR) of China on December 20, 1999, and operate under a
 principle of "one country, two systems," with the enclave's social, economic, and
 legal systems to remain unchanged for 50 years. The Macau SAR's future constitu-
 tion, called the "basic law," is expected to be promulgated in 1993.
 Citizens of Macau enjoy a wide range of rights and freedoms. The fundamental
 human rights contained in the Portuguese Constitution apply in Macau, and China
 has promised to include "relevant sections" of the International Covenant on Civil
 and Political Rights in the basic law. The principal human rights problem in the
 territory of Macau involves the restriction of the right of citizens to change their
 government or determine their political futures: Macaus Governor is appointed by
 the Portuguese President, only a third of legislators are directly elected, and the ter-
 ritory's future path has been set largely by Lisbon and Beijing.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Government authorities do not prac-
 tice these abuses.
 b. Disappearance.The authorities do not practice or condone secret arrests or
 clandestine confinements.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Such abuses are prohibited by law and were not known to occur in 1992.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal prohibitions against arbitrary ar-
 rest exist and ar honored. The examining judge, who conducts a pretrial inquiring
 criminal cases, has a wide range of powers to collect evidence, order or dismiss in-
 dictments, validate and maintain the detention of suspects, and determine whether
 to release accused persons. Persons remanded in custody must be presented to an
 examining judge within 48 hours of being detained. The accused's counsel may ex-
 amine the evidence. f the judge is not convinced that the evidence is adequate, he
 may dismiss the accused. Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Triai-Fair trial is guaranteed and practiced. The courts
 are independent of the executive, and juries determine questions of fact in criminal
 cases. At present, Macau's courts are integrated into the Portuguese judicial system,
 and decisions are appcalable to the superior Portuguese courts. However, Macau is
 scheduled to set up a Supreme Court some time in 1993. This move will give the
 enclave nearly complete judicial autonomy, although in cases involving "basic rights
 of the citizend defed. The appeal to Portugal's Constitutional Court, which can
 overturn all lower court rulings.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Macau
 currently has laws ensuring the inviolability of the home and of communication, the
 right of ownership of private property and of enterprises, and the freedom to marry
 and raise a family. There is no indication of any abuses either condoned or practiced
 v the  nvernnent t.hrities.
 
 
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Independent or critical opinions receive consist-
 ent airing on radio and television and in public forums. The Government owns a
 majority share of the radio and television service and ensures that all candidates
 receive equal time during election campaigns. However, freedom of the press is more
 restricted. Most of Macau's newspapers are pro-China publications that do not give
 equal coverage to liberal and prodemocracy forces. Self-censorship is growing among
 newspaper reporters, some of whom express fears that they will lose their jobs if
 they criticize China or government policy. The academic community is free to ex-
 press its views, though some academics report that they avoid research on topics
 that entail criticism of China.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Legal guarantees exist and are
 largely observed. However, the Government in 1992 attempted to enforce a ban on
 gatherings within 50 meters of government buildings, which would exclude dem-
 onstrations from the city center and allow them only on outlying islands.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Macau is a predominantly Buddhist society. Members of
 other religious may and do exist and practice their religious freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-No restrictions exist on movement within the enclave; emigration and
 foreign travel are unlimited. The Government reports that about 100,000 of Macau's
 400,000 inhabitants have the right of abode in Portugal.
 The Government's official policy since 1982 has been to guide all Vietnamese boat
 people arriving in Macau waters to Hong Kong territorial waters. There were no ar-
 rivals of boat people in Macau in 1992. The 20 remaining beat people remaining in
 Macau live in public housing and work in the local economy.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have only a limited ability to change their government. In a by-election
 in the summer, 6 members were added to the Legislative Assembly (2 appointed,
 2 elected, 2 indirectly elected through functional constituencies). The 23-member
 Legislative Assembly is comprised of 8 members elected in universal, direct elec-
 tions; 8 indirectly elected by local community interests; and 7 appointed by the Gov-
 ernor. The Consultative Council, an advisory group to the Governor composed of
 elected and appointed members, also provides some measure of popular representa-
 tion. The Macau Government, by tradition, also consults informally on a regular
 basis with local business and cultural leaders.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights organizations operate freely in Macau, and Amnesty Inter-
 national sent a delegation to study a final draft of the basic law, the constitution
 of the future SAR. The delegation was received by Macau government authorities.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Freedom from discrimination is guaranteed by law. However, in practice Macau's
 governmental and legal systems place a premium on knowledge of the Portuguese
 language, which is spoken by less than 4 percent of the population. Thus, about 60
 percent of the approximately 130 senior government officials come from Portugal.
 ost of the other middle and upper ranking civil servants are Macanese-Eurasians
 of Chinese and Portuguese descent. There is significant public pressure for the Gov-
 ernment to speed up the process of making the civil service more representative of
 the population. In January the Government gave the Chinese language official sta-
 tus and the same legal force as Portuguese.
 Traditionally, women have played a minor role in local political life. However,
 they are becoming more active and visible in business and government, and some
 enjoy considerable influence and responsibility in these areas. Women are members
 of the Legislative Assembly and Cabinet, and many hold senior posts in the civil
 service.
 Cases of violence against women are not common. For cases that are reported,
 Macau's criminal statutes prohibiting domestic violence are enforced and violators
 prosecuted. Police and doctors report abuses to the Social Welfare Department,
 which investigates them. If hospital treatment is required, a medical social worker
 counsels the victim and informs her about social welfare services. Until their com-
 plaints are resolved, battered women may be placed in public housing, but no facili-
 ties are reserved especially for them.

 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Macau labor law recognizes the right and freedom
 of all workers to form and join trade unions and of private sector unions to strike.
 The Government neither impedes the formation of trade unions nor discriminates
 against union members. One major strike occurred in 1992 when garbage collectors
 walked out. The police are legally prohibited from striking but occasionally engage
 in massive "job actions" which are strikes in all 'but name.
 Local trade union activities, including the selection of union leadership, are heav-
 ily influenced by mainland Chinese interests, which stress the importance of stabil-
 ity and minimum disruption of the work force. Nearly all of Macau's 7,000 private
 sector union members belong to a pro-PRC labor confederation. Many local observ-
 ers claim that this organization is more interested in furthering the PRC political
 agenda in Macau than in addressing classic trade union issues. A few private sector
 unions and, two of the four public sector unions are outside PRC control.
 Macau unions may freely form federations and affiliate with international bodies.
 Three civil service unions are affiliated with the major non-Communist Portuguese
 union confederation, which itself has international labor ties.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions tend to resemble local
 traditional neighborhood associations, promoting social and cultural activities rather
 than issues reating to the workplace. Local custom, moreover, normally favors em-
 ployment without the benefit of written labor contracts--except in the case of impor-
 tation of labor from China. Reflecting PRC influence, unions traditionally have not
 attempted to engage in collective bargaining. While Portuguese laws protecting col-
 lective bargaining apply to Macau, the Government does not impede or discourage
 it. There are no government mechanisms to promote voluntary negotiations.
 There is no minimum wage law in Macau; wages are set by the market. Por-
 tuguese law applied to Macau prohibits antiunion discrimination. There were no
 complaints about this issue in 1992. There are no export processing zones in Macau.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor is illegal and
 does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Minors under the age of 15 are
 forbidden legally to work except in businesses operated by their families. The law
 is enforced by the Macau Labor Department, which refers offending employers to
 the judicial authorities for prosecution. The Labor Department claims that the inci-
 dence of child labor has declined radically since effective enforcement began in 1985.
 There were two prosecutions for child labor violations in 1992.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In the absence of any statutory minimum wage
 or publicly administered social security program, some large companies have pro-
 vided private welfare and security packages. Calls for labor reform, medical insur-
 ance, a social security system, and increases in employee compensation figure regu-
 larly in political campaign platforms. To offset a current labor shortage, the Macau
 Government allows the importation of labor from China under contract, while at the
 same time imposing heavy fines on employers harboring illegal immigrants. Roughly
 12,000 imported Chinese laborers are now in Macau, most working on construction
 of the new airport. The number of imported workers in other jobs totals between
 2,000 and 3,000 out of an estimated work force of 195,000.
 Existing labor legislation provides for a 48-hour workweek, (regularly 8 hours per
 day, but no more than 102 hours per day)l overtime, annual leave, medical and
 maternity care, and employee compensation insurance. The Department of Labor
 provides assistance and legal advice to workers on requestl but government enforce-
 ment of labor laws can be lax because of limited resources.
 Laws on occupational safety and health are enforced by the Labor Department
 which reported 1,171 infractions of occupational safety and health laws through
 mid-November, mostly in the construction sector. Failure to correct infractions leads
 to government prosecution.
