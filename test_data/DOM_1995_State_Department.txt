 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Constitution of the Dominican Republic provides for a popularly elected Presi-
 dent and a bicameral Congress. In practice, the system heavily favors the executive
 branch, headed by seven-term President Joaquin Balaguer. The Senate appoints jus-
 tices to the Supreme Court, which heads an only nominally independent judiciary.
 Political parties representing the ideological spectrum from left to right freely par-
 ticipatein elections.
 The National Police, the National Department of Investigations, the National
 Drug Control Directorate (DNCD), and the military (army, air force, and navy) form
 the security services. The Government controls all the security services, which are
 generally responsive to civilian executive branch authority. However, some members
 of the security forces continued to commit human rights abuses with the tacit acqui-
 escence of the civil authorities.
 The economy, once heavily dependent on sugar, has diversified; tourism and ex-
 ort processing zones (EPZ's) are now major sources of income and employment.
 tate-owned firms such as the State Sugar Council (CEA), the Consortium of State
 Enterprises, and the Dominican Electricity Corporation remain heavily involved in
 the economy, and their financial and administrative difficulties still impede eco-
 nomic growth.
 Principal human rights problems included continuing instances of police killings
 of civilians, arbitrary detention and beatings of suspects, security services' refusal
 to obey judicial orders, judicial corrupti on ,  ala disin of the courts, poor
 prison conditions, and abuses of Haitian migrant workers. Workers in the state-
 owned sugar plantations and mills continued to work under deplorable conditions.
 EPZ workers achieved some gains with the signing of collective contracts and other
 agreements. Discrimination, violence against women, and prostitution are also seri-
 ous problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings, but there were several instances of extrajudicial killings by the police. Po-
 lice use of excessive force led to at least 26 civilian deaths. Some killings occurred
 as a result of personal disputes, but others clearly were the result of excessive force
 while persons were in custody or during civil disturbances. The authorities usually
 discharge police personnel for carrying out extrajudicial killings and submit their
 cases to civilian justice.
 In March three officers were dishonorably discharged and handed over to civilian
 justice after a 17-year-old boy died in their custody. Witnesses said the officers had
 beaten the young man before throwing him into their car. The case was still pend-
 ingin court at year's end.
 In September two police officers were dishonorably discharged and handed over
 to civilian courts after investigators determined they had murdered two individuals
 accused by them of having robbed the house of one of the police officers. The officers
 shot the two victims several times and threw them off a bridge into the sea. One
 officer jumped in the water to finish the job when he saw one of the victims was
 still moving. The case was pending in court at the end of the year.
 Military courts try military personnel charged with extrajudicial killings. Police
 tribunals have on occasion tried, convicted, and sentenced personnel charged with
 extrajudicial killings. However, there were no cases reported during the year.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The 1994 disappearance of Autonomous University of Santo Domingo Professor
 Narciso Gonzalez remains unresolved. The Gonzalez family, assisted by the Domini-
 can Human Rights Commission, filed a complaint in Santo Domingo courts pressing
 for a full investigation, but the courts have not pursued the case aggressively.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other forms of physical abuse are illegal, but there continued to be in-
 stances of security service personnel physically abusing detainees.
 The authorities usually order little or no punishment for perpetrators of such
 abuse. Although punishment may range up to 5 years' incarceration for serious
 
 
 cases of abuse, as a rule judges have sentenced convicted officials to sentences rang-
 ing from a 1-month suspension to 6 months' incarceration.
 Prisons are overcrowded, and health and sanitary conditions are substandard.
 Some prison personnel reportedly engage in extortion and other corrupt activities,
 and most prisoners find it necessary to rely on relatives or their own finances to
 be fed adequately. Prison authorities allowed gangs to operate inside the prisons;
 these gangs were responsible for several deaths and ran active drug markets and
 prostitution rings. Corrupt practices by prison personnel and overcrowding at the
 main La Victoria prison led to several days of rioting, resulting in the deaths of at
 least five inmates. Prison authorities subsequently transferred all of the prison per-
 sonnel to other functions outside the prison and transferred several hundred pris-
 oners to other facilities to ease the overcrowding. Medical care suffers from a lack
 of supplies and available physicians. Dominican authorities estimate the number of
 minors incarcerated in adult prisons at between 1,500 to 2,500 (see Section 5).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution stipulates that authori-
 ties may detain suspects for a maximum of 48 hours for investigation before ar-
 raignment, after which they must charge or release them. However, in special cir-
 cumstances, suspects may be detained for longer periods with the approval of the
 prosecutor's office. Security service officials continued routinely to violate constitu-
 tional provisions by detaining suspects for "investigation" or "interrogation" beyond
 the prescribed 48-hour limit. Law 'enforcement authorities traditionally detain all
 suspects and witnesses to a crime and use the investigative process to determine
 which ones are innocent and merit release and which ones they should continue to
 hold. Civil authorities have not employed sufficient efforts to address these wide-
 spread abuses.
 Despite announcements to the contrary, the DNCD and National Police continued
 to engage in indiscriminate roundups of people in poorer neighborhoods. Early in
 the year, the Supreme Court ruled against searches of homes by DNCD agents after
 6 p.m. However, in November Congress amended the drug law to allow searches at
 any time of the day, as long as they are carried out in accordance with a written
 order by the Attorney General or the investigating prosecutor, and in the presence
 of a court official. The security services also continued occasionally to detain rel-
 atives of suspected criminals with the aim of forcing the surrender of suspects. Civil
 authorities have taken no action to curb these abuses.
 The National Police and the DNCD persisted in their refusal to release some pris-
 oners and detainees who had been granted judicial release orders. Law enforcement
 and other governmental authorities cited judicial corruption as the justification for
 this noncompliance. In some of these cases involving narcotics or terrorist-related
 crimes, it appeared that evidence merited pursuing the cases in the judicial system.
 Although the right to judicial determination of the legality of detention exists, pre-
 trial detention is legal and commonly employed. This custom, coupled with a lack
 of administrative and financial support for the system, creates a major backlog of
 cases, which in turn causes suspects to suffer long periods of pretrial detention that
 sometimes exceed possible sentences.
 While the law does not prohibit exile, there are no known cases of citizens in
 forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution stipulates an independ-
 ent judiciary, in practice, interference from other public and private entities, includ-
 ing the executive branch, substantially undermines judicial independence.
 The judicial system is in a state of transition as the National Congress has failed
 to form the National Judicial Council mandated by constitutional reforms enacted
 in 1994. When implemented, the reforms would end the Senate's exclusive role in
 appointing judges and establish a professional career service for judges, including
 potential life-term appointments. Until these reforms are in place, the overall auton-
 omy of the judiciary is in question.
 rfle Constitution provides for public trial. The courts normally appoint lawyers at
 public expense for indigent defendan inin felony criminal cases but rarely in crimi-
 nal misdemeanor cases. The judicial process is plagued by chronic delays; of the
 penal system's approximately 11,000 detainees, only about 10 percent have been
 convicted. As noted above, many suspects suffer long periods of pretrial detention
 that sometimes exceed maximum possible criminal penal ties.
 The judicial system provides for bail. However, cass in which bail is posted rarely
 come to trial, circumventing the intended purpose of bail.
 Military or police curtsihave jurisdiction over members of the armed forces and
 police, but a military or police bard frequently remands cases involving capital
 crimes (murder, rape, etc.) to civilian courts after review.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Apart
 from occasional exceptions, the Government does not arbitrarily interfere with the
 private lives of persons or families and generally observes constitutional provisions
 against invasion of the home. The authorities may only search a residence in the
 presence of a prosecutor or an assistant prosecutor, or in cases of "hot pursuit" and
 instances where there is reason to believe that a crime is in progress.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for these freedoms, and the
 Government usually respects them in practice.
 Dominicans of all political persuasions exercise freedom of speech. The numerous
 privately owned radio and television stations broadcast all political points of view.
 A 1971 law prohibits foreign-language broadcasts.
 The Government controls one television station but no major newspapers. News-
 papers freely reflect independent and opposition points of view. Although journalists
 operate in a relatively tolerant environment, a certain amount of self-censorship ex-
 ists for fear of retaliation, ranging from loss of influence to loss of one's job. Eco-
 nomic considerations also inhibit free expression, as all the principal media outlets
 are owned by powerful economic consortiums or wealthy, influential families. In ad-
 dition, some journalists solicit, or are responsive to, bribes to generate reports.
 The DNCD waged a campaign to destroy material which it regards as promoting
 or condoning the use of drugs. Clothing and music tapes deemed by the DNCD to
 promote drug use were publicly incinerated, along with confiscated drugs. Some of
 these materials were forcibly removed from their owners.
 Public and private universities enjoy broad academic freedom. The main public
 university, the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo, with approximately
 35,000 students, has no restrictions on enrollment and maintains a policy of non-
 intervention (other than curriculum development) in classroom affairs. The Govern-
 ment exerts no control over private universities except for the preservation of stand-
 ards, and teachers are free to espouse their own theories without government over-
 sight.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these freedoms, which the Government commonly respects in practice. Outdoor pub-
 lic marches and meetings require permits which the Government usually grants. Po-
 litical parties freely affiliate with their foreign counterpart organizations. Profes-
 sional organizations of lawyers, doctors, teachers, and others function freely and can
 maintain relations with counterpart international bodies of diverse political philoso-
 phies.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination on religious
 grounds, and the Government does not interfere with the practice of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens face no unusual legal restrictions on travel within or outside
 the country. Throughout the year, Dominican military personnel repatriated un-
 documented Haitian nationals believed to be in the country illegally. The expulsions
 occurred in various regions of the country; human rights groups estimated that the
 authorities expelled between several hundred and perhaps as many as 2,000 Hai-
 tians. Some of these were legal resident Haitians and persons of Haitian ancestry
 who may have claims to Dominican citizenship. The authorities did not allow the
 Haitians the opportunity to establish their possible claims to citizenship.
 Since the 1991 coup in Haiti, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) accorded refugee status to 1,341 Haitians who fled to the Dominican Re-
 public. Although the Government began processing petitions for Dominican recogni-
 tion of the UNHCR wards in 1991 only 10 percent have been granted such status.
 Some Haitians returned to Haiti following the restoration of democracy there.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In August the Supreme Court upheld the legalities of the constitutional reforms
 enacted in 1994, based on the Pact for Democracy. As a result of these reforms,
 residential elections are scheduled for May 16, 1996. Among other things, the re-
 forms also limited the current presidential term to 2 years, prohibited consecutive
 presidential reelection, and established the threshold for victory in the first round
 at 50 percent of the vote.
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy. The President, all 150
 members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, and the mayors and city council
 members of more than 100 municipalities are freely elected every 4 years by secret
 ballot and universal suffrage (except for active duty military and police, who may
 
 
 396
 not vote). The President appoints the governors of the 29 provinces. Opposition
 groups of the left, right, and center operate openly.
 Although the nation has a functioning multiparty system, in practice the Presi-
 dent dominates public policy formulation and implementation. He exercises his au-
 thority through use of the veto, discretion to act by decree, and influence as the
 leader of his party. The Congress traditionally has had limited powers, although the
 current Congress is showing greater autonomy than its predecessors in substantially
 modifying proposals submitted by the executive branch. The Congress also provides
 an open forum for the free exchange of views and debate. The governing Reformed
 Christian Social Party has a 1-vote majority in the 30-seat Senate when it combines
 its 14 votes with 1 vote from the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) and 1 vote from
 the Democratic Union (UD). Similarly, it has in coalition with the PLD a working
 plurality in the Chamber of Deputies.
 Women and minorities confront no serious legal or practical impediments to politi-
 cal participation. Women hold 8 of the country's 29 appointed governorships, 5 cabi-
 net-level executive branch positions, 14 seats in the 120-member House of Deputies,
 and 1 seat in the 30-member Senate.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigations of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental human rights organizations operate freely without government
 interference. In addition to the Dominican Human Rights Committee (CDH), several
 other Haitian, church, and labor groups exist. The Government has been slow to ac-
 knowledge requests for information and criticism from some international human
 rights organizations. It has refused to respond to criticisms leveled by the U.N.
 Human Rights Commission in 1993 regarding its treatment of Haitian refugees.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on race and sex. Such discrimination ex-
 ists in society, but the Government has not acknowledged its existence or made ef-
 forts to combat it.
 Women.-Domestic violence and sexual harassment are widespread. According to
 one report, approximately 7,000 rapes occur annually, but victims report only 1,500
 cases to the police. There are no laws protecting citizens from abuse by their
 spouses, and victims rarely report such abuse.
 Dominican women are victims of rings which smuggle third-world women to Eu-
 rope to work as prostitutes in conditions rife with exploitation and mistreatment.
 The Government does not vigorously enforce prostitution laws but does periodically
 prosecute organized alien smuggling rings. Corruption and a reluctance to restrict
 emigration hinder enforcement of the law.
 Women traditionally have not shared equal social and economic status or oppor-
 tunity with men, and men hold the overwhelming majority of leadership positions
 in all sectors. In many instances, women are paid less than men in jobs of equal
 content and equal skill level. Divorce is easily obtainable by either spouse, and
 women can hold property in their own names apart from their husbands. Congress
 for the second year in a row took no action on pending legislative proposals to en-
 hance women's status under the Civil and Penal Codes.
 Children.-The Government has not supported its professed commitment to child
 welfare with financial and human resources. Despite the existence of government
 institutions dedicated to child welfare, private social and religious organizations
 carry the principal burden. The most serious abuse involving children is the failure
 of the judicial system to respect the status of minors in criminal cases. In Septem-
 ber the Congress passed legislation establishing minors' courts which are in part de-
 signed to alleviate this problem. The authorities sometimes treated minors as adults
 and incarcerated them in prison rather than juvenile detention centers. One group
 of concerned attorneys reported that there are more than 344 minors in the coun-
 try's main prison. Prison authorities transferred some of these juveniles to juvenile
 centers or simply released others. A great many remain at the main prison, serving
 sentences longer than those the courts had prescribed.
 According to local monitors, the incidence of child abuse is underreported because
 of traditional beliefs that family problems should be dealt with inside the family.
 Sporadic instances of Haitian child labor on sugar plantations continued to occur
 (see Section 6.d.). A new Minor's Code went into effect on January 1. The Code con-
 tains provisions against child abuse, including physical and emotional mistreatment,
 sexual exploitation, and child labor. It also provides for removal of a mistreated or
 delinquent child to a protective environment.
 
 
 397
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled persons encounter discrimination in employ-
 ment and the provision of other services. Although a September 1991 law contains
 provisions for physical access far the disabled to all new public and private build-
 mthe authorities have not uniformly enforced this law.
 ationalRaciollEthnic Minorities.-Dominicans are strongly prejudiced against
 Haitians, many of whom are illegal immigrants and who constitute - significant
 percentage of the unskilled manual labor force. The Government has not acknowl-
 edged the existence of this discrimination normade any efforts to combat it. Darker-
 skinned Dominicans also face informal barriers to social and economic advancement.
 Credible sources charge that the Government at times refuses to recognize indi-
 viduals of Haitian ancestry born in the country as Dominican citizens. Lack of docu-
 mentation also sometimes hinders the ability of children of Haitian descent to at-
 tend school where there is one available; some parents fail to seek documentation
 for fear of being deported.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the freedom to orga-
 nize labor unions and also for the right of workers to strike (and for private sector
 employers to lock out workers). All workers, except military and police, are free to
 organize, and workers in all sectors exercise this right. The new Labor Code enacted
 in 1992 significantly strengthened the right of freedom of association and removed
 some restrictions on the right to strike by narrowing the definition of essential serv-
 ices to exclude transportation, food services, and fuel services. Requirements for
 calling a strike include the support of an absolute majority of the workers of the
 company, a prior attempt to resolve the conflict through arbitration, written notifi-
 cation to the labor secretariat, and a 10-day waiting period following notification be-
 fore proceeding with the strike. The Code also eliminated previous prohibitions
 against political and sympathy strikes. The Government respects association rights
 and places no obstacles to union registration, afiliations, or the ability to engage
 in legal strikes.
 Strikes in 1995 occurred mainly in the public sector. Nurses and doctors staged
 periodic strikes and walkouts. Employees of state-owned companies also staged
 strikes because of unpaid wages and benefits, as well as threats of job loss.
 In November the polie broke up a legal strike by a recently formed union against
 the Korean-owned Bonahan Apparel Company. The police arrested 18 workers and
 released them only after direct intervention by the Labor Minister.
 The Labor Code specifies in detail the steps legally required to establish a union,
 federation, and confederation. The Code calis for automatic recognition of a union
 if the Government has not acted on its application within a specific time. In prac-
 tice, the Government has readily facilitated recognition of labor organizations. Org a-
 nized labor represents between 10 and 13 percent of the workforce and is divided
 among three major confederations four minor confederations, and a number of inde-
 pendent unions. The International Labor Organization's Committee of Experts con-
 siders that the two-thirds majority vote required to form confederations is too high,
 but this has not impeded unions from joimng together, for example, with the forma-
 tion of the Autonomous Institutional Workers Central in August.
 Unions are independent of the Government and political parties, although sym-
 pathizers of various political parties are found in most union organizations. Labor
 unions can and do freely affiliate regionally and internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize.and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is law-
 ful and may take place in firms in which a union has gained the support of an abso-
 lute majority of the workers. Only a minority of companies has collective bargaining
 pacts. The Labor Code stipulates that workers cannot be dismissed because of their
 trade union membership or activities. The previous Code allowed arbitrary termi-
 nation of a worker so long as severance pay was provided; the 1992 Code exempts
 from dismissal specific numbers of union organizers and officials. The number of
 union organizers or officials given protection from layoffs can total up to 20 mem-
 bers of a union in formation, between 5 to 10 members of a union executive council
 (depending on the size of the work force), and up to 3 members of a collective bar-
 gaining negotiating committee. Nonetheless, workers are at times fired without re-
 gard to the law.
 The 1992 Code established a system of labor courts for dealing with labor dis-
 putes, but their effectiveness is limited. Labor court employees halted their activi-
 ties in the summer because of poor working conditions and lack of basic materials.
 The halt illustrated the new courts' operational shortcomings. On occasion, corrupt
 attorneys and court officials, acting with powers of attorney from unwitting workers,
 enforced spurious judiments against businesses and offices. The new courts are lo-
 cated in ive jurisdictions, but the judicial problems which the courts were estab-
 
 
 lished to address still prevail in the rest or the country. Violations of freedom of as-
 sociation, the minimum wage, and overtime pay continue.
 In September authorities detained nearly 50 sugar industry union leaders and
 members, the majority of them for 24 hours or more. They held the three leaders
 of the country's two major sugar workers' federations for 8 hours when they at-
 tempted to meet with workers in two of the country's state-owned mills. The union-
 ists were coordinating a strike to protest the nationwide 2-month suspension of
 12 700 sugar workers.
 ihe Labor Code applies in the 32 established export processing zones which are
 comprised of nearly 500 mostly U.S.-owned or associated companies and employ
 more than 170,000 workers, mostly women. Some EPZ companies have a history of
 discharging workers who attempt to organize unions. Although the Government reg-
 istered more than 50 unions in the EPZ's since the new Labor Code went into effect
 in June 1992, fewer than 10 of these unions still have their membership intact.
 Some unions apparently ceased to function due to firings of union members, while
 some may have dissolved because of voluntary resignations or company closure. The
 Secretariat of Labor has brought criminal charges against several EPZ firms for
 Labor Code violations involving worker rights. The courts found in favor of manage-
 ment in the majority of cases concluded. The unions won two cases, a number of
 cases were under appeal, and others were still pending at year's end.
 The State Sugar Council employs workers from more than 100 unions. Dominican
 workers predominate in most of the unions, although between two and five unions
 are Haitian-dominated. The CEA has long maintained a negative attitude to addi-
 tional organizing efforts.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor. During previous years, the Government and the CEA forcibly re-
 cruited Haitian seasonal agcltra workers and then restricted them to specific
 sugar plantations. The CEA denied that it used paid recruiters inside Haiti to ob-
 tain workers, and there is no conclusive evidence that either practice occurred to
 any significant degree in 1995. In July the Haitian ambassador publicly accused the
 Dominican armed forces of forcibly recruiting Haitians already in the country to
 work in sugar plantations far from their places of residence. There are no firm sta-
 tistics on the number of cane cutters on CEA plantations; the CDH estimates the
 number at as many as 42,000, of which up to 30 percent are Haitians.
 Haitian sugar cane workers continued to encounter restrictions on their freedom
 of movement. These included the presence of armed guards in and around various
 sugar plantations and the sequestering of workers' belonging in order to discourage
 their movement to other CEA plantations or other types of employment. The CEA
 and the Dominican Office of Immigration initiated a program in late 1991 to issue
 1-year temporary work permits to regularize the status of the immigrant laborers.
 This program documents the Haitians' right to work but also imposes a contractual
 obligation on the workers to remain in a specific area for the duration of the work
 contract. Many Haitians do not understand the contractual process, and work condi-
 tions tantamount to indentured servitude prevail. According to the most recent sur-
 vey (1993) by an independent polling firm, 50 percent of allitinerant Haitian work-
 ers possessed permits. There are no figures available on the number of illegal Hai-
 tianx cane and offee workers deported in 1995, but the practice continued, depend-
 ing upon the demand for labor and the law enforcement capabilities of the authori-
 ties.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code prohibits employ-
 ment of youth under 14 years of age and places various restrictions on the employ-
 ment of youth under age 16. These restrictions include a limitation of no more than
 6 hours of daily work, no employment in dangerous occupations or jobs involving
 the provision of intoxicating beverages, and limitations on nighttime work.
 In practice, employers ignore many of the child labor restrictions. Dominican law
 requires 6 years of compulsory formal education. The high level of unemployment
 and the lack of a social safety net create pressures on families to allow children to
 earn supplemental income. A U.N. Children's Fund study estimated that approxi-
 mately 58,000 minors work as itinerant vendors in occupations such as shining
 shoes, selling newspapers, and cleaning cars. During the past few years, the Labor
 Secretariat made some effort to enforce the law in cases where companies employed
 underage workers, but penalties were largely limited to small fines. Some young
 workers obtained work permits and continued their employment; those unable to ob-
 tain permits were dismissed.
 Instances of child labor in CEA sugar plantations have diminished greatly. The
 CEA and the Labor Secretariat took steps to discourage child labor, and in 1995 it
 occurred in only isolated instances, most involving children accompanying their fa-
 thers into the fields. Some underage Haitians do work in the state cane fields, but
 
 
 399
 
 they susally steadfastly claim that they are of adult age, making it difficult to prove
 otherwise.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution provides the Government
 with legal authority to set minimum wage levels, and the Labor Code assigns this
 task to a National Salary Committee. Congress may also enact minimum wage leg-
 islation. Minimum wage raises have not compensated for the loss of purchasing
 power, and scheduled wage increases in May only provided partial relief. Most work-
 ers receive only the minimum wage, which averages little more than $100 per
 month (1,340 pesos), depending on the sector and employer size. The minimum wage
 represents only 20 percent of the estimated monthly cost of living for an average-
 sized family in Santo Domingo. As a result, many people hold more than one job.
 The Labor Code establishes a standard work period of 8 hours per day and 44
 hours per week. The Code also stipulates that all workers are entitled to 36 hours
 of uninterrupted rest each week. In practice, a typical workweek is Monday through
 Friday plus a half day on Saturday, but longer hours are not unusual. The Code
 grants workers a 35-percent wage differential for work over 44 hours and up to 68
 hours per week and a 100 percent differential for any hours above 68 hours per
 week.
 The Dominican Social Security Institute (IDSS) sets workplace safety and health
 conditions but these frequently do not meet legal standards. The Labor Code sets
 nonhealth safety standards. The existing social security system does not apply to
 all workers andis underfunded. Furthermore, some employers charge workers for
 social security coverage but fail to pass the payments on to the IDSS. As a result,
 benefits are low, payments often delayed, and medical care is limited.
 Workplace regulations and their enforcement in the EPZ's do not differ from those
 in the country at large, although working conditions are sometimes better. Some
 companies in privatel owned EPZ's enforce much higher worker safety and health
 standard. Both the IDSS and the Labor Secretariat have small corps of inspectors
 charged with enforcing standards. Although new labor inspectors undergo a rigorous
 professional selection process, these posts were customarily filled through political
 patronage, and some inspectors continue to have a reputation for corruption. In
 practice, workers cannot remove themselves from hazardous workplace situations
 without jeopardy to continued employment.
 Conditions for agricultural workers are in general much worse, especially in the
 sugar industry. Although the CEA readily cooperates with nongovernmental organi-
 zations active in efforts to improve the conditions of sugar cane workers, in some
 cases the CEA and the Government failed to take measures to implement written
 agreements designed to overcome the problems facing sugar cane workers. Cane cut-
 ters on CEA plantations are paid by weight of cut cane rather than hours worked
 and thus they must work significantly more hours than the standard workweek to
 earn a wage approaching that of workers in other industries. Cane cutters also faced
 cheating during the weighing of their cut cane. Although the CEA and the Labor
 Secretariat signed an agreement with labor unions to allow union officials to assist
 the Labor Secretariat in the inspection and monitoring of CEA weight stations, they
 took no action to implement the agreement. Many worker villages continued to suf-
 fer high rates of disease and a lack of schooling, medical facilities, running water,
 and sewage systems.
