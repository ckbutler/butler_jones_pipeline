 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 The United Kingdom (UK) of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
 is a constitutional monarchy with a multiparty, parliamentary,
 democratic form of government. As there is no written
 constitution, human rights are "residual," i.e., assumed
 unless limited by statute. Human rights traditionally have
 been respected and guarded by the British people and their
 elected governments. British law bars discrimination on the
 basis of race, religion, sex, or political opinion.
 The United Kingdom has a highly developed industrial economy.
 Persons may own property and pursue their economic interests,
 and the Government provides comprehensive social welfare
 programs.
 Throughout the UK, public order is maintained by a civilian
 police force. However, in Northern Ireland, as a result of
 terrorist violence, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) is
 supported by regular army units to combat terrorism.
 On November 15, 1985, the British and Irish Governments
 concluded the Anglo-Irish Agreement (AIA). The Agreement
 affirms that the status of Northern Ireland as a part of the
 United Kingdom can only be changed by the wishes of a majority
 in the North. It also provides for an Intergovernmental
 Conference to discuss the two Governments' views on Northern
 Ireland affairs. The Conference has met regularly since its
 inception and has given particular attention to enhancing
 security cooperation. Although intended to safeguard the
 rights and traditions of both Protestant and Catholic
 communities in Northern Ireland, the Agreement has met strong
 opposition, particularly from Protestant Unionists.
 The Northern Ireland Assembly was suspended in July 1986, and
 no new elections have been scheduled to reconstitute it.
 The UK's long tradition of respect for human rights has been
 tested by terrorist activity and sectarian violence in and
 related to Northern Ireland. Paramilitary groups on both
 sides of the conflict continued their campaigns of violence,
 and the level of terrorism in 1987 and 1988 rose to equal that
 of the early 1980's. The Government proposed changes to the
 general law on evidence in Northern Ireland that would affect
 the traditional right to silence of accused persons by
 permitting the courts to draw-whatever inference they deemed
 proper if a subject remained silent during questioning. While
 concerns over aspects of police procedure, detention, and
 judicial practices vis-a-vis Northern Ireland were expressed,
 the Government and the judicial system provided avenues for
 inquiries and remedial actions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The British Government does not practice or condone killing
 for political motives. It reported that, during 1988, 93
 persons were killed in incidents of terrorism in Northern
 Ireland, 39 of whom were members of the security forces. Six
 persons were killed by security forces. The Provisional Irish
 
 
 1237
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Republican Army (PIRA) admitted that four of these were
 engaged in terrorist operations at the time.
 Security forces in Northern Ireland continue the use of
 plastic baton rounds (PBR's or plastic bullets) for riot
 control. Two people have been killed by PBR's since 1982, but
 none in the past 2 years.
 Three incidents in 1982 in which RUC officers killed six men
 gave rise to allegations that the security forces in Northern
 Ireland practiced a "shoot-to-kill" policy when dealing with
 suspected terrorists. Four RUC officers involved in the
 shootings were tried for murder and acquitted. Manchester
 Deputy Chief Constable John Stalker began a special
 investigation in 1984 but was removed in 1986 and replaced by
 another senior UK police official, Colin Sampson. Stalker
 alleged in his book, "Stalker," that his inquiry was
 obstructed by the RUC and that he was removed to prevent
 further investigation. However, he acknowledged that he
 "found no evidence of instructions to any RUC officer in
 Northern Ireland to use other than legitimate methods to bring
 offenders to justice."
 In January the Government announced that, although the
 Stalker/Sampson inquiry found evidence of perverting or
 attempting to pervert the course of justice, those RUC officers
 involved would not be prosecuted, though they may face
 disciplinary action. The Government cited considerations of
 security as the basis for its decision and stated that the
 Stalker/Sampson Report would not be published. Its
 announcement stimulated renewed demands for a full judicial
 inquiry into disputed killings and for a review of legislation
 governing the use of lethal force by security forces.
 The Northern Ireland police authority decided that there was
 insufficient evidence to launch an investigation to determine
 if top RUC officers had obstructed the Stalker-Sampson
 inquiry. The police authority announced, however, that 20 RUC
 officers would face disciplinary action over charges that they
 had hindered the investigation.
 The UK Government's Nozthern Ireland Secretary of State, Tom
 King, said proper procedures had not been followed in
 investigating the 1982 shooting incidents, that there was a
 failure to provide full and accurate information to the
 director of public prosecutions, and that the RUC Special
 Branch had operated as a "force within a force" without
 adequate control and accountability. King promised
 wide-ranging changes in RUC operational procedures,
 particularly as they relate to the Special Branch.
 In February a civilian, Aidan McAnespie, was killed by a
 ricochet bullet from a weapon fired by a British soldier at a
 checkpoint on Northern Ireland's border with the Republic of
 Ireland. The soldier was released from custody in September
 after the Northern Ireland director of public prosecutions
 declared that the evidence did not warrant a. prosecution for
 manslaughter.
 In April 1987, the Government announced a decision to draft,
 publish, and bring into force a code of practice for the
 exercise of emergency powers by the RUC and armed forces in
 Northern Ireland. The code, now expected to be published
 early in 1989, will address the emergency powers available to
 the RUC and the armed forces and how they should be exercised.
 
 
 1238
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 In addition, in April 1988, a new code of conduct for the RUC
 was issued. The code addresses the treatment of members of
 the public and prisoners, the use of physical force,
 cooperation with officials outside the organization, and the
 conduct of a police officer's private life. The code stresses
 the RUC's commitment to carry out its duties without regard to
 status, sex, race, religion, political beliefs, or aspirations.
 On March 6, security forces in Gibraltar shot and killed three
 unarmed members of the PIRA who were on a bombing mission.
 Critics of the shootings claimed that the three were the
 victims of a "shoot-to-kill" policy and called on the UK
 Government to provide public clarification of the circumstances
 surrounding the incident. A Gibraltar coroner's inquest found
 in September that the killings were justified under law.
 b. Disappearance
 Government authorities do not abduct, secretly arrest, or hold
 persons in clandestine confinement, nor do they sponsor or
 condone such activities. The Government reported that during
 1988 over 60 persons were abducted or illegally held hostage
 in terrorist and other incidents in Northern Ireland.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 British laws forbid torture and other cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment of prisoners, and provide penalties for
 violations of those laws. Confessions obtained by such
 methods are not admissible as evidence in court. Government
 policy seeks to prevent abuse of prisoners.
 In February Amnesty International (AI) called on the
 Government to review the convictions of those involved in an
 October 1985 riot at the Broadwater Farm Housing Estate in
 North London in which a police officer was killed. Several
 defendants claimed that they were denied access to lawyers and
 families during police interrogation and that they were
 threatened and forced to make admissions or sign statements
 under duress during interrogation. In late 1988, the police
 complaints authority was conducting an investigation into
 these complaints.
 Police complaints procedures in Northern Ireland were reformed
 and brought into line with those which apply in England and
 Wales through the Police (Northern Ireland) Order of 1987.
 The Independent Commission for Police Complaints for Northern
 Ireland was put in place on February 29. The Commission,
 which is independent of both the Government and-the police,
 must supervise police investigations into the most serious
 complaints. The Commission's powers include the ability to
 approve or disapprove the choice of police investigating
 officers, direct the conduct of investigations, and monitor
 the disciplinary aspects of complaints.
 Complaints of mistreatment at the hands of the RUC by two
 persons arrested under the prevention of Terrorism Act in
 separate cases in January led to calls for an inquiry into the
 allegations. Both persons, who had been released without
 charges, claimed they were beaten while in custody. A judge
 ordered the release of one of them after the judge found
 police doctors' affidavits were "consistent" with his claims
 that he had been beaten during interrogation by RUC
 detectives. The United Nations assigned a special rapporteur
 
 
 1239
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 to investigate these allegations. The rapporteur was expected
 to refer to the cases in his report to the 45th Commission on
 Human Rights. The Standing Advisory Commission on Human
 Rights said that, while it was generally impressed with police
 arrangements in Northern Ireland for the detention and
 questioning of suspected terrorists, it remained seriously
 concerned over the level of complaints of assault and other
 improper practices during police interrogation of suspected
 terrorists.
 Complaints continue about "strip searching" in Northern
 Ireland prisons, particularly of women. These searches
 involve a visual inspection conducted in special cubicles by
 female officers. Body cavity searches are not performed.
 Strip searching is routine for prisoners on first committal
 and final discharge and when making home visits. It is
 conducted on a random basis for prisoners making court
 appearances or leaving the prison temporarily for any reason.
 Since prisoners awaiting trial are brought to court every 7 to
 28 days, they face the possibility of more frequent strip
 searching than those who are sentenced. The Standing Advisory
 Commission on Human Rights determined that strip searches
 remain necessary to protect the well-being of guards,
 pr-isoners, and the community at large. But the Commission
 also stated that strip searchinq is conducted too frequently.
 All visitors to prisons, including government officials, are
 subject to a "rub-down search." This involves an officer
 passing his or her hands over the visitor's clothing.
 Visitors are not strip searched. Strip searching is also
 conducted at prisons elsewhere in Great Britain.
 Britain has ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the
 Transfer of Sentenced Persons, by which prisoners may be sent
 to their hom6 countries to serve their sentences. Within the
 United Kingdom, convicts are almost always required to serve
 their prison time in the general region where the crime was
 committed. Transfers may, however, be requested. Prisoners
 from Northern Ireland, for example, who are serving time in
 Great Britain may apply for transfer to Northern Ireland.
 Several such requests were approved in 1988.
 In the crown colony of Hong Kong, following allegations by the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that
 Vietnamese refugees in the Hei Ling Chau closed detention
 center had been beaten by correctional services personnel, the
 correctional services department conducted an in-house
 inquiry, uncovering no corroborating evidence. In September
 the Government appointed an independent paneI to examine these
 same allegations. In a report issued on October 6, the two
 justices of the peace who conducted the inquiry concluded that
 correctional services personnel had used unnecessary force on
 refugees and that doctors had been less than thorough in
 examining those who had been beaten. The Government ordered
 an investigation into internal correctional services department
 procedures and into the performance of the doctors who
 examined the refugees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 British law gives the police broad discretionary powers to
 make arrests without warrant based on reasonable cause.
 Procedures for bail, judicial determination of the legality of
 detention, and suits for false imprisonment are routinely
 utilized.
 
 
 1240
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Persons arrested without a warrant must be released on bail if
 they cannot be brought before a magistrate's court within 24
 hours. Generally, persons charged with nonserious offenses
 can be released on bail. However, in some cases where the
 alleged offense is deemed serious, such as violent crimes,
 magistrates have repeatedly remanded persons for periods of up
 to 18 months before trial. In 1988 some 11,600 persons
 (roughly 23 percent of the prison population in England and
 Wales) were on remand. The average length of time between
 first remand and trial in scheduled cases in Northern Ireland
 declined steadily between 1984 and 1988, and the Emergency
 Provisions Act of 1987 gave the Secretary of State for
 Northern Ireland authority to specify maximum time limits for
 particular pretrial stages; this authority has not yet been
 utilized. The Prosecution of Offenses Act of 1985 gave the
 Government similar authority for England and Wales. In April
 1987, statutory limits on time in custody were introduced
 experimentally in four counties. The Government extended the
 operation of these limits to all of Wales and part of England
 in April 1988 and announced its intention to include all of
 England by 1990.
 British law allows for the restriction of personal liberties
 by the Government in an emergency situation, subject to review
 by Parliament. Acting on the premise that the fundamental
 "right to life" has been in serious jeopardy due to the
 violence in Northern Ireland, the Government adopted the
 Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Acts of 1978 and 1987
 which are applicable only to Northern Ireland; and the
 Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1984
 (originally enacted in 1976), almost all of which is
 applicable to the entire United Kingdom. Although both these
 acts permit the restriction of personal liberties, they are
 subject to parliamentary review and to mandatory renewal at
 frequent intervals.
 The 1984 Prevention of Terrorism Act allows the police to
 arrest, without warrant, persons anywhere in the UK whom they
 reasonably suspect to be involved in terrorism. Such persons
 may be detained for up to 48 hours without judicial review,
 and up to a further 5 days on the authority of the Home
 Secretary or, in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State for
 Northern Ireland. In recent years, the powers of the Act have
 been used when persons were suspected of acts of terrorism
 related to Northern Ireland, India, and the Middle East.
 In September 1987, the European Commission on Human Rights
 recommended that, in the case of two men detained in 1984
 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act's 7-day maximum
 detention period, the Government respond to charges it had
 violated the requirement contained in the European Convention
 on Human Rights that a person should be brought "promptly to
 court." Both parties referred the case to the European Court
 of Human Rights which ruled in November that a 7-day detention
 was excessive. At year's end, a new Prevention of Terrorism
 bill was before Parliament, which does not conform to the
 findings of the European Court of Justice, but the Government
 is still seeking ways to bring UK practice into conformity.
 Under the Northern Ireland Emergency Provisions Act of 1978,
 the RUC, for the purpose of arresting anyone under the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act, may enter and search without a
 warrant any place where that person is or where the police
 reasonably suspect him of being. The Act provides similar
 authority in connection with the arrest of persons suspected
 
 
 1241
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 of having committed or being about to commit a "scheduled"
 offense (i.e., one listed on a schedule attached to the law).
 Also under this Act, members of the armed forces on duty may
 arrest without a warrant any person suspected of having
 committed or being about to commit any offense. Such persons
 can be held for up to 4 hours, after which they must be
 transferred to police custody or released. Allegations that
 these limits have been exceeded by the police or the armed
 forces have not been substantiated.
 In Northern Ireland, pursuant to the provisions of the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Emergency Provisions Act,
 arrested persons have the right to a lawyer after 48 hours in
 detention. Some human rights activists charge, however, that
 the 48-hour rule is not always followed.
 An independent review of the 1978 Emergency Provisions Act by
 Sir George Baker, published in April 1984, concluded that its
 provisions were still necessary. The 1987 Act implemented a
 number of Baker's recommendations and provided further rights
 and safeguards for persons detained under emergency
 legislation. On the authority of a senior police officer, and
 if specified conditions are met, the exercise of the right to
 an attorney and 'to have someone informed of the arrest may be
 delayed for a maximum of 48 hours.
 British legal practice provides for the indeterminate
 detention of minors convicted of murder. In Northern Ireland,
 where public attention has focused particularly on this issue,
 there were 32 persons serving such sentences in late 1988. At
 year's end, there were 17 prisoners in Northern Ireland who
 had served 8 or more years for murders committed while they
 were under the age of 18 and whose release dates had not been
 decided. All but one had their cases reviewed by the Life
 Cases Review Board by the end of 1988, although the outcome of
 the reviews was not to be made known until early 198-9.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see section 6.c.
 e. -Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is guaranteed by law and observed in practice. An
 indigent defendant has the right to counsel of his own
 choosing. All criminal proceedings must be conducted in
 public, with the exception of juvenile court cases and cases
 involving public decency or security. In a trial on charges
 under the Official Secrets Act, the court may be closed at the
 judge's discretion, but the sentence must be passed in
 public. A National Independent Prosecution Service was
 established in 1985, extending to England and Wales a system
 introduced to Northern Ireland in 1972 which provides g-reater
 consistency in determining which cases are to be prosecuted.
 Juries hear all cases not covered by antiterrorist legislation;
 these constitute the majority of criminal cases. In Northern
 Ireland, the right to trial by jury has been suspended for
 certain terrorist-related offenses because the intimidation of
 juries raised serious questions about the ability to reach
 impartial verdicts. "Diplock courts," in which a single high
 court judge presides over a trial without a jury, were
 established by legislation in 1973.
 The Government's ability to provide trials by multiple judges
 or with juries is limited because of PIRA terrorist attacks
 aimed at intimidating the judiciary. In 1987 Lord Justice
 
 
 1242
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Gibson and his wife were murdered by PIRA terrorists. In
 December 1987, the PIRA exploded a bomb outside the Belfast
 home of a judge, and in July 1988 a married couple and their
 child were killed in a PIRA bomb attack intended for a judge
 and his family. The PIRA has warned that it will even attack
 workmen who perform services at the homes of judges, and in
 1988 went so far as to shoot a workman while he was performing
 roof repairs on a Belfast court building.
 A unique safeguard for persons convicted by a Diplock Court is
 the automatic right of appeal of conviction or sentence to a
 three-judge court of appeals. The rate of conviction in
 Diplock Courts for defendants who have pleaded "not guilty" is
 similar to that of defendants tried before juries. Judges in
 Diplock Courts must publish written explanations of their
 decisions. Nonetheless, there is support for a court system
 in which three judges (instead of one) would preside over
 trials when a jury trial is deemed impossible. Although the
 Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights endorsed a change
 to a three-judge system, the Government announced in February
 that it does not intend to alter the Diplock Courts. A report
 published by the Association of the Bar of the City of New
 York stated that there has been no serious claim that a
 factually erroneous conviction has occurred in a Diplock Court
 and that Diplock Courts conform to the requirements of
 international standards for fair trials.
 The recent reversals on appeal of several convictions in
 earlier terrorism cases have limited the Government's ability
 to obtain convictions based on uncorroborated evidence by
 convicted terrorists ("supergrasses"). Although there were no
 "supergrass" trials in 1988, and none since 1985, the issue
 remains controversial.
 On October 20, the Government announced changes, subject to
 parliamentary approval, to the general law on evidence in
 Northern Ireland. These changes would affect the traditional
 right to silence of accused persons under British law by
 permiting the courts to draw whatever inference they deem
 proper--including an inference of guilt--if a subject remains
 silent during questioning. The changes will apply to four
 situations: (1) when an accused explains his conduct for the
 first time at his trial, after remaining silent during police
 questioning; (2) once the prosecution has established that
 there is a case to try; (3) when an accused fails or refuses
 to explain to the police certain specified situations, such as
 substances or marks on his clothing; and (4) when an accused
 fails or refuses to explain to tht police his presence at a
 particular place. The Government also announced plans to
 implement similar legislation as soon as possible in England
 and Wales. These proposals were widely criticized.
 The Criminal Law Jurisdictions Act, enacted by both the UK
 Government (1975) and the Irish Government (1976), permits
 trial in the Republic of Ireland or in the UK of those accused
 of certain terrorist offenses, regardless of where the offense
 was committed.
 In late 1987 and early 1988, a UK appellate court- reviewed the
 1975 conviction of 6 men for the murder of 21 people in the
 1974 Birmingham Pub Bombings. The court dismissed the appeal
 of the "Birmingham Six" after considering claims that the
 prosecution's forensic and other evidence was flawed. The
 case has long been controversial in Ireland and in Northern
 Ireland, where many in the Catholic community charge that the
 
 
 1243
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 convictions constituted an injustice against the six Irish
 residents of England.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right of privacy is well respected in both law and
 custom. Warrants are generally required for a police search
 of private premises. However, under the Northern Ireland
 (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978, any member of the armed
 forces on duty, or any constable, may enter any premises or
 other place if he or she considers it necessary to do so to
 preserve peace or maintain order. Changes in the 1987
 Emergency Provisions Act now require a standard of "reasonable
 grounds of 'susp-icion" before a dwelling can be entered to
 search for munitions or transmitters.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including-:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Strongly held tradition, an independent press, and a
 democratic political system combine to secure freedom of
 speech and press. Viewpoints independent and critical of the
 Government are well represented.
 Controversy continued during 1988 over the Government's
 efforts in the courts to prevent publication of the book
 "Spycatcher," the memoirs of former UK intelligence officer
 Peter Wright. The case highlighted the problem faced by many
 democratic governments in determining how to balance freedom
 of the press and protection of national security. Copies of
 "Spycatcher".published abroad were allowed to enter the United
 Kingdom without restriction. On October 13, Britain's highest
 court rejected the Government's request for permanent
 injunctions against newspapers to prevent them from publishing
 excerpts from "Spycatcher." As a result, newspapers are free
 to publish extracts from and comment on the book.
 On October 19, the Government issued notices to radio and
 television broadcasting organizations banning the broadcast of
 interviews or direct statements by representatives of Sinn
 Fein, Republican Sinn Fein, the Ulster Defense Association,
 and all proscribed organizations, including the PIRA, the
 Irish National Liberation Army, the Ulster Freedom Fighters,
 and the Ulster Volunteer Force. The notices also prohibit the
 broadcast of any statements supporting or inviting support for
 these organizations. Exceptions are made for coverage of
 elections and parliamentary proceedings. The written media
 were not affected by the notices. The measures drew
 widespread criticism as undermining freedom of speech and
 press. The practical effect of these provisions has not yet
 been tested.
 In 1987 the Hong Kong Government passed an amendment to the
 Public Order Act which made it a punishable offense to publish
 *false news" likely to cause public alarm or disorder.
 Visiting UK Members of Parliament and the local media
 criticized this action. Following a government review, the
 Legislative Council repealed this provision in January 1989.
 Hong Kong media representatives expressed concern over the
 Film Censorship Ordinance of 1988 for including a clause
 permitting the censorship of a film if there is a likelihood
 that the film would seriously damage good relations with other
 territories.
 
 
 1244
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Except in cases of extreme civil disorder, in which public
 safety is judged to be at risk, the authorities do not
 exercise their statutory right to limit the freedom of public
 assembly. However, some critics believe that the 1986 Public
 Order Law gives police too much discretion to restrict public
 assembly.
 The Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1984 and the Northern
 Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978 include sections
 prohibiting membership in, or support of, organizations
 involved in terrorism. These organizations are specifically
 listed in the statutes. The lists do not include political
 parties, even those such as the Provisional Sinn Fein, which
 have close links to terrorist paramilitary organizations and
 openly support violence.
 The summer "marching season" in Northern Ireland presents
 special problems. These marches commemorate the traditions of
 opposing sectarian communities. Each community considers them
 a right, but they are controversial and have been a source of
 public disorder. Public Order (Northern Ireland) 1987
 introduced new provisions for parades. The police must be
 notified 7 days before a planned march and may impose
 conditions, including rerouting, on the organizers. Two
 marches were rerouted, but no permits to march were denied in
 1988. There were no serious disorders during the 1988
 marches, in large part because of impartial police policies
 and handling of the issue.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Government policy and general practice ensure freedom of
 religion to all residents. While both England and Scotland
 have established churches, the State makes no direct financial
 contribution to them, and their existence does not limit the
 freedom or access to public life of members of other
 churches. The Government does, however, provide funds for
 church schools throughout the country.
 In Northern Ireland, the Constitution Act of 1973 specifically
 prohibits discrimination on the basis of religious belief or
 political opinion.
 There is no religious or denominational bar to the holding of
 public office. The sovereign must be a member of the Church
 of England.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 UK citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country and
 in foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation.
 The Prevention of Terrorism Act includes one exception to this
 general principle. The Act gives the Home Secretary the
 authority to exclude or prevent from entering mainland Britain
 anyone he believes may be connected with terrorism related to
 Northern Ireland, unless that person was born in Great Britain
 or has been ordinarily resident there for 3 years. Similar
 authority is granted to the Secretary of State for Northern
 
 
 1245
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Ireland to exclude persons not native to or resident in that
 province. Between November 1974 and March 1988, 31 persons
 were the subjects of exclusion orders. As of March 31, 22 of
 these orders still were in operation. The Standing Advisory
 Commission on Human Rights and Lord Colville, in his official
 review of the Act, recommended an end to the Act's exclusion
 order. The National Council for Civil Liberties has referred
 to exclusion orders as a system of internal exile.
 In 1988 special problems existed in Hong Kong with respect to
 refugees. The Hong Kong Government's refugee program featured
 both "open" and "closed" camps, the latter restricting refugee
 access to the outside. Because of the surge in the number of
 refugees in 1988, coupled with limited fiscal resources and
 space, the-closed camps became dangerously overcrowded,
 squalid, and unsanitary. There were reports of camp guards
 beating refugees who had protested food shortages. On June
 16-, the Hong Kong Government implemented a more stringent
 screening policy whereby persons judged to have fled Vietnam
 for economic reasons would remain in closed camps until
 repatriation could be arranged. Following complaints from a
 number of observers, including foreign diplomats, the Hong
 Kong Government agreed to apply internationally accepted
 criteria to the'running of the camps and to improve the
 quality of service. In September it turned over management of
 the territory's refugee camps to international relief agencies
 under the auspices of the UNHCR.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The United Kingdom is ruled by a government formed on the basis
 of a majority of seats in the House of Commons, won in freely
 contested elections held at intervals not longer than 5 years.
 Participation in the political process is open to all persons
 and parties, of which there are several, representing a broad
 range of political views. For parliamentary and local
 elections, all citizens 18 years of age and over have the
 franchise. Women have full rights of participation and are
 represented at all levels of British political life. Racial
 minorities comprise about 5 percent of the total population.
 There are several nonwhite members of Parliament, and there
 are nonwhite elected members of local governments.
 Most British colonies have small populations (under 60,000)
 and are ruled by an appointed governor or administrator,
 assisted by an executive council (usually appointed) and a
 legislative assembly or council (partly elected).
 In Hong Kong (with a population of over five million),
 representative government employing universal franchise exists
 only in rudimentary form and without formal political
 parties. The Governor is appointed by, and serves at the
 pleasure of, the Crown. Universal direct elections are
 employed to fill a majority of seats on grassroots Advisory
 District Boards, and indirect elections serve to fill 26 of 56
 seats in the Legislative Council. The Government is committed
 to further gradual democratization and announced a series of
 reforms early in 1988. By virtue of a formal agreement
 ratified by the British and Chinese Governments in 1985, Hong
 Kong will revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The
 Agreement specifies that, upon its becoming a Special
 Administrative Region of China, socialism will not be
 practiced for a period of 50 years.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government maintains an open attitude toward international
 inquiries into alleged violations of human rights in the
 United Kingdom. It cooperates fully with the European
 Commission on Human Rights in investigations of complaints and
 has usually taken steps to rectify its own laws and policies
 when they were found not to be in conformity with the European
 Convention.
 The United Kingdom is a party to several human rights
 conventions, participates in international and regional human
 rights bodies, and is the host country to international
 nongovernmental human rights organizations, such as AI. In
 1973 the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights was
 established to monitor human rights in Northern Ireland.
 The UK Government cooperates fully in investigations
 undertaken by the International Labor Organization (ILO). It
 places no obstacles in the path of persons or organizations
 wishing to avail themselves of ILO investigative machinery.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Through the Race Relations Act of 1976, British law bars
 discrimination on the basis of race, color, nationality, or
 national or ethnic origin in the areas of employment, training
 and related matters, education, the provision of goods,
 facilities, services, and the disposal and management of
 property. However, statistical studies have shown a black
 unemployment rate that is nearly double that of whites, lower
 attainment levels in education for ethnic minority young
 people, black concentration in manual jobs, racial
 discrimination in job recruitment, and a greater likelihood
 for blacks and Asians to live in substandard housing. In 1984
 a Code of Practice on Employment, proposed by the Commission
 for Racial Equality and accepted by the Government, took
 effect. Although the code does not have the force of law, it
 is used as a standard of good practice by industrial tribunals
 in racial discrimination cases and serves as a guideline for
 firms in eliminating all forms of discrimination. However,
 representatives of some ethnic groups do not believe that
 existing legislation has made inroads in overcoming racial
 discrimination.
 Equal status and equal opportunity for women in professional
 fields also is provided by law. Enforcement mechanisms have
 been established, and progress toward women's equality is
 visible in many areas, including government hiring. The
 Government has made improvements in the legal protection
 offered women in employment as a result of test cases taken to
 the European Court of Justice which have claimed that British
 law did not comform to European Community legislation on equal
 rights. Still, women have yet to achieve fully equal status.
 Comprising 45 percent of the work force, women hold 75 percent
 of the UK's lowest paying jobs, and the average female wage
 earner takes home less than 75 percent of the pay of her male
 counterpart. Women continue to be underrepresented in
 engineering and technical fields.
 The Government's Technical and Vocational Education
 Initiative, covering all students aged 14 to 16, was launched
 
 
 1247
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 to counter sex stereotyping in the school system and in career
 counseling. Equal Opportunity Commissions were established in
 Britain in 1975 and in Northern Ireland in 1976 to assist in
 the enforcement of equal opportunity legislation.
 There is no evidence of governmental discrimination on
 religious grounds in Great Britain. However, in Northern
 Ireland, anti-Catholic discrimination involves a complex range
 of historical and social factors. The majority Protestant
 community has historically controlled much of the local
 economy and been more prosperous than the Catholic community.
 Since 1972, when direct British rule was introduced in
 Northern Ireland, specific measures have been taken to combat
 religious discrimination. These include reform of the
 electoral rolls, prohibition of religious or political
 discrimination by any level of government, establishment of a
 Commissioner for Complaints to deal with grievances against
 local government, appointment of a central housing authority
 to meet the problem of discrimination in housing, prohibition
 of discrimination in employment, and a special effort to
 recruit more Catholics into the civil service and the police.
 Since 1976 the Fair Employment Agency (FEA) has served as the
 focal point of the Government's efforts to end job
 discrimination. In 1988 the Government announced plans to
 strengthen and restructure the FEA to make it mo-re effective.
 Within the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the proportion of
 Catholics under age 35 reflects their proportion in the
 population, although Protestants still dominate in the upper
 age groups. In Northern Ireland overall, the Catholic male
 unemployment rate is 2 1/2 times that of Protestant men. The
 Government introduced new legislation, expected to be passed
 by Parliament and to become law in 1989, which is aimed at
 outlawing unintentional or "indirect" discrimination, and all
 public sector employers and private firms with 25 or more
 workers will have to monitor the religious composition of
 their staffs and submit annual reports. Employers will face
 penalties and loss of government contracts for failure to
 comply with the law. While the proposed legislation has been
 criticized by some for not proposing "strong and effective
 provisions for targets and timetables," it has in general been
 praised by leaders of the Catholic community.
 PIRA assassinations and death threats have-largely stymied
 government efforts to increase recruitment of Catholics (now
 around 10 percent) into the police force and related security
 fields. The PIRA has carried out a terror campaign not only
 against police officers but also against persons who provide
 services to the security forces. Since 1973, for example,. 25
 prison staff members were murdered while off duty.
 In Hong Kong, the Chinese language has equal status with
 English in many government operations. Major legislation is
 enacted in both languages, and legal proceedings are
 bilingual. The number of Hong Kong Chinese in high level
 administration and-policymaking positions is increasing.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 British workers have the right to associate freely, choose
 their own representatives, publish their own journals, openly
 promote their members' interests and views, and elect
 representative assemblies through which union policies and
 
 
 1248
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 procedures are determined. In the main, these rights are
 shared by workers in British dependent territories and
 possessions. The UK Government, which has ratified ILO
 conventions covering trade union rights, has, on behalf of its
 dependent territories and possessions, declared their
 adherence to these conventions. The UK and Chinese
 Governments have agreed that these conventions will continue
 to apply in Hong Kong after 1997.
 In law, there is no formal right to strike. Voluntary
 cessation of work may be considered as breaking the employment
 contract. However, a system of legal immunities has evolved
 which protects unions from prosecution when engaged in
 legitimate trade disputes. The circumstances in which such
 immunities exist have been narrowed in the UK following
 legislation adopted in the 1980's which has more tightly
 defined legitimate trade disputes, e.g., excluding unions and
 workers engaging in secondary industrial action. Industrial
 actions arising from political rather than industrial
 concerns, including sympathy strikes, are no longer immune
 from possible liability under civil law. In the rare instance
 where the right to strike is prohibited, e.g., for police
 officers, there are alternative means to resolve differences.
 Similar restrictions apply in the dependent territories and
 possessions. Hong Kong workers are not guaranteed the
 unequivocal right to strike. Employees hired on a contract
 basis can be fired for breach of contract if they walk out.
 UK unions are free from government control. However,
 legislation adopted in 1988 set legal requirements for the
 periodic election by postal ballots of senior trade union
 officials, mandated postal ballots before a strike call may be
 issued, prohibited unions from disciplining individual members
 who choose not to honor a legally called strike, and
 established procedures by which individual trade union members
 could bring complaints against their union to government-
 appointed ombudsmen. The British Trades Union Congress (TUC)
 lodged a complaint with the ILO charging that these measures
 represent unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of
 the trade unions and are contrary to provisions of ILO
 conventions on the right of association and the freedom to
 organize. The UK Government informed the ILO that it would
 respond to this complaint.
 There are no limitations on the freedom of UK unions to
 maintain relations with international organizations and they
 participate actively in a wide variety of international trade
 union groupings.
 Practice in Hong Kong is based on UK patterns with minor local
 variations. The principal government and nongovernment
 institutions which interact with the trade unions are the
 Legislative Council, the Department of Labor, the Labor
 Advisory Board, and the Labor Tribunal.
 Currently, two seats in Hong Kong's Legislative Council are
 set aside for labor representatives indirectly elected by the
 labor constituency. The Department of Labor initiates labor
 legislation, monitors the territory's compliance with
 international conventions, enforces local regulations, and
 handles labor-management disputes. The Labor Advisory Board
 is a nonstatutory body which advises the Commissioner for
 Labor on matters of interest to the local work force; trade
 unions and employer organizations elect eight of the
 representatives, while the remaining four are appointed by the
 
 
 1249
 UNITED KINGDOM OF uREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Commissioner. The Labor Tribunal, part of the judicial
 branch, provides a quick, inexpensive, and informal method for
 adjudicating disputes arising between workers and management.
 In common with other persons and organizations, trade
 unionists in the United Kingdom and dependent territories and
 possessions are afforded protection of self and property.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is deeply
 rooted in common law and widely practiced. This right is
 confirmed under appropriate ILO conventions in the UK and
 dependent territories and possessions. There is no legal
 obligationfor employers to bargain with workers'
 representatives, but collective bargaining is extensively
 practiced in the UK. Approximately 12.5 million workers, or
 43 percent of the work force, are organized and working under
 collectively agreed conditions of employment. All collective
 bargaining in the UK is voluntary. There are no export
 processing zones in the UK. Allowing for the different legal
 systems applicable to England and Wales, Scotland, and
 Northern Ireland, their labor laws are, in effect, similar.
 The Government actively encourages the resolution of disputes
 through the good offices of the governmental Advisory
 Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS). Such arbitration
 is voluntary and under conditions agreed to by the parties to
 the dispute. Employers and trade unions make extensive use of
 ACAS assistance.
 In the territory of Hong Kong, approximately 16 percent of the
 work force belongs to 403 registered trade unions. While
 collective bargaining exists in Hong Kong, it is not widely
 practiced. Hong Kong law does, however, provide for a system
 to handle settlement of disputes. Free conciliation service
 is afforded by the Department of Labor's labor relations
 division to employers and employees involved in labor disputes
 or grievances. It also carries out promotional activities
 through visits to employers' ahd employees' organizations,
 organizes training courses, talks and seminars, and assists
 employers in setting up, jointly with labor, consultation
 machinery. In the case of disputes, if initial conciliation
 efforts are unsuccessful, the dispute may be referred to
 arbitration with the consent of the parties, or a board of
 inquiry may be established to investigate and make suitable
 recommendations. Use of this system is widespread. There are
 no export processing zones in Hong Kong, and labor standards
 are uniform throughout the territory.
 Following several years of inability to -egotiate contracts
 over wages and conditions of employment for UK teachers under
 the then-existing negotiating machinery, ir 1987 a bill was
 passed by Parliament on teachers' pay and conditions. Under
 this bill, the existing negotiation procedureb were abolished
 and an advisory commission established to examine matters
 relating to pay and conditions of employment and to make
 recommendations to the Secretary of State for Education. The
 Secretary was empowered to accept, reject, or modify these
 recommendations. This bill is to be in effect until March 31,
 1990, by which time a new negotiating procedure is to be in
 place. The Government enforced its ban on trade union
 membership at its highly sensitive communications intelligence
 facility in Cheltenham in October when it fired four employees
 who retained union membership. The remaining trade union
 
 
 1250
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 members either were dismissed, retired, or transferred during
 November and December.
 The trade unions complained to the ILO Committee on Freedom of
 Association that these actions violated the provisions of
 Convention 98 on the right to bargain collectively. The
 Government responded that its actions fall under the provisions
 of Convention 151 governing pay and conditions of public
 servants. The Government further noted that the temporary
 nature of the bill on teachers' pay and conditions and the
 ongoing discussions with the teachers' unions over new
 negotiating procedures indicated that the dispute was on the
 way to resolution. The ILO Committee on Freedom of Association
 requested that the Government report any developments which
 might take place.
 Workers who believe themselves victims of antiunion
 discrimination, up to and including dismissal, may appeal for
 redress through industrial tribunals. Remedies could include
 the payment of substantial indemnities as well as
 reinstatement by employers found guilty of discriminatory
 practices.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited in the UK and its
 dependent territories and possessions and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Education Act of 1944, as amended, defines the compulsory
 school age as 16 years in the United Kingdom. Children under
 the age of 16 are prevented from working in an industrial
 undertaking, except in situations where they are participating
 in an organized work experience program as part of an
 educational course. Local education authorities are empowered
 to prohibit or restrict the hours of employment of children
 where they deem such employment to be a hindrance to a child's
 education.
 Child labor is not deemed to be a problem in the UK, and such
 action by local education authorities is rare.
 In Hong Kong, minors are allowed to do limited part-time work
 beginning at age 13, and to engage in full-time work at age
 15. Employment of females under age 18 in establishments
 which fall under liquor regulations is prohibited. The Labor
 Inspectorate conducts workplace inspections to ensure that
 working hours conform to the law and that no persons under the
 age of 15 are employed full time. During 1987, the
 inspectorate carried out 242,791 inspections of establishments
 in industrial and nonindustrial sectors, which resulted in
 1,704 prosecutions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The UK does not have a comprehensive minimum wage framework.
 In a Sindil number of industries where union representation has
 traditionally been limited, or where workers are predominantly
 casual or part time, a system of wage councils operates.
 Until the enactment of the 1986 Wages Council Act, the
 councils, consisting of employers, trade unionists, and
 independents, established minimum hourly wages, basic hours of
 work, and holiday entitlement in the sectors concerned. The
 provisions were legally enforceable by the wages council
 
 
 1251
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 inspectorate. The 1986 Act curtailed the scope of the
 councils by removing workers under the age of 21 from their
 protection and by limiting their influence to matters of
 minimum hourly rates and overtime rates. The minimum rates
 vary trom industry to industry. The minimum wage at entry
 level in the service sectors is about #3.60 per hour. The
 average annual wage in the service sectors is about $11,285
 which provides a decent standard of living for the worker and
 his family.
 Hong Kong wage rates are determined by supply and demand, with
 no statutory minimum. The 1968 employment ordinance generally
 regulates conditions and contracts of employment of all manual
 workers and of nonmanual workers earning $1,475 or less a
 month. Various pieces of legislation--including the Factories
 Act of 1961, the Employment of Women, Young Persons, and
 Children Act of 1920, the Hours of Employment (Conventions)
 Act of 1936, and the Young Persons (Employment) Act of 1938--
 regulate the maximum working hours of women and young persons
 and prohibit night work of these groups in industrial
 undertakings. The UK Government ir 1987 announced that it was
 considering the repeal of these provisions because they were
 an unnecessary limitation on equal employment opportunities.
 In Hong Kong, regulations under the Women and Young Persons
 and Children Act control hours and conditions of work for
 women and young people in industry. These regulations mandate
 one-half hour of rest for each 5 hours of continuous work for
 women and young people aged 16 to 17 and 1 hour of rest per
 5 hours of work for young persons aged 15. Hours of work are
 limited to 8 per day and 48 per week between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m.
 for women, and between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. for young persons
 aged 15 to 17. There are no legal restrictions on hours of
 work for men. Overtime is restricted to 2 hours per day and
 200 days per year for women; it is prohibited for all young
 persons.
 The keystone of UK occupational health and safety legislation
 is the Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974 which places a
 duty upon employers to act in such a way so to ensure "as far
 as is reasonably practicable" that the health and safety of
 employees and any others are not placed at risk. The Act
 established two bodies. The Health and Safety Executive, with
 its inspectorate, is responsible for enforcing health and
 safety regulations. It may initiate criminal proceedings
 against employers and may issue enforcement notices. The
 Health and Safety Commission submits proposals for regulations
 to the Government, may appoint committees of inquiry to
 investigate accidents, and encourages research and training.
 The Safety Representatives and Safety Committees Regulations-
 of 1977 provided that recognized trade unions may appoint
 safety representatives from among employees and that employers
 must grant paid leave to such representatives to undertake
 their duties and to receive health and safety training. Where
 two such representatives formally request, an employer is
 obliged to establish a safety committee in which the
 employer's and employees' representatives meet jointly to
 consider health and safety issues.
 It is a widely held view that the UK system of occupational
 health and safety is efficiently managed and operates with the
 full involvement of workers' representatives. In recent
 years, trade union leaders have commented that reductions in
 the numbers of health and safety executive inspectors have
 limited the inspectorate's ability to visit all workplaces.

 In Hong Kong, government regulations have set standards for
 industrial safety which follow the UK model.
