 ECUADOR
 Ecuador is a constitutional republic with a president and an 82-member unicam-
 eral legislature chosen in free elections. President Abdala Bucaram's governing coa-
 lition controls only 30 seats in the Congress. Congress has sweeping powers to ques-
 tion and censure cabinet ministers; such censure results in automatic dismissal of
 the minister in question. This is often used as a political tool by opposition political
 parties. Members of the Supreme Court preside over a judiciary that is constitu-
 tionally independent but in practice is susceptible to outside pressure.
 The military enjoys substantial autonomy, reinforced by guaranteed revenues
 from the nation's oil exports, as well as from civil aviation, shipping, and other com-
 mercial sectors. The military has maintained a low profile in domestic politics since
 the return to constitutional rule in 1979. The National Police, responsible for domes-
 tic law enforcement and maintenance of internal order, falls under the civilian Min-
 istry of Government and Police. There continued to be credible allegations of human
 rights abuses by the police and, in some isolated cases, members of the military.
 The economy is based on private enterprise, although there continued to be heavy
 government involvement in key sectors such as petroleum, utilities, and aviation.
 The gross domestic product of $1,559 per capita provides most of the population
 with a low standard of living. The inflation rate for the year was 26 percent. The
 principal exports are oil, bananas, and shrimp, which are the country's leading
 sources of foreign exchange. Manufacturing for regional export markets is of grow-
 ing importance. Most citizens are employed in the urban informal sector or as rural
 agricultural workers; rural poverty is extensive, and underemployment is high.
 The most fundamental human rights abuse stems from shortcomings in the politi-
 cized and inefficient legal and judicial system. People are subject to arbitrary arrest;
 once incarcerated, they may wait years before coming to trial unless they resort to
 paying bribes. Other human     rights  abuses included isolated instances of
 extrajudicial killings; torture and other mistreatment of prisoners and detainees by
 the police; poor prison conditions; government failure to prosecute and punish
 human rights abusers; and violence and pervasive discrimination against women,
 Afro-Ecuadorians, and indigenous people. In August the Supreme Court resolved a
 controversial human rights case involving those accused of a 1993 ambush of a joint
 miitary and poie riverine unit, by absolving the seven peasants of murder charges
 on the grounds that their confessions were obtained through torture. In September
 the President established a Truth and Justice Commission to investigate human,
 rights abuses since the 1979 restoration of democracy.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings. There continued to be credible reports of police involvement in
 extrajudicial killings, although the number of such reports declined significantly.
 The police often acted with impunity in such cases, because disciplinary action is
 the responsibility of the police itself. Although special police courts usually try cases
 involving police officers as defendants, the Government in some cases revoked this
 right and tred officers in civil courts.
 The Ecumenical Committee for Human Rights (CEDHU) reported a total of nine
 extrajudicial killings. Six of these involved individuals klled by the police in the
 course of pursuing criminals, one involved a drunk policeman killing a citizen, and
 two were apparently the result of personal fights between victims and off-duty po-
 licemen.
 In February policemen in the Amazonian town of Sucumbios chased a young black
 man named Jose Landazuri into a swamp, following reports that he had been in-
 volved in a robbery. Bystanders heard Landazuri shout "Don't shoot me" followed
 by the sound of gunfire. The police left the swamp without Landazuri. he family
 later found the body of Landazuri in the swamp with a bullet through his forehead.
 A police investigation concluded that he had been shot while resisting arrest.
 On September 17, police shot and killed an alleged criminal, 16-year-old Miguel
 Mannique, during a drug raid on his house in the La Toja neighborhood of Quito.
 The police broke into Manrique's house without a warrant and said they shot him
 in a scuffle. The family claims that the youth was sleeping when the police broke
 in, and that the police shot him in the face at close range while he was wiping the
 sleep out of his eyes. On October 2, after a public outcry a criminal court ordered
 the arrest of police sergeant Ulvio Munoz in connection with Manrique's murder.
 There were also instances in which citizens took the law into their own hands,
 leading to mob violence that resulted in deaths (see Section i.e.). Faced with a grow-
 ing number of such cases and complaints from human rights groups that the police
 were tolerant of vigilante justice, late in the year the police began to crack down
 on the practice. There were a number of news reports of police saving criminals
 from lynchings. For example, on September 30, policemen in the poor neighborhood
 of Santa Elena, Machala, rescued a thief who had been tied to a post by a crowd,
 beaten, and doused with gasoline. As members of the crowd looked for a match, the
 police cut him loose and took him to a hospital.
 There were no reports of individuals killed by the military. A provincial court is
 investigating the apparent death of one Peruvian at the hands of local authorities
 in 1995 (see Section 1.b.).
 In August a former policeman published a book and gave a series of interviews
 in which he claimed that police special units had participated in the execution of
 suspected leftist guerrillas during the 1980's. His revelations were questioned by
 some, but prompted Congress to create an investigating committee in September.
 Among other information, the former policeman provided the location of two alleged
 clandestine graveyards where he claimed the police buried the bodies of prisoners
 killed during interrogations in 1984-88. The Government promised a full investiga-
 tion. Initial surveys of the sites by members of the press failed to indicate the pres-
 ence of buried bodies.
 Attorney General Leonidas Plaza told reporters on October 2 that the Inter-Amer-
 ican Court of Human Rights had no jurisdiction in the case of Consuelo Benavides,
 a school teacher whom the army killed in 1985 because of alleged subversive activi-
 ties. Plaza said that the courts had already tried the case and found several mem-
 bers of the military guilty. He noted that Congress authorized an indemnity to the
 Benavides family but said the country does not have $10 million the family seeks.
 President Bucaram told the press earlier that the Benavides family has a just claim,
 but that the Government has no money to pay it. He said that the Benavides family
 should seek compensation from then-President Febres Cordero, as the Bucaram
 Government had not committed the crime. The Benavides case is the first Ecua-
 dorian case before the Inter-American Court. Human rights groups note that while
 the Government did eventually prosecute some of the military personnel involved
 in this murder, several of the most high-ranking suspects "escaped" from military
 confinement, and the statute of limitations spared others due to slow progress of the
 case in court.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 In the wake of border hostilities with Peru in 1995, the Government of Peru
 claimed that 15 of its citizens had disappeared at the hands of Ecuadorian authori-
 ties. The Provincial Court in Loja province is investigating the apparent death of
 
 
 436
 one Peruvian at the hands of local authorities, and another Peruvian detained in
 a military hospital in Quito has not been accounted for. However, there is no evi-
 dence that the 13 other Peruvian nationals were ever in Ecuador.
 In September President Bucaram established a Truth and Justice Commission to
 investigate human rights abuses since the 1979 restoration of democracy. The Com-
 mission, made up of representatives of human rights organizations, the Church, and
 the Government, will have no judicial powers but is to report on unresolved human
 rights cases. In its first week, the Commission received 211 allegations of disappear-
 ances, although only 14 persons were alleged to have disappeared due to actions by
 agents of the State.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law prohibits torture and similar forms of intimidation and punish-
 ment, police continued to physically mistreat suspects and prisoners, usually with
 impunity. The CEDHU regularly published detailed reports on suspects who
 charged the police with torture. In these reports the CEDHU frequently named po-
 lice officials dleged to be responsible and often included photographs of the victims
 with their wounds. In most cases, the police appeared to have abused such persons
 during investigations of ordinary street crime. According to the CEDHU and other
 human rights organizations, the victims reported that the police beat them, burned
 them with cigarettes, applied electric shocks or threatened them psychologically. In
 Guayaquil a television camera crew videotaped a police officer stomping on the head
 and kicking the face of a robbery suspect who had already been handcuffed and was
 lying on the ground.
 Defense Ministry officials continued to deny mistreatment by the military of four
 Colombians whom they detained in August-September 1995 and who, according to
 the police, had suffered numerous contusions by the time the military handed them
 over to police custody. The Defense Ministry claimed that the contusions resulted
 from the detainees throwing themselves against the walls and floor during interro-
 gation.
 The Supreme Court rendered a landmark decision in August rejecting the admis-
 sibility of confessions obtained through torture. It overturned the conviction of 7
 peasants accused of participating in the December 1993 ambush of a joint military
 and police riverine patrol along the Putumayo River in which 11 soldiers and. police
 officers died. A lower court, which had found the defendants guilty of murder, ac-
 knowledged that the only evidence against the defendants consisted of their own
 confessions and noted in the court record that these confessions had been obtained
 through torture. The police investigation further substantiated that the defendants
 had been physically abused while in military custody. The "Putumayo seven" were
 released from prison in September, following 2  years of detention. Human rights
 groups point to the Supreme Court decision as a factor that may encourage the po-
 lice to cease the use of torture to extract confessions and turn to legitimate, if more
 resource-intensive, methods of investigating common crime.
 The law permits police or military courts to try police officers and military defend-
 ants in closed sessions, in accordance with the respective military and police court
 martial manuals. Only the Supreme Court may try cases involving flag-rank offi-
 cers. The police court in particular does not announce verdicts or punishments, if
 any, creating the strong impression that the police are immune from prosecution.
 Conditions in detention centers generally continued to be poor. Prisons in the
 tropical coastal areas tend to be worse than those in the temperate highlands. Over-
 crowding is a chronic problem, although conditions are notably better in the wom-
 en's prison in Quito than in other facilities. A midyear census of the prison system
 found that 9,369 male prisoners were crowded into prisons designed to hold 5,049.
 There are no separate facilities for hard-core or dangerous criminals, nor are there
 effective rehabilitation programs.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and the Penal Code
 provide that no one may be deprived of liberty without a written order from a gov-
 ernmental authority, but the authorities often violated these legal protections
 against arbitrary arrest or detention. By law, the authorities must issue specific
 written orders within 24 hours of detention-even in cases in which a suspect is
 caught in the act of committing a crime-and must charge the suspect with a spe-
 cific criminal offense within 48 hours of arrest. All detained persons may have the
 legality of their detention reviewed within 48 hours of their arrest. This review is
 supposed to be conducted by the senior elected official (usually the mayor) of the
 locaity in which the suspect is held. Regardless of the legality of a detention, a pris-
 oner may only be released by court order. In some cases, detainees who are unaware
 of this, or who do not have the funds to hire a lawyer, may remain in prison for
 an extended period before being released. Bail is not generally available. Families
 
 
 of detainees sometimes intervene in an attempt to secure the prisoners' freedom
 through illegal means.
 In its first months after taking office in August, the Bucaram Government ordered
 the arrest of suspected corrupt civil servants, as well as some business executives,
 without proper evidence. Although the authorities released them within a few days
 in most cases, this practice led to numerous complaints of arbitrary arrest.
 Human rights organizations reported occasional cases of incommunicado deten-
 tion, although the law prohibits this practice. Despite provisions of the Penal Code,
 the police often detained suspects without the required written order. Even when
 an order was obtained, those charged with determining the validity of detention
 often allowed frivolous charges to be brought, either because they were overworked
 or because the accuser bribed them. In many instances, the system was used as a
 means of harassment in civil cases in which one party sought to have the other ar-
 rested on criminal charges. The authorities frequently detained suspects longer than
 24 hours before court orders were signed and often failed to bring charges against
 suspects within 48 hours of arrest. Preventive detention up to and including trial
 is legal under certain circumstances.
 The Government does not use exile as a method of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. In practice, however, the judiciary is susceptible to outside pressure.
 The regular court system tries most nonmilitary defendants, although some indig-
 enous groups try members independently for violations of tribal rules. Despite ef-
 forts begun in 1992 to depoliticize and modernize the court system, the judiciary
 continues to operate slowly and inconsistently. Judges reportedly rendered decisions
 more quickly or more slowly depending on political pressure or the payment of
 bribes. However, the norm is for lengthy periods before cases come to the courts.
 The failure of the justice system led to a growing number of cases of communities
 taking the law into their own hands (see Section L.a.). Through the first week of
 December, there were 23 reports of fatal lynchings and burning of alleged criminals
 by enraged citizens. These occurred particularly in indigenous communities and por
 neighborhoods of the major cities where there is little police presence. One of the
 most dramatic cases occurred in July in the town of Mana, Cotopaxi province, when
 an angry rowd stpped a poice vehicle transporting a group of five car thieves and,
 after wresting them from police custody, beat them to death and burned their bod-
 ies. The group reportedly had killed an individual in the course of stealing his car
 only days earlier, and the family of the victim and other townspeople ambushed the
 police escort to exact their own justice.
 The law provides for internationally accepted due process rights for criminal de-
 fendants, but the authorities often did not observe these rights in practice. By law,
 the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and defendants have the right
 to a public trial, defense attorneys, and appeal. They may present evidence, refuse
 to testify against themselves, and may confront and cross-examine witnesses. Al-
 though a public defender system exists, in practice there are relatively few attorneys
 available to defend the large number of indigent suspects.
 The legislature amended the Constitution in 1995 to stipulate that no testimony
 taken from a prisoner may be used as evidence in court unless the individual's law-
 yer was present at the taking of testimony. Implementing legislation, however, re-
 mains to be passed.
 Trial is supposed to begi within 15 to 60 days of the initial arrest, but in prac-
 tice, initiation of the trial phase can take years. Less than 40 percent of all pris-
 oners have been to trial. Indigenous people and other minorities are disproportion-
 ately affected by these delays as they are more likely to be poor and unable to buy
 their way out of pretrial detention. However, there was no evidence of a systematic
 effort to discriminate against women or minorities.
 A foreign assistance program begun in 1994 has enabled the courts to computerize
 the National Register of Prisoners. Use of this system made it possible for the courts
 to track prisoners' status more easily. Since its inception, the courts released over
 800 prisoners, who had either completed their sentences or who had never been
 tried but had served the maximum sentence for the alleged crime.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 and the authorities generally respected this provision in practice, but with some no-
 table exceptions. A case remains before the Supreme Court in which an independent
 
 
 438
 
 congressman, Fernando Larrea, was charged with treason for remarks he made on
 a provincial radio station in 1995 in which he ridiculed the president of the Su-
 preme Court and the commander of the army. (He spoke derisively of the role the
 army commander had played in the border hostilities with Peru.) While not releas-
 ing the tape or transcript of Larrea's intemperate remarks, the military proceeded
 to charge Larrea with treason under the National Emergency Decree then in force
 and initiated proceedings against him in a military court. The Supreme Court has
 yet to determine if the military court has jurisdiction.
 All of the major media organs-television, newspapers, and radio-are in local,
 private hands except for two government-owned radio stations. The law limits for-
 eign investment in broadcast media. Using a law (promulgated by the last military
 regime) that requires the media to give the Government free space or air time, the
 Government can and does require television and radio to broadcast government-pro-
 duced programs featuring the President and other top administration officials.
 Ecuador has a free and vigorous press. Ownership of the media is broad based,
 and editorials represent a wide range of political views and often criticize the Gov-
 ernment. However, some degree of self-censorship in the print media occurs, par-
 ticularly with respect to politically sensitive issues or stories about the military and
 its related industries.
 The Government does not interfere in issues involving academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of free assembly and association for peaceful purposes, and the Govern-
 ment generally respected these rights in practice. Public rallies require prior goverif-
 ment permits, which are generally granted, although exceptions occur. Numerous
 labor and student demonstrations too place without incident in the capital and the
 outlying regions. In general the security forces intervened in demonstrations only
 when there was violence against bystanders or property. During a strike in March
 by bus drivers in Quito, the authorities called in the military to clear blocked roads
 after 5 days of inaction by the police. The military injured several striking drivers
 in the course of the operation.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Numerous foreign religious orders and
 missionary groups are active.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refu-
 gees. The issue of provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no reports of
 forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. Since the return to civilian rule
 in 1979, citizens have actively exercised their right to change their national and
 local governments. There were 18 political parties spanning the ideological spectrum
 that participated in the 1996 national elections, 11 of which won representation in
 Congress. These elections resulted in the peaceful transfer of power from a center-
 right government to a populist government, as well as a realignment of power with-
 in the legislature.
 Voting is mandatory for literate citizens over 18 years of age and voluntary for
 illiterate citizens. The law does not permit active duty members of the military to
 vote. The Constitution bars members of the clergy and active duty military person-
 nel from election to Congress, the presidency, or vice presidency.
 Traditional elites tend to be self-perpetuating. Consequently, very few women,
 Afro-Ecuadorians, and indigenous people are found in high positions in government,
 although no specific laws or policies prevent women or minorities from attaining
 leadership positions. Women hold 4 of 82 seats in Congress. In July voters elected
 Rosalia Arteaga as the first female Vice President in the country's history.
 There are no Afro-Ecuadorians in Congress or in any senior level government
 jobs. Afro-Ecuadorian political leaders in Esmeraldas province (whose population is
 argely Afro-Ecuadorian) attribute this in part to the lack of identification of the
 Afro-Ecuadorian population with their own politicians.
 The indigenous movement, which long shunned traditional politics, formed an
 electoral movement called Pachakutik (which means "cataclysmic change" in
 Quichua) and ran candidates for national, provincial, and local office in the elec-
 tions. Pachakutik succeeded in electing eight members of congress (one national
 
 
 439
 deputy and seven provincial deputies) and mayors of several cities, including
 Cuenca-the third largest city. Although Pachakutik only received about 8 percent
 of the vote nationwide, its representation in Congress and at the provincial and mu-
 nicipal level assures the indigenous community a greater voice in government.
 Pachakutik's success also forced traditional political parties to focus attention on is-
 sues of importance to the indigenous population-long neglected by the political
 process.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups, both domestic and international, operate with-
 out restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases.
 Domestic human rights groups, such as the CEDHU and the Regional Latin Amer-
 ican Human Rights Association (ALDHU) were outspoken in their criticism of the
 Government's record on specific cases. Nevertheless, the Government contracted
 with the ALDHU to provide human rights training to the military and the police.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, sex, or social
 status. However, women, Afro-Ecuadorians, and indigenous people face significant
 discrimination.
 Women.-Although the law prohibits violence against women, including within
 marriage, it is a widespread practice. Many rapes go unreported because of the vic-
 tims' reluctance to confront the perpetrators. Women may only file complaints
 against a rapist or an abusive spouse or companion if they produce a witness. While
 some communities have established their own centers for counseling and legal sup-
 port of abused women, the Government only began to address this question seri-
 ously with the formation of the "Comisaria de la Mujer," or Women s Bureau, in
 1994. Although this office can accept complaints about abuse of women, it has no
 authority to act on them.
 A 1995 Law Against Violence Affecting Women and Children, drafted by a coali-
 tion of women's organizations, criminalizes spousal abuse for the first time, includ-
 ing physical, sexual, and psychological abuse. It also creates family courts and re-
 forms the Penal Code to give courts the power to separate an abusive spouse from
 the home. Congress approved the law in record time.
 Discrimination against women is pervasive in society, particularly with respect to
 educational and economic opportunities for those in the lower economic strata. The
 increasingly active women's movement blames culture and tradition for inhibiting
 achievement of full equality for women. There are fewer women in the professions
 and skilled trades than men, and pay discrimination against women is common.
 Women's groups accused the Bucaram administration of ignoring the cause of re-
 ducing violence against women because of the President's steadfast support for his
 Minister of Energy, who made denigrating public statements about women and who
 has been accused of physically assaulting women.
 Children.-The Government is committed in principle to the welfare of children
 but has not taken effective steps to promote it. The Government rarely enforces the
 constitutional requirement of education through the age of 14.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse against children. Government resources to
 assist children have traditionally been limited, although it instituted a program to
 care for the children of the working poor called "Operation Child ResOLie." Several
 private organizations are very active in programs to assist street children, and the
 U.N. Children's Fund also runs a program in conjunction with the Central Bank.
 Especially in urban areas, the children of the poor often experience severe hard-
 ships. It is common to see children as young as 5 or 6 years of age selling news-
 papers or candy on the street to support themselves or to augment the family in-
 come. Also, there are instances of prostitution by girls under 18 years of age in
 urban areas. In rural areas, young children often must leave school at an early age
 to help out on the family's plot of and.
 People With Dsabilities.-There is no official discrimination against disabled per-
 sons in employment, education, or the provision of other state services. However,
 there are no laws to guarantee disabled people access to public buildings or services,
 nor are they provide any other special government assistance.
 Indigenous People.-While at least 85 percent of all citizens claim some indige-
 nous heritage, culturally indigenous people make up about 15 to 20 percent of the
 total population. The vast majority of these people live in rural areas, and most live
 in varying degrees of poverty. Land is scarce in the more heavily populated highland
 areas where high infant mortality, malnutrition, and epidemic disease are also coin-
 
 
 mon. In addition, electricity and potable water are often unavailable. Although the
 rural education system is seriously deficient, many indigenous groups participated
 actively with the Ministry of Education in the development of the bi mgual edu-
 cation program used in rural public schools.
 Indigenous people enjoy the same civil and political rights as other citizens and
 also have several special privileges designed to allow them to manage their own af-
 fairs within their own communities. This is particularly true in the Amazon area
 where indigenous groups have claim to specific tracts of land. These groups also
 have begun to play an active role in decisionmaking with respect to the use of their
 lands for oil exploration and production, by lobbying the Government and enlisting
 the help of foreign nongovernmental organizations. Environmental groups and in-
 digenous organizations continued to blame oil companies for causing major environ-
 mental damage and to criticize their damage control efforts as insufficient.
 Despite their increasing political influence (see Section 3) and the efforts of grass-
 roots community groups, which were increasingly successful in pressuring the
 central Government to assist them, Indians continue to suffer discrimination at
 many levels of society. In an Augat beauty paeant in the predominantly Indian
 town of Otavalo, young women of indigenous bacground were denied participation
 in the contest based on their Indian heritage. Even after this blatant discrimination
 received national attention in the press and had provoked an appeal by President
 Bucaram, organizers of the event refused to admit contestants of Indian back-
 ground.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Thejpopulation of the rural, northern coastal
 area includes large numbers of Afro-Ecuadorian citizens. They suffer widespread
 poverty and pervasive discrimination, particularly with regard to educational and
 economic opportunity. There were no special government efforts to address these
 problems.
 There are five major Afro-Ecuadorian organizations active in the country, and
 these organizations estimate that Afro-Ecuadorians account for 700,000 people, or
 about 6 percent of the total population. While the presence of Afro-Ecuadorians has
 grown in the fields of sports and culture (the country's most prominent soccer stars
 and 1996 Miss Ecuador were Afro-Ecuadorian), educational opportunities continue
 to be limited. A recent census listed only 359 Afro-Ecuadorian lawyers, engineers,
 doctors, and economists.
 The press has focussed on lingering racism among all strata of society. Afro-Ecua-
 dorian organizations note that despite the absence of official discrimination, societal
 discrimination continues to affect them. For example, they assert that the police
 stop Afro-Ecuadorians for document checks with greater frequency than other citi-
 zens.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and Labor Code provide most
 workers with the right to form trade unions. Members of the police and the military,
 and public sector employees in nonrevenue producing entities are not free to form
 trade unions. The 1991 Labor Code reforms raised the number of workers required
 for an establishment to be unionized from 15 to 30, which the International Labor
 Organization's Committee on Freedom of Association considered too stringent a limi-
 tation at the plant workers' council level.
 While employees of stated-owned organizations enjoy rights similar to those in the
 private sector, the law technically prevents the majority of public sector employees
 from joining unions or exercising collective bargaining rights. Nevertheless, most
 Fublic empoyees maintain membership in some labor organization, and there are
 requent illegal" strikes. Despite official threats, the Government rarely takes ac-
 tion against striking public workers. Although the five umbrella organizations are
 politically independent, the two largest single labor unions, the Teachers' Union and
 the Union of Social Security Workers, are allied with the Movimiento Politico
 Democratico, the far-left socialist party.
 Approximately 12 percent of the work force is organized. There are four large
 labor centrals or confederations, three of which maintain international affiliation.
 None of the main labor centrals is firmly connected to any one political party, and
 there are no ties between the Government and any labor union.
 There are few restrictions on the right of workers to strike, although a 20-day
 cooling-off period is required before a strike is declared. The Labor Code revisions
 limit solidarity strikes or boycotts to 3 days, provided that they are approved by the
 Labor Ministry. In a legal strike, workers may take possession of the factory or
 workplace, thus ending production at the site, and receive police protection during
 the takeover. The employer must pay all salaries and benefits during a legal strike;
 the Labor Code protects strikers and their leaders from retaliation. The only signifi-
 
 
 441
 cant strikes were by public sector employees such as teachers and medical workers.
 None of the strikes resulted in violence.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The labor market is highly
 segmented, with a minority of workers in skilled, usually unionized, positions in
 state-run enterprises or in medium to large industries. Most of the economically ac-
 tive population is employed in the agricultural sector or the urban informal sector,
 the vast majority of these workers are not organized. The Labor Code requires that
 all private employers with 30 or more workers belonging to a union must negotiate
 collectively when the union so requests. Although approximately 12 percent of the
 work force is organized, collective bargaining agreements cover only one-quarter of
 these workers.
 The Labor Code streamlined the bargaining process in state enterprises by requir-
 ing workers to be represented by one labor union only. It prohibits discrimination
 against unions and requires that employers provide space for union activities upon
 the union's request. The law does not permit employers to dismiss a worker without
 the express permission of the Ministry of Labor, rulings that are not subject to judi-
 cial review. If the Ministry of Labor rules that a dismissal is unjustified, it can re-
 quire the employer to pay large indemnities or separation payments to the worker,
 although the reforms set a cap on such payments. The Labor Code provides for reso-
 lution of labor conflicts through an arbitration and conciliation board comprising one
 representative of the Ministry of Labor, two from the union, and two representatives
 of management.
 The Maquila (in bond) Law passed in 1990 permits the hiring of temporary work-
 ers for the maquila industries only. While there is no express prohibition on associa-
 tion rights in the Maquila Law, in practice it is difficult to organize temporary em-
 ployees on short-term contracts. Since temporary workers are not recognized by the
 Labor Code, they do not enjoy the same level of protection offered to other workers.
 The maquila system allows a company and its property to become an export process-
 ing zone wherever it is located. Many such "zones have thus been established; most
 are dedicated to textiles and fish processing.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory  Labor.-The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit compulsory labor, and there were no reports of it.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution establishes that
 children must attend school until the equivalent of 14 years of age. However, be-
 cause of the lack of schools in many rural communities and the need for children
 to work, this provision is rarely enforced. The law prohibits persons less than 14
 years old from working, except in special circumstances such as apprenticeships. It
 requires those between the ages of 14 and 18 years, to have the permission of their
 parent or guardian to work. The law prohibits children between he ages of 15 and
 18 years from working more than 7 hours per day or 35 hours per week, and it re-
 stricts children below the age of 15 years to a maximum of 6 hours per day and
 30 hours per week. In practice, the Ministry of Labor fails to enforce child labor
 laws. In rural areas many children attend school only sporadically after about 10
 years of age in order to contribute to household income as farm laborers. In the city
 many children under 14 years of age work in family-owned "businesses" in the infor-
 mal sector, shining shoes, collecting and eycling garba e, or as street peddlers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Labor has the principal
 in enforcing labor laws and carries this out through a corps of labor inspectors who
 are active in all 21 provinces. The Labor Code provides for a 40-hour workweek, a
 15-day annual vacation, a minimum wage, and other employer-provided benefits,
 such as uniforms and training opportunities.
 The Ministry of Labor sets the minimum wage every 6 months in consultation
 with the Commission on Salaries, but Congress may also adjust it. The statutory
 minimum wage is not adequate to provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and family. As of September, the minimum wage plus mandated bonuses provided
 a gross monthly compensation of approximately $160 (S(513,583). Most organized
 workers in state industries and formal sector private enterprises earned substan-
 tially more than the minimum wage and also received significant other benefits
 through collective bargaining agreements. The majority of workers, however, work
 in the large informal and rural sector without recourse to the minimum wage or le-
 gally mandated benefits.
 The Labor Code also provides general protection for workers' health and safety
 on the job. A worker may not leave the workplace of his own volition, even if there
 is a hazardous situation. The worker is allowed to request that an inspector from
 the Ministry of Labor come to the workplace and confn-rm the hazard; that inspector
 may then close down the workplace.
 The Government enforces health and safety standards and regulations through
 the Social Security Institute. In the formal sector, occupational health and safety
 
 
 is not a major problem. However, there are no specific regulations governing health
 and safety standards in the agricultural sector and, in practice, there is no enforce-
 ment of safety rules in the small mines that make up the vast majority of the min-
 ing sector.
