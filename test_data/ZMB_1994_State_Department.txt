 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a republic governed by a president, a unicameral national assembly,
 and a constitutionally independent judiciary. After two decades of one-party rule,
 free and fair multiparty elections in October 1991 resulted in the victory of the
 Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) and the election of President Frederick
 J.T. Chiluba, a former trade unionist. In addition to the former ruling party, the
 United National Independence Party (UNIP), some 30 opposition parties were active
 to varying degrees.
 The Zambia police, divided into regular and paramilitary units, and operating
 under the Ministry of Home Affairs, have primary responsibility for maintaining
 law and order. In January President Chiluba appointed a new inspector general of
 police with a mandate to eliminate human rights abuses and corruption. Despite re-
 form efforts begun in 1994, including human rights training and punishment of
 some offenders, the police continued to commit abuses, including beating and
 extrajudicial killing of criminal suspects and detainees. The Zambia Intelligence Se-
 curity Service, under the Office of the President, is responsible for intelligence and
 internal security.
 During 1994 the Chiluba Government continued its free market economic reform
 program. Tight monetary and fiscal policies kept inflation low as the Zambian cur-
 rency stabilized and real interest rates fell dramatically. There was considerable
 public criticism of the reform program, exacerbated by allegations of high-level cor-
 ruption in the Government. Poor rans at the end of the 1993-94 growing season
 resulted in a reduced harvest of maize, the staple food. The Government relied on
 imports to make up the shortfall. The key copper industry benefited from increased
 world prices during much of the year, but production fell from 1993 levels.
 The Government began to take steps to address one of its most serious human
 rights problems, police brutality. Throughout the year the government-appointed
 Human Rights Commission aggressively pursued allegations of past and present
 human rights abuses and kept public attention focused on incidents of police wrong-
 doing. Nevertheless, by year's end much remained to be done to restore professional-
 ism and discipline to the police force.
 The Government generally respected Zambians' civil liberties but persisted in at-
 tempts to limit freedom of the press. The Constitutional Review Commission took
 public testimony during most of the year but had not yet drafted a new constitution
 to replace the 1991 Constitution. The Government's commitment to legal reform
 with respect to the press remained unfulfilled. In December the National Assembly
 passed a bill strengthening judicial autonomy. Prison conditions deteriorated fur-
 ther, posing an increased threat to the health and lives of inmates, and women con-
 tinued to experience discrimination in both law and fact. Wife beating and rape re-
 mained widespread.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings during the year, but police continued to use excessive force that often re-
 sulted in extrajudicial killings. In one well-publicized case in January, police
 claimed to have killed three armed criminal suspects attempting to flee the scene
 of a burglary. However, after witnesses testified they had seen police take two of
 the three men into custody, the police revised their accounting of the incident,
 
 
 claiming instead that the two suspects had died of wounds suffered during a subse-
 quent escape attempt. Credible reports indicated that the police had interrogated
 the two suspects and had killed one of them with a single shot in one eye.
 According to reliable press reports, almost all based on statements by police
 spokesmen, police killed at least 30 criminal suspects between January 1 and No-
 vember 15. Most of these killings allegedly occurred when police attempted to appre-
 hend suspects during the commission of crimes.
 At least 10 criminal suspects died in police custody, mostly as a result of beatings
 inflicted by police officers. For example, the Human Rights Commission heard testi-
 mony from a Lusaka family that a relative died on May 19 after police broke his
 neck with an irn bar. On June 10, a robbery suspect severely beaten by police died
 at Matero police station in Lusaka. In another incident, never fully explained, a rob-
 bery suspect allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in a jail cell in
 Chililaborbwe.
 Throughout the year, government officials, nongovernmental organizations, and
 the press closely scrutinized police involvement in human rights abuses, criminal ac-
 tivity, and corruption. In January President Chiluba appointed Francis Ndhlovu as
 the new Inspector General of Police and gave him a mandate to reform the force.
 Ndblovu instituted a variety of measures designed to restore discipline, professional-
 ism, and respect for human rights. These included involuntarily retiring several sen-
 ior officers; reopening the police training academy, which had been closed for 7
 years, with a new curriculum that includes a human rights segment; cooperating
 with the Human Rights Commission in making police officers available to testify;
 arranging with the nongovernmental Zambia Civic Education Association (ZCEA) to
 provide human rights training to officers in selected police stations; undertakig in-
 vestigations of instances of police use of excessive force; and beginning to discipline
 and prosecute officers who committed human rights abuses. By August 1, some 230
 middle-ranking and senior police officers were enrolled in training courses at the po-
 lice academy.
 According to statistics made available by Inspector General Ndhlovu, at least 33
 police officers were the subjects of internal investigations or prosecutions between
 January and September. At year's end, most of these cases, which involved murder,
 attempted murder, and deaths in poie cell, reaied before the courts. However,
 in 1994 the courts sentenced at least three officers to prison terms. Further, accord-
 ing to reports in the Zambian press, the authorities arrested at least 16 police offi-
 cers between January 1 and September 15 on such criminal charges as robbery and
 possession of illegal narcotics.
 In addition, the Human Rights Commission, chaired by prominent attorney Bruce
 Munyama, aggressively examined plice human rights abuses in public hearings
 held throughout the year. These hearings not only brought to light numerous
 abuses, but they also forced police officers to account for their behavior in sworn
 testimony. By year's end, the Commission had not yet submitted to the President
 its final report, which will include recommendations to improve the human rights
 performance of the police.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known instances of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the 1991 Constitution prohibits torture, police regularly used excessive
 force wen apprehending, interrogating, and detaining criminal suspects or illegal
 aliens. In most such instances, detaining officers beat suspects. During the year, the
 Human Rights Commission heard testimony from numerous credible witnesses who
 said police had assaulted and beaten them. In one case, a middle-ranking police offi-
 cer admitted that a senior officer had instructed her to deny medical attention to
 a suspect whom other officers had beaten. In another incident, the authorities dis-
 missed from the force and arrested four officers involved in abusing a young woman
 at Woodlands police station in Lusaka.
 By year's end, the Government had not disciplined or prosecuted any of the indi-
 viduals allegedly involved in the torture of persons detained in connection with the
 1993 state of emergency. According to the Law Association of Zambia, officers who
 in 1993 beat a youth suspected of theft are still employed.
 Deteriorating prison conditions posed an increased threat to prisoners' lives. Ac-
 cording to official statistics, prisons designed to hold 6,500 prisoners held over
 12 000. This severe overcrowding, combined with poor sanitation inadequate medi-
 cal facilities, meager food supplies, and lack of potable water resulted in serious out-
 breaks of dysentery and other diseases at various prisons throughout the year. In
 July a prisoner in Mongu died from meningitis an din August a prisoner in Kitwe
 died from dysentery, according to reports in the Zambian press. Also in August, dys-
 entery struck some 44 inmates at Kamfinsa prison in Kitwe.
 
 
 292
 During August an official told Home Affairs Minister Chitalu Sampa that
 .Karfinsa, Kansenshi, and Ndola remand prisons had run out of food and were feed-
 ing prisoners only coarse hominy and salt. The Human Rights Commission visited
 Kamfinsa prison in early 1994 and was reportedly appalled-by the deplorable living
 conditions of prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Criminal suspects are often arrested on
 the basis of flimsy evidence or an uncorroborated accusation. In these and other
 criminal cases, the law requires that a detainee be charged and brought before a
 magistrate within 24 hours. Pretrial detainees are allowed access by attorneys and
 family members. However, in practice, the authorities hold most detainees for more
 than I month from commission of an offense to first appearance before a magistrate.
 In many cases, an additional priod of 6 months elapses before the magistrate com-
 mits the defendant to the High Court for trial. Following committal, preparation of
 the magistrate court record for transmittal to the High Court takes months--in
 some cases as long as a year. Once a case reaches the High Court for trial, court
 proceedings last an average of 6 months.
 Approximately 3,000 of the 12,000 prisoners are awaiting trial on criminal
 charges. In early 1994, in an effort to demonstrate that the courts as well as pros-
 ecutors were responsible for long delays in the judicial process, the Director of Pub-
 lic Prosecutions compiled a list of appromnately 150 prisoners who had been await-
 ing trial since 1988. In some cases, defendants have been awaiting trial for 10 years.
 In August a judge discharged a defendant who had been in custody since 1986.
 These long delays are the result of inadequate resources, inefficiency, lack of trained
 personnel, and broad rules of procedure that give wide latitude for prosecutors and
 defense attorneys to request adjoumments.
 Although there is a functioning bail system, overcrowded prisons reflect the large
 number of detainees who have committed serious but common offenses for which
 bail is not granted. These include murder, aggravated robbery, and since 1993, vio-
 lations of the narcotics laws. Also, poor or indigent detainees rarely have the finan-
 cial means to post bail.
 The government legal aid office is responsible for providing legal representation
 to poor or indigent detainees and defendants in both criminal and civil cases. In
 practice, few receive assistance. In 1994 the office had 15 attorneys to cover the en-
 tire country and a budget of $110,000.
 According to well-informed sources, police stations frequently become "debt collec-
 tion centers," where police officers, acting upon an unofficial complaint, will detain
 a debtor without charge indefinitely untilhe or she pays the complainant. In return,
 the police receive a percentage of the payment. This situation is commonplace
 among police stations m Copperbelt province.
 The authorities held approximately 550 foreigners, principally from neighboring
 countries, as illegal aliens until they could deport them. At times, these detentions
 last months or years.
 In the past the Government has not used exile for political purposes. However
 on September 1, the Government deported John Chinula, a member of the Central
 Committee of UNIP, the former ruling party. Minister of Home Affairs Chitalu
 Sampa said that Chinula had been determined by the Government to have been a
 "prohibited immigrant" who entered Zambia illegally from Malawi, where the Gov-
 ernment alleged he was born. Legal and human rights groups protested the deporta-
 tion, asserting-along with Chinula-that Chinula had been born in Zambia and
 that the deportation was a denial of due process. Zambian law provides that a pro-
 hibited immigrant is liable to deportation once a valid deportation order is signed.
 Chinula's longstanding ties to Zambia and his prominence as a politician raised
 questions about the Government's motives in deporting him.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL--The Government respects the independence of the
 judiciary. On December 2, the National Assembly passed a judicial autonomy bill
 that will enhance the independence of the courts by separating their administration
 from the Ministry of Legal Affairs.
 The President nominates and the National Assembly confirms the Chief Justice
 and the other eight members of the Supreme Court. The Court has appellate juris-
 diction for all legal and constitutional disputes. Several high courts have authority
 to hear criminal and civil cases and appeals from lower courts. Magistrate courts
 have original jurisdiction in some criminal and civil cases, while local, or customary,
 courts handle most civil cases at the local level.
 These local courts employ the principles of customary law, which vary widely
 throughout the country. Lawyers are barred from participating, and there are few
 formal rules of procedure. Presiding judges, who are usually prominent local citi-
 zens, have great power to invoke customary law in rendering judgments regarding
 weddings, divorces, inheritances, other civil proceedings, and minor criminal mat-
 
 
 ters. Judgments are often not in accordance with the Penal Code; for example, they
 tend to discriminate against women in matters of inheritance (see Section 5).
 Trials in magistrate courts are public, and defendants have the opportunity to
 confront accusers and present witnesses. Many defendants, however, are too poor
 to retain a lawyer and the poor state of the Government's legal aid department
 means that many Zambians entitled to legal aid find that it is unavailable.
 There are no political prisoners in Zambia. The trials of a number of UNIP mem-
 bers detained in connection with the 1993 state of emergency continued in the
 courts during 1994. All defendants remained free on bail while their trials pro-
 ceeded. One person convicted in 1993 remained free pending consideration of his ap-
 peal. In March a Lusaka magistrate acquitted one of the defendants. In September
 another magistrate found Member of Parliament Wezi Kaunda, son of the former
 president, guilty of possession of a seditious document-the so-called zero option
 plan. Kaunda was exonerated, however, of the more serious charge of treason and
 remained free as he appealed the conviction to the High Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Iome, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for respect for privacy andthe inviolability of the home, and
 the authorities generally respected these rights in practice. Except during a state
 of emergency, the law requires a warrant before police may enter a home. Roundups
 of suspected illegal aliens in the home or workplace continued. According to the gov-
 ernment Commissioner for Refugees, immigration officials are empowered under the
 law to conduct these roundups without a warrant.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While the Constitution provides for freedom of
 expression and of the press, the Penal Code lists various prohibited activities that
 may be broadly interpreted and in effect restrict freedom of expression and press.
 By year's end, no action had been taken on media reform proposals to revise many
 of these archaic Penal Code provisions. The Government generally respected free-
 dom of expression, but invoked these restrictive laws--for example, prohibiting defa-
 mation of the President-in selected cases.
 The Government or its appointed officials filed over two dozen libel and defama-
 tion suits against the independent weekly newspaper, The Post, in response to a se-
 ries of headlines and stories focusing mainly on issues of corruption and controver-
 sial government policies. The Government harassed Post personnel by detaining
 them for short periods for questioning in connection with these reports. In another
 instance the Government charged a Member of Parliament and former minister
 with maing accusatory statements in the course of his reaction to having been fired
 from his ministerial position. At year's end, these libel and defamation suits were
 still awaiting decisions by the judiciary.
 In August-Parliament passed an ethics bill, one section of which extended the au-
 thority of investigative tribunals to call as witnesses journalists and media man-
 agers who print allegations of parliamentary misconduct. Failure to cooperate with
 the tribunal may result in charges of contempt punishable by up to 6 months in
 jail. Although the Government denied it, this was seen by the media as a clear in-
 fringement on press freedom and a means for parliamentarians to bypass the
 clogged court system in dealing with libel suits against the media. The Press Asso-
 ciation of Zambia announced its own media ethics code and voluntary industry eth-
 ics board within days after the bill was passed, denouncing the amendment in the
 process.
 The Government owns the two most widely circulated newspapers, as well as
 most radio and television broadcasting stations. There are a number of independent
 newspapers, three of which are active in questioning government actions and poli-
 cies and which enjoy considerable circulation. At midyear, the Government approved
 and issued eight licenses to independent radio and television broadcasters to begin
 construction of facilities. The first of these went on the air in December. The Gov-
 ernment exercises considerable influence over the government-owned media, which
 to varying degrees have followed the government line on important issues.
 The Government took no action to restrain academic freedom during the year. In
 October, however, the Government sternly warned University of Zambia students
 not to participate actively in politics. Education Minister Alfeyo Hambayi, recalling
 student unrest that has led to frequent university closings, said students wishing
 to participate in politics should leave school. Authorities threatened that students
 who violated the ban would lose their scholarships.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association. In practice, the Government respected
 these provisions. Under the Public Order Act of 1955, persons or organizations wish-
 ing to hold an assembly, public meeting, or procession must first apply for a permit.
 
 
 294
 The Government routinely granted these permits to political parties and nonpolitical
 organizations, including to former President Kenneth Kaunda, who beginning in
 July held a series of political meetings and rallies.
 All organizations must apply formally for registration to the Registrar of Societies.
 In most cases the authorities routinely approved these applications. However, an Is-
 lamic party, which the Government refused to register in 1993, had not been reg-
 istered at year's end. During the year, there were over 30 political parties in oper-
 ation.
 c. Freedom of Relgion.-Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution,
 and all faiths worship freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 pafration.-The Constitution provides citizens the right to move freely throughout
 Zambia, to reside in any part of the country, and to depart and return to the coun-
 try without restriction. The authorities generally respected these rights during 1994,
 but police roadblocks to control criminal activity continued, and police sometimes ex-
 torted money and goods from motorists.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that
 there were approximately 141,000 refugees, mainly Angolans, in Zambia in 1994,
 down slightly from 1993. The Government cooperated with the UNHCR in process-
 ing applications for refugee status.
 A steady trickle of Zairians continued to cross into Zambia during the year. In
 response to alleged criminal activities of many Zairians in the border region, the
 Government rounded up, arrested, and deported many Zairians and other illegal
 aliens throughout the year. The deportation of illegal aliens is lawful, but Zairians
 and others who had been accorded refugee status by the UNHCR were sometimes
 picked up and held for varying lengths of time before being released. In several
 cases, the Government deported refugees who were registered with the UNHCR.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Zambian citizens exercised the right to change their government in free and fair
 multiparty elections in 1991, following years of one-party rule by UNIP. Nationwide
 local government elections are scheduled for 1995; elections for President and the
 National Assembly are scheduled for 1996. The ruling MMD controls the executive
 branch and the National Assembly.
 Under the 1991 Constitution the President wields broad authority. Although the
 National Assembly ratifies major appointments and has other powers, in practice
 it continued during 1994 to provide only a limited check on executive authority. The
 state of emergency that President Chiluba declared in March 1993 lapsed 3 months
 later, and he did not use this constitutionally authorized power during 1994. The
 pace of constitutional reform increased during the year as the 24-member Constitu-
 tioial Review Commission conducted hearings throughout the nation.
 The MMD continued to be the dominant political force in the country. UNIP was
 further weakened by internal divisions, exacerbated during the last 6 months of the
 year by former president Kaunda's return to active politics. The National Party,
 formed in 1993, foundered due to indecisive leadership, internal divisions, and a
 lack of clear direction. These and other political parties generally operated without
 government interference, although individual UNIP members were sometimes sub-
 jected to harassment. Several political parties contested National Assembly by-elec-
 tions, all but one of which were won by the MMD. These elections featured a low
 turnout of registered voters, and their fairness was undermined by the MMD's use
 of government resources--including the state-owned media-during campaigns. In
 some instances, MMD campaign themes were highly intimidating, such as when
 high-ranking government officials told voters that their region would not receive de-
 velopment assistance if they failed to elect the MMD candidate.
 Opposition parties called on the MMD to update the voter register in order to en-
 franchise thousands of citizens who became eligible to vote since the register was
 last updated in 1989. Although the Government publicly recognized the need to re-
 vise the register, by year's end it continued to delay the preparation of a concrete
 registration plan.
 The number of influential women in politics and government is increasing.
 Women now serve as cabinet ministers, deputy ministers, members of the National
 Assembly, ministerial permanent secretaries, numerous elected local government of-
 ficials, and leaders of nongovernmental organizations.
 
 
 295
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights and civic organizations operated without government
 hindrance. These include the Law Association of Zambia, the Foundation for Demo-
 cratic Process, and the Zambia Civic Education Association. Other groups were ac-
 tive in promoting women's civil and political rights. The government-appointed
 Human Rights Commission operated throughout the year and, as previously noted,
 was a vigorous human rights advocate.
 In general, the Government continued to be receptive to criticism from human
 rights and civic organizations, but on occasion, government officials, including the
 Home Affairs Minister accused human rights monitors of abetting crime and
 thwarting the work of tihe police through their focus on the victims of police brutal-
 ity. Despite such charges, the police cooperated with the ZCEA during part of the
 year to facilitate human rights training to police officers, although a dispute over
 course content disrupted the training in August. In September the ZCEA and police
 agreed to resume the training in early 1995 at the police training academy. Police
 officers regularly appeared be fore the Human Rights Commission.
 The Government was receptive to inquiries or visits by international human
 rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, tribe, sex, place of origin,
 marital status, political opinion, color, or creed.
 Women.-Both the Constitution and law entitle women to full equality with men
 in most areas. In practice, Zambian women are severely disadvantaged compared
 to men in formal employment and education. Married women who are employed
 often suffer from discriiminatory conditions of service. For example, allowances for
 housing and children and tax rebates to which they as employees are entitled often
 accrue to their husbands. Similarly, women have little independent access to credit
 facilities; in most cases, they remain dependent on husbands, who are required to
 sign for loans. As a result, few women own their own homes.
 Customary law and practice also place women in subordinate status with respect
 to property, inheritance, and marriage, despite various constitutional and legislative
 provisions. Under traditional customs revalent in most ethnic  ups, all rights to
 inheritproperty rest with the deceasecfmann family. The 1989 ff-testate Succession
 Act is designed to guarantee women a share of the joint estate. Under the Act, the
 children of a deceased man share equally 50 percent; the widow receives 20 percent;
 the parents, 20 percent; and relatives, 10 percent.
 In practice, "proprty grabbing" by the relatives of the deceased man continues
 to be rampant, particularly when local customary courts have jurisdiction. These
 courts often use a different law, the Local Courts Act, to distribute inheritances
 without reference to the percentages mandated in the Succession Act. As a result,
 many widows receive little or nothing frm the estate. Another problem is that fines
 pby                                eSuccessionAct are eraordinarily   w gven
 and nongovernmental organizations examined ways to amend the law to safeguard
 the rights of women more effectively and to increase the penalties for violations. By
 ear's end, however, an amended Succession Act had not yet been introduced in Par-
 liament.
 Violence against women remained a serious problem. Wife bating and rape were
 commonplace. According to official statistics, 2,243 rape cases were reported to the
 police between 1990 and 1994. Of these, 709 resulted in conviction and 102 in a-
 quittal. The remainder were either dismissed or are unresolved. Defendants con-
 victed of rape normally were sentenced to prison at hard labor. Since many rapes
 are not reported to the police, the actual number is certainly much higher. Domestic
 assault is a criminal offense, ut in practice police are often reluctant to pursue re-
 ports of wife bating. In June the spokesman for the Zambia police said that officers
 will follow up on a case if a victim desires to press charges, but that in other cases
 police will try to broker a reconciliation. The Government and nongovernmental or-
 ganizations expressed increasing concern about violence against women, and the
 media devoted considerable publicity to it during the year.
 Children.-The Government seeks to improve the welfare of children, but scarce
 resources and ineffective implementation of socal programs adversely affected the
 welfare of children and adults alike. Due to harsh economic conditions, both rural
 and urban children often must work in the informal sector to help families make
 ends meet (see Section 6.d.).
 
 
 296
 
 There was no pattern of discrimination or societal abuse against children. In Sep-
 tember the Ministry of Legal Affairs sponsored a 3-day worshop on "The Human
 Ri hts of the Child.
 People With Disabilities.-Persons with disabilities face significant societal dis-
 crimination in employment and education, and the Government took steps to ame-
 liorate their hardships, including establishing a national trust fund to provide loans
 to the disabled to help them start businesses. The Government has not leqislated
 or otherwise mandated accessibility to public buildings and services for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of citizens
 to form trade unions, and approximately 60 percent of the 300,000 formal sector
 workers are unionized. The country's 19 large national unions, organized by indus-
 try or profession, are affiliated with the Zanbia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU).
 The ZCTU is democratically operated and, like its constituent unions, is independ-
 ent of any political party and the Government. By a majority vote of its members,
 a union may decide on affiliation with the ZCTU or with trade unions or organiza-
 tions outside Zambia. The ZCTU is a member of the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions. Labor leaders travel without restriction to international con-
 ferences and to visit counterparts abroad. In late 1994, the Mine Workers Union of
 Zambia and a number of other ZCTU constituent unions, in rejecting the results of
 ZCTU leadership elections, took steps to disaffiliate themselves from ZCTU and es-
 tablish a rival umbrella organization. This process continued as the year ended.
 The 1993 Industrial and Labor Relations Act (ILRA) reestablished the "one indus-
 try, one union" principle. The Bankers Union of Zambia, a new union, was duly reg-
 istered with the Government in 1993 but has been unable to operate because the
 employers recognize the existing Zambia Union of Financial and Allied Workers.
 In November 1993 the Ndola High Court ordered the Government to register the
 Secondary School Teachers Union of Zambia. The Government appealed to the Su-
 preme Court, noting that secondary school teachers were already represented by the
 Zambia National Union of Teachers. The case remained pending at year's end.
 All workers have the right to strike, except those engaged in essential services,
 the Zambia Defense Force, the judiciary, the police, the prison service, and the intel-
 ligence security service. The ILRA defines essential services as power, medical,
 water, sewerage, firefighting, and certain mining occupations essential to safety. It
 permits strikes only after all other legal recourse has been exhausted, and in prac-
 tice all work stoppages during the year were illegal. The ILRA prohibits employers
 from retribution against employees engaged in legal trade union activities. Wor ers
 engaged in illegal strikes do not enjoy this protection, and there were at least two
 instances in 1994 when employers fired workers engaged in illegal strikes.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The rig ht to bargain collec-
 tively is established by legislation and is contained in the ILRA. Employers and
 unions in each industry negotiate collective bargaining agreements through joint
 councils in which there is no government involvement. Civil servants and teachers,
 as public officials, negotiate directly with the Government. Collective disputes are
 first referred to a conciliator or a beard of conciliation. If conciliation fails to resolve
 the dispute, the parties may refer the case to the Industrial Relations Court or, in
 the case of employees, vote to strike. In practice, the industry joint councils function
 effectively as collective bargaining mechanisms.
 The ILRA prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union mem-
 bers and organizers. An employee who believes he or she has been penalized for
 union activities may, after exhausting any existing administrative channels for re-
 lief, file a complaint with the Industrial Relations Court. This Court has the power
 to order appropriate redress for the aggrieved worker. The complainant may appeal
 a judgment of the Industrial Relations Court to the Supreme Court. In practice, the
 Court often orders employers to reinstate workers found to have been the victims
 of discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits slavery
 and involuntary servitude, but it authorizes citizens to be called upon to perform
 labor in specific instances, for example, during national emergencies or disasters.
 Moreover, a citizen can be required to perform labor that is associated with tradi-
 tional civic or communal obligations, as when all members of a village are called
 upon to assist in preparing for a visit by a traditional leader or other dignitary.
 d. Minimum       or Employment of Children.-By legislation, the minimum age
 for employment of children is 16. The Labor Commissioner effectively enforces this
 law in the industrial sector, in which, because of the high demand for employment
 by adults, there are no jobs available to children. However, the law is not enforced
 
 
 297
 for the vast majority of Zambians who work in the subsistence agricultural, domes-
 tic service, and informal sectors where persons under age 16 are often employed.
 In urban areas children conmony engage in street trading.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Wrk.--a August, pursuant to Statutory Instrument
 Number 99, the Minister of Labor set the minimum wage for nonunionized workers
 at !0.11 (70.30 kwacha) per hour. On a monthly basis, assuming a 48-hour work-
 week, a worker earning the minimum wage would receive $22 (14,600 kwacha). The
 minimum wage covers nonunionized workers in categories such as general workers,
 cleaners, office orderlies, and watchmen. The minimum wage is insufficient to pro-
 vide an adequate standard of living, and most minimum wage earners must supple-
 ment their incomes through second jobs, subsistence farming, or reliance on the ex-
 With respect to unionized workers, each industr through collective bargaining
 sets its own wage scales. In practice, almost all umonized workers receive salaries
 considerably higher than the nonunion minimum wage.
 The legal maimum workweek for nonunionized workers is 48 hours. Maximum
 limits for unionized workers vary. The minimum workweek for full-time employ-
