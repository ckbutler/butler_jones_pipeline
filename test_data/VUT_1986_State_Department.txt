 VANUATU
 Vanuatu, the former New Hebrides, is a South Pacific island
 nation with an estimated population of 136,000. One of 3
 countries comprising Melanesia, Vanuatu became independent in
 1980, following more than 70 years of joint British-French
 rule. It has a parliamentary system of government with a
 prime minister and a parliament, the Representative Assembly.
 Independence was accompanied by temporary political
 turbulence, including an attempt at secession, which left a
 legacy of suspicion of outside interference. However, most of
 the internal strains from the 1980 secessionist rebellion have
 subsided.
 Political legitimacy in Vanuatu is based on majority rule,
 supported by both Melanesian and Western tradition. The first
 general election since independence, held in November 1983,
 was vigorously contested and democratically conducted. A
 second parliamentary election is scheduled for 1987. The
 courts are independent and solicitous of individual rights.
 The police and military are under civilian control.
 The Vanuatu economy resembles that of other Pacific island
 states in its dependence on international trade and its
 vulnerability to shifts in world market prices. Tourism
 formerly earned more foreign exchange than all exports
 combined but recently has been very depressed.
 The favorable human rights situation in Vanuatu changed little
 in 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Neither the Government nor any organized group resorts to
 political violence.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Constitutional guarantees against torture and cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment are observed in practice and enforced
 by the courts. Prisoners have recourse to an Ombudsman.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no politically motivated arrests in Vanuatu. Arrest
 is by warrant. There is no exile. Suspects have free access
 to a lawyer of their choice. The constitutional guarantee
 that suspects will be informed of charges and given a speedy
 hearing before a judge is observed. The use of forced or
 compulsory labor is not permitted, and there have been no
 reports of either practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The courts uphold constitutional provisions for a fair public
 trial, presumption of innocence until proven guilty,

 prohibition against double jeopardy, the right of habeas
 corpus, and appeal to the Supreme Court. The courts are
 independent of military or executive interference. There were
 no reports of arbitrary or unfair exercise of judicial
 authority.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Sanctity of the home and family and privacy of correspondence
 are observed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although freedom of expression is guaranteed by the
 Constitution, the Government publishes and controls the
 country's only national newspaper and manages the national
 radio station. There is no independent newspaper or radio.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no restrictions on the formation of political
 parties or trade unions in Vanuatu. There are two main
 political parties and several relatively new smaller parties.
 To an extent unusual among Pacific island states, the ruling
 Vanua'aku Party is the primary policymaking body; its
 decisions are implemented by the Government. Vanuatu has a
 small but active trade union movement with the right to
 organize, strike, and bargain collectively. As of 1984, there
 were 21 registered trade unions and 6 employer associations.
 In February 1984, a labor council, the Vanuatu Trade Union
 Congress, was formed and became a member of the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is protected by law and respected in
 practice. Missionaries of various Christian denominations
 work without restriction.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Vanuatu citizens are free to travel internally and
 externally. There are no restrictions on returning from
 abroad.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Vanuatu is a multiparty democracy. Numerous candidates
 competed in the parliamentary elections in 1983; both the
 campaign and voting were considered by outside observers to
 have been fair. Elections to provincial and local councils
 have also been contested and fair. However, members of the
 opposition complained in the latter part of the year that they
 were denied use of both the government-owned radio and press
 to a significant degree.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government publicly has expressed willingness to permit
 investigation by qualified and objective outside observers.
 There were no charges of human rights violations in 1986.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Most of the people are Melanesians whose ancestors migrated
 from New Guinea. There are small minorities of Chinese,
 Fijians, Vietnamese, Tongans, and others; most of them are
 concentrated in the two towns and on a few plantations. These
 minorities are not discriminated against. Although there have
 been rumors of corrupt practices by members of the ruling
 Vanua'aku Party, there is no evidence to suggest a pattern of
 discrimination in government provision of basic services.
 While women have equal rights under the law, they are only
 slowly emerging from a traditional culture characterized by
 male dominance, a general reluctance to educate women, and a
 widespread belief that women should devote themselves
 primarily to propagation and child rearing. Nevertheless, an
 increasing number are finding work in the unskilled,
 semiskilled, and social occupations. Although the 39 seats in
 the Representative Assembly are all held by men, there was a
 woman candidate in the 1983 election, and she was defeated by
 only a small margin. Several women hold senior positions in
 the Government, but otherwise women have not found their way
 into positions of leadership.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 In 1985 a minimum wage law was adopted. There is also
 legislation, regulating conditions of work, including hours,
 and with provisions concerning child labor. No information is
 available on occupational safety and health legislation. A
 large proportion of the population is still engaged in
 subsistence agriculture or fishing.
