 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multiparty system and free elections.
 There is no constitution; a series of "basic laws" provide for fundamental rights. The
 legislature, or Knesset, has the power to dissolve the Government and limit the au-
 thority of the executive branch. The judiciary is independent. In a landmark deci-
 sion in November, the Supreme Court established the principle of judicial review of
 legislation in cases that are appealed to the court. Public debate is open and lively,
 and a free press scrutinizes all aspects of society and politics.
 Since its founding in 1948, Israel has been in a state of war with most of its Arab
 neighbors. It concluded a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and with Jordan in 1994.
 As a result of the 1967 war, Israel occupied the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the

 the annex appended to this report.

 eastern sector of Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. Throughout its existence, Israel
 has experienced numerous terrorist attacks. It relies heavily on its military and se-
 curity services and retains many security-related regulations from the penod of the
 British Mandate.
 The historic process of reconciliation between Israel and its neighbors that began
 with the Madrid Conference in 1991 continued in 1995. On September 28, Israel
 and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signed an agreement that provided
 for Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to redeploy from Palestinian areas in the West
 Bank, the further transfer of certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinians,
 and for Palestinian elections. The agreement also calls for the release of certain Pal-
 estinian prisoners. Separate agreements earlier in the year transferred a variety of
 civil powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority (PA). (See the annex
 to this report.)
 Internal security is. the responsibility of the General Security Service (GSS)-
 (Shin Bet, or Shabak), which is under the authority of the Prime Ministers office.
 The police are under the authority of a different minister. The IDF is under the au-
 thority of a civilian Minister of Defense. The IDF includes a significant portion of
 the adult population on active duty or reserve status and plays a role in maintain-
 ing internal security. The Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in the Knesset
 reviews the activities of the IDF and Shin Bet.
 Israel has an advanced economy, and citizens enjoy a high standard of living. The
 economy has grown by an average of 6 percent a year in the past several years. Un-
 employment in 1995 averaged about 6.3 percent, the lowest since 1987, and inflation
 was about 8.1 percent, the lowest since 1969. Since implementation of an economic
 stabilization plan in 1985, the Government has moved gradually to reduce state
 intervention in the economy. Much progress has been made in liberalizing capital
 markets, but privatization and labor market reform have progressed more slowly.
 Despite the continued dominant role of the Government in the economy, individuals
 are generally free to invest in private interests and own property.
 The Government generally respects human rights, and citizens enjoy a wide range
 of civil and other rights. Positive human rights developments flowed naturally as
 peace agreements were implemented. During the year, the Government released
 about 1,100 Palestinian detainees and prisoners; another 1,200 detainees were
 scheduled to be released in January 1996. In other developments, the Government
 passed legislation banning discrimination in employment, as well as legislation
 mandating affirmative action for women and Israeli Arabs.
 The assassination of Prime Minister Rabin in November horrified the nation and
 prompted calls for a lowering of the national rhetoric in political discourse. There
 was also renewed debate over the limits of free speech as the Government sought
 to discourage political language that would incite further violence.
 Israel's main human rights problems have arisen from its policies and practices
 in the occupied territories. The redeployment of the IDF from most major Palestin-
 ian population areas in the West Bank during the year, and its previous withdrawal
 from Gaza, are significantly reducing these problems. In addition, while the Govern-
 ment has worked to close the social and economic gap between Israel's Arab and
 Jewish citizens, the Arab minority still does not share fully in the rights granted
 to, and the obligations imposed on, Jewish citizens.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political killings in Israel are nei-
 ther practiced nor condoned by Israeli authorities. At least six Palestinians died
 while in the custody of Israeli authorities (see Section 1.c. and the annex to this
 Politically motivated intercommunal killings continued to take place, as extrem-
 ists on both sides sought to disrupt the Israel-Palestinian peace process. On January
 22, 2 Palestinian suicide bombers at the Beit Lid junction near the coastal city of
 Netanya killed 21 Israelis and injured 60. On April 9, two suicide bombers in Gaza
 killed seven Israelis and a U.S. student, and injured 57. Lone suicide bombers killed
 6 and injured 34 in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan on July 24 and killed 5
 including a US. citizen, with 100 others injured in the Ramt Eshkoi neighborhood
 of Jerusalem on August 21. There were also other incidents in the Gaza Strip.
 On November 4, after several months of escalating rhetoric against the Govern-
 ment's peace policies, a right-wing extremist shot and killed Prime Minister Yitzhak
 Rabin. In the days that followed this national tragedy, there were appeals from all
 parts of the political spectrum for restraint in the public debate over the crucial is-
 sues of Israel's future.
 
 
 1173
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Pumnhment.-
 Although Israeli laws and administrative regulations prohibit the physical abuse of
 detainees, the head of Shin Bet is empowered to authorize security officers to use
 interrogation measures with Palestinian detainees that human rights groups con-
 sider abusive. These measures have been applied against Palestinians suspected of
 involvement in planning terrorist acts, and include the practice of violent shaking,
 which in April led to the death of a prisoner in custody. (See annex for a discussion
 of mistreatment of prisoners from the occupied territories incarcerated in detention
 facilities located in Israel.)
 The practice of shaking has been challenged before the Israeli Supreme Court. In
 late December, in response to a detainee's petition, the Supreme Court issued an
 injunction against the use of physical force in interrogation. This case was still be-
 fore the courts at year's end. The head of the GSS argued that the use of "special
 interrogation methods" had forestalled many terrorist attacks, and might have been
 able to yield information from a suspect then in custody to prevent the August 21
 Ramot Eshkol bombing.
 Incarceration facilities in Israel and the occupied territories are administered by
 the Israeli Prison Service (IPS), the national police, or the Israel Defense Forces.
 Although conditions vary, all facilities are monitored by various branches of the
 Government, by members of the Knesset, the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC), and many human rights organizations, which have access to the pris-
 ons, police jails, and IDF camps.
 Generally, IPS inmates are not subject to physical abuse by guards, food is ade-
 quate, and prisoners receive basic necessities. However, prisoners incarcerated for
 security reasons are subject to a different regime, even in IPS facilities. They are
 often denied certain privileges given to prisoners convicted on criminal charges. Se-
 curity prisoners include some minors.
 IPS prisons for the most part meet minimum international standards, and the
 Government permits visits by human rights monitors. Inmates receive mail, have
 televisions in their cells, and receive regular visits. Prisoners receive wages for pris-
 on work and benefits for good behavior. Many IPS prisons have drug treatment,
 educational, and recreational programs.
 Overcrowding is a problem in some holding facilities. The Association for Civil
 Rights in Israel (ACRI) presented a report to the Israeli Government's Police Min-
 ister criticizing conditions at Jerusalem's Russian Compound holding facility. The
 report cited dilapidation and overcrowding, with up to 50 Palestinian detainees in
 a 4-bed cell, and demanded that the facility be transferred to a more appropriate
 building. A police spokesman said that several of the suggested changes have been
 made, but noted that historic preservation codes prevent major structural changes
 to the building.
 In addition, some national police detention facilities can fall below generally ac-
 cepted minimum international standards. Such facilities are intended to hold com-
 mon law detainees prior to trial, but often become de facto jails, in which some per-
 sons have been held for as long ar a year because of-lack of space in IPS facilities.
 Those held include some security detainees and some pisons who have been con-
 victed and sentenced. Inmates in the national police-detention facilities are ofien not
 accorded the same rights as prisoners in the _IPS. After sharp criticism of the Abu
 Kabir facility in the Tel Aviv area by human rights groups, the Government an-
 nounced a plan to renovate the facility and improve living conditions there. Civil
 rights groups have expressed concern over the conditions in which minors are held
 in several regional detention facilities, and have recommended the construction of
 a separate detention facility for children. Although children are not housed in the
 same cells as adults, there have been cases of sexual molestation of children.
 Detention camps administered by the IDF are limited to male Palestinian security
 prisoners and are guarded by armed soldiers. The number of security prisoners re-
 mained at about 6,000 through most of the year, but dropped to about 4,900 by the
 end of the year. In many cases, conditions in the camps do not meet minimum inter-
 national standards and can threaten the health of the inmates. Many camps house
 inmates in unheated tents in severe weather conditions, or in overcrowded and poor-
 ly ventilated buildings. New restrictions limit the age and relationship of those al-
 lowed to pay family visits and visits have been prevented altogether for long peri-
 ods during closures of the borders with Gaza and the West Bank. Recreational facili-
 ties are minimal.
 Member of the Knesset Dedi Zucker, who chairs the Knesset's Constitution, Law,
 and Justice Committee, called for closure of the Ketziot Detention Camp in the
 Negev, which has been regarded as having the harshest conditions. Ketziot held
 
 
 1174
 
 about 1,200 inmates at the end of 1995. This increase over 1994 is due to the trans-
 fer of detainees from closing West Bank detention facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest or
 exile of Israeli citizens, and the Government observes this prohibition. Defendants
 are considered innocent until proven guilty, and have the right to writs of habeas
 corpus and other procedural safeguards. However, a 1979 law permits administra-
 tive detention without charge or trial. The Minister of Defense may issue a deten-
 tion order for a maximum of a year. Within 48 hours of issuance, detainees must
 appear before a district judge who may confirm, shorten, or overturn the order. If
 the order is confirmed, an automatic review takes place after 3 months. Detainees
 may be represented by counsel and appeal detention orders to the Supreme Court.
 At detention hearings, the Government may withhold evidence from defense lawyers
 on security grounds. It may also seek to renew administrative detention orders.
 In felony cases, a district court judge may postpone for 48 hours the notification
 of arrest to the detainee's attorney. The postponement may be extended to 7 days
 b the Minister of Defense on national security grounds or by the Police Inspector
 General to conduct an investigation. Moreover, a judge may postpone notification up
 to 15 days in national security cases.
 Administrative orders issued by the IDF central command continued to restrict
 the movements of some members of the Jewish ultranationalist Kach and Kahane
 Chai organizations who live in the occupied territories. In addition, in December the
 Home Front Command issued orders restricting the movements of several rightwing
 activists living in Israel.
 Most of the legal protections afforded by Israeli law are not extended to Palestin-
 ian detainees, who fall under the jurisdiction of military law even when held in Is-
 rael. For most of the year, the Government held about half of the Palestinian de-
 tainees from the occupied territories in detention centers in Israel. With IDF rede-
 loyment on the West Bank, however, detention centers there were closed, and by
 e end of the year, all Palestinian detainees were being held in Israel. Eleven hun-
 dred of these prisoners were released in accordance with the Interim Agreement
 siged by the Government and the PLO on September 28.
 'We Government detains some 70 Lebanese citizens, who comprise a mixture of
 common prisoners, administrative detainees, and security detainees. It has yet to
 provide information on the whereabouts of two of them, Sheikh Mustafa Dirani and
 Sheikh Obeid. The disposition of these two cases appears linked to government ef-
 forts to obtain information on Israeli military personnel believed to be prisoners of
 war or missing in Lebanon.
 In April the Government expelled a Jordanian citizen and a West Bank Palestin-
 ian into the security zone in southern Lebanon, where they have been given shelter
 by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon forces. The ICRC has taken up
 these cases with the Government.
 Forced exile (i.e., the expulsion of Israeli citizens) is illegal and is not used.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The law provides for an independent judiciary,
 and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides citi-
 zens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 The judicial system is composed of civil, military, religious, labor relations, and
 administrative courts. The law provides for the right to a hearing with representa-
 tion by counsel, and this right is observed in practice. In November a regional and
 national system of public defenders was established to provide legal defense for
 those unable to afford a lawyer. All nonsecurity trials are public except those in
 which the interests of parties are deemed best served by privacy.
 Cases involving national security may be tried in either military or civil courts
 and may be partly or wholly closed to the public. The Attorney General determines
 the venue in such cases. The prosecution must justify closing the proceedings to the
 public. Defendants have the right to be represented by counsel even in closed pro-
 ceedings but may be denied access to some evidence on security grounds. Convic-
 tions may not be based on any evidence denied to the defense.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-A1-
 though privacy of the individual and the home are generally protected by law, au-
 thorities sometimes interfere with mail and monitor telephone conversations. In
 criminal cases, the law permits wiretapping by court order, in security cases, the
 order must be issued by the Ministry of Defense. Under emergency regulations, au-
 thorities may open and destroy mail on security grounds.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flict.-See Section 1.g. of the annex.
 
 
 1175
 
 Seciion 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, 'Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of the press, and
 the Government generally respects this right in practice. The law authorizes the
 Government to censor any material reported from-Israel or the occupied territories
 regarded as sensitive on national security grounds. However, news printed or broad-
 cast abroad may be reported in Israel without censorship.
 Emergency regulations prohibit anyone from expressing support for illegal organi-
 zations.'he Government occasionally prosecutes persons for speaking or writing on
 behalf of terrorist groups. No such cases were filed in 1995.
 Individuals, organizations, the press, and the electronic media freely debate public
 issues and criticize government officials and policies. During the year, protests by
 cups opposed to the Government's policies in the peace process escalated from
 demonstrations to acts of civil disobedience, including the blocking of roads.
 These acts, and claims of police violence in dealing with them, prompted a public
 debate on the legitimate exercise of the rights of freedom of speech and assembly.
 The debate widened after the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin. Some Israelis
 called for stricter measures to ban hate speech that could incite others to violent
 acts, while rightwing groups claimed that the Government was using Rabin's mur-
 der to limit their right to oppose government policies. In the weeks after the assas-
 sination, several persons were arrested for celebrating his death, and in December
 the State Attorney's office charged three members of the Zo Artzenu group with se-
 dition.
 The Government sought to block repairs to a pirate radio ship that broadcasts
 programming critical of the Government, when it entered port. Civil rights activists
 charged that this constituted censorship, although the Government argued that the
 issue was only one of proper licensing.
 All newspapers are privately owned and managed. Newspaper licenses are valid
 only for Israel; separate licenses are required to distribute pubictions in the occu-
 pied territories. Directed b a overnment appointee, the quasi-independent Israel
 Broadcast Authority controls television channel 1 and Kol Israel radio, both major
 sources of news and information. Six cable companies operate under franchises
 granted by councils appointed by the Government. Privately owned channel 2 tele-
 vision, the first commercial television channel in Israel, is operated by three fran-
 chise companies. Six of the first seven regional radio franchises began broadcasting
 by the end of the year. The Second Television and Radio Authority, a public body,
 supervises beth channel 2 and the new regional radio stations.
 b.Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associatlon.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government generally respects them in practice. After the Hebron
 massacre in 1994, the Cabinet invoked the 1948 Ordinance for the Prevention of
 Terror to ban the ultranationalist Kach and Kahane Chai organizations, a ban that
 remains in effect. The decision stipulates imprisonment for anyone belonging to, or
 expressing sup port for, either organization.
 c. Freedom oT Religion.-The law provides for freedom of religion, and the Govern-
 ment respects this right. Approximately 81 percent of Israeli citizens are Jewish.
 Muslims, Christians, Druze, and members of other minority religions make up the
 remaining 19 percent. Each recognized religious community has legal authority over
 its members in matters of marriage and divorce. Secular couris have primacy over
 questions of inheritance, but parties, by mutual agreement, may bring the case to
 religious courts. Jewish and Christian families may ask for some family status mat-
 ters, such as alimony and child custody in divorces, to be adjudicated in civil courts
 as well.
 Many Israelis object to the Orthodox religious authorities' exclusive control over
 marriage and divorce, and burial, whether the subjects are Jews or not. These au-
 thorities do not recognize marriages or conversions to Judaism performed by Con-
 servative or Reform rabbis. These issues have been a source of sharp division within
 Israeli society, particularly in recent years as thousands of Jewish immigrants from
 the former Soviet Union have brought with them family members not recognized as
 Jewish by these authorities. A large number of Jews who wish to be married in sec-
 ular or non-orthodox religious ceremonies do so abroad. The Ministry of Interior rec-
 ognizes such marriages. During the year, there was a controversy over a Ministry
 of Religious Affairs list of citizens who are not Jewish under Orthodox rules, and
 who therefore may not marry those who are regarded as Jewish by those rules.
 A growing reform movement led to plans to acquire land for the first secular
 cemeteries this year. A Supreme Court decision also directed that Conservative and
 Reform rabbis be allowed inclusion on local religious councils. In November the
 court decreed that in registering conversions to Judaism, the Ministry of the Inte-
 rior may not reject conversions as invalid on the grounds that they were performed
 by non-Orthodox rabbis. The issue will be considered by the Knesset, where draft
 
 
 1176
 legislation aimed at overruling the court has been introduced. A coalition of human
 rights and religious groups has been formed to oppose that legislation.
 SMissionaries are Sowed to proselytize in Israel A 1977 antiproselytizing law pro-
 hibits anyone from offering or receiving material benefits as an inducement to con-
 version, but the law has not been applied for several years.
 The Government permits citizens to visit religious sites or perform religious obli-
 gations in Israel and abroad. However, on occasion it has dened Muslim and Chris-
 tian Palestinians from the occupied territories access to holy places in East Jerusa-
 lem for security reasons (see annex, Section 2.c.). Beginning in October, a Supreme
 Court decision allowed small numbers of Jews under police escort to pray on the
 Temple Mount, which is the site of two Muslim holy places.
 d Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice, except with regard to military or security zones or in instances where
 citizens may be confined by administrative order to their neighborhoods or villages.
 The Government continued to limit the movements of some Jewish settlers living
 in the occupied territories who belonged to extremist Kach or Kahane Chai groups
 (see Section 2.d of the annex).
 Citizens are free to travel abroad and to emigrate, provided they have no out-
 standing military obligations or are not restricted by administrative order. In 1995
 the Government again permitted Muslim citizens over 30 years of age to perform
 the religious pilgrimage to Mecca, but it denied permission to Muslim citizens under
 30 years of years of age on security grounds. The Government asserts that travel
 to Saudi Arabia, which is still in a state of war with Israel, is a privilege and not
 a right.
 The Government welcomes Jewish immigrants, their families, and Jewish refu-
 gees, on whom it confers automatic citizenship and residence rights under the Law
 of Return. This law does not apply to non-Jews or to persons of Jewish descent who
 have converted to another faith.
 Under the principle of family reunification, successive governments have allowed
 the return of some Arab refugees who fled Israel in 1948-49. Other than the Law
 of Return, which applies only to Jews, and the family reunification statutes, Israel
 has no immigration law that provides for immigration to Israel, or for political asy-
 lum, but the law does allow qualified individuals to live in Israel as permanent resi-
 dents.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The law provides citizens with the right to change peacefully their government,
 and citizens exercise this right in practice through pridic, free, and fair elections
 held on the basis of universal suffrage for adult citizens.
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy, with an active multiparty system represent-
 ing a wide range of political views. Relatively small parties, including those whose
 primary support is among Israeli Arabs, regularly win seats in the Knesset. Elec-
 tions are by secret ballot.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation of women and minorities in
 government, but they are underrepresented. Eleven women, and 7 Arab and 2
 Druze citizens serve in the 120-seat Knesset. Two women are in the Cabinet, and
 two Israeli Arabs and an Israeli Druze are deputy ministers.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Local human rights groups believe that Israel has an advanced framework of laws
 for protecting human rights, but are concerned that resources for implementing
 those laws, or mechanisms for their enforcement, are sometimes lacking. The Equal
 Opportunities in Employment Law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, mar-
 itl status, or sexual orientation. The Labor Exchange Law prohibits discrimination
 by nongovernmental entities on the basis of race, religion, political beliefs, and age.
 Another law prohibits government bodies from practicing discrimination on any of
 these grounds.
 Women.-There was continued concern over violence against women, in both Isra-
 ers Jewish and Arab communities. Groups formed to combat domestic violence in-
 clude a parliamentary committee of inquiry, a committee established by the Min-
 
 
 1177
 ister of Labor and Social Affairs that includes Jewish and Arab nongovernmental
 organization (NGO) as well as government representatives, and a coalition of
 human rights organizations. Women's advocacy groups estimate that 16 women
 were killed by male relatives during the year, and that some 200,000 women suffer
 from domestic violence each year. Some 7 percent of these battered women are
 abused on a regular basis.
 Arab human rights advocates also have formed a coalition to raise public aware-
 ness of so-called family honor killings, a term commonly used for the murder of a
 female by a male relative for alleged misconduct.
 The Government supports seven shelters for battered women, including one exclu-
 sively for Arab women. There are plans for a total of 12 shelters, including 2 for
 Arab women.
 According to the 1991 Domestic Violence Law, a district or magistrate court may
 prohibit access by violent family members to their property. Women's gups cooper-
 ate with legal and social service institutions to provide women's rights education.
 Sentences or many convicted of domestic violence were significantly harsher-in
 some cases as a result of prosecution appeal to the Supreme Court-than in past
 years.
 The Equal Pay Law requires employers to pay male and female workers equal
 wages for equal work. However, women's advocacy groups report that women rou-
 tinely receive lower wages for comparable work, are promoted less often, and have
 fewer career opportunities than their male counterparts.
 Civil rights groups hailed two decisions regarding affirmative action as landmarks
 in the campaign for equal opportunity. In July legislation was passed that requires
 the civil service to give preference to women when male and female candidates of
 similar qualifications compete for the same positions. A November 1994 decision by
 the High Court of Justice, which mandated that preference be given to women in
 appointments to the boards of government-owned companies, has brought about a
 sharp increase-from 2 percent to 15 percent-in women's representation on such
 boards during the year.
 The adjudication of personal status law in the areas of marriage and divorce is
 left to religious courts, where Jewish and Muslim women are subject to restrictive
 interpretations of their rights (see Section 2.c.). Women's advocacy groups report
 cases in which rabbinical courts have failed to invoke the sanctions at their disposal
 in cases where a wife has ample grounds for divorce-such as abuse-but the hus-
 band has refused to agree. In some cases where a wife has failed to agree, a hus-
 band has been allowed to remarry; this permission is not given to wives. Such im-
 balances have been used by husbands to extort concessions in return for agreeing
 to divorce.
 Religious law can be even more restrictive for Muslims: some Islamic law courts
 have held that Muslim women may not request a divorce, but that women may be
 forced to consent if a divorce is granted to a man.
 Jewish women are subject to the military draft but may not serve in combat posi-
 tions. This was successfully challenged in November, when the Supreme Court ruled
 in favor of a woman officer who had applied for IDF pilot training, which would
 qualify her for a combat aviation position. The Israeli Air Force also agreed to
 search out other qualified women candidates for training.
 In December the Knesset's Ad Hoc Committee on the Status of Women was grant-
 ed permanent statutory standing equal to that of other Knesset committees.
 Chdren.-The Government has a strong commitment to the rights and welfare
 of children, including in the areas of education and health care. Children's rights
 groups have expressed concern, however, that resources are sometimes insufficient
 to put that commitment into practice, particularly in the case of low-income fami-
 lies. Government ministries, children's rights groups, and members of the legisla-
 ture often cooperate on children's rights issues.
 The Government has legislated against sexual, physical, and psychological abuse
 of children anii has mandated comprehensive reporting requirements. Although
 there has been a sharp increase in reported cases of child a use in recent years,
 activists believe this may reflect increased awareness of the issue rather than a
 growing pattern of abuse. Child prostitution has been reported in isolated cases and
 has been dealt with promptly by appropriate authorities.
 NGO's in the field of children's welare concentrate their efforts on public edu-
 cation, on promoting the concept of children's rights as citizens, on improving legal
 representation for minors, and on combating the problems of poverty, which are
 most notable for the Bedouin children of the south. Children's rights groups express
 particular concern over the lack of special education facilities for Bedouin children.
 
 
 1178
 
 Privately funded children's rights information centers have been established in
 some communities, and the Government is assisting in funding additional centers
 in other cities.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government provides a range of benefits, including
 income maintenance, housing subsidies, and transportation support for disabled per-
 sons, who are about 10 percent of the population. Advocacy groups observe that ex-
 isting antidiscrimination laws do not prohibit discrimination based on disability,
 and report that these citizens continue to encounter difficulties in areas such as em-
 ployment and housing. A law requiring access by the disabled to public buildings
 is not widely enforced. There is no law providing people with disabilities with access
 to public transportation.
 Reigious Minorities.-In civic areas where religion is a determinant criterion,
 such as the religious courts and centers of education, non-Jewish institutions rou-
 tinely receive less state support than their Jewish counterparts.
 In May there was a shooting attack against a Christian church in Jaffa, near Tel
 Aviv, and in August an arsonist struck a church in the Galilee region of the north.
 There is no evidence, however, that these incidents represent a concerted anti-Chris-
 tian campain.
 Nationfal/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government does not provide Israeli
 Arabs, who constitute 18 percent of the population, with the same quality of edu-
 cation, housing, employment, and social services as Jews. Relative to their numbers,
 Israeli Arabs are underrepresented in the student bodies and faculties of most uni-
 versities and in higher level professional and business ranks. A small number of Is-
 raeli Arabs have risen to responsible positions in the civil service, generally in the
 Arab departments of government ministries. A 1994 Civil Service Commission 3-
 year affirmative action program is expanding that number. In addition, in June
 comprehensive legislation was passed   at prohibits discrimination in employment.
 Civil rights activists see it as a major precedent, but note that it does not provide
 any enforcement mechanism. In September Israeli Arabs welcomed the first ap-
 pointment of an Arab as an Israeli ambassador.
 The Government's commitment to closing the gaps between Jews and Arabs has
 resulted in a much greater allocation of resources to Arab communities in recent
 years than in the past. A committee established in 1994 to address the problem of
 fiscal deficits of the Arab local authorities has not yet reported its findings-
 In practice, Israeli Arabs are not allowed to work in companies with defense con-
 tracts or in security-related fields. The Israeli Druze and Circassian communities
 are subject to the military draft-although some have refused to serve-while some
 Bedouin and other Arab citizens serve voluntarily. Those not subject to the draft
 have less access than other Israelis to those socialand economic benefits for which
 military service is a prerequisite or an advantage, such as housing, new-household
 subsidies, and government or security-related industrial employment. Under agov-
 ernment policy whose implementation began in 1994, the social security child allow-
 ance for parents who have not served in the military is being increased over a 3-
 year period to equal the allowance of those who have served in the military.
 The Government has yet to fulfill its commitment to resolve the legal status of
 unrecognized Arab villages. Eight villages have been recognized since late 1994, but
 human rights groups estimate that several dozen more remain in limbo, without
 any of the infrastructure, such as electricity, provided to recognized villages and
 towns. Private efforts have supplied some with water. In the Negev, a government
 program to provide housing for thousands of Bedouin in seven concentrated settle-
 ments has been criticized as likely to aggravate the severe poverty there.
 Problems of many years' standing that remain unresolved also include claims by
 Arab groups that land expropriation for public use has affected the Arab community
 disproportionately; that Arabs have been allowed too little input in planning deci-
 sions that affect their municipalities; that mosques and cemeteries belonging to the
 Islamic Waqf have been unjustly expropriated for public use; and that successive
 governments have blocked the return of persons displaced in the early years of Isra-
 els history from returning to their homes. At the end of the year, a special ministe-
 rial committee was negotiating with the pre-1948 residents of the northern villages
 of Bir Am and Ikrit, and their descendants, regarding their long-time demand to-be
 allowed to rebuild their houses.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers may join and establish labor organizations
 freely. Unions are free to affiliate with international organizations. Most unions be-
 long to Histadrt (the General Federation of Labor in Israel), or to a much smaller
 rival federaticn. These organizations are independent of the Government. Histadrut
 members democratically elect national and local officers, and officials of its affiliated
 
 
 1179
 women's organization Na'amat, from political party lists. Plant or enterprise com-
 mittee members are elected individua ty.
 A new Histadrut administration moved to reshape the labor federation drastically,
 reducing its staff and services, and concentrating its focus on those areas directly
 related to employment. A new national health insurance law severed the link be-
 tween Histadrut and Kupat Holim Clalit, the nation's largest health maintenance
 organization, in the process ending Histadrut's chief source of income. Membership
 in Histadrut dropped sharply once it was no longer necessary to join the federation
 in order to have access to its health plan. Histadrut hopes to expand its membership
 in areas not presently organized, such as small businesses and factories, even where
 collective bargaining agreements do not exist. At the end of the year, membership-
 which once reached 1.8 million people-had climbed back to about 700,000.
 The right to strike is exercised regularly. Unions must provide 15 days' notice
 prior to a strike unless otherwise specified in the collective bargaining agreement.
 However, unauthorized strikes occur. Strike leaders-even those organizin illegal
 strikes-are protected by law. If essential public services are affected, the Govern-
 ment may appeal to labor courts for back-to-work orders while the parties continue
 negotiations. There were a number of strikes in both public and private sectors dur-
 ing the year by employees protesting the effects of privatization. Worker dismissals
 and the terms of severance arrangements were often the central issues of dispute.
 Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip who work in Israel may not join
 Israeli trade unions or organize their own unions in Israel. Palestinian trade unions
 in the occupied territories are not permitted to conduct activities in Israel (see Sec-
 tion 6.a. of the annex). However, nonresident workers in the organized sector are
 entitled to the protection of Histadrut work contracts and grievance procedures.
 They may join vote for, and be elected to shop-level workers' committees if their
 numbers in individual establishments exceed a minimum threshold. Palestinian par-
 ticipation in such committees is minimal.
 Labor laws apply to Palestinians in East Jerusalem and to the Syrian Drze liv-
 ing on the Golan Heights.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Israeli workers fully exercise
 their legal rights to organize and bargain collectively. While there is no law specifi-
 cally prohibiting antiunion discrimination, the basic law against discrimination
 could be cited to contest discrimination based on union membership. No antiunion
 discrimination has been reported.
 Nonresident workers may not organize their own unions or engage in collective
 bargaining, but they are entitled to be represented by the bargaining agent and pro-
 tected by collective bargaining agreements. They do not pay umon m bership fees,
 but are required to pay a 1-percent agency fee which entitles them to union protec-
 tion by Histadrut's collective bargaining agreements. The Ministry of Labor may ex-
 tend collective bargaining agreements to nonunionized workplaces in the same in-
 dustrial sector. The Ministry of Labor also oversees personal contracts in the
 nonorganized sectors of the economy.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor. Neither Israeli citizens nor nonresident Palestinians working in Israel
 are subject to this practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.--Children who have attained the
 a of 14 years, and who are liable to compulsory education under the Compulsory
 Education Law, may not be employed unless they work as apprentices under the
 Apprenticeship Law. Notwithstanding these provisions, children who are 14 may be
 employed during official school holidays. Employment of those aged 16 to 18 is re-
 stricted to ensure time for rest and education.
 There are no reliable data on illegal child workers. They are concentrated among
 Israel's Arab population and its newest Jewish immigrants. Illegal employment is
 found priaiIy in urban, light-industrial areas. Children's rights groups have called
 for more vigorous enforcement of child labor laws, combine d with a parallel effort
 to deal with its causes.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Legislation in 1987 established a minimum
 wage at 45 percent of the average wage, calculated periodically and adjusted for cost
 of living increases. At year's end, the monthly minimum wage stood at about $580
 (1,785 new Israeli shekels). The minimum wage is often supplemented by special
 allowances and is generallY sufficient to provide workers and their families with an
 acceptable standard of living. Union officials have expressed concern over enforce-
 ment of minimum wage regulations, particularly with respect to employers of illegal
 nonresident workers who sometimes pay less than the minimum wage.
 By law the maximum hours of work at regular pay are 47 hours a week, 8 hours
 per day, and 7 hours on the day before the weekly rest, which must be at least 36
 
 
 1180
 
 consecutive hours and include the Sabbath. By national collective agreements, the
 private sector established a maximum 45-hour workweek in 1988. The public sector
 moved to a 5-day, 4222 hour workweek in 1989, while the military adopted it in
 1993.
 Employers must receive a government permit to hire nonresident workers from
 the occupied territories, certifying that no Israeli citizen is available for the job. All
 Palestinians from the occupied territories are employed on a daily basis and, unless
 they are employed on shiftwork, are not authorized to spend the night in Israel. Pal-
 estinians without valid work permits are subject to arrest.
 Nonresident workers are paid thrugh the Employment Service of the Ministry
 of Labor which disburses wages and benefits collectd from employers. The Ministry
 deducts a 1 percent union fee and the workers' contributions to the National Insur-
 ance Institute, the agency that administers the Israeli social security system. De-
 spite these deductions, Palestinian workers do not have access to unemployment in-
 surance, general disability pay ts, low-income supplements, child allotments, or
 maternity leave. By contrast Israeli settlers in the occupied territories who work in
 Israel have the same benefits as other Israeli workers. The International Labor Or-
 ganization has long criticized this inequality in entitlements. Histadrut and the Pal-
 estinian trade unions of the West Bank and Gaza agreed on payment to the new
 Palestinian Trade Union Federation of 4 million shekels deducted from the wages
 of Palestinian workers.
 Along with union representatives, the Labor Inspection Service enforces labor,
 health, and safety standards in the workplace, although resource constraints affect
 overall enforcement. Legislation protects the employment rights of safety delegates
 elected or appointed by the workers. In cooperation with management, these dele-
 gates are responsible for the safety and health of the workplace. Workers do not
 have the legal right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without
 jeopardy to continued employment. However, collective bargaining agreements pro-
 vide some workers with recourse through the work site labor committee. Any worker
 may challenge unsafe work practices through government oversight and legal agen-
 cies.
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES (INCLUDING AREAS SUB-
 JECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE PALESTINIAN
 AUTHORITY AND ITS SUCCESSOR, THE PALESTINIAN
 INTERIM SELF-GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY)
 This report reflects the fundamental changes that have occurred in the West
 Bank and Gaza Strip as a consequence of the implementation of the Declaration of
 Principles (DOP) signed by Israel and Palestinian representatives on September 13,
 1993, and the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the
 Gaza Strip ("the Interim Agreement") signed on September 28, 1995.
 Beginning in May 1994, Israel transferred most responsibilities for civil govern-
 ment in the Gaza Strip and Jericho Area to the Palestinian Authority (PA). -In late
 1995, Israel began redeploying its forces from the West Bank and turning over
 major towns and surrounding villages to PA administration. Currently the PA exer-
 cises authority over about 2.2 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
 Strip. By year's end, those areas in the West Bank and Gaza were largely adminis-
 tered by the Palestinian Authority.
 As of early 1996, the PA is being succeeded by an elected council pursuant to the
 Interim Agreement. Accordingly, this report discusses the policies and the practices
 of both the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority in the areas where
 they exercise jurisdiction and control.
 The DOP and the Interim Agreement fundamentally altered the relationship be-
 tween Palestinians and Israelis. These historic agreements are part of a process de-
 signed to end their conflict and to guide negotiations concerning the future of the
 territories. The DOP provides for a 5-year transitional period in which specified re-
 sponsibiities are to be transferred to Palestinian Authorities to permit the Palestin-
 ian people of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to govern themselves.
 Implementation of the process began in May 1994, when Israel and the PLO
 agreed (the Gaza-Jericho Agreementy on the initial transfer of powers and respon-
 sibilities relating to the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area in the-West Bank. In Au-
 gust 1994, the Government of Israel and the PLO agreed (the Agreement on Pre-
 paratory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities) on the further transfer of five
 areas of responsibility (education and culture, health, tourism, taxation, and social
 
 
 1181
 
 welfare) in the rest of the West Bank, excluding Israeli settlements. The transfer
 to the PA of responsibility for these areas was completed in December 1994.
 The Interim Agreement signed in September transferred additional spheres of re-
 sponsibility, including statistics, local government, insurance, commerce and indus-
 ty, fuel and gasz agriculture and labor. Israel continues to be responsible for exter-
 nal security, and the overall security for Israelis, including public order in the Is-
 raeli settlements, foreign relations, and certain other areas. The Interim Agreement
 also provides for the redeployment of Israeli forces, and modalities for elections for
 the Palestinian Council and the chief executive of ite Executive Authority. The situ-
 ation in the West Bank and Gaza will continue to change as the Israelis and Pal-
 estinians implement their agreements.
 Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, and East Jerusalem
 during the 1967 War. Under Israel-PLO agreements, the permanent status of the
 West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as the issue of Jerusaiem, are to be addressed
 in the permanent status negotiations due to begin in May 1996.
 The West Bank and Gaza legal regimes derive from Ottoman, Jordanian, Egyp-
 tian and British law, Israeli military orders, Israel-PLO agreements, and decisions
 by the PA. The United States considers Israel's authority in the occupied territories
 to be subject to the Hague Regulations of 1907 and the 1949 Fourth Geneva Con-
 vention relative to the protection of civilians in time of war. The Israeli Government
 considers the Hague Regulations applicable and states that it observes the Geneva
 Convention's humanitarian provisions.
 Israel has governed the territories through the Israeli Civil Administration
 (C1VAD), a body overseen by the Minister of Defense. West Bank towns had been
 governed by Palestinian mayors appointed by the Israeli Government, with some ex-
 ceptions such as Hebron, Bethlehem, and Nablus. In late 1995, the PA began to
 take over the administration of other municipalities as part of the transfer of au-
 thority btween Israel and the PA. Following the redeployment of Israeli forces from
 most Palestinian populated cities and surrounding villages in the West Bank, the
 C1VAD was dissolved and replaced with the IDF's Office of Coordination and Liai-
 son, known by its Hebrew acronym "MATAK." The election for the Palestinian
 Council and the chief executive of the Executive Authority of the Council was held
 in January 1996 (see below).
 In the past, Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem have been eligible to vote in
 Jerusalem municipal elections, but have generally declined to vote, claiming that Is-
 rael's annexation of East Jerusalem is illegal. However, these residents voted in the
 Januaby 1996 Palestinian election.
 Israeli settlers in the territories (about 11 percent of the population there) are
 subject to Israeli law and are better treated byIsraeli forces than Palestinians who
 have been subject to military occupation law. Under the Israel-PLO agreements, Is-
 rael maintains jurisdiction over the settlements and settlers during the transitional
 period. The permanent status of the settlements will be addressed mn future negotia-
 Israeli security forces in the West Bank consist of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF);
 the Shin Bet, or General Security Services (GSS); the police; and the paramilitary
 border police. Military courts try Palestinians accused n Israeli-controlled areas of
 security crimes as de-ied  the Government of Israel. The Palestinian Police Force
 (PPF) was established in ay 1994 and consists of the Palestinian National Secu-
 rity Force (PNSF); the Palestinian civil police; the Preventive Security Force (PSF);
 Palestinian intelligence, or the Mukhabarat; the civil defense force; and the Pal-
 estinian Presidential Security Force. Palestinian police are responsible for securty
 and law enforcement for Palestinians and other non-sraelis in  tane in Jericho,
 and in November and December took over security and law enforcement for West
 Bank towns and surrounding villages except for Hebron City.
 The economies of the West Bank and Gaza are small, poorly developed, and highly
 dependent on IsraeL Both areas rely on agculture, services, and to a lesser extent,
 ligt manufacturing. Many West Bank and Gazan workers are employed at day jobs
 in Israel. The West Bank and Gazan economies have been adversely affected by ten-
 sions caused by continued terrorist incidents and closures of the territories by Is-
 rael, which significantly limits the number of Palestinians permitted to enter Israel,
 especially in times of heightened security alerts. The flow of gods in and out of the
 West Bank and Gaza has been severely restricted from time to time under the clo-
 sures.
 There were improvements in the human rights situation in the occupied tori-i
 tories in 1995. As agreed to in the Interim Agreement, most of the large Paestinian
 cities were placed under Palestinian control y the end of 1995. The anuary 1996
 election gave Palestinian residents of the terrtories their first desmocratically elect-
 
 
 1182
 ed representative body. The Council will be responsible for the executive and legisla-
 tive powers transferred to the Palestinians under the Interim Agreement.
 The numbers of Palestinians killed by Israelis, Palestiniansikilled by other Pal-
 estinians, and Israelis killed by Palestinians, decreased in comparison with 1994
 in some cases dramatically. The number of confrontations between Palestinians and
 Israeli security forces has also dropped dramatically in the past 2 years.
 With the continued implementation of the DOP, Palestinians steadily acquired
 more opportunities to participate in political and economic decisions that affect their
 lives. Moreover, Israel and the PLO have continued to use channels and procedures
 established in 1994 for dealing with a variety of their differences over political, eco-
 nomic, and security matters. PA security forces have generally allowed opposition
 rallies and demonstrations to run their course, without using excessive force to pre-
 vent or disperse them. The PA has also issued licenses to opposition and independ-
 ent publications.
 During 1995 Israeli civilians and military personnel were the targets of repeated
 lethal terrorist attacks. There were credible reports that Israeli security officials
 mistreated, and in some cases tortured, Palestinians during arrest and interroga-
 tion. According to these reports, Israel also utilized undercover units in possible
 extrajudicial killings. Six Palestinians died in the custody of Israeli security forces.
 Israeli military courts imposed harsh sentences on Palestinians. Prison conditions
 remained poor. Discriminatory policies on land and resource use and trade, and lim-
 its on freedom of movement remained in place. There were continued restrictions
 imposed on the ability of Palestinians in the territories to enter Jerusalem, and
 travel between Gaza and the West Bank, as well as between Jericho and the rest
 of the West Bank. Toward the end of the year, Israeli authorities implemented new
 measures to facilitate travel and commerce across the Erez checkpoint between
 Gaza and Israel, which incresed the flow of Palestinian day laborers entering Israel.
 The PA exercised jurisdiction in Gaza and Jericho since May 1994 and in the re-
 maining West Bank cities and surrounding villages since late 1995. The process of
 institution-building has proceeded slowly, and in some areas, such as the judiciary,
 there has been little progress. There were credible reports that the Palestinian Po-
 lice Force (PPF) mistreated and in some cases tortured detainees, and did not com-
 ply with proper arrest and detention procedures. International and local human
 rights groups widely criticized the establishment in April of a state security court
 to try terrorist or security cases. They maintain that this court denies Palestinians
 the right to adequate legal defense and a fair and public trial. Five detainees died
 in the custody of Palestinian security forces. These incidents have been or are being
 investigated, and some officers were disciplined internally. There were numerous
 limitations on press freedoms, such as temporary closures of newspaper offices,
 confiscation of publications, and prohibition on distribution. There was societal dis-
 crimination against women and the disabled.
 A number of Islamic groups, specifically the Islamic Resistance Movement
 (HAMAS) and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), made a concerted effort to under-
 mine Israeli-PLO negotiations by killing Israelis and discrediting the authority and
 effectiveness of the PA. In the worst incident, two suicide bombers reportedl from
 PIJ killed 21 Israelis at the Beit Lid junction in central Israel in January. iicide
 bombers also killed 18 others in several other attacks throughout the year.
 There were also acts of violence against Palestinians committed by Israeli settlers,
 including killings and the destruction of property. Overall, the DF was more effec-
 tive in stopping or preventing such attacks than in previous years. The number of
 Palestinians killed by other Palestinians for alleged collaboration with Israel
 dropped dramatically, continuing a downward trend for the third straight year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Eztrjudicial Killing.-Credible sources report that Israeli
 undercover units, disguised as Palestinians, killed at least 10 Palestinians during
 the year. At least 13 such killings occurred in 1994. The Israeli Government does
 not publish its guidelines on the conduct of undercover operations in the occupied
 territories.
 These undercover units seek to arrest activists suspected of committing serious
 crimes. According to human rights organizations, undercover units deliberately kill
 suspects under circumstances n which they might have been apprehended alive.
 Such operations normally take place at night when there are few eyewitnesses. Ac-
 counts of witnesses, when available, often differ from the IDF version.
 Israeli authorities acknowledge that the. undercover units conduct operations
 among wanted Palestinians, but claim that such units observe the same rules of en-
 
 
 1183
 gement as other IDF units. They further claim that the IDF investigates all
 kings and allegations of misbehavior. However, human rights groups state that
 the investations are not conducted efficiently and rarely lead to serious punish-
 ment. The LDF does not announce the findings of its investigations.
 In January undercover soldiers killed 4 Palestinians at least one of whom was
 a wanted person, after one of them reportedly opened fire on the undercover unit's
 vehicle. Eyewitnesses said that the Paestinians were ambushed by the undercover
 unit and killed without an opportunity to surrender. A foren observer at the scene
 added that the soldiers denied medical treatment to the victims.
 At least six Palestinians died in Israeli detention two apparently from pre-exist-
 ing medical conditions, one from an apparent suicide attempt, two apparently as a
 result of beatings by other Palestinian inmates, and one as a result of torture.
 Human rights groups claim that lack of prompt and adeate medical attention
 while in detention aggravates the medical conditions of ill prisoners, and over-
 crowded cell conditions contribute to intra-prisoner violence.
 In April detainee Abd A1-Samad Hereizaat died while in the custody of Israeli se-
 curity officers. Pathologists who performed the autopsy on Hereizaat determined
 that his death-from a large edema and internal hemorrhaging of the brain-was
 a direct result of torture. His interrogator had reportedly shaken Hereizaat violently
 by the shoulders, allowing his head to snap back and forth, causing injury to the
 brain. Israeli press reorted that Hereizaats interrogators did not have permission
 from the head of the (GSSto exceed the "moderate physical pressure" limits (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.). The Israeli Ministry of Justice announced that the OSS agent involved
 would be brought before a disciplinary tribunal, but not criminally charged. How-
 ever, in October the Israeli High Court of Justice issued an order to the Attorney
 General requiring him to axplain why the interrogator should not be criminally
 prsecuted. At the recommendation of the Ministry of Justice, the state attorney de-
 cided that criminal charges could not be brought against the agent as he could not
 have foreseen that his actions would result in death. The Public Committee Against
 Torture has brought a petition before the High Court of Justice to show cause why
 no criminal charges have been brought against the GSS agent. The agent was later
 brought before a disciplinary tribunal on the grounds that he had deviated from in-
 terrogation procedures. His case was still ongoing at year's end.
 During the year, Israeli settlers killed 4 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
 Strip. By comparison, there were 37 such killings in 1994, 29 of which took place
 inasinle incident in Hebron.n one case in August, a settler shot and killed a
 Palestinian demonstrating against a makeshift campsite erected by settlers on dis-
 puted land. The settler was arrested and charged with manslaughter and obstruct-
 ng justie. Settlers also engagead in several other attacks on the property and per-
 sons of Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem. Overall, the IDF was mere
 forceful in attempting to halt such attacks. The IDF has imposed protective curfews
 on the Palestinian population when it expects violence from settlers.
 Human rights groups note that Palstinians often fail to reprt cases of settler
 violence from fear of retribution by settlers, or of labeling as collaborators with Is-
 raeli authorities. These grups claim that polie investigations of settler violence are
 often superficial, delayed, and rarely lead to arrests or sentencing. The IDF has also
 complained of police and court inaction against settlers and has resorted to adminis-
 trative orders restricting the movement of violent settlers. In May the Government
 began exploring ways to enforce the law more effectively.
 Five Palestinians, including one who was also an American citizen, died in the
 custody of PA security officers. Investigation determined that one of the deaths was
 accidental and another due to pre-existing medical conditions. The interrogators in-
 volved in those cases were disciplined. The remaining three cases are still under in-
 vestigation. Several Palestinian officials have been sentenced for their role in some
 of these cases.
 In April a detainee, Muhammad Ahmad Mahmud AI-Jundi, who had been in the
 custody of Palestinian police in Gaza for several months, was shot to death on a
 street in Jabalya refugee camp, reportedly after police officers either handed him
 over to members of the "Fatah Hawks," a strike force formed during the Intifada,
 or alerted the group that he was returning home. AI-Jundi was killed at the same
 location where he was accused of having helped an Israeli undercover unit kill 6
 Fatah members in 1994. Eyewitnesses claim that 4 men in civilian clothes shot the
 hooded victim numerous times at close range in full view of the public. An investiga-
 tion into the incident is ongoing. Five PA intelligence interrogators have been ar-
 rested in the case, but not yet tried.
 In September detainee Azzam Rahim, a Palestinian who was also an American
 citizen, died in the custody of PA intelligence officers in Jericho. Members of his
 family reported that bruises and cuts were visible on his head and face after his
 
 
 1184
 death. Results of an autopsy, conducted on Rahim after he had been interred for
 several weeks, showed that sehim had broken ribs and appeared to have no heart
 damage, but the report said it was not possible to determine the cause of death.
 Three intelligence officers were sentenced for their role in the case. Two were sen-
 tenced to 1-year terms and one for 7 years.
 During the year, Palestinians killed 45 Israelis and 2 American citizen tourists
 in the occupied territories and in Israel. This marked a decrease from 75 persons
 killed in terrorist attacks in 1994. The worst incidents were a January suicide
 bombing that killed 21 Israelis at the Beit Lid junction in central Israel, and suicide
 bombings in Gaza, the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan, and the Jerusalem Ramot
 Eshkol neighborhood that left 20 dead, including two American citizens.
 Palestinians also killed an estimated 14 Palestinians during the year, for either
 suspicion of collaboration with Israeli security services or as a result of criminal ac-
 tion, personal disputes, or street gang infighting. This is a dramatic decrease from
 the 65 reported killed in 194, the year the PLO leadership pledged that it would
 try to halt the killing of "collaborators." Although these figures do not differentiate
 between collaborator and other types of killings, the number of Palestinians killed
 by Palestinians has continued to decline. There were 149 in 1992 and 79 in 1993.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 attributedto either Israeli or Palestinian security serv ices.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 International, Israeli, and Palestinian human rights groups and diplomats continue
 to provide credible reports indicating that Israeli security forces are responsible for
 widespread abuse, and in some cases torture, of Palestinian detainees. According to
 the reports, such abuse takes place immediately after arrest and during interroga-
 tion. According to the 1987 Landau Judicial Commission GSS interrogation guide-
 lines, torture is condemned but interrogators are allowed to use "moderate physical
 and psychological pressure" to secure confessions and obtain information.
 Although there were fewer arrests in 1995, local human rights monitors cite a
 marked increase in the number of complaints of mistreatment and torture during
 interrogation, especially from those suspected of belonging to Islamic groups. Inter-
 rogation sessions have reportedly become longer and more severe. The frequency
 and duration of solitary confinement has also increased. According to human rights
 monitors, the GSS systematically uses interrogation methods which do not result in
 detectable traces of ill-treatment on the victims or which leave marks that dis-
 appear after a short period of time.
 Common interrogation practices reportedly include hooding; forced standing; tying
 the detainee in contorted positions; prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures-
 blows and beatings with fists, sticks, and other instruments; confinement m a small
 and often filthy space; sleep and food deprivation; threats against the detainee's
 family; and threats of death. Detainees have also been subjected to violent "shaking"
 by their interrogators (see Section l.a.). The apparent intent of these practices is
 to disorient and intimidate prisoners in order to obtain confessions or information.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) declared in 1992 that such
 practices violate the Geneva Convention.
 Although Israel's Criminal Code prohibits torture, the GSS Chief is permitted by
 law to allow interrogators to employ "special measures" that exceed the use of "mod-
 erate physical and psychological pressure" allowed in the Landau Commission
 guidelines when it is deemed necessary to obtain information that could potentially
 save Israeli lives in certain "ticking bomb" cases. The GSS first permitted interroga-
 tors "greater flexibility" in applying the guidelines shortly after a bus bombing in
 Tel Aviv in October 1994 that killed 22 Israelis. The Government has not defined
 the meaning of "greater flexibility." At 3-month intervals throu-ghout the year, the
 Government approved the continued use of "special measures, arguing that they
 were vital because their use had prevented numerous terrorist attacks.
 Israeli authorities maintain that torture is not condoned, but acknowledge that
 abuses sometim2s occur and are investigated. However, the Government does not
 generally make public the results of such investigations. There is a growing public
 debate within senior levels of the Government as to whether some of the "special
 measures" constitute torture and should be banned.
 According to the Israeli press, five members of the Jerusalem police were sen-
 tenced in September to jail terms ranging from 2 months community service to 15
 months imprisonment for mistreating Arabs from East Jerusalem during question-
 ing. The five were also charged with fabricating evidence and violating the public
 trust.
 Most convictions in security cases before Israeli courts are based on confessions.
 An attorney is not allowed to meet with a client until after interrogation, a process
 that may take days or, in some cases, weeks. The Government does not allow ICRC
 
 
 1185
 representatives access to detainees until the 14th day after arrest. Human rights
 groups point to this prolonged incommunicado detention as contributing to the like-
 Iihood of abuse. Detainees often claim in court that their confessions are coerced,
 but judges rarely exclude such confessions. Human rights groups assert that Pal-
 estinian detainees often fail to lodge complaints either from fear of retribution or
 because they assume that their complaints will be ignored.
 There were 65 complaints submitted by Palestinian detainees resident in the oc-
 cupied territories against the GSS for mistreatment during interrogation. All were
 forwarded to the Department for Police Investigations at the Ministry of Justice,
 which investigates complaints against the GSS. During the year, there were no
 known cases in which a confession was disqualified because of improper means of
 investigation or interrogation.
 Human rights groups provided credible reports that PA security forces abused,
 and sometimes tortured, Palestinian detainees. According to the reports, such abuse
 takes place immediately after arrest and during interrogation. The Gaza civil police
 commander issued a circular in 1995 that forbids torture during interrogation and
 directs the security forces to observe the rights of all detainees.
 A report produced by the Israeli human rights group B'tselem claimed that mis-
 treatment of detainees and improper arrest and detention procedures by the Preven-
 tive Security Service (PSS) in Jericho reflects PA policy. The Palestinian Centre for
 Human Rights (PCHR) and other Palestinian human rights groups denied that
 there is evidence of systematic abuse, but cited numerous incidents of mistreatment,
 especially of detainees accused of collaboration with the Israelis drug trafficking,
 prostitution, rape, or membership in extremist groups. Human rights monitors have
 reported the following abuses used by PA police authorities: hooding, beating, tying
 in painful positions, sleep deprivation, preventing medical care, and threats. In
 June, PA security officials in Gaza arrested HAMAS spokesman Mabmud Zahar on
 charges of incitement. Palestinian human rights organizations say Zahar was se-
 verely beaten and his hair and beard were shaved as unusual and degrading pun-
 ishment.
 PA investigatory committees have ruled that interrogators have been negligent for
 not providing detainees with medical care upon arrest and duringinterrgation and
 for not following correct interrogation procedures. PA security officials ac owledge
 that problems exist but attribute most abuses to lack of training and education.
 Some security officials involved in mistreatment of prisoners were disciplined.
 Palestinian inmates of several Israeli prisons and detention centers undertook
 hunger strikes throughout the year to protest either harsh conditions or to pressure
 the Government to release prisoners as a goodwill gesture during the peace process.
 Prisoners criticized overcrowding, mistreatment, filthy and deteriorating conditions
 of cells and tents, inadequate medical care, extended use of solitary confinement,
 and in some cases, lack of visits by lawyers (see Section 2.c. of the Israel report).
 The PA took over the administration of detention facilities in Gaza and Jericho
 from Israeli security forces in May 1994. The physical conditions at these facilities
 do not meet minimum international standards. Food and clothing for prisoners are
 inadequate and must be supplemented by donations from families and humani-
 tarian groups. In Jericho, for example, the one prison, a former police station, is di-
 lapidated and overcrowded with about 80 prisoners. The PA has not allocated its
 Ministry of Justice adequate funds to make improvements.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Any Israeli soldier may arrest without
 warrant a person who has committed, or is suspected of having committed, a crimi-
 nal or securit offense in the territories, except for areas under exclusive PA control.
 The vast majority of arrests are for alleged security offenses. Persons arrested for
 common crimes are usually provided with a statement of charges and access to an
 attorney, and may apply for bail. However, these procedures are sometimes delayed.
 Authorities reportedy issue special summonses for security offenses. Israeli Military
 Order 1369 stipulates a 7-year prison term for any person who does not respond to
 a special summons delivered by a family member or posted in the Civil Administra-
 tion office nearest his home address. Bail is rarely available to those arrested for
 security offenses. The courts treat persons over age 12 as adults.
 Persons may be held in custody without a warrant for 96 hours and then released
 unless a warrant is issued. Prearraignment detention can last up to 11 days for Pal-
 estinians arrested in the occupied territories and up to 8 days or minors and those
 accused of less serious offenses. Authorities must obtain a court order for longer de-
 tentions-up to 6 months from the date of arrest. Detainees are entitled to be rep-
 resented by counsel at their detention hearings. They must be released at the end
 of the court-ordered detention if they are not indicted. If there is an indictment, a
 judge may order indefinite detention until the end of the trial. Detainees have the
 right to appeal continued detention.

 Although a detainee generally has the right to consult with a lawyer as soon as
 possible, in security cases authorities ma y delay access to ounsel for up to 15 days.
 Higher ranking officials orjudges may extend this period an additional 75 days. Au-
 thorities must inform dtanees of their right to an attorney and whether there are
 any orders prohibiting such contact.
 SHuman rights groups charge that authorities sometimes schedule appointments
 between a         an   their detained clients, only to move the clients to another
 prison prior to the meeting. Authorities reportedly use such tactics to delay lawyer-
 client meetings for as long as 90 days. Israeli regulations also permit detainees to
 be held in isolation from famly and other detainees during interrogation.
 Israeli authorities claim that they attempt to post notification of arrest within 48
 hours. However, Palestinian suspects are often kept incommunicado for several days
 after their arrest by Israeli authorities, who do not inform their families of their
 whereabouts. Palestinians assert that they generally locate the detainees through
 their own efforts. The ICRC attempts to help by telephoning families with informa-
 tion received from prison officials. A senior officer may delay for up to 12 days noti-
 fication of arrest to immediate family members, attorneys, and consular officials. A
 military commander may appeal to a judge to extend this period in security cases
 for an unlimited time.
 Israeli district military commanders may order administrative detention without
 formal charges. In January the period of administrative detention was extended
 from 6 months to 1 year, with renewals possible. Many Palestinians administra-
 tively detained over the past 2 years have had their detention orders renewed re-
 peatedly with no meaningful chance of appeal. One detainee is currently serving his
 fifth consecutive order, which is due to expire in April 1996.
 An estimated 220 Palestinians were in administrative detention in Megiddo mili-
 tary detention center as of December, the same number as at the end of 1994. Ac-
 cording to the Mandela Institute for Political Prisoners, 60 of the 220 administrative
 detainees had their detention orders renewed.
 Evidence used at hearings for administrative detention is secret and unavailable
 to the detainee or his attorney. Authorities maintain that they are unable to present
 evidence in open court because to do so would compromise the method of acquiring
 the evidence, which is often provided by informers whose lives would be jeopardized
 if their identities were known. Detainees may appeal detention orders, or the re-
 newal of a detention order, before a military judge.
 A HAMAS supporter who was arrested in January 1993 and was not administra-
 tively detained, was held nonetheless until August 1995 after 21 hearings. An Is-
 raeli military court finally sentenced him to 42 months' imprisonment for belonging
 to HAMAS and providing support to its members. In another case, security forces
 detained and interrogated a reporter for a Palestinian newspaper for over a month
 (see Section 2.a.).
 There were no deportations for security reasons in 1995.
 As of December, an estimated 4,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were in-
 carcerated in Israeli-administered prisons, military detention centers, and holding
 centers, a decrease from the 1994 figure of 6,050. Since the beginning of the intifada
 in 1987, the Government has routinely transferred Palestinian detainees from the
 occupied territories to facilities in Israel, especially to the Ketziot detention camp
 in the Negev Desert and Megiddo prison near Afula.
 The restrictive procedures regulating the movement of goods and people between
 the territories and Israel, which have been in effect since 1993, have made it impos-
 sible for those with security records to visit imprisoned relatives in Israel, and has
 caused difficulty for other family members and lawyers to visit as well.
 Israeli security forces conducted several mass arrests in response to acts or
 threats of violence against Israelis. For example, about 1,500 Palestinians suspected
 of belonging to HAMAS or Islamic Jihad were arrested after the January Beit Lid
 suicide bombing. In October in connection with the Interim Agreement, about 1,100
 Palestinian criminal and security prisoners were released from Israeli jails and de-
 tention centers. Another 1,200 were scheduled to be released in January 1996.
 The Palestinian police in Gaza conducted several mass arrests in response to acts
 or threats of violence against Palestinians and Israelis. These arrests were con-
 ducted without warrants against groups whose members have engaged in violence.
 In most cases, Palestinian authorities released detainees without charge within the
 48-hour limit stipulated by Gaza law, although some suspects remained in custody
 longer.
 The PA's Ministry of Justice requires that all detainees held beyond the 48-hour
 limit must be formally charged, but acknowledges that some detainees are held
 longer without being charged. Gazan law allows the Attorney General to extend the
 detention period to a maximum of 90 days during investigations. According to the
 
 
 1187
 PA's Ministry of Justice, 45 opposition members were in detention as of September
 26, compared with 20 members as of September 1, 1994. Authorities generally per-
 mit prisoners to receive visits from family members, attorneys, and human rights
 monitors, except for prisoners held in the Gaza central prison security wing. In prin-
 ciple detainees may notify their families of their arrest, but this is not always per-
 mitted.
 The several PA security services have overlapping or unclear mandates. Although
 only the civil police are authorized to make arrests, other security services report-
 edly do so as well. The operating procedures and regulations for conduct of police
 in the various services are not wel developed and have not yet been made available
 to the public. In a letter to an international human rights group, the civilian police
 commander in Gaza admitted that there have been problems regarding proper ar-
 rest and detention procedures, which he attributes to either ignorance of proper pro-
 cedures or 'bad habits" which certain officers picked up during the "revolutionary
 period."
 There are many detention facilities in Gaza and Jericho, a situation that com-
 plicates the ability of families, lawyers and even the Ministry of Justice, to track
 etainees! whereabouts. Many security services, including Preventive Security, Gen-
 eral Intelligence, Military Intelligence, and the Coast Guard, have their own interro-
 Fation and detention facilities. In general, these services do not, or only sporadically
 inform families of a relative's arrest. Most PA police officers lack the training and
 knowledge of such things as proper arrest procedures and human rights standards.
 In 1995 Palestinian human rights groups conducted training at the SS police acad-
 emy in Jericho on such matters, and have held human rights seminars for interro-
 gators and other officials.
 Until the signing of the Interim Agreement in September, Palestinian police did
 not have the legal authority to arrest, try, or imprison Palestinians who committed
 crimes outside of Gaza or Jericho. Reportedly for this reason, such suspects were
 usually released without charge, sometimes after several weeks of detention. This
 activity also resulted from the general vacuum of law enforcement of civil and crimi-
 nal cases in the West Bank, where the IDF concentrated almost exclusively on secu-
 rity cases.
 Prior to the Palestinian police deployment in the rest of West Bank cities in 1995
 there were numerous reports that officials from various Palestinian factions, and
 Palestinians working for PA security services, forced or persuaded--sometimes
 under false pretexts-West Bank suspects to travel to Jericho for interrogation by
 PA security services.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Palestinians accused by Israel of security offenses
 are tried in Israeli military courts. Security offenses are broadly defined and may
 include charges of political activity, such as membership in outlawed organizations.
 Charges are brought by military prosecutors. Serious charges are tried before three-
 judge panels; lesser offenses are tried before one judge. Defendants have the right
 to counsel and to appeal verdicts to the Court of Military Appeals, which may accept
 appeals based on the law applied in the case, the sentence, or both. The right of
 appeal does not apply in all cases and sometimes requires court permission. The Is-
 raeli military courts rarely acquit Palestinians of security offenses, but sentences
 are sometimes reduced on appeal.
 Trials are delayed for several reasons: witnesses, including Israeli military or po-
 lice officers, do not appear, the defendant is not brought to court; files are lost; or
 attorneys fail to a ppear, in some cases reportedly because they have not been in-
 formed of the trial date. These delays add pressure on defendants to plead guilty
 to avoid serving a period of pretrial detention that could exceed the sentence. In
 cases involving minor offenses, an "expedited" tria may be held, in which a charge
 sheet is drawn up within 48 hours and a court hearing scheduled within days.
 By law most Israeli military trials are public, although access is limited. Consular
 officials are allowed to attend military court proceedings involving foreign citizens,
 but there have been delays in gaining admission.
 Most convictions in military courts are based on confessions. There is practically
 no testimony provided by Palestinian witnesses because, Israeli authorities main-
 tain, Palestinians refuse to cooperate with the authorities. Physical and psycho-
 logical pressures and reduced sentences for those who confess contribute to the like-
 lihood that security detainees will sign confessions. Confessions are usually spoken
 in Arabic, but translated into Hebrew for the record because, authorities maintain,
 many Israeli court personnel speak Arabic but few read it.
 Crowded facilities and poor arrangements for attorney-client consultations in pris-
 ons hinder legal defense efforts. Palestinian attorneys report that appointments to
 see clients are difficult to arrange, and that prison authorities often fail to produce
 clients for scheduled appointments.
 
 
 1188
 Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip accused of security and ordinary
 criminal offenses are tried under Israeli law in the nearest Israeli district court. Ci-
 vilian judges preside and the standards of due process and admissibility of evidence
 are not governed by military occupation law. Settlers convicted in Israeli courts of
 crimes against Palestinians regularly receive lighter punishment than Palestinians
 convicted of similar crimes against either Israelis or other Palestinians.
 The PA inherited a court system based on structures and legal codes predating
 the 1967 Israeli occupation. The Gaza legal code derives from British mandate,
 Egyptian, and some locally generated law. Pre-1967 Jordanian law applies in those
 areas in the West Bank under PA control. However, the body of law in both Gaza
 and West Bank has been substantially modified by Israeli military orders. According
 to the DOP and the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, Israeli military decrees issued during
 the occupation theoretically remain valid in both areas and are subject to review
 pursuant to a spcific procedure. The PA is undertaking efforts to unify the Gaza
 and West Bank legal codes, but has made little progress.
 The court system in general is still recovering from years of neglect. Judges and
 staff are underpaid and overworked and suffer from lack of skills and training;, court
 procedures and record-keeping are archaic and chaotic; and the delivery of justice
 is often slow and uneven. Judges suffer from lack of police protection. The ability
 of the courts to enforce decisions is extremely weak, and Palestinian courts in the
 West Bank function sporadically. There is also administrative confusion in the ap-
 peals process.
 The PA Ministry of Justice appoints all civil judges for 10-year terms. The Attor-
 ney General, an appointed official, reports to the Minister of Justice and supervises
 judcial operations in both Gaza and Jericho and, since late 1995, in other West
 Bank cities.
 In February in response to Israeli and international pressure to take a tougher
 stance on terrorism and to charges that extremist opposition groups intimidated ci-
 vilian court judges, the PA established a state security court in Gaza to try cases
 involving internal or external security. The court was established by special decree
 on the basis of legislation in place during Egyptian control of the Gaza Strip from
 1948-1967 and on a Palestinian constitution enacted in Gaza in 1962. Three mili-
 tary judges preside over the court, which reportedly applies civilian law. There is
 no right of appeal, but verdicts may be either ratified or repealed by the head of
 the PA.
 During the year, the PA State Security Court in Gaza handed down sentences to
 at least 18 defendants, ranging from 25 years for recruiting suicide bombers and as-
 sisting bombers to acquitta f-all charges. A similar court operates in Jericho under
 the same guidelines as the Gaza court. It is headed by a senior police official and
 presided over by three military judges. The State Security Court was also used in
 Jenin in December, when it sentenced two former Fatah "Black Panthers" to 9 years
 in prison and hard labor for abducting two Israeli border policemen in Jenin in No-
 vember.
 Local and international human rights groups have criticized the PA State Secu-
 rity Court, arguing that it is subordinate to the power of the executive, undermines
 the independence of the judiciary, and violates defendants' rights to a fair and open
 trial.
 Normal limits on the length of pre-arraignment detention do not appear to apply
 to suspects held by the PA security prosecutor. Defendants are brought to court
 without knowledge of the charges against them or sufficient time to prepare a de-
 fense. Court sessions often take place on short notice, sometimes even in the middle
 of the night, often without lawyers present. In some instances, the State Security
 Court has tried a case, issued a verdict, and imposed a sentence in a single session
 lasting several hours.
 A Palestinian human rights organization estimated that 35 political prisoners and
 90 detainees suspected of-"collaboration" with Israel were incarcerated in the Gaza
 central prison as of December. This does not include detainees who may be held in
 other detention facilities in Gaza. Thirty "security prisoners" and 10 "military viola-
 tors" (i.e., Palestinian security service employees facing prosecution) were reportedly
 held in Jericho prison in November.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Israeli
 military authorities in the West Bank may enter private Palestinian homes and in-
 stitutions without a warrant on security grounds when authorized by an officer of
 the rank of lieutenant colonel. In conducting searches, the IDF has used forced en-
 tries, and has sometimes beaten occupants and destroyed property.
 In July IDF soldiers, without identifying themselves, reportedly attempted to
 enter the home of a Palestinian with American citizenship by force, and then opened
 fire on the house indiscriminately, damaging the house and its contents while the
 
 
 1189
 
 family was inside. Undercover units have also engaged in destructive and violent
 behavior during searches, as well as harassment of families of wanted Palestinians.
 Israeli authorities claim that forced entry may lawfully occur only when incident to
 an arrest and when entry is resisted. They maintain that beatings and arbitrary de-
 struction of property during searches are punishable violations of military regula-
 tions, and that compensation is due to victims in such cases. The Government does
 not provide information regarding such compensation.
 Security forces may demolish or seal the home of a suspect, whether the owner
 or tenant, without any trial. The decision to seal or demolish a house is made by
 several high-level Israeli officials, including the Coordinator of the Civil Admlinistra-
 tion and the Defense Minister. Owners of houses ordered demolished have 48 hours
 to appeal to the area commander;, a final appeal may be made to the High Court.
 A successful appeal generally results in the conversion of a demolition order to seal-
 ing. After a house is demolished, military authorities confiscate the land and pro-
 hibit the owner from rebuilding or removing the rubble.
 The number of house demolitions and sealings continued to be low. Authorities
 demolished one house for security reasons in 1995, compared to one partial demoli-
 tion in 1994. They also sealed the stairway to the roof of one house, compared to
 five such sealings in 1994.
 Israeli authorities ordered the demolition of the house of the Ramat Gan suicide
 bomber. The family has appealed the order. The authorities also ordered the demoli-
 tion of the house of an alleged accomplice in the attack, as well as the house of the
 Jerusalem suicide bomber.
 Many human rights groups maintain that the sealing or demolishing of homes is
 a form of collective punishment because such acts target innocent families and chil-
 dren. The Israeli High Court has stated that the goal of such demolitions is to deter
 terrorists.
 Owners may apply to regional military commanders for permits to rebuild or
 unseal their homes. n December 1994, the Israeli Government decided to allow the
 opening or rebuilding of homes sealed or demolished as a result of security offenses
 committed by a family member who had been released from prison. Each former
 prisoner must apply for a rebuilding or unsealing permit after which the Govern-
 ment will approve or reject the application. In Marh the IDF unsealed about 40
 houses in the West Bank, many sealed since the 1970's, as a goodwill gesture to
 mark a Muslim holiday.
 The IDF continued using heavy weapons to destroy houses believed to be the hid-
 ing places of security suspects. In at least 3 cases, houses were destroyed apparently
 to punish familiesbelieved to have harbored suspects. In one case in Hebron, 2
 houses were demolished reportedly as a result of their proximity to an orchard in
 which a wanted person had sought refuge. According to official Israeli sources, 5
 houses were demolished in 1995 in military operations, a decrease from 12 in 1994.
 A wall dividing two houses was also partially demolished in one military operation.
 Israeli security services sometimes monitor the mail and telephone conversations
 of Palestinians resident in PA areas and the West Bank. The authorities sometimes
 interrupt telephone service and electricity to specific areas.
 In Gaza and Jericho, the existing law requires that a chief prosecutor issue war-
 rants for entry and searches of private proper. These requirements are occasion-
 ally ignored in Palestinian police sweeps for security suspects. Homes have been
 searched without the consent of their owners; in some cases police have forcibly en-
 tered premises, destroying doors and windows.
 g. Use of Excesive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The human rights organization B'tselem estimated 47 persons were killed by
 Israeli security forces in 1995. Israeli forces killed a total of 108 persons in 1994.
 Human rights monitors say that one reason for the decrease appears to be a
 change in IDF tactics in confronting Palestinian demonstrators and stonethrowers,
 as well as apparent Israeli decisions to keep away from schools and other
 flashpoints. The IDF generally did not use deadly florce to disperse crowds, and
 adopted the use of batons, tear gas, and-with less frequency-rubber bullets. There
 were still instances, however, in which live ammunition was used to disperse peace-
 ful crowds, especially during demonstrations throughout the West Bank in solidarity
 with hunger striking prisoners in June.
 Palestinians killed 15 Israeli soldiers and civilians in the West Bank and PA
 areas during the year, and 30 people in Israel. Extremists associated with HAMAS
 and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were responsible for most of the lethal attacks on Is-
 raelis.
 According to an Israeli human rights organization, Israeli security forces killed 4
 Palestinian children under the age of 16. There were 15 such killings in 1994. Infor-
 mation on the results of the investigations into these incidents was not available.
 
 
 1190
 
 Human rights groups report that the IDF killed at least 3 Palestinians at military
 roadblocks and chec pints at Israeli borders and inside occupied Territory. In these
 cases, the IDF said that the individuals were shot after they failed to obey soldiers'
 orders to halt. The IDF said in late 1994 that it would revise the open fire orders
 at the checkpoints, but has so far not released any new orders.
 IDF regulations permit the use of live ammunition only when a soldier's life is
 in immediate danger, to halt fleeing suspects, to disperse a violent demonstration,
 or to fire on an "individual unlawfully carrying firearms." According to policy, sol-
 diers should direct fire at the legs only and may fire at a fleeing suspect only if they
 believe that a serious felony has occurred and they have exhausted other means to
 apprehend the suspect. It is forbidden to open fire in the direction of children or
 women, even in cases of severe public disorder, unless there is an immediate and
 obvious danger to a soldier's life.
 In practice, soldiers, police, and undercover units used live ammunition in situa-
 tions other than when their lives were in danger (see Section L.a.) and sometimes
 shot suspects in the upper body and head. Soldiers, police, and undercover units
 also injured many bystanders, including children, by live fire, rubber bullets, or
 beating while pursuing suspects.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Israeli Government generally respects free-
 dom of speech in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, but prohibits public expres-
 sions of support for Islamic extremist groups, such as HAMAS, and other groups
 avowedly dedicated to the destruction of Israel. Continuing a policy began in 1994,
 the Government generally did not enforce the prohibition on the display of Palestin-
 ian political symbols, such as flags, national colors, and graffiti, acts which are pun-
 ishable by fines or imprisonment.
 Overall, censorship of specific press pieces continued to be low. Israeli authorities
 continue to restrict the Arabic press for security-related issues. Military censors re-
 view all Arabic publications in East Jerusalem for material related to the public
 order and security of Israel and the occupied territories. Israeli security forces -aid-
 ed several press offices in the West Ban and East Jerusalem on suspicion of pub-
 lishing or possessing material linking them to militant Islamic groups, and seized
 files, equipment, and computer disks. In another case, security forces detained and
 interrogated a reporter from An-Nahar Palestinian newspaper for over a month on
 his relations with llAMAS without bringing charges. The International Federation
 of Journalists petitioned the Prime Minister to urge his release.
 Reports by foreign journalists are also subject to review by Israeli military censors
 for security reasons, and the satellite feed used by many foreign journalists is mon-
 itred. PA authorities accused the Government of being behind unexplained tech-
 nical failures that cut off communications several times to the PA "Voice of Pal-
 estine" radio station located in Ramallah. PA authorities charged that these unex-
 pected service lapses coincided with news events that the Israelis did not want re-
 ported on Palestinian radio.
 Some areas continue to be closed to journalists, usually in conjunction with a cur-
 few or security incident. From time to time during security closures, the IDF denies
 entry permits to Palestinian journalists preventing them from attending their places
 of work in East Jerusalem.
 The IDF requires a permit for publications imported into the occupied territories.
 Imported materials may be censored or banned for anti-Semitic or anti-Israel con-
 tent. Possession of banned materials is punishable by a fine and imprisonment.
 Security forces raided and in some cases closed several mosques in 1995 after
 HAMAS pamphlets were found inside.
 Palestinian universities and schools generally operated normally, although stu-
 dents and teachers still had problems traveling between Gaza and the West Bank.
 The Government denied to hundreds of Gazan students the travel permits required
 to reach the West Bank or the residency permits required to study or teach there.
 Some Palestinians were also denied permits to travel to academic meetings abroad
 or to engage in cultural exchange programs in Israel. Several private schools in Je-
 rusalem were shut down for weeks at a time during strict closures after many
 teachers were unable to obtain permits to enter. In January Israeli police raided a
 university in Jerusalem, destroyed property, and arrested and reportedly beat sev-
 eral students.
 Palestinians living in areas under the PA's jurisdiction have been allowed to criti-
 cize PA performance and the peace process. The PA has granted licenses to a vari-
 ety of periodicals, including some published by opposition groups. Nonetheless, the
 PA has a generally poor record on freedom of expression and freedom of the press.
 
 
 1191
 
 The PA Press Law published in 1995 has been described by Palestinian journalists
 as the best in the Arab world, but it has not been adhered to in many cases.
 PA officials imposed restrictions on the press in several instances, including tem-
 porarily closing some opposition and mainstream papers and confiscating copies of
 others, including a Fatah publication. While some were losed for publishing inflam-
 matory material, others published articles critical of the PA. There were credible re-
 ports that a reporter from the mainstream An-Nahar newspaper was detained by
 security forces for reporting on an alleged bomb factory in Gaza. On several occa-
 sions, 'A officials detained the editors of opposition papers.
 There were also credible reports that senior PA leaders have intimidated editors
 into practicing self-censorship, and pressured them not to publish certain writers
 who are out of favor with the PA or Fatah officials. In an incident in Nablus, a Pal-
 estinian profesor who published an article that labeled Yasir Arafat as a dictator
 received anonymous threatening calls, and was later shot in the legs, reportedly by
 local Fatah renegades.
 In a report issued in September, Reporters Without Frontiers, a Paris-based jour-
 nalists! rights group, charged the PA with resorting to "pressure, harassment, ar-
 rests, and suspensions" to stifle the independence of the press. They labeled the PA
 Press Law as restrictive, because it prevents criticism of the police and permits the
 seizure of newspapers which do so. -In December PA police officials summoned an
 editor of Al-Quds newspaper, Mahir Al-Alami, to police headquarters in Jericho, to
 question him about his refusal to publish on AI-Quid's front page a story about PLO
 Chairman Yasir Arafat. Alami was released after being detained without charge in
 Jericho for nearly a week.
 Under the August 1994 Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Re-
 sponsibilities reached with the Government of Isel, the PA assumed responsibility
 for all levels of education in the West Bank, in addition to its jurisdiction in Gaza
 and Jericho.
 There were no reports of PA interference with academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although Israeli military or-
 ders ban public gatherings of 10 or more people without a permit, authorities re-
 laxed enforcement after the signing of the Declaration of Principles in September
 1993. However, in January after several well-attended Palestinian demonstrations
 against confiscation of Palestinian land and settlement expansion, the IDF banned
 demonstrations involving land issues. Private organizations are required to register
 with the authorities, though some operate without licenses. Authorities permit Pal-
 estinian charitable, community, professional, and self-help organizations to operate
 unless their activities are viewed as overly political or opposed to the DOP.
 PA officials maintain that they do not impose restraints on freedom of assembly,
 although they require permits for rallies, demonstrations, and many cultural events.
 These were rarely denied. In a notable exception in March, the PA refused permis-
 sion for the Gaza Center for Rights and Law to hold a seminar on the PA State
 Security Court. In Gaza, police approval is required for "political" meetings at sev-
 eral specific large meeting halls. Written permission is also required for buses to
 transport passengers to attend political meetings. There have been no reports that
 such permits or permissions were denied. In PA cities in the West Bank, the PA
 requires permits for outdoor rallies and demonstrations and prohibits calls for vio-
 lence a display of arms, and racist slogans.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Israeli Government respects freedom of religion and
 does not ban any group or sect on strictly religious grounds. It permits all faiths
 to operate schools and institutions. Religious publications are subject to the publica-
 tions laws described in Section 2.a. The MF raided several mosques in the West
 Bank and closed some for several days or months after "incitive material" was found
 on the premises.
 The A does not restrict the freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the occupied territories, Foreign Travel, Emigra-
 tion, and Repatriation.-Israeli authorities continued to issue some Palestinians
 green identity (ID) cards which signify that the bearer is a security risk and pro-
 hibit the bearer's travel in or through Jerusalem and abroad. Issuance of the cards
 is a form of punishment without formal charge or trial. According to Arabic press
 reports, Palestinians with blue identity cards, signifying they are residents of the
 Jerusalem area, must obtain permits from Israeli authorities to enter the PA areas.
 Closures of the West Bank and Gaza continued to occur in 1995. Any Palestinian
 holding a Gaza or West Bank ID card was required to obtain a permit togain en-
 trance to Israel or Jerusalem. Most Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza en-
 countered difficulty in obtaining permits to visit, work, study, obtain medical care,
 or attend religious services outside of the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinian journal-
 ists, many working for the foreign media, were denied entry during strict closures.
 
 
 1192
 As a security precaution, Israeli authorities also banned West Bank residents and
 Gazans from entering Jerusalem during major Jewish holidays. Even with a valid
 permit, entry by Palestinians was subjected to the decision of soldiers manning the
 checkpoints into Israel or Jerusalem; these soldiers sometimes refused entry. In
 January women, who previously did not need permits, were required to obtain them.
 After March the IDF banned Palestinian vehicles from entering or exiting Gaza.
 Serious security incidents generally prompt the Government to cancel all permits,
 forbidding completely Palestinian entry from the territories and the PA areas for ex-
 tended periods, and requiring Palestinians to reapply for permits. Israeli officials ac-
 knowledge that no Palestinian holder of a legal entrance permit has committed an
 act of terrorism in Israel; terroristo have been either legal residents of East Jerusa-
 lem or have entered Israeli territory clandestinely. Palestinian sources report that
 Israeli police arrest at random an average of 1,000 Palestinians a month in Israel
 and Jerusalem for lack of entrance permits. Te offenders are often jailed for 48
 hours and may be fined up to $133.00.
 The Israeli authorities have also closed off for security reasons the Palestinian
 city of Jericho, inside the West Bank, from periods ranging from hours to a 9-day
 closure in August. The August closure was imposed during a period of contention
 with the PA concerning suspects in Jericho who were wanted for the murder of Is-
 raelis. Many Palestinian non-residents of Jericho, as well as tourists, were trapped
 in the city as a result of the closure.
 Curfews were still in use, generally in response to security incidents or in advance
 of antizipated incidents, or as part of an on-going security operation. Israeli settlers
 are generally free to move about during curfews, while Palestinian residents are
 confined to their homes.
 The Government has issued travel restrictions against 17 Israeli settlers, prohibit-
 ing them from entering sensitive locations in the West Bank. At least 18 Israelis
 living in Israel are prohibited from entering any part of the West Bank. After the
 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in November, the Israeli Gov-
 ernent clamped down on extremist settler activities. About 50 settlers were
 charged for activities that took place several months prior to the assassination.
 Three settlers were charged with sedition, the first time such charges have been is-
 sued for activities not related to the Israeli-Arab conflict. One prominent settler
 later received a 6-month prison sentence, plus a 6-month suspended sentence for ri-
 oting. Seventeen settlers were placed under administrative detention, or house ar-
 rest; administrative detention sentences usually range from 3 to 6 months. Three
 members of the extremist Kahane Chai organization were imprisoned, although
 they were later released on appeal.
 The Government requires all Palestinians resident in areas under Israeli control
 to obtain permits for foreign travel and has restricted the travel of some political
 activists. However, thousands of Palestinians in the occupied territories travel
 abroad each year.
 Bridge-crossing permits to Jordan may be obtained at post offices without a
 screening process. Palestinian males between the ages of 16 and 25 who cross into
 Jordan must remain outside the territories for 9 months. Passports and identifica-
 tion cards for the residents of PA areas are issued by the PA. In late 1995, the PA
 began to issue documents to Palestinian residents throughout the West Bank.
 Obstacles to travel by Palestinian residents of the occupied territories include the
 inability to obtain a travel permit and the ^ear of losing one's residency. Restriction
 on residence, tourist visas, reentry, and family reunification apply only to Palestin-
 ian residents of the occupied territories. Israeli authorities sometimes refuse to
 renew the laissez-passers of Palestinians from the occupied territories who live or
 work abroad, on the grounds that they have abandoned their residences.
 The Government ordinarily does not permit Palestinians who obtain foreign citi-
 zenship to resume residence in the occupied territories; nor does it permit those who
 acquire legal residency abroad, or who remain outside the occupied territories for
 over 3 years, to resume their residency. Such persons are permitted to return only
 as tourists and are sometimes denied entry entirely.
 Israeli authorities also place restrictions on family reunification. Most Palestin-
 ians who were abroad before or during the 1967 war (estimated at one-fourth of the
 Palestinian population at that time) or who have lost their residence permits for
 other reasons, are not permitted to reside permanently with their families in the
 occupied territories.
 The CIVAD and its successor, MATAK, usually denied permanent residency in the
 occupied territories to the foreign-born spouses and children of Palestinian resi-
 dents, and to nonresident mothers. The Government usually issues temporary resi-
 dency permits to persons in these categories.

 The PA does not restrict the travel of Palestinians in Gaza and PA cities in the
 West Bank. However, a "safe passage' ensuring travel between Gaza and PA cities
 in the West Bank for Palestinian residents provided for in the Interim Agreement
 is awaiting implementation. The PA Ministry of Civil Affairs requires women to
 show the written consent of a male family member before it will issue them a travel
 document (see Section 5).
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 For the first time in their history, Palestinian residents in the West Bank, Gaza,
 and East Jerusalem went to the polls on January 20, 1996. They elected an 88-
 member Palestinian Council and the head of the Executive Authority of the Council.
 Despite calls for an election boycott from the Islamist party HAMAS and other fac-
 tions opposed to the peace process, voter turnout was high, about three-fourths of
 the estimated 1 million registered voters. Yasir Arafat won almost 89 percent of the
 vote in a two-person race for chief executive of the Council.
 Some 700 candidates ran for Council seats. Council members were elected in
 multi-member electoral districts. The Council is expted to convene in early 1996.
 On its agenda will be the tasks of drafting a basic law specifying the powers of the
 Council. A sizable number of independents and critics of Mr. Arafat and his Fatah
 faction, as many as 35, won seats on the Council.
 The election was monitored by hundreds of international and local observers.
 They agreed that while there were some irregularities, the election was generally
 satisfactory overall.
 Most Palestinians in East Jerusalem do not recognize the jurisdiction of the mu-
 nicipality of Jerusalem; less than 7 percent of Jerusalem's Palestinian population
 voted in the November 1993 municipal elections. No Palestinian resident of East Je-
 rusalem sits on the city council.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Many local groups--Israeli, Palestinian, and mixed-monitored the Israeli Gov-
 ernment's human rights practices. The Israeli Government generally cooperates
 with human rights organizations; officials normally agree to meet with human
 rights monitors. The Israeli Government permits them to publish and hold press
 conferences. However, some groups maintain that the Israeli Government does not
 adequately respond to their inquiries and sometimes does not respond at all.
 The director of a Palestinian Workers' Rights Center was arrested and called in
 for several hours of questioning and accused of "encouraging workers to use violence
 against their employers." The director said such charges were unfounded, and sev-
 eral human rights and other organizations worked for his release, including Israel's
 Histadrut Labor Federation.
 Many local human rights groups-mostly Palestinian-as well as several inter-
 national human rights organizations, monitored the PA's human rights practices.
 The PA generally, but not always, cooperates with these organizations and PA offi-
 cials normally meet with their representatives. The PA licensed a new human rights
 organization in Gaza, the Palestinian Center for Human Rights. The PA also has
 a cooperative relationship with the International Labor Organization. Many of the
 Palestinian human rights organizations work behind the scenes with the PA to over-
 come areas of alleged abuse. They also publish criticism if they believe the PA is
 not responding adequately to private entreaties. The PSS in Jericho is working with
 local Palestinian human rights groups to train its members in proper human rights
 procedures.
 The ICRC operates in the PA areas under the terms of a memorandum of under-
 standing signed between the ICRC and the PLO. The memorandum accords the
 ICRC access to all detainees held by the PA. However, the ICRC has experienced
 difficulties in gaining access to all detainees. PA officials did not grant ICRC rep-
 resentatives permission to visit Gaza Central Prison from July to December.
 In February PA police arrested and detained for several hours Raji Sourani, a
 Palestinian lawyer and director of the Gaza Human Rights Center for Rights and
 Law. Sourani was arrested after the Center published a report condemning the es-
 tablishment of the PA State Security Court. In December PA security officials in
 Gaza arrested the chairman of the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citi-
 zen's Rights (PICRR), Iyad Sarraj, and held him for 9 hours, reportedly for criticiz-
 ing human rights violations by the PA.
 In September the head of Palestinian Preventive Security Service (PSS) in Jericho
 labeled Bassam Eid, a Palestinian human rights field worker from the Israeli
 human rights organization B'tselem, an "agent of the Israeli police" after B'tselem
 
 
 1194
 released a report critical of PSS treatment of Palestinian detainees. Human rights
 groups charged that such a public statement put the researcher in danger because
 it implied he was a "collaborator" with Israel. The PSS head has not publicly re-
 tracte-d the statement.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Palestinian women living under military occupation face human rights
 problems similar to those of men. In addition, Palestinian women both in the occu-
 pied territories and in the Palestinian Authority areas endure various forms of so-
 cial prejudice and repression within their own society. Because of early marriage,
 girl frequently do not finish the mandatory level of schooling and often do not at-
 tend colleges and universities because of cultural restrictions. While there is an ac-
 tive women's movement in the West Bank and Gaza, attention has only recently
 shifted from nationalist aspirations to women's issues such as domestic violence,
 education, employment, and marriage and inheritance laws.
 Although the issues of rape, domestic violence, and violence related to "family
 honor," have gained greater prominence, public discussion is generally muted. Vic-
 tims are often encouraged by relatives to remain quiet and are themselves punished
 or blamed for the "shame" which has been brought upon them and their families.
 While women's groups seek to educate women on these issues, women's rights advo-
 cates claim that few resources are available to shelter the victims of violence. They
 also maintain that society has not been receptive to providing counseling or out-
 reach services to victims of a problem they see as more widespread than is acknowl-
 ere are no reliable statistics available on family violence or other forms of vio-
 lence against women.
 There are no laws providing for women's rights in the workplace. Some Palestin-
 ian women work outside the home; a recentUnited Nations study set the female
 workforce at 8.8 per cent in the West Bank and 1.7 percent in Gaza.
 Women are underrepresented in most aspects of political and professional life.
 There are almost no women in decisionmaking positions in the legal, medical, edu-
 cational, and scientific fields. However, a small group of women is prominent in poli-
 tics, medicine, law, teaching, and in non-governmental organizations.
 Personal status law for Palestinians is based on religious law. For Muslim Pal-
 estinians, personal status law is derived from Shari'a (Islamic) law. The PA Min-
 istry of Civil Affairs requires women to obtain the written consent of a male family
 member before issuin  a travel document. This requirement is based on Jordanian
 law. In the West Bank and Gaza, Shari'a law pertaining to women is part of the
 Jordanian Status Law of 1976, which includes inheritance and marriage laws.
 Under the law, women inherit less than male members of the family. The Marriage
 Law allows males to take more than one wife, but few do so. Under this law, women
 are permitted to make "stipulations" to protect them against divorce and questions
 of cld custody. However, only 1 percent of women take advantage of this section
 of the law, leaving most women at a disadvantage when it comes to divorce or child
 custody.
 Children.-Current British Mandate, Jordanian, and military laws, all of which
 exist in the West Bank and Gaza, offer protection to children under labor and penal
 codes. While there is no juvenile court system, judges specializing in children's cases
 generally sit for juvenile offenders. In cases where the child is the victim, judges
 have the discretion to remove the child from a situation deemed harmful. However,
 the system is not advanced in the protection afforded children.
 There is no pattern of societal abuse of children, either among Israelis or Palestin-
 ians.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no mandated accessibility to public facilities in
 the occupied territories under either Israeli or Palestinian authority. Approximately
 130,000 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are disabled. Some Palestinian in-
 stitutions care for and train disabled persons; their efforts, however, are chronically
 underfunded. According to a report by the Palestinian human rights group A1-Haq,
 Palestinians with disabilities are segregated and isolated from Palestinian society.
 They are discriminated against in most spheres including education, employment,
 transportation, and access to public buildings and facilities.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Israeli settlers are treated more favorably
 under Israeli law and practices than Palestinians under the complex mixture of
 laws and regulations that apply to the territories. This includes the right to due
 process, residency rights, freedom of movement, sales of crops and goods, land and
 water use, and access to health and social services. Travel restrictions are not ap-
 plied equally (see Section 2.c.). Similarly, the Government treats Israeli settlers in-
 
 
 1195
 
 volved in security violations more leniently than Palestinians guilty of similar of-
 fenses (see Section l.a.).
 Settlers and other Israelis opposed to the peace process established a semi-perma-
 nent demonstration site outside Orient House, former headquarters for the Palestin-
 ian bilateral negotiating team and center of Palestinian political activity in Jerusa-
 lem for several months. At times, the demonstrators harassed and bullied visitors,
 passersby, and children at a nearby school
 The Israeli human rights organization B'tselem released a report in September
 charging that the Government has failed to protect the lives and property of Pal-
 estinians in Hebron from repeated attacks by settlers there. Israeli security forces
 in Hebron were charged with acting half-heartedly with regard to repeated acts of
 settler violence, including attacks on property and beatings and stonings. In numer-
 ous cases, the police conducted no investigation and only in isolated incidents were
 those responsib e brought to trial.
 The same B'tselem report stated that from February 1994, when an Israeli settler
 killed 29 Palestinians in the brahimi Mosque in Hebron, until the conclusion of
 B'tselem's research in August 1995, the IDF increased its presence in the city and
 created a more restrictive environment for Palestinians than in other West Bank
 cities. The IDF imposed 50 curfew days and 40 curfew nights, erected 32 roadblocks
 and 10 manned checkpoints, and closed entire sections of the city to Palestinians.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Labor affairs in the West Bank came under Palestin-
 ian authority with the signing of the Interim Agreement in September 1995. As a
 result, labor regulations are currently in a transitional state because of the transfer
 of authority. Palestinians are in the process of writing a new labor law. In the
 meantime, labor matters in the West Bank are governed by Jordanian Law 21 of
 1965, as amended by Israeli military orders, and in Gaza and Jericho, by PA deci-
 sions. The law permits workers to establish and join unions without government au-
 thorization. The stipulation by Israeli authorities that all proposed new West Bank
 unions apply for a permit is no longer being enforced because of the peace process.
 No new unions were established in 1995, although one applied for registration. Is-
 raeli authorities have licensed about 35 of the estimated 185 union branches now
 in existence. There are close to 30 licensed trade unions in the West Bank and 6
 in Gaza.
 PA officials are drafting a new labor law which reportedly provides for the right
 to collective bargaining, the right to strike, a minimum wage, maximum working
 hours, minimum age employment restrictions, and health and safety regulations. It
 does not allow for the unionization of domestic servants, family members of employ-
 ers, and PA civil servants.
 Palestinian workers in East Jerusalem are governed by Israeli labor law. They
 are free to establish their own unions. Although the Government restricts East Je-
 rusalem unions from joining West Bank trade union federations, this restriction has
 not been enforced. Palestinian workers in East Jerusalem may simultaneously be-
 long to unions affiliated with a West Bank federation and the Israeli Histadrut
 labor federation.
 West Bank unions are not affiliated with the Histadrut federation. West Bank
 and Gaza labor leaders met formally with Histadrut officials for the first time in
 1994 and signed a cooperative agreement with Histadrut in March 1995. The Gov-
 ernment prohibits Palestinian workers who are not resident in Israel or East Jeru-
 salem from being full members of Histadrut. Nevertheless Palestinian workers in
 Israel are required to contribute 1 percent of their wages to Histadrut. Negotiations
 between Histadrut and West Bank union officials to return half of this fee to the
 Palestinian Union Federation were also completed in March 1995.
 Palestinians who work in Israel are also required to contribute to the National
 Insurance Institute (NIl) which provides unemployment insurance and other bene-
 fits. Palestinian workers are eligible for some, but not all, NIl benefits. Israeli au-
 thorities maintain that the CIVAD provided Palestinian workers with tax allow-
 ances and other benefits that amounted to adequate compensation, a process that
 Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements have disrupted. According to the Gaza-Jericho
 agreement, Palestinians working in Israel will continue to be insured for injuries
 occurring in Israel, the bankruptcy of a worker's employer, and allowances for ma-
 ternity leave.
 The Government has agreed to transfer the NII fees collected from Palestinian
 workers to the PA, which will assume responsibility for the pensions and social ben-
 efits of Palestinians working in Israel. Implementation of this change is still under-
 way.
 
 
 1196
 The great majority of West Bank unions belong to the General Federation of
 Trade Unions in the West Bank (GFTU) or the Workers' Unity Bloc (WUB). In the
 summer of 1994, the GFTU, the WUB, other West Bank unions, and the Gaza
 unions merged informally to create a single union, the Palestinian General Federa-
 tion of Trade Unions (PGFTU). Pending elections (postponed until after the Pal-
 pstinian general elections), the PGFTU acted as the informal coalition in the com-
 pletion of the negotiations with Histadrut regarding workers' fees. The reorganiza-
 tion of unions under the PGFTU-although not yet finalized-is intended to enable
 the West Bank and Gaza unions to represent worker interests more effectively.
 Union membership has declined continuously since the intifada, in part because
 the periodic closures of the occupied territories have restricted the number of work
 permits issued to Palestinians. The number of Palestinians working in Israel fell in
 1995 because of the closure and the Government's policy of hiring workers from
 abroad to work inside Israel. An estimated 85,000 workers are members of the
 GFTU, the largest union bloc. There are approximately 25,000 union members in
 Gaza. The PGFTU estimates actual organized membership, i.e., dues-paying mem-
 bers, at about 30 percent of all Palestinian workers, and is working to add more.
 Although the GFTU has participated in meetings of the International Confederation
 of Arab Trade Unions (ICATU), the PGFTU has yet to do so because of a conflict
 over jurisdictions. The GFTU, the PGTIU, and the WUB have applied for member-
 ship in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).
 Since union organizations in the West Bank are associated with various Palestin-
 ian political factions, Israeli authorities at times have inhibited union activities in
 the West Bank and Gaza. That situation is changing under the peace process, how-
 ever, as Israeli authorities have generally not interfered in union activity. At least
 one organization organized by Islamists now operates legally.
 West Bank unions held some elections in 1994, which were suspended until after
 the Palestinian general elections. The CIVAD, which had the power to remove can-
 didates convicted of security and other offenses, did not exercise that power after
 the DOP.
 There has been no dissolution of unions by administrative or legislative action.
 Under prevailing labor law, unions have the right to strike only after submitting
 a complaint to the CIVAD for mandatory arbitration, but in current practice, this
 law is not being executed. Many small scale, non-union sanctioned strikes occurred
 in the West Bank without Israeli interference. There are no laws in the territories
 that specifically protect the rights of striking workers, and, in practice, such workers
 have little or no protection from employers' retribution.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-A majority of workers in the
 occupied territories are self-employed or unpaid family helpers in agriculture or
 commerce. Only 35 percent of employment in the territories consists of wage jobs,
 most in services provided by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
 (UNRWA), the CIVAD, or in municipalities. Collective bargaining is protected. Al-
 though the CIVAD did not officially recognize collective agreements, it nonetheless
 honored such agreements and did not interfere in them. About 150 labor agreements
 were in force in the West Bank in 1995.
 Labor disputes are reportedly adjudicated by committees of 3 to 5 members in
 businesses employing more than 20 workers. Existing laws and regulations do not
 offer real protection against anti-union discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones in the occupied territories.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no forced or compulsory
 labor in the occupied territories.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum working age in the
 West Bank, Jericho, and Gaza is 14. This order is not effectively enforced, and un-
 derage workers are employed in agriculture and in some West Bank and Gaza fac-
 tories. Work hours for young workers are not limited.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage in the West Bank,
 Jericho, or Gaza area. In the West Bank, the normal workweek is 48 hours in most
 areas; in Gaza the workweek is 45 hours for day laborers and 40 hours for salaried
 employees. There is no effective enforcement of maximum workweek laws.
 The Israeli Ministry of Labor's Office of Inspection Services has been responsible
 for enforcing safety standards in the West Bank. While it maintains that it has un-
 dertaken inspections, health and safety conditions in Palestinian factories and other
 businesses in the West Bank and Gaza often do not meet international standards.
