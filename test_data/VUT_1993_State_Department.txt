 VANUATU
 Vanuatu, a South Pacific island nation with a population of 170,000, became inde-
 pendent in 1980 after many years of joint British-French rule. It has a parliamen-
 asystem of government with a prime minister and a 46-member parliament. The
 President has largely ceremonial powers, except when acting on the advice of the
 Council of Mini.ters. Vanuatu's citizens are divided by a variety of languages, by
 the nation's separation into more than 80 islands and by their colonial experience.
 Over time Vanuatu has largely overcome this difference to forge a strong sense of
 nationhood. Political legitimacy is based on majority rule, supported by both Mela-
 nesian and Western tradition.
 The civilian authorities control the small police and paramilitary mobile forces.
 Because the Vanuatu economy is dependent on international trade, it is vulner-
 able to shifts in world market prices. Growth in tourism and Vanuatu's offshore
 banking center were expected once again to lead other sectors of the economy in
 1993.
 Restrictions on freedom of speech and press, together with the treatment of
 women, remain the major human rights problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-No political or other extrajudicial
 killings by the Government or any organized group were reported.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 e. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-Con-
 stitutional provisions against torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 are observed in practice and enforced by the courts. While the law provides that
 prisoners shall have recourse to an ombudsman, that position has never been filled.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were no reports of arbitrary ar-
 rests. Arrest is by warrant. The constitutional provision that suspects must be in-
 formed of charges and given a speedy hearing before a judge is observed in practice.
 There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The courts uphold constitutional provisions for a
 fair public trial, presumption of innocence until guilt is proven, prohibition against
 double jeopardy, the right of habeas corpus, and appeal to the Supreme Court. The
 courts are free of military or executive interference. There were no reports of arbi-
 trary or unfair exercise of judicial authority in 1993.
 There were no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 was no arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Vanuatu's record of respect for the independ-
 ence of opinion and of the media is poor, and 1993 proved no exception. Although
 the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, the Government controls
 the national newspaper, radio stations, and television company.
 An independent newspaper, Vanuascope, opened in 1992 and enjoyed relative
 freedorm until August 1993, when the Government banned media coverage of any
 statements by Father Walter Lini's political faction, which was challenging the Gov-
 ernment's control over Parliament. When Vanuascope defied the ban, the Govern-
 ment discussed revoking the editor's work permit and the newspaper's publishing
 license. With the collapse of Lini's challenge, the overt pressure on the newspaper
 relaxed but remained behind the scenes.
 Although strict controls over the media remain in place, the Government has per-
 mitted more balanced coverage of significant issues than was the case previously.
 Even so, the Government continues to manipulate the media when it suits its politi-
 cal advantage and to react harshly to any criticism. The political oppoaition often
 encounters difficulty in getting its press statements broadcast and published in the
 state-controlled media, and coverage of opposition statements has sometimes been
 delayed until the Government has prepared its response.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associaticn.-Permits must be obtained to
 hold public demonstrations and rallies. The Government reportedly denied the Na-
 tional Teachers Union permission to demonstrate during its June strike. Neverthe-
 less, the teachers marched on Parliament. Several union leaders, including some
 who had not prrticipated in the march, were arrested. They were released after 2
 days in custody, and the court ultimately dismissed charges that they had created
 a public disturbance. Twenty striking members of the Vanuatu Public Service Asso-
 
 
 756
 ciation were arrested in early December for involvement in a protest outside Par-
 liament. The public prosecutor released the group without charge after approxi-
 mately 1 hour.
 There were no restrictions on the forming of political parties or other groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is protected by law and has been gen-
 erally respected in practice. Missionaries of various Christian denominations work
 without restrictions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-All citizens are free to travel internally and externally and to return
 from abroad without restrictions.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right freely to change the government through periodic
 multiparty elections. The Constitution provides for parliamentary elections every 4
 years. The Government of Prime Minister Maxime Carlot Korman is comprised of
 the Prime Minister's Francophone Union of Moderate Parties and the Deputy Prime
 Minister's faction of the Anglophone National United Party. In opposition are the
 Vanua'aku Party and four others. Campaigns and voting are considered by outside
 observers to be fair although government restrictions and pressure on the media in-
 hibit the ability of opposition parties to publicize their views (see Section 2.a.). Elec-
 tions to provincial and local councils have also been freely contested and fair. There
 were reports of discrimination in hiring and provision of services against both per-
 sons and communities suspected of or known to be supporting opposition political
 candidates. The Government has also been charged with unfairly dismissing civil
 servants for political reasons (see Section 6.a.).
 In Vanuatu's traditional society, males are dominant and women are frequently
 limited to customary family roles. This has hampered women from taking a more
 active role in economic and political life. There is only one female Member of Par-
 liament. She served as Minister of Health for part of the year.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Although there are no restrictions on the formation of local nongovernmental
 human nghts organizations, none has been founded to date. A nongovernmental or-
 ganization to promote and protect the rights of women, the Committee on Violence
 against Women, was formed in 1993. There were no requests for investigation by
 outside human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-While women have equal rights under the law, they are only slowly
 emerging from a traditional culture characterized by male dominance, a general re-
 luctance to educate women, and a widespread belief that women should devote
 themselves primarily to childbearing. Members of the National Council of Women
 (NCW) view village chiefs as a primary obstacle to the attainment of social political,
 and economic rights by women. There are no women serving as leaders in Vanuatu's
 municipal or village councils, churches, or chambers of commerce.
 While no accurate data are available, violence against women, particularly wife
 beating, is reportedly common. However, very few cases of wife beating are brought
 to the attention of the authorities, and even fewer are prosecuted. Usually the cases
 are dropped by the women involved beforeging to court. The police are reluctant
 to intervene in what are considered purely domestic matters. Although there are no
 specific laws against spouse beating, the courts have at times dealt severely with
 such cases, using common law assault as a basis for imposing punishment. Several
 cases have been reported in which victims have died. In one case, the husband was
 tried and sentenced to 15 years in prison. In another, the family ultimately with-
 drew the charges and the husband remains at liberty.
 The majority of women enter into marriage through "bride price payment". On
 those islands where the custom of paying "bride price" is observed, the woman is
 regarded as the property of the husband and may be dealt with as he chooses.
 Children.-Children are loved and protected within the traditional extended-fam-
 system, in accordance with the family's financial resources and access to services.
 Members of the extended family, particularly paternal uncles, play an active role
 in a child's development. As a result, virtually no children are homeless or aban-
 doned. Though cases of child abuse are sometimes reported, there is no pattern of
 societal abuse. Although the present Government has made education a priority, ac-
 cess is limited and school attendance is not compulsory. Within the limits of its re-
 
 
 sources, the Government is committed to the welfare, and the protection of the
 rights, of children.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Most of the population is comprised of Mela-
 nesians whose ancestors probably originated in New Guinea. Small minorities of
 Chinese, Fijians, Vietnamese, Tongans, and Europeans are generally concentrated
 in two towns and on a few plantations and experience some discrimination with re-
 gard to land ownership. Although there have been allegations of corrupt practices
 by members of the Government, there is no evidence to suggest a pattern of ethnic
 discrimination in the provision of basic services.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no known governmental or national policy on
 the disabled. Their protection and care is left to the traditional extended family and
 voluntary nongovernmental organizations.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Vanuatu's workers have the right to organize
 unions. Unions may not affiliate with international labor federations without gov-
 ernment permission. The fundamental legislation establishing the right to organize
 unions, setting out the scope of union activity, and providing for the arbitration and
 conciliation of labor disputes consists of the Trade Union Act of 1983 and the Trade
 Disputes Act of 1983. Complaints of antiunion discrimination are referred to the
 Commissioner of Labor.
 There are 5 trade unions with over 4,000 members in the private and public sec-
 tors. The high percentage of the population still engaged in subsistence agriculture
 and fishing serves as a deterrent to extensive union activity. The unions are
 grouped under an umbrella organization, the Vanuatu National Committee of
 Unions, which is a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. The trade unions are independent of the Government.
 Strikes seldom occurred in the past, due in part to high rates of unemployment.
 In 1993 an important strike took place when over three-quarters of Vanuatu's teach-
 ers walked off the job, demanding a 25 percent increase in their salaries. Although
 the 3-week strike was ultimately settled when the Government granted the teachers
 a 5 percent salary increase, the Government failed to handle the matter within the
 established framework of the country's labor laws. The strike was resolved after
 civil servants threatened to generalize the strike. In the wake of the teachers' strike,
 the Government refused to allow two officials of the South Pacific Council of Trade
 Unions to enter the country, resulting in the cancellation of the council's triennial
 conference, scheduled to be held in Port Vila. In late November, the Vanuatu public
 service union went on strike seeking a 16-percent pay raise to compensate for infla-
 tion. At year's end the strike continued. The courts declined the union's mid-Decem-
 ber request that a conciliator be appointed and ordered the opposing parties to en-
 gage in face-to-face negotiation.
 Unrelated to the strikes discussed above, and ignoring legal requirements for noti-
 fication, the Government summarily dismissed a number of civil servants. Critics
 contend that the Government's motivations are political. Several of the people dis-
 missed have successfully fought their dismissals through appeal to the Vanuatu na-
 tional court system. Others are expected to appeal.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions exercise the right to
 organize and bargain collectively. Labor unions negotiate wages and conditions di-
 rectly with management. If the two sides cannot agree, the matter is referred to a
 three-member Arbitration Board appointed by the Minister of Home Affairs. The
 board consists of one representative from organized labor, one from management,
 and the senior magistrate of the magistrate's court. While a dispute is before the
 board, labor may not strike and management may not dismiss union employees.
 Unions and management, however, generally reach agreement on wages without
 having to refer the matter to arbitration.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and there have been no reports that either is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Children under 12 years of age
 are not permitted to work outside of family owned agriculture, where many children
 assist their parents. Employment of children from 12 to 18 years of age is restricted
 by occupational category and conditions of labor-for example, restrictions on em-
 ployment in the shipping industry and nighttime employment. The laws are effec-
 tively enforced by the Labor Department. The high level of unemployment discour-
 ages the use of child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Vanuatu has a legislated minimum wage, ef-
 fectively enforced by the Labor Department. Minimum wage rates were last raised
 in November 1991 to $107 monthly for urban workers and $93 monthly for rural
 
 
 workers (13,200 and 11,440 vatu, respectively). Agricultural workers' minimum
 wages are tied to the market prices for copra and cocoa. Most workers are not in
 the wage economy and are thus outside the scope of the minimum wage laws. For
 those covered by them, the wages provide an adequate standard of living within the
 local context.
 Various laws regulate the rights to sick leave, annual vacations and other condi-
 tions of employment, including a 44-hour maximum workweek. Vanuatu's Employ.
 ment Act, enforced by the Labor Department, includes provisions for safety stand-
 ards. However, the 1987 safety and health legislation is inadequate to protect work-
 ers engaged in logging, agricifiture, construction, and manufacturing. It lacks provi-
 sions for sanitation and protection against substandard electrical wiring, machinery,
 and exposure to a  *icultural and industrial chemicals. Even so, the single inspector
 attached to the Laor Department is hard pressed to enforce the Act fully. After vis-
 its by International Labor Organization consultants, a new occupational health and
 safety act and an industrial relations act have been drafted. It is expected that they
 will be submitted to the Parliament in 1994.
