 Egypt is a republic in which the President and his party, the
 National Democratic Party (NDP), are the dominant political
 forces. The NDP, in power since 1978, commands large
 majorities in the two Parliamentary bodies, the People's
 Assembly and the Shura (Consultative) Council; three of the
 five legal opposition parties have some representation in the
 Parliament. The Cabinet is headed 6y a Prime Minister
 appointed by and responsible to the President. Mohammed Hosni
 Mubarak was elected President by the People's Assembly in 1981
 and reelected to a second 6-year term in July 1987. In
 accordance with the Constitution, his reelection was affirmed
 by a popular referendum.
 Internal security is the responsibility of several different
 organizations. Of the three intelligence services, the
 General Directorate for State Security Investigations (GDSSI),
 which reports to the Interior Ministry, is the main agency
 responsible for domestic security, although there are several
 other police services, including the Central Security Force
 which protects public buildings, facilities, and foreign
 missions. Investigations pertaining to national security may
 be undertaken by any of the three intelligence agencies,
 depending on the nature of the case. GDSSI conducts most
 undercover investigations of domestic opponents of the regime,
 and also carries out interrogations of suspects arrested under
 Egypt's state of emergency legislation. It has been linked to
 many of the reports of torture and abuse of prisoners and
 detainees.
 Egypt's economy has diversified over the'past two decades as
 industries such as petroleum and services such as tourism have
 grown in importance. An inefficient public sector dominates
 the economy, and the Government also maintains an extensive
 network of subsidies and regulations as part of a social
 contract perceived by major segments of the population as
 essential to their economic security. Severe economic
 problems--sluggish growth, rising inflation, and shortages of
 foreign exchange--led the Government to design a reform plan
 aimed at reducing the Government's large budget deficit and
 increasing the role of market forces in the economy.
 Implementation of this plan continues to be held back,
 however, by deep-seated social and political resistance.
 Human rights remained significantly restricted in 1989. The
 primary problems continued to be torture of detainees, with
 apparently ineffective efforts to investigate, try, and punish
 perpetrators of such abuses, an emergency law that permits
 prolonged detentions without due process, and various
 restrictions on political activities, which call into question
 the ability of citizens to change their government by
 democratic means. The Government continued its use of
 emergency law authority--currently in effect until 1991--to
 detain a wide variety of persons suspected of involvement in
 subversive activities. The number of political detainees is
 higher than last year's level, as at least 1,500 persons,
 including Islamic activists, alleged Communists, and strike
 participants were detained. Most of these were subsequently
 released. Those most likely to suffer from human rights
 abuses are Muslim activists or other groups perceived to be a
 threat to the Government. Women are likely to suffer from
 discrimination and abuses sanctioned by tradition.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 --ection-1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no confirmed reports of unlawful government-
 instigated killings for political reasons, nor were there any
 reported-political killings by underground groups. Twenty
 persons have been indicted for their role in the "Egypt's
 Revolution" organization, accused of killing two Israeli
 diplomats and attempting to kill a number of other Israeli and
 American Embassy personnel in a series of attacks in 1984-87.
 The trial, which began in November 1988, continued throughout
 1989.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed reports of disappearances.
 c. Torfure and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Runishment
 Although torture and other forms-of mistreatment are forbidden
 by the Constitution and the law, convincing reports indicate
 they continue to be practiced by police and security
 officials, and punishment of such actions is rare. Egyptian
 courts will not accept confessions or testimony considered to
 have been obtained under torture and-have ordered the release
 of defendants in a number of state security trials because of
 reports by forensic medical examiners that the'defendants had
 been tortured. Detainees and prisoners who claim-to have been
 tortured can and do appeal for redress to the courts and
 public prosecutor. In rare cases the cdurts award financial
 compensation to torture victims. The law also provides for
 jail sentences ranging from 3 to 10 years for officials
 convicted of torture, and first degree.murder charges may be
 brought against those who inflict torture resulting in the
 victim's death. In August a court ordered Interior Minister
 Zaki Badr to pay the nominal compensation of about $40 to one
 vict-im's'family in a case in 1988 in which police officers
 tortured-,to death a son who refused to testify against his
 father. -iThere were no instances in 1989 of police being tried
 and punished for such actions.  -
 In a report issued in May on arbitrary detention and torture
 under the Egyptian Government's emergency powers, Amnesty
 Intexnational(AI) concluded that the "seriousness of the
 alnlegations, medical evidence and consistency of detail" of
 detainee mistreatment have convinced it that a "pattern of
 torture" exists in Egypt.
 Egyptian human rights activists note that most torture
 -allegations involve members of the Islamic Gamaat, while other
 political detainees usually are not subjected to similar
 treatment. In August, however, security forces broke up a
 labor strike at an iron and steel complex in Helwan and
 detained up to several hundred workers. According to a report
 written by members of the Egyptian Oxganization for Human
 Rights (EOHR), arrestees were subjected to mistreatment
 including verbal abuse, systematic beatings, and threats of
 sexual violence, as well as the denial of medical assistance.
 In late August, security forces detained 52 persons, including
 four members of the EOHR, on suspicion of belonging to a
 
 
 1367
 "Communist Workers' Party." There is reliable evidence that
 members of this group were also tortured while under detention.
 There is no evidence that the authorities brought charges
 against those accused of torture or mistreatment. In early
 January 1990, EOHR published a second report charging that
 torture and sexual abuse of prisoners has become so widespread
 that it appeared to be a matter of policy by security forces
 holding those detained both for political and nonpolitical
 reasons.
 The Arab Human Rights Organization, in its 1989 annual report,
 states that many cases of torture have been disclosed and that
 reports have been submitted to the prosecutor's office
 requesting full investigation. It does not say whether the
 Government has responded to these submissions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Two systems of criminal procedure are in effect: ordinary
 criminal procedures and the emergency law. Under ordinary
 procedures, arrests follow investigations, and arrested
 persons are charged with violations of specific laws. With
 the important exception of certain applications of the
 emergency legislation,,preventive detention is not practiced.
 Arrested persons have the right to a judicial determination of
 the legality of detention, and there is a system of bail. The
 ordinary law states that a detained suspect must be brought
 before a magistrate and formally charged within 48 hours of
 his arrest or be released. By and large, there is careful
 observance of constitutional and legal safeguards in the
 arrest and pretrial custody stages. Arrests occur openly and
 with warrants, and the accused are brought before an
 independent judiciary.
 The major exceptions to the normal procedures arise when the
 emergency law, which gives the Government extraordinary
 powers, is applied. The Constitution and the emergency law
 empower the President, when national security or public order
 are thought to be in peril, to invoke emergency powers
 authorizing the arrest and detention of persons suspected of
 being dangerous to national security, irrespective of
 provisions of the penal code. Egyptian law specifies a wide
 range of offenses, deemed harmful to national security, which
 may be tried before a parallel system of state security courts
 under the emergency legislation. Despite a provision of the
 Constitution which states that a state of emergency may only
 be imposed in case of war, foreign invasion, civil strife, or
 natural disaster, a state of emergency has been imposed almost
 without interruption for the last 41 years and continuously
 since the assassination of President Sadat in 1981.
 Under the emergency law a person may be held without charge or
 due process while an investigation is conducted. Within 30
 days the detainee may petition the State Security Court to
 review his detention. The Court has 15 days to review the
 case, following which it may order the detainee's release.
 The Interior Minister then has 15 days to offer objection to
 the Court's decision, following which another State Security
 Court has a further 15 days to review the Minister's
 objection. If the second Court upholds the decision to
 release the detainee, the decision must be implemented. The
 Interior Minister, however, may simply order the detainee
 arrested again, in effect allowing the Government the right of
 indefinite detention of suspects in state security cases.
 
 
 1368
 E=Y2
 During the People's Assembly debate in 1988 over the extension
 of the emergency law, the Government argued that the law is
 only applied against "terrorists, drug pushers, and illegal
 currency traders." In fact, the emergency law is used against
 those categories of suspected criminals, but it was also
 applied in 1989 to detain, among others, striking iron and
 steel workers, student demonstrators, Islamic student
 activists, and relatives (including young children) of
 suspects sought for questioning.
 The Egyptian Minister of Interior acknowledged detaining 1,500
 Islamic fundamentalists during April and May after a clash
 between fundamentalists and police in Fa:-youm. In a wave of
 arrests in August and September, police detained some 300 more
 Isladic fundamentalists, 20 members of the Muslim Brotherhood
 (on charges of indoctrinating young children against the
 regime), and some 40 alleged Shi'ite Muslims on charges of
 plotting against the Government. Police also detained
 striking iron and steel workers and 52 persons (including four
 human rights advocates) on suspicion of belonging to a
 "Communist Workers Party." In December 300 fundamentalist
 students were detained after a clash between police and the
 students at Assyut University. In most cases, detainees are
 released after interrogation and never brought to trial. In
 fact, AI noted that "in recent years, only about 5 percent of
 those arrested for investigation in connection with
 security-related offenses have ever been brought to trial,
 suggesting that the great majority of such prisoners are held
 in the absence of any real evidence incriminating them in the
 offenses they are alleged to have committed."
 Detainees are sometimes held incommunicado. According to AI's
 report, "in practice, political detainees' first access to
 legal counsel has been delayed for days or even weeks at a
 time. Many individuals are arrested without being allowed to
 inform their relatives of their detention."
 Exile is forbidden by law and is not practiced. With regard
 to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Egyptian judiciary includes four types of regular courts:
 Summary Courts, Primary Courts, Appeals Courts, and the Court
 of Cassations (Supreme Court), and two kinds of special
 courts, the Court of Ethics and the State Security Courts.
 The courts are independent of the executive branch of
 government.
 The provisions in Egyptian law for public trial do not apply
 in state security cases. Persons accused of certain
 security-related offenses, which may trigger emergency law
 provisions at the Interior Ministry's discretion, are usually
 tried in public sessions in the State Security Courts. These
 Courts have less independence than other courts because their
 decisions may be challenged by the executive. However, the
 State Security Courts have procedural safeguards (including
 the right of the defendant to be represented by an attorney,
 the attorney's access to the prosecutor's investigation, and a
 prohibition against secret testimony), and their judges are
 drawn from the ranks of the senior judiciary. The judgments
 of the State Security Courts may be appealed to the Higher
 State Security Court.
 Under the emergency law, only the President may amend,
 
 
 1369
 commute, or cancel a sentence or order a retrial. The law
 also grants the President the authority to approve or reject
 all rulings of the State Security Court system. In some
 cases, the President may order defendants in state security
 cases to be tried before military courts, although the
 applicability of this provision to civilian defendants is
 repeatedly challenged on constitutional grounds. In July
 counsel for the defense challenged the original 1986 referral
 of a case involving defendants accused of burning video clubs
 to military court. The Egyptian Code of Criminal Procedures
 states that court hearings should be conducted publicly, but
 permits the Court to order part or all of the hearing to be
 conducted in secret session or to restrict access to the court
 "in order to preserve public order or morals." The court
 trying the Egypt's Revolution case has not ordered the
 hearings to be held in secret session, but has restricted
 access to the courtroom to those who have obtained special
 permits from the court. The proceedings have been covered
 thoroughly in the press.
 No reliable statistics exist on the number of political
 prisoners. Opponents of the regime are not arrested for
 criticizing government leaders or policies. The Interior
 Ministry has drawn a distinction between indoor opposition
 meetings, rallies, and discussions, which are tolerated, and
 public demonstrations, which are not. For the most part,
 those tried and convicted for their political activities have
 been members of groups advocating the violent overthrow of the
 regime, but many people have been detained for questioning
 under the emergency law for varying periods without ever
 coming to trial.
 The High Judicial Council is empowered to override decisions
 by the Ministry of Justice regarding judicial appointments,
 promotions, and other personnel matters. The Council of
 State, a court system having jurisdiction over disputes
 between private citizens and government agencies, is
 independent of the Ministry of Justice and is effectively
 safeguarded against arbitrary dismissal of its members.
 In August the Higher State Security Court ordered the release
 of 50-odd members of an Islamic organization accused of
 inciting religious strife and trying to undermine government
 authority. In September several persons charged with being
 members of a "Communist Worker's Party" were released on their
 own recognizance after several days of detention.
 Two judicial institutions sometimes criticized by the
 opposition as superfluous and potentially dangerous to the
 judicial system are the Court of Ethics and its investigating
 agency, the Office of the Socialist Prosecutor. Created in
 1980, while Sadat was seeking to counter public criticism of
 widespread corruption in government, the Court is charged with
 trying offenders of "Socialist values," meaning investigations
 of allegations of corruption and illegal business activities.
 The other tasks of the Office of the Socialist Prosecutor
 include approving candidates for elective positions in the
 trade union movement, professional syndicates, and local
 government councils, as well as performing security checks on
 appointees to senior government positions. The Socialist
 Prosecutor may impose travel bans on officials under
 investigation. The Socialist Prosecutor and Court of Ethics
 were involved in a number of recent cases, including those
 involving Islamic investment companies. The Socialist
 Prosecutor referred 13 Islamic investment companies to the
 
 
 1370
 Financial and Commercial Affairs Prosecutor, and the Court of
 Ethics placed the money of some Islamic investment company
 owners under sequestration.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary
 interference in private life by the State or by political
 organizations, but this freedom is significantly abridged in
 cases under the emergency law. Ordinarily, police must obtain
 a warrant from the Public Prosecutor before undertaking
 arrests, searches, or seizures. On occasion the courts have
 dismissed cases when they determined warrants were issued
 without sufficient cause. Police officials who conduct
 searches without proper warrants are subject to criminal
 penalties. However, the emergency law empowers the President,
 or the Minister of the Interior acting as his deputy, to
 authorize searches of persons or premises without following'
 normal procedures. The internal security services have the
 capability to monitor telephone and other private
 conversations of the political opposition and a broad range of
 citizens suspected of illegal or subversive activity. There
 are persistent and credible reports of routine screening of,
 and in some cases interference with, correspondence and
 especially international mail. As with search warrants,
 telephone taps and mail screening normally require the prior
 authorization of the Public Prosecutor, but normal procedures
 do not prevail when the emergency law is invoked. GDSSI and
 the other domestic intelligence agencies engage routinely in
 surveillance of opposition politicians, political or social
 activists, foreign diplomats, and suspected subversives.
 Employees of most government facilities, public sector
 factories, and foreign embassies presume that their activities
 are monitored by government informants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the
 press, and in general the Government has provided press
 freedom and resisted curbs on political expression. Egyptians
 openly express their views without fear of retribution on a
 wide variety of political and social issues, sometimes airing
 vigorous criticism of the Government. A lively debate of
 national issues and criticism of government officials is
 evident in the media and the theater. Much commentary
 reflecting differences of opinion appears regularly in the
 major government-owned dailies and magazines. Radio and
 television are state owned and all broadcasts are closely
 supervised by the Government. National newspapers are
 corporately independent and therefore less controlled, but
 they still essentially answer to the Government.
 The oppbsition papers are free to publish stories supporting
 the political inclinations of their sponsoring organizations.
 Journalists and other persons slandered or maligned in the
 press may sue in court or, in the case of journalists, raise
 the matter with the press syndicate. By virtue of their
 positions, the President and members of the People's Assembly
 and the Shura Council may not sue for libel. There have been
 repeated moves to strip opposition Members of Parliament of
 their parliamentary immunity so that they could be sued for
 articles appearing in their parties' newspapers.
 
 
 1371
 The Government occasionally exercises influence on the
 national dailies and magazines, the editors in chief of which
 are appointed by the presidency and can be dismissed by the
 NDP-dominated Shura Council. The Council supervises the press
 to some extent through the Higher Press Council, a 45-member
 body chaired by the Speaker of the Shura Council and composed
 of senior press figures. One of the Higher Press Council's
 functions is to approve applications for new publications. No
 applications to publish independently owned journals were
 approved in 1989. The Council's approval, however, is only
 required for publications appearing regularly.
 There is no overt censorship, with the exception of press bans
 occasionally imposed by the State Security Prosecutor on
 stories which might affect the course of investigations under
 way in State Security Court cases. In September allegations
 that suspected Communists arrested in August were tortured
 while detained were aired extensively in the opposition
 press. Nevertheless, journalists and editors working for the
 government-supported newspapers are sometimes given guidance
 by officials about the treatment of specific issues. This
 guidance is given informally to senior editors and board
 chairmen by senior officials such as the Information
 Minister. This does not happen routinely; usually the editors
 know the policy and are aware of the limits which they are
 expected to observe. Opposition press coverage of the arrests
 of Islamic extremists and suspected Communists, strikes, and
 public demonstrations was not censored.
 In August 1988, the Government closed down the Nasserist
 opposition newspaper Sawt al-Arab following a controversial
 attack by the paper's editor on the Saudi ruling family. That
 was the only instance of government action to silence an
 opposition newspaper in recent years. Supporters of the
 newspaper lost an appeal in 1989 to resume publication in
 Egypt and are publishing Sawt al-Arab abroad.
 The universities enjoy a considerable degree of academic
 freedom. In the past, faculty clubs at several universities,
 especially the Universities of Alexandria and Assiut, have
 held political discussions which led to friction with the
 Minister of Interior and threats to dissolve the clubs.
 Faculty members are more likely to feel social pressure to
 conform than any actual interference in their publications or
 research. Controversial books by Egyptian authors are
 published freely in Egypt but are sometimes banned from
 overseas distribution by the Government. A wide variety of
 foreign reading matter in Arabic and other languages is
 available at newsstands and major hotels, although there are
 isolated reports of the seizure or censorship of foreign
 publications.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Under the emergency law, the Government can and does place
 limitations on the constitutionally assured right of
 assembly.
 Permission is required from the Ministry of Interior to hold
 public meetings, mass political rallies, and protest marches.
 In September the Governor of Ismailiyya banned a meeting of
 the Lawyer's Syndicate during which arbitrary arrest, torture,
 and human rights abuses were to be featured as topics. Also
 in September, security forces arrested several Islamic
 activists who participated in a press conference sponsored by
 
 
 1372
 the Physicians' Syndicate to denounce arrests and alleged
 torture ordered by the Interior Ministry. In October the
 Ministry is reported to have acted to prevent the holding of a
 seminar, sponsored by the Islamist-dominated Engineers,
 Syndicate, intended to promote a campaign against torture.
 Generally, however, the Minister of Interior permits protest
 rallies on the campuses and at the facilities of professional
 associations, particularly the Bar Association. Street
 demonstrations, however, have been banned on the grounds that
 they are a likely source of violent disturbances. Islamic
 organizations are permitted to organize public religious
 ceremonies, often attended by tens of thousands of people, on
 major holidays, but persons regarded as Islamic radicals may
 still be denied permission to organize public assemblies.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 According to the Constitution, Egypt is an Islamic state which
 provides for freedom of religious expression and equality
 before the law, regardless of religion. Egypt has a tradition
 of religious tolerance, and, with some notable exceptions, the
 authorities generally uphold the rights of religious
 minorities and the rights of individuals to practice their
 religion. In accordance with Islamic law, only Islam,
 Judaism, and Christianity are fully recognized as religions
 with laws, traditions, and rites which must be respected. The
 overwhelming majority of Egyptians practice Sunni Islam or
 Coptic Christianity.
 Coptic Orthodox Christians, the most significant religious
 minority, may constitute 10 percent of the population,
 although their numbers are a subject of controversy.
 Coptic-Muslim relations continued to be generally good in
 1989, with no increase in incidents of sectarian violence from
 the level of 1988.
 While most Egyptian Jews emigrated in the 1950's and 1960's,
 those few who remain appear to practice their faith without
 restriction or harassment.
 Various Protestant denominations operate, some with
 significant Egyptian membership, while others have a small,
 largely expatriate following. Members of recognized religions
 may maintain links with coreligionists abroad. Other small
 religious groups continue to face difficulties.
 Significant problems are encountered by those who convert from
 Islam to Christianity. Christian missionaries who engage in
 proselytizing Muslim Egyptians may be prosecuted under the
 penal code or under the broad terms of the Law of National
 Unity, even though missionary work is not specifically
 banned. This represents a major departure from the
 traditi'onal Islamic practice in which proselytizing Muslims
 would be considered a capital offense. Conversion from Islam,
 while officially not restricted or penalized, is discouraged
 by the Government, and even more so by social pressure. In a
 number of cases involving converts from Islam, the security
 authorities have used the state of emergency legislation to
 arrest and detain converts, without bringing specific charges,
 on the grounds that converts threaten social peace and
 intercommunal relations. Those who convert cannot have the
 religion category changed on their national identity cards or
 
 
 1373
 EGYPT
 other legal documentation.
 All recognized faiths can, in principle, establish places of
 worship, run schools, and train enough clergy to serve
 believers. Synagogues and churches routinely receive police
 protection. Under a law dating back to the Ottoman era,
 however, non-Muslims must obtain a series of permits
 culminating in a presidential decree to build or repair places
 of worship. Obtaining authorization can take years and is
 often not granted. *This is a point of contention, especially
 among Coptic Christians.
 Egyptian law prohibits the use of places of worship to
 criticize the State. The courts have not yet ruled on a
 challenge to the constitutionality of this restriction.
 Although the Government maintains that sermons by Islamic and
 Coptic religious figures are not censored, Muslim prayer
 leaders are occasionally detained and questioned for
 delivering allegedly inflammatory sermons in their mosques.
 The Ministry of Religious Endowments has also been known to
 substitute its prayer leaders at mosques for preachers it
 regards as troublesome, as well as to take over the
 administration of some privately run mosques considered to be
 centers of antigovernment activity.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Egyptians are free to move within Egypt, except in
 well-defined military districts; there are additional
 restricted areas to which foreigners may not travel.
 Exceptions to freedom of foreign travel and emigration apply
 to males who have not completed compulsory military service,
 unmarried women under 21 or married women who must obtain
 their father's or husband's permission to obtain a passport,
 and persons under investigation for criminal offenses or whose
 travel is banned by emergency law provisions. Citizens who
 leave the country have the right to return. There are no
 known cases of citizenship being revoked for political
 reasons. Under the state of emergency, the Prime Minister has
 authority, which he may delegate to the Interior Minister, to
 restrict foreign or domestic travel. The total number of
 persons denied the right to travel abroad is relatively small,
 and travel bans are generally applied according to normal
 legal procedures.
 Egypt's record on granting political asylum generally has been
 good, and the extradition of those granted political asylum is
 prohibited by the Constitution. Several thousand non-Egyptian
 Arabs residing in Egypt, including many Libyan dissidents,
 have been granted political asylum. Egypt also allows the
 children of some African refugees awaiting resettlement to
 study in Egyptian schools and grants residence to a number of
 elderly persons who have remained stateless since the Second
 World War.
 Although there were two well publicized cases of deportation
 in 1988, there were no known deportations in 1989.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Although the right exists theoretically, as a practical matter
 citizens do not have the ability.to change the government by
 democratic means. Since the 1952 revolution, Egypt has had a
 
 
 1374
 political system characterized by a strong presidency. Four
 former military officers, including Mubarak, have served as
 president in that period, but civilian government has become
 increasingly separated from military influence. Nasser ruled
 a one-party state, Sadat created an embryonic multiparty
 system, and Mubarak has liberalized the political atmosphere
 by expanding the range of legal opposition activities. While
 Nubarak's National Democratic Party (NDP) dominates the
 political scene, there are now five legal opposition parties
 which are allowed to organize, hold rallies, publish their
 views, and enter candidates for election to the People's
 Assembly, the Shura Council, and local councils. Still, the
 political process remains significantly restricted, and in
 1989 there was some slowing of the general trend of the last
 several years toward increasing political liberties and a
 widening scope for legal opposition participation in the
 political system.
 The NDP is a nonideological party which groups together a
 range of political camps, some of which support the statist
 and Arab nationalist policies promoted by former President
 Nasser, while others support the more liberal economic and
 pro-Western foreign policies promoted by Sadat. Still others
 are Mubarak supporters of little fixed ideological
 commitment. It has a dominant role in most party-based
 institutions in the country. It holds almost every seat in
 the Shura Council, as well as virtually all the seats in the
 1,300 local popular councils across the country.
 According to the Constitution, the President is elected by the
 People's Assembly; his election is then ratified by popular
 referendum. Both of President Mubarak's elections to 6-year
 terms of office, most recently in 1987, followed these
 constitutional provisions. These procedures, in principle,
 allow the Egyptian people to exercise their right to change
 their government. The opposition argues that the Constitution
 should be amended to allow for direct popular election of the
 President. President Mubarak has countered that he is
 "administering democracy by doses" and that the public is not
 prepared for full democracy.
 The People's Assembly comprises 458 members, of whom 448 are
 elected. The remaining 10 are appointed by the President.
 The Constitution reserves half of the elected seats for worker
 and farmer deputies. In the 1987 elections, the NDP won 348
 seats, plus the 10 appointed seats. The two principal
 opposition groups, the Socialist Labor Party (in alliance with
 the Muslim Brotherhood) and the New Wafd, won 56 and 25 seats
 respectively. The Assembly debates and passes laws and must
 approve the Government's general policies and civilian
 budget. The military budget is not subject to parliamentary
 review. Assembly members can and do, however, call for
 parliamentary investigations and interpellate ministers. This
 often vigorous questioning is broadcast on television and
 covered in the press.
 The opposition parties continue to make credible complaints
 about electoral fraud by the Government and about the method
 of calculating election results used by the Ministry of
 Interior. NDP candidates won all of the elected seats in the
 June Shura Council elections and a September by-election in
 Port Said. The 1987 postelection ruling by the State Council
 Administrative Court that the NDP should give up 39 seats to
 the Wafd and the Islamic alliance was never implemented. The
 ruling remains under discussion in both the State Council and
 
 
 1375
 Constitutional Court systems.
 The opposition parties and some within the NDP and government
 leadership also object to the "party list system" used to
 calculate election results in the People's Assembly, arguing
 that direct election of individual candidates is fairer to
 smaller parties than is proportional representation and would
 assure better qualified candidates and popular participation.
 However, the outcome of the Shura Council elections, which
 were contested on an individual basis, have tended to focus
 debate on the larger issue of electoral fairness. Some regime
 critics argue that the political system is designed to ensure
 that the NDP and the Government retain control of all state
 institutions. Government supporters argue, however, that
 President Hubarak has firmly established at least an
 elementary multiparty system in order to create checks and
 balances and give expression to a broad range of political
 views.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not responded to most of the queries from
 Amnesty International and other international groups about
 human rights concerns. However, in 1988 it received two AI
 delegations, including one headed by the organization's
 Secretary General, to discuss human rights. These visits
 resulted in a report submitted to the Government which
 included a number of recommendations (June 1988). The
 Government provided some preliminary comments in response.
 Human rights groups in Egypt continue actively to promote
 domestic and foreign human rights issues, even though they
 have not been accorded official recognition by the
 Government. The Egyptian Chapter of the Arab Organization for
 Human Rights (AOHR), which has been active for several years,
 was denied permission by the Social Affairs Ministry to
 establish itself as a legally recognized organization on the
 grounds that its activities were political in nature. Local
 human rights observers believe the Interior Ministry detained
 and reportedly tortured four persons in late August because of
 their activities as members of the Egyptian'Organization for
 Human Rights. The Government has also denied recognition to
 the larger AOHR and refused permission for the establishment
 of a local chapter of AI. Nevertheless, the AOHR continues to
 maintain regional offices in Cairo and publishes its
 newsletters and annual review of the human rights situation in
 the Arab world without interference.
 The AOHR has sought and been denied access to prison
 facilities to inspect conditions and meet with prisoners.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 -Egyptian law provides for equality of the sexes, but aspects
 of the law and many traditional practices are discriminatory
 against women. Marriage and personal status are primarily
 based on the religious law of the individual concerned, which
 for most Egyptians is Islamic law. Under Egyptian law a
 married woman must have her husband's permission-to obtain a
 passport, and he may stop her from traveling for any reason.
 A child must have his or her father's permission to obtain a
 passport, and even if the parents are divorced and the mother
 
 
 1376
 
 has custody, the child's mother need not be informed if the
 child obtains a passport or travels outside of Egypt.
 The Revised Family Status Law, enacted in July 1985 to replace
 a 1979 law declared unconstitutional by the Supreme
 Constitutional Court, amplified the legal basis for equality
 of the sexes beyond rights contained in Islamic law. It
 largely ensures a woman's right to divorce and preserves the
 wife's child custody and property rights. A second marriage
 by the husband (multiple marriage for men is acceptable
 practice in Islam) is grounds for the first wife to divorce,
 if-it is shown that the marriage had caused her material
 psychological harm, or if the husband fails to declare such
 subsequent marriages. A wife has the option of retaining the
 family residence or receiving financial compensation. These
 aspects of the family status law only apply to Muslims.
 Christians do not practice plural marriage, and the Coptic
 Church permits divorce only in unusual circumstances.
 Under Islamic law, which is applied in personal status
 matters, female heirs are entitled to one-half the amount of
 inheritance that male heirs can receive. However, only male
 heirs have a duty to provide for all the members of the family
 who need assistance.
 Economic necessity as well as changing attitudes are drawing
 more and more women into the work force. They are
 increasingly well represented in medicine, law,. and
 education. Within more traditional communities, prevailing
 cultural values make it more difficult for women to work
 outside the home. Some jobs are advertised for males only.
 Despite the legal stipulation of equality, women living in
 more traditional areas occupy a subordinate and dependent role
 in the household. Women's rights advocates also note that
 some traditional attitudes and practices--particularly female
 circumcision, Islamic legal attitudes toward divorce and
 plural marriage, and the male relatives' responsibility to
 punish even to the point of death their female relatives who
 bring dishonor to the family by actual or presumed violation
 of the strict traditional code of sexual conduct--are highly
 discriminatory toward women. Some of these acts are illegal.
 Most of these traditional practices are disappearing from the
 cities but are still practiced to varying degrees in the
 countryside. Although violence against women is known to
 occur, little is known about its extent. There are no
 reliable statistics on the subject. Abuse within the family,
 such as wife beating, is seldom discussed publicly owing to
 the value attached to privacy in family matters in this
 traditional society.
 Reliable statistics are not available for female circumcision
 in Egypt. While it is not against Egyptian law, the law
 prohibits doctors from performing it in government hospitals.
 One doctor who has done extensive research on this subject
 maintaifs 80 per cent of women in Egypt's rural areas receive
 the milder form of excision/circumcision, although in parts of
 Upper Egypt the more drastic infibulation is practiced. In
 the larger cities the rate decreases to 50 percent in the less
 educated classes and almost zero in the middle and upper
 classes.
 Coptic Christians work in all career fields, occupying many
 leadership positions in the business and professional
 communities. Copts continue to enjoy access to public
 
 
 1377
 employment, although there appears to be some discrimination
 against young Copts seeking to obtain employment in the
 government or public sectors. Coptic representation at the
 highest levels of government increased slightly in 1987--from
 2 to 3 of the total of 33 cabinet ministers and from 9 to 11
 of 458 People's Assembly deputies--following the People's
 Assembly elections and a minor cabinet reshuffle. Copts
 seldom advance to the senior ranks of the military (there are
 no Coptic generals), security, or diplomatic services, nor are
 there any serving Coptic governors (26 states) or security
 directors of governorates.
 Some Copts allege that they are discriminated against in
 admissions to some fields of medical study, particularly
 obstetrics and gynecology. Islamic activists have objected to
 the prevalence of Copts in the medical and pharmacological
 professions, arguing that Muslim women should not be treated
 by Coptic doctors or go to Coptic pharmacists. There are also
 reports that universities have effectively blocked Coptic
 professors from becoming administrators and chairmen of
 certain departments. Copts note that Arabic language classes
 use the Koran as the major text.
 Although religious minorities face social prejudice and
 individual acts of discrimination from some Muslims, there is
 no evidence that these acts are officially inspired or
 condoned. President Mubarak has emphasized publicly the full
 equality of Copts and other religious minorities. The courts'
 application of Islamic law to personal status matters among
 Muslims, and the Islamic influences elsewhere in the legal
 system, have not affected the constitutionally assured
 freedoms of Copts and other minorities. Coptic observers have
 alleged that it is Islamic fundamentalists who contribute most
 heavily to the discrimination experienced by the Copts, but
 that government officials, reluctant to antagonize the
 fundamentalists, fail to rectify situations created by their
 anti-Coptic actions.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The law provides for the workers' right to join local
 committees of workers. About 20 to 25 percent of the work
 force is unionized. Any establishment employing 50 or more
 workers must allow them the right to organize a local
 committee if the workers so desire. These locals are
 affiliated with national trade unions, organized along
 sectoral lines, all 23 of which are required to affiliate with
 the single labor federation, the Egyptian Trade Union
 Federation (ETUF). There have been complaints to the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) that requiring all
 national trade unions to join a single federation infringes
 upon workers' freedom of association. In its 1989 report, the
 ILO Committee of Experts (COE) again asserted that the law
 institulionalizes a single trade union system, contrary to
 Convention 87 on Freedom of Association. The Government has
 shown no sign that it intends to accept the establishment of
 more than one federation. The leadership of. the Federation
 asserts that it actively promotes workers' interests and that
 there is no need for another federation.
 ETUF is a member of The Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity and was readmitted to the International Confederation of
 Arab Trade Unions in March (from which it was expelled in
 
 
 1378
 1978). ETUF sends observer delegations to International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions' and World Federation of
 Trade Unions' conferences, but, in an effort to maintain its
 nonaligned status, has not joined either one.
 The ETUF is dominated by the NDP and therefore works, at the
 least, in close concert with the Government. The ETUF, which
 has a pyramidal structure, holds its elections periodically,
 with each level electing the leadership of the next level.
 Candidates for offices are approved by the Office of the
 Socialist Prosecutor. A council of national union presidents
 elects the ETUF Council, whic in turn elects the President of
 the Federation from among its ranks. The trade union movement
 takes pride in the relative independence of its electoral
 procedures; a large number of union presidents were not
 reelected in 1987. The person and property of union leaders
 are not threatened by the Government or nongovernmental
 antiunion forces. The 1989 report of the ILO COE, while
 noting some positive developments, repeated its request that
 the Government not interfere in the internal affairs of the
 unions and allow these matters to be determined by union rules.
 The labor law provides for a system of arbitration to resolve
 dispute~s about wages and working condition. While the labor
 law and labor unions are silent on the right to strike, the
 larger body of Egyptian law, in fact, restricts workers' right
 to strike. The Criminal Code provides criminal penalties of
 up to 2 years in jail for civil servants or public sector
 employees who strike and more severe penalties for those who
 incite others to strike. The National Security and Unity Law
 of 1977 punish workers by hard labor if they participate in a
 strike that "constitutes a threat to the national economy-or
 in a gathering or sit-in that "endangers the public peace."
 The Government has occasionally reacted harshly to strikes in
 the public sector. In August the security forces allegedly
 beat and detained hundreds of workers who participated in a
 strike at the Helwan Iron and Steel Complex. One worker was
 killed. Detainees subsequently complained of mistreatment and
 torture while held in prison.
 The strongest antistrike provision is contained in the Law of
 National Unity which prohibits strikes that threaten the
 national economy. The full implications of this law are not
 yet clear. In 1987 the State Security Court ruled in the case
 of a 1986 train conductors' strike that the Government is
 obligated as a signatory to the International Covenant on
 Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights to allow workers the
 right to strike peacefully. However, a presidential review
 panel refused to accept the Court's decision, and the issue
 remains unresolved. In August participants in the strike at
 the Helwan Iron and Steel Complex were arrested under the same
 law. The 1989 report of the ILO COE called on the Government
 to bring its legislation into conformance with Convention 87
 by eliminating the existing broad restrictions on the right to
 strike.
 b.- The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The law provides for the workers' right to organize.
 Establishments employing 50 or more workers must allow them to
 organize a local committee. Collective bargaining is
 permitted in the private sector (including in export
 processing zones) but not in the public sector where most
 union members are employed. For the most part, private sector
 wages and benefits are higher than those in the public sector.
 
 
 1379
 Trade union leaders note that there is a distinction between
 the unions' function in negotiating with the public sector and
 the private sector. Public sector wages and benefits are set
 by law at the national level. Trade unionists point to the
 constitutional provision that half the members of the People's
 Assembly must be workers and farmers and claim that the
 struggle to protect workers' interests in the public sector
 takes place in the legislature. ETUF also says that it holds
 regular private discussions with senior government officials,
 in which the Federation promotes the interests of the
 workers. The 1989 report of the ILO COE again cited
 provisions of the Labor Code directing labor and management to
 conform to national economic interests as being at odds with
 the provisions of Convention 98 on the Right to Organize and
 Bargain Collectively.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced labor. There are no reports
 of forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age of Employment for Children
 The minimum age for employment is 12 years (which is also the
 age at which a child has completed compulsory education). The
 law permits children between the ages of 12 and 16 to work up
 to 6 hours a day with 1 hour of rest but prohibits them from
 working after 10 p.m. or from engaging in certain forms of
 dangerous or heavy labor, such as mining. There is
 considerable evidence, however, that underage children
 continue to perform full-time jobs, particularly in rural
 areas. Growing numbers of urban children are also working as
 families are forced by economic necessity to increase their
 sources of income. Newspaper articles in both the
 progovernment and opposition press have charged that several
 million children may be working full-time in violation of the
 labor law. Informal private sector workshops and cottage
 industries appear to be the main urban users of child labor.
 Representatives of both government and labor argue that such
 unregulated industries cannot be supervised. It is also the
 case, however, that larger private textile factories also
 employ large numbers of young girls, who may work up to
 12-hour shifts. No consistent attempt is made to enforce the
 law regarding child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Employers are required by law to provide acceptable terms and
 conditions of employment for their workers. Working
 conditions are discussed between union representatives and
 management in public sector companies. The minimum wage of
 approximately $10 a month is low but is part of a social
 contract which includes generous government subsidies of
 foodstuffs and other basic necessities. Within the local
 context, most workers are able to maintain a decent standard
 of living for themselves and their families. The minimum wage
 law is enforced where government labor inspectors have access,
 but there are enclaves of labor activity, especially in the
 rural areas, where government inspectors have no access. The
 regular workweek is fixed at 48 hours for factory workers.
 Many workers increase their incomes by working overtime or at
 second jobs.
 Employers are legally required to meet worker safety and
 health norms, which are modeled on the ILO's suggested
 
 
 1380
 standards. There are special provisions for women workers,
 including generous maternity leave. Employers who yiolate
 wage, hour, and safety and health provisions face civil and
 criminal penalties. Labor inspectors enforce these provisions
 with-varying degrees of success. Employers are seldom
 prosecuted, but reliable sources confirm that the courts
 occasionally impose fines on offending companies. The worst
 violators of the legal provisions on conditions of labor are
 small workshop owners in the informal sector whose operations
 are not subject to supervision or inspection.
