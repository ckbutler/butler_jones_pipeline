EGYPT
 According to its Constitution, Egypt is a social democracy in which Islam is the
 state religion. The National Democratic Party (NDP), which has governed since its
 establishment in 1978, has used its entrenched position to dominate national poli-
 tics, and it maintains an overriding majority in the popularly elected People's As-
 sembly and the partially elected Shura (Consultative) Council. President Hosni Mu-
 barak was reelected unopposed to a third 6-year term by the People's Assembly in
 1993. The Cabinet and the country's 26 governors are appointed by the President
 and may be dismissed by him at his discretion. The judiciary is independent.
 There are several security services in the Ministry of Interior, two of which are
 involved primarily in combating terrorism: The State Security Investigations Sector
 (SSIS), which conducts investigations and interrogates detainees; and the Central
 Security Force (CSF), which enforces curfews and bans on public demonstrations
 and conducts paramilitary operations against terrorists. The President is the com-
 mander-in-chief of the military; the military is a primary stabilizing factor within
 society but generally does not involve itself in internal issues. The use of violence
 by security forces in the campaign against suspected terrorists appeared more lim-
 ited than in previous years. The security forces committed numerous serious human
 rights abuses.
 Egypt is in transition from a government-controlled economy to a free market sys-
 tem. The Government continued its privatization program, although key sectors of
 the economy remain under government control. Agriculture remains the largest em-
 ployer and is almost entirely in private hands. The tourism sector generates the
 largest amount of foreign currency. Petroleum exports, Suez Canal revenues, and
 remittances from approximately 2 million Egyptians working abroad are the other
 principal sources of foreign currency. In the past 8 years, the Government has en-
 acted significant economic reforms, which have reduced the budget deficit, stabilized
 the exchange rate, reduced inflation and interest rates significantly, and built up
 substantial reserves. The success of the macroeconomic reform has resulted in an
 annual economic growth rate of 5 percent for fiscal year 1997-98. Continued
 progress in economic development depends primarily upon implementation of a wide
 range of structural reforms. The per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is about
 $1,100 per year. Official statistics place 34.4 percent of wage earners in the agricul-
 tural sector, and knowledgeable observers estimate that perhaps 3 to 5 percent of
 those engage in subsistence farming. The annual population increase is 2.1 percent
 Adult literacy rates are 63 percent for males and 34 percent for females.
 The Government continued to commit numerous serious human rights abuses, al-
 though its record improved somewhat over the previous year. The ruling NDP domi-
 nates the political scene to such an extent that citizens do not have a meaningful
 ability to change their government.
 The Emergency Law, which has been in effect since 1981, continues to restrict
 many basic rights. The security forces and terrorist groups continued to engage in
 violent exchanges. In fighting the terrorists, the security forces continued to mis-
 treat and torture prisoners, arbitrarily arrest and detain persons, hold detainees in
 prolonged pretrial detention, and occasionally engage in mass arrests. In actions un-
 related to the antiterrorist campaign, local police killed, tortured, and otherwise
 abused both criminal suspects and other persons. The Government took disciplinary
 action against police officers accused of abusing detainees, including prosecution of
 several offenders, but it did not pursue most cases or seek adequate punishments.
 Local human rights groups reported that in the course of a murder investigation in
 August and September, the police detained hundreds of citizens, including relatives
 of suspects, women, and children, in the largely Coptic Christian village of al-Kush
 in Sohag governorate. Local observers reported that dozens of these detainees were
 subjected to torture and mistreatment. In October the public prosecutor in Sohag
 charged local clergymen Bishop Wisa and Arch-Priest Antonius with witness tam-
 pering after they publicly protested the police conduct. They were questioned and
 released after each paid bail. On December 1, a state security prosecutor charged
 the secretary general of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR),
 Hafez Abu Se'da, with accepting foreign money and publishing false information
 with the intent to harm national interests. The charges were based on a report criti-
 
 
 1644
 cal of the Sohag incident published by the EOHR on September 28. Abu Se'da was
 detained for 6 days and then released on bail. A state security prosecutor also levied
 the same charges against EOHR attorney Mustafa Zidane on December 9. Zidane
 is the author of the EOHR report on the Sohag incident He was not detained but
 required to pay bail. The charges raised against Bishop Wisa, Arch-Priest Antonius,
 Abu Se'da, and Zidane have not been dropped.
 Prison conditions are poor. In a significant policy shift, the Ministry of Interior
 announced in December that it had released up to 5,000 political detainees during
 the year. The use of military courts to try civilians continued to infringe on a de-
 fendant's right to a fair trial before an independent judiciary. However, during the
 year the Government referred only one case, involving 65 civilian defendants, to the
 military court system. The Government used the Emergency Law to infringe on citi-
 zens' privacy rights. Although citizens generally express themselves freely, the Gov-
 ernment continued to place some restrictions on freedom of the press. The Govern-
 ment restricts freedom of assembly and association. Despite difficulties due to an
 inadequate legal framework and periodic government harassment, a number of local
 human rights groups are active. Although the Government does not legally recog-
 nize them, it allows these groups to operate openly. The Government places limits
 on freedom of religion.
 Women and Christians face discrimination based on tradition and some aspects
 of the law. Domestic violence against women is a problem. Terrorist violence against
 Christians is a problem. Child labor remains widespread despite government efforts
 to eradicate it. Abuse by employers continues, and the Government does not enforce
 the law effectively. Although the Government enforces the 1996 decree banning the
 practice of female genital mutilation (FGM), many families persist in subjecting
 their daughters to the traditional practice. The Government limits workers' rights.
 Terrorist groups committed numerous serious abuses. Terrorist groups seeking to
 overthrow the Government and establish a purportedly Islamic state continued their
 attacks on police and Coptic Christians. Terrorist groups were responsible for 29
 deaths throughout the year. In September Amnesty International (AI) issued a re-
 port on the impact of terrorist groups titled "Human Rights Abuses by Armed
 Groups," which covers the period 1992-1998. AI reported that armed groups in
 Egypt, particularly the Islamic Group and the Jihad Group, have been responsible
 for numerous serious abuses and have killed hundreds of civilians, including Coptic
 Christians and foreign tourists. However, the report noted that political violence ap-
 peared to have diminished considerably over the first 8 months of the year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings; however, police committed extrajudicial killings, and such killings also may
 have occurred in certain antiterrorist operations.
 On April 9, Waheed Al Sayyid Ahmad Abdallah died as a result of torture during
 interrogation by police in the village of Belqas in Mansura governorate (see Section
 1.c.). In response to Abdallah's death, the public prosecutor charged five security of-
 ficials with premeditated murder. On April 30, Mahmoud Fares died as a result of
 torture while detained at a prison in Port Said (see Section I.c.). On September 26,
 Gamal Mohammed Abdallah Mustafa died as a result of torture during an investiga-
 tion by police in the Cairo suburb of Ma'adi (see Section 1.c.). The public prosecutor
 is investigating the incident.
 Four persons died in Luxor on April 17 after security forces opened fire on a
 crowd protesting government demolition of their homes. The names of these persons
 were Mohammed Ahmad Radwan, Mohammed Ahmad Ahrya, Badawy Ahmad Al
 Bahairy, and Mohammed Mahmoud Abmad. In civil unrest related to the ongoing
 implementation of the Agrarian Reform Law, security forces killed four persons in
 ensuing clashes. According to the Land Center for Human Rights, the persons who
 died were Mohammed Ali Hemeida, Ahmed Mohammed Abdou, Sweilam Shamiya
 Mahrous, and Mohammed Mohammed Ali.
 In antiterrorist campaigns, security forces killed 18 suspected terrorists during
 raids on suspected terrorist hideouts; there were no reports of the excessive use of
 lethal force. No suspects died while attempting to escape arrest. There were no re-
 ports of killings of relatives of suspected extremists by security forces in apparent
 vendettas.
 Eleven persons died in prison, reportedly due to medical negligence by the au-
 thorities (see Section 1.c.).
 The public prosecution is investigating allegations of the use of torture by police
 that resulted in the death of a businessman in November 1997 in the governorate
 
 
 1645
 
 of Galoubiya (see Section 1.c.). In response to a 1994 charge of police torture of
 Fateh A-Bab Abdel Moneim, a court convicted the defendant to 1-year's imprison-
 ment in January. The officer is appealing the verdict. According to the Egyptian Or-
 ganization for Human Rights (EOHR), the prosecution dropped the case against a
 police officer charged with the 1995 torture of Gamal El-Shazly. Reportedly, the offi-
 cer was subjected to an internal reprimand and transferred.
 Terrorist groups were responsible for the majority of the deaths in civil unrest.
 They killed 29 persons, compared with 155 in 1997. This total included 11 police
 and security officers and 18 civilians, including 8 Coptic Christians.
 On February 1, the Government executed four members of the Islamic Group who
 were sentenced to death by a military court in 1997 for killing a state security offi-
 cer in Giza in 1993, and for bombing nine banks in Cairo and Giza in 1993 and
 1994. On June 10 the Government executed two members of the Islamic Group sen-
 tenced to death by a state security court in 1997 for carrying out acts of terrorism
 in Sohag governorate in 1994. On May 24 the Government executed the two men
 who were sentenced to death by a military court in 1997 for carrying out a terrorist
 attack resulting in the death of nine German tourists at the Egyptian Museum in
 Cairo in September 1997. On November 25, the government executed one member
 of the Islamic Group sentenced to death by a military court in 1995 for planning
 to carry out acts of terrorism in the Khan al Khalili market of Cairo. Also on No-
 vember 25, the government executed two members of the Islamic Group, including
 local leader Gamal Abu Rawash, convicted during the year for planning to kill pub-
 lic figures (see Section i.e.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The Human Rights Center for the Assistance of Prisoners is investigating the
 cases of 19 persons who disappeared during the period between 1992 and 1996. One
 individual reported missing in 1997 by the center has been found. During the year
 the EOHR reported the disappearance of 21 persons since 1994. The EOHR suspects
 that 17 of these persons are members of the terrorist organization known as "the
 Islamic Group in Egypt." The EOHR continues to investigate nine previously re-
 ported disappearances. The EOHR has provided these names to the U.N. Committee
 on Disappearances, but the Government reportedly has denied any involvement in
 these cases, and has not responded to queries from human rights monitors regard-
 ing other outstanding cases.
 After an investigation of the case of former Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur
 Kikhiya, who disappeared from Cairo in 1993, a Cairo court on March 21 rejected
 claims of government culpabfiity in his kidnapping and execution. Kihiya's family
 sued the Government folowing reports that he had been kidnaped from Cairo by
 Libyan agents, taken to Libya, and executed there in early 1994.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits the infliction of "physical or moral harm" upon persons
 who have been arrested or detained; however, torture and abuse of detainees by po-
 lice, security personnel, and prison guards is common.
 Under the Penal Code, torture of a defendant or orders to torture are felonies
 punishable by temporary hard labor or 3 to 10 years' imprisonment. If the defendant
 dies, the crime is one of intentional murder punishable by a life sentence at hard
 labor. Arrest without due cause, threatening death, or using physical torture is pun-
 ishable by temporary hard labor. The use of cruelty against persons by relying on
 one's position is punishable by imprisonment of no more than 1 year or a fine of
 no more than $65. Victims may bring a criminal or civil action for compensation
 against the responsible government agency. There is no statute of limitations in
 such cases.
 Despite these legal safeguards, there were numerous credible reports, including
 statements by government officials, that security forces tortured and mistreated citi-
 zens. Reports of torture and mistreatment at police stations remain frequent. In De-
 cember Interior Minister Habib al Adly publicly stated that "it is no longer possible
 to disregard human rights or excuse violations under the pretext of confronting se-
 curity risks." However, Adly added that "some legitimate extraordinary measures
 initiated for the public good to address an extraordinary danger should not be de-
 scribed as a human rights violation."
 While the Government has investigated torture complaints in criminal cases and
 punished some offending officers, the punishments are not in line with the serious-
 ness of the offense. However, government officials have stated that administrative
 punishments can be severe enough to prevent further career advancement, and that
 some police officers have opted to face criminal charges instead. The Government
 has stated that it would not disclose further details of individual cases of police
 abuse for fear of harming the morale of law enforcement officers involved in
 counterterrorism operations.
 
 
 1646
 Human rights groups believe that the SSIS continues to employ torture. Torture
 takes place in SSIS offices, includingits headquarters in Cairo, and dt Central Secu-
 rity Force camps. Torture victims usually are taken to an SSIS office where they
 are handcuffed, blindfolded, and questioned about their associations, religious be-
 liefs, and political views. Torture. is used to extract information, coerce the victims
 to end their antigovernment activities, and deter others from such activities.
 Egyptian human rights groups and victims reported a number of torture methods.
 Detainees frequently are stripped; hung by their wrists with their feet touching the
 floor or forced to stand for prolonged periods; doused with hot or cold water; beaten;
 forced to stand outdoors in cold weather; and, subjected to electrical shocks. Some
 victims, including female detainees, report that they have been. threatened with
 rape._                                                           �
 While the law requires security authorities to keep written records of detained
 citizens, human rights groups report that such records often are not available, not
 found, or that the police deny any knowledge of the detainee when inquiries are
 made about specific cases, effectively blockng tha investigation of torture com-
 plaints.v
 On April 9, Waheed Al Sayyid Ahmad Abdailah died as a result of torture during
 interrogation by police in the village of Belqas in Mansura governorate (see Section
 L.a.- On April 30, Mahmoud Fares died as a result of torture while detained at a
 prison in Port Said (see Section 1.a.). On September 26, Gamal Mohammed
 Abdallah Mustafa died as a result of torture during an investigation by police in
 the Cairo suburb of Ma'adi (see Section l.a.).
 The EOHR and other groups reported that the police in the mainly Coptic Chris-
 tian Al-Kush village in Sohag governorate detained hundreds of citizens, including
 relatives of suspects, women, and children, in the largely Coptic Christian village
 of al-Kush in Sohag governorate during the investigation of the double murder of
 two Copts in August and September. Local observers reported that dozens of these
 detainees were subjected to torture and mistreatment. It is unclear whether religion
 was a factor in' the officers' actions. There are credible reports that in the course
 of the interrogations the police disparaged the religion of the detainees. However,
 most local Christian leaders and human rights activists say the incident was not
 a case of religious persecution or discrimination. They characterize it'as an example
 of systemic police brutality. However, confusion and suspicion about police motives
 remain (also see Sections 1.d. and 2.c.).
 During the year the- Government took action against several policemen charged
 with torture during interrogation, of detainees., In three separate cases a court found
 Interior Ministry officials guilty of torture and ordered compensation paid to the vic-
 tims. In a fourth case, the court acquitted the defendant. An official at the Tora
 prison complex in Cairo was suspended during an internal investigation following
 allegations that he and officials under his command beat members of the press syn-
 dicate during an August 25 visit. The public prosecution is investigating allegations
 of the use of torture by police that resulted in the death of a businessman in Novem-
 ber 1997 in the governorate of Galoubiya (see Section L.a.). In December a criminal
 court directed- the public prosecutor to investigate allegations that 13 members of
 the Alexandria police force tortured Mohammed Badr al Din Gomah during the in-
 vestigation of a 1996 murder case. Gomah had been convicted of murder and impris-
 oned because of testimony he provided while subject to torture. In the same deci-
 sion, the court ordered Gomah's release. In. separate but related action, the Interior
 Minister ordered an internal investigation of these police officers.
 Prison conditions remain poor. Government authorities reported the renovation or
 construction of 14 prisons during the past 5 years. Nonetheless, human rights
 groups report that overcrowding and unhealthy conditions continue. Cells are poorly
 ventilated, food. is inadequate in quantity and nutritional value, drinking water is
 often polluted, and medical services are insufficient. These conditions contribute to
 the spread of disease and epidemics. The use of torture and mistreatment continues
 to be common.
 During the year, the EOHR and the Human Rights Center for the Assistance of
 Prisoners issued several reports describing the inhuman conditions of 10 prisons, fo-
 cusing on inadequate medical treatment of hundreds of prisoners. The reports cover
 conditions in Abu Zaabal Industrial Prison and Leman Abu Zaabal, Al-Wadi Al-
 Jadid, Wadi Al-Natroun I and II, Damanhour, Fayoum General, -Assiyut General,
 and the prisons of the Tora complex. Human rights groups estimate that at least
 11 persons died in prison during the year and attributed these deaths to medical
 negligence by prison authorities. The names of these persons were Hassouna Gaber
 Abdel Latef, Magdi Mohammed Abdul Maqsoud Afi, Sa'eed Mohammed Moham-
 med Al-Melegi, Abdul Aziz Abdul Wahid Abdalla, Abu Bakr Sa'ad Mahnoud,
 Hamid Fathi Abdul Aziz, Ali Abdel Nasser, Fathi Ali Orman, Fathi Abdel-Aziz
 
 
 1647
 Ibrahim, Sa'eed Eid Mohammed Eid Adam, and Mahmoud Nour Eddine. The
 human rights groups continued to investigate these deaths. However, The EOHR re-
 ported that the Ministry of Health inoculated the inmates of Damanhour prison in
 May following a prisoner's death from meningitis.
 Relatives and lawyers often are unable to obtain access to prisons for visits. Pris-
 ons in Abu Zaabal, Tora, and Al Fayoum remain closed to visits. Since 1994 there
 have been seven court orders directing the Interior Ministry to open these prisons
 for visits. However, human rights groups report that visits have been refused at sev-
 eral prisons. At others restrictions have been p laced on visits to prisoners incarcer-
 ated for political or terrorist crimes, limiting the number of visits allowed each pris-
 oner, and the total number of visitors allowed in the prison at any one time.
 In principle, human rights monitors are allowed to visit prisoners in their capacity
 as legal counsel, but in practice they often face considerable bureaucratic obstacles
 that prevent them from meeting with prisoners. The Government does not permit
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-As part of the Government's antiterrorist
 campaign, security forces have conducted mass arrests and detained hundreds of in-
 dividuals without charge. Police also at times arbitrarily detained persons. Under
 the provisions of the Emergency Law, which has been in effect since 1981, the police
 may obtain an arrest warrant from the Ministry of Interior upon showing that an
 individual poses a danger to security and public order. This procedure nullifies the
 constitutional requirement of obtaining a warrant from a judge or prosecutor upon
 showing that an individual likely has committed a specific crime.
 The Emergency Law allows authorities to detain an individual without charge.
 After 30 days, a detainee has the right to demand a court hearing to challenge the
 legality of the detention order and may resubmit his motion for a hearing at 1-
 month intervals thereafter. There is no maximum limit to the length of detention
 if the judge continues to uphold the legality of the detention order, or if the detainee
 fails to exercise his right to a hearing.
 In addition to the Emergency Law, the Penal Code also gives the state wide de-
 tention powers. Under the Penal Code, prosecutors must bring charges within 48
 hours or release the suspect. However, they may detain a suspect for a maximum
 of 6 months, pending investigation. Arrests under the Penal Code occur openly and
 with warrants issued by a district prosecutor or judge. There is a system of bail.
 The Penal Code contains several provisions to combat extremist violence. These pro-
 visions broadly define terrorism to include the acts of "spreading panic" and "ob-
 structing the work of authorities."
 During the year security forces and police arrested 62 persons allegedly associated
 with the terrorist organizations known as The Islamic Group in Egypt and The
 Jihad Group in Egypt. Security forces also arrested 24 persons suspected of belong-
 ing to the nonviolent, Islamic fundamentalist group Qutbiyyoun. During the year
 they arrested a total of 75 persons allegedly associated with the Muslim Brother-
 hood (an Islamist opposition organization). Eight of these persons reportedly were
 released later. In April state security forces reportedly arrested 30 members, includ-
 ing the leader, of a cult-like Islamic group associated with the Al Tableegh Wal
 Daa'wa (Withdrawal Movement). In April the Interior Ministry announced that
 these detainees would be referred to Al Azhar University for reeducation on the cor-
 rect interpretation of Islam.
 Local human rights groups reported that in the course of a murder investigation
 in August and September, the police detained hundreds of citizens, including rel-
 atives of suspects, women, and children, in the largely Coptic Christian village of
 al-Kush in Sohag governorate. Local observers reported that dozens of these detain-
 ees were subjected to torture and mistreatment.
 On December 1, a state security prosecutor detained EOHR secretary-general
 Hafez Abu Se'da and charged him with violating two articles of the Criminal Code.
 The prosecutor acted in response to allegations that Abu Se'da had received bribes
 from a foreign country to spread reports of discrimination against Coptic Christians.
 The charges raised by the state security prosecutor followed publication of an EOHR
 report critical of police conduct in Sohag (see Sections 1.c., 2.a., and 2.c.). Abu Se'da
 was released from detention on December 6 after paying bail. However, the charges
 raised against him have not been dropped.
 Human rights groups reported that hundreds, and according to one report, thou-
 sands, of persons detained under the Emergency Law have been incarcerated for
 several years without charge. The courts have ordered the release of several of these
 detainees, but prison officials reportedly have ignored the orders. The Ministry of
 Interior frequently reissues detention orders to send detainees back to prison. One
 such detainee, Abdel Moneim Gamal Eddine, went on a hunger strike in May to pro-
 test his detention. He was transferred in June from Al-Wadi Al-Jadid prison in the
 
 
 1648
 New Valey to the hospital in the Tora prison -complex in Cairo. During the year,
 the Government released and then rearrested some of the 31 persons convicted in
 1995 and given a 3-year sentence for association with the Muslim Brotherhood.
 In December the government reported that during the year it had released 5,000
 political detainees, whom the government described as "repentant extremists."
 Human Rights groups reported that the government released an estimated one to
 three thousand political detainees. The Government also released an additional
 2,300 prisoners who had been convicted of ordinary crimes and were serving sen-
 tences. These prisoners were released on October 6 to commemorate the 25th anni-
 versary of the October 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Neither the Government nor human
 rights groups were able to provide firm figures for the total prison population. How-
 ever, following the 1998 release, one human rights group estimated that there are
 10,000 prisoners who are registered and serving sentences and an additional 13,000
 political detainees.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of FairPublic Trial.-The. judiciary is independent; however, cases in-
 volving national security or terrorism- may be handled by military or State Security
 Emergency courts, in which constitutional -protections may not be observed. The
 Constitution provides for the independence and immunity of judges and forbids in-
 terference by other authorities in the exercise of their judicial functions. The Presi-
 dent appoints all judges upon recommendation of the Higher Judicial Council, a con-
 stitutional body composed of senior judges, and chaired by the President of the
 Court of Cassation. The Council regulates judicial promotions and transfers. In the
 last few years, the Government has added lectures on human rights and other social
 issues to its training courses for prosecutors and judges.
 There are three levels of regular criminal courts: Primary courts, appeals courts,
 and the Court of Cassation, the final stage of criminal appeal. The judicial system
 is based on the Napoleonic tradition; hence, there are no juries. Misdemeanors that
 are punishable by imprisonment are heard at the first level by one judge; at the
 second level by three judges. Felonies that are punishable by imprisonment or exe-
 cution are heard in -criminal court by three judges. Contestations of rulings are
 heard by the Court of Cassation.
 A lawyer is appointed at the court's expense if the defendant does not have one.
 The appointment of lawyers is based on a roster chosen by the Bar Association;
 however, expenses are incurred by the state. Any denial of this right is cause for
 contestation of the ruling. However, detainees in certain high security prisons al-
 leged that they were denied access to counsel or that such access was delayed until
 trial, thus denying counsel the time to prepare an adequate defense. A woman's tes-
 timony is equal to that of a man's in court. There is no legal prohibition against
 a woman serving as a judge, although in practice no women serve as judges (see
 Section 5).
 Defense lawyers generally agree that the regular judiciary respects the rights of
 the accused and exercises its independence. In the past, criminal court judges have
 dismissed cases where confessions were obtained by coercion. However, while the ju-
 diciary generally is credited with conducting fair trials, under the-Emergency Law,
 cases involving terrorism and national security may be tried in military or State Se-
 curity Emergency courts, in which the accused do not receive all the constitutional
 protections of the civilian judicial system.
 In 1992 following a rise in extremist violence, the Government began trying cases
 of persons accused of terrorism and membership in terrorist groups before military
 tribunals. In 1993 the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled that the President may
 invoke the Emergency Law to refer any crime to a military court. This use of mili-
 tary and State Security Emergency courts under the Emergency Law has deprived
 hundreds of civilian defendants of their constitutional right to be tried by an ordi-
 nary judge.
 The Government defends the use of military courts as necessary in terrorism
 cases, maintaining that trials in the civilian courts are protracted and that civilian
 judges and their families are vulnerable to terrorist threats. Some civilian judges
 have confirmed their fear of trying high visibility terrorism cases because of possible
 reprisal. The Government claims that civilian defendants receive fair trials in the
 military courts and enjoy the same rights as defendants in civilian courts.
 However, the military courts do not ensure civilian defendants due process before
 an independent tribunal. While military judges are lawyers, they are also military
 officers appointed by the Minister of Defense and subject to military discipline. They
 are not as independent or as qualified as civilian judges in applying the civilian
 Penal Code. There is no appellate process for verdicts issued by military courts; in-
 stead, verdicts are subject to a review by other military judges and confirmation by
 the President, who in practice usually delegates the review function to a senior mili-
 
 
 1649
 tary officer. Defense attorneys have complained that they have not been given suffi-
 cient time to prepare defenses and that judges tend to rush cases with many defend-
 ants.
 During the year, the Government referred 65 civilian defendants to the military
 courts in the case named after Gamal Abu Rawash, a leader of the Islamic Group.
 The defendants, including four lawyers who previously had defended members of
 the Islamic group, were charged with planning in 1995 to kill the President of Cairo
 University, presidential advisor Osama Al Baz, and the head of the cabinet,
 Zakariya Azmy. On February 1, the court acquitted 32 persons, sentenced 2 to
 death (including Abu Rawash), I to life imprisonment, and the remaining 30 to pris-
 on sentences varying from 3 to 15 years.
 The State Security Emergency courts share jurisdiction with military courts over
 crimes affecting national security. The President appoints judges to these courts
 from the civilian judiciary upon the recommendation of the Minister of Justice and,
 if he chooses to appoint military judges, the Minister of Defense. Sentences are sub-
 ject to confirmation by the President but cannot be appealed. The President may
 alter or annul a decision of a State Security Emergency court, including a decision
 to release a defendant
 During the year, the State Security Emergency courts issued judgments in 5 cases
 involving 129 defendants who were charged with terrorist acts.
 There are no reliable statistics on the numbers of political prisoners, but the total
 may approach 100; observers estimate that the number of political detainees may
 be in the thousands (see Section 1.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the Constitution, homes, correspondence, telephone calls, and other means of com-
 munication "shall have their own sanctity, and their secrecy shall be guaranteed."
 Police must obtain warrants before undertaking searches and wiretaps. Courts have
 dismissed cases in which warrants were issued without sufficient cause. Police offi-
 cers who conduct searches without proper warrants are subject to criminal pen-
 alties, although these are seldom imposed.
 However, the Emergency Law has abridged the constitutional provisions regard-
 ing the right to privacy. The Emergency Law empowers the Government to place
 wiretaps, intercept mail, and search persons or places without warrants. Security
 agencies frequently place political activists, suspected subversives, journalists, for-
 eigners, and writers under surveillance, screen their correspondence (especially
 international mail), search them and their homes, and confiscate personal property.
 The Ministry of Interior has the authority to stop specific issues of foreign-pub-
 lished newspapers from entering the country on the grounds of protecting public
 order, it exercises this authority sporadically (also see Section 2.a.). In April the In-
 terior Ministry announced that 30 detainees associated with a cult-like Islamic
 group would be referred to Al Azhar University for spiritual "re-education" (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.).
 In August and September, during a murder investigation in al-Kush village in
 Sohag governorate, police detained relatives of suspects, women, and children. Local
 human rights groups reported that some of these relatives were also subject to tor-
 ture by the police (see Section 1.c.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, however, the Government continued to place some limitations on
 these rights. Citizens openly speak their views on a wide range of political and so-
 cial issues, including vigorous criticism of the Government.
 The Government owns stock in the three largest daily newspapers, and the Presi-
 dent appoints their editors-in-chief. However, although these newspapers generally
 follow the government line, they frequently criticize government policies. The Gov-
 ernment also enjoys a monopoly on the printing and distribution of newspapers, in-
 cluding the opposition parties' papers. The Government has been known to use its
 monopolistic control of newsprint to limit the output of opposition publications. In
 March the Government withdrew the permission to print at a government printing
 facility that previously had been granted to the Arabic language weekly newspaper,
 Al Dustur. Al Dustur, which had operated under a publishing license from Cyprus,
 lost its government permission to print following publication of articles about reli-
 gious strife.
 Opposition political parties publish their own newspapers but receive a subsidy
 from the Government and, in some cases, subsidies from foreign interests as well.
 Most newspapers are weeklies, with the exception of the daily Al Wafd, the daily
 Al-Ahrar, and Al-Shaab, the semiweekly of the Islamist-oriented Socialist Labor
 Party. All have small circulations. Opposition newspapers frequently publish criti-
 
 
 1650
 
 cism of the Government. They also give greater prominence to human rights abuses
 than the state-run newspapers. All party newspapers are required by law to reflect
 the platform of their party.
 The Press Law, the Publications Law, and the Penal Code govern press issues.
 The laws stipulate fines or imprisonment for criticism of the President, members of
 the Government, and foreign heads of state. The Supreme Constitutional Court
 agreed in November to review the constitutionality of those articles of the Penal
 Code that specify imprisonment as a penalty for journalists convicted of libel. The
 Constitution restricts ownership of newspapers to public or private legal entities,
 corporate bodies, and political parties. However, there are numerous restrictions on
 legal entities that seek to establish their own newspapers, including a ceiling of 10
 percent on individual ownership. In January the People's Assembly approved a. law
 that requires newspapers managed by joint stock companies to obtain the approval
 of the Prime Minister prior to publishing. Given government restrictions, a joint
 stock company is the only feasible incorporation option for publishers. Under this
 new law, the Government denied a publishing license to two newspapers, including
 Al Dustur.
 Newspapers published outside Egypt may be distributed with government permis-
 sion. However, the Government imposed a 2-month ban (March 31 to May 20) bar-
 ring publishing companies located in the free-trade ,zone from printing more than
 30 newspapers and magazines developed for the Egyptian market but licensed by
 a foreign government. On August 2, an administrative court issued a judgment de-
 claring the ban unlawful,
 Libel- laws provide protection against malicious rumor-mongering and unsubstan-
 tiated reporting. Financial penalties were increased substantially in 1996 when rel-
 evant provisions of the Penal Code were revised, but the judicial process remains
 long and costiy, creating a bar to realistic legal recourse for those wrongly defamed.
 In recent years, ,opposition party newspapers have, within imits, published articles
 critical of the President and foreign heads of state without being charged or har-
 assed. The Government-continues to charge journalists with libel.
 In 1996 the People's Assembly approved a revised Press Law, following criticism
 of a more restrictive revision that had been approved in 1995. In related legislation,
 the People's Assembly also revised certain articles in the Penal Code pertaining to
 libel and slander. In addition, in 1997 the Supreme Constitutional Court declared
 unconstitutional Article 195 of the' Penal Code under which an editor in chief could
 have been considered criminally responsible for libel contained in -any portion of the
 newspaper. The court ruled that the correct standard of responsibility should be
 "negligence-" This lesser standard- subsequently was applied by the courts.
 During the year, four journalists convicted of libel under the '1996 Press Law were
 imprisoned for short periods. However, the Court of Cassation overturned the libel
 convictions of Magdy Ahmad Hussein and Mohammed Hillal of the newspaper Al
 Shaab. Hussein and Hillal had been convicted on several counts of libel of former
 Interior Minister Hassan Alfi and his family. Af and Hussein reached an out-of-
 court settlement, and Alfi agreed to drop the remaining charges against Al Shaab.
 The Court of Cassation also overturned a lower court libel conviction of Gamal
 Fahmy, a reporter for the recently defuinct Al Dustor. Amr Nassif, a reporter for the
 weekly newspaper Al Usbua served a 3-month sentence for libel. Both Fahmy and
 Nassif had published articles critical of a member of the Shura Council. By contrast,
 two other journalists, Mustafa Bakry and his brother, Mahmoud Bakry, who were
 convicted in October by a lower court and sentenced to 1 year imprisonment for
 libel, were permitted by the Public Prosecutor to remain free while they contest the
 ruling. Because Mustafa Bakry filed a complaint in November with the Public Pros-
 ecutor against the EOHR for its critical report on the Sohag incident (see Section
 1.c.), many human rights activists are suspicious about the Public Prosecutor's deci-
 sion to permit the Bakry brothers to remain free.
 Government officials fied suit against 10 journalists in 9 cases during the year.
 In three libel cases filed by the Government in previous years, the courts found the
 accused guilty and levied fines against them. The Government dropped two pre-
 viously pending cases.
 On occasion, based on authority granted to him by law, the Public Prosecutor may
 issue a temporary ban on the publication of news pertaining to cases involving na-
 tional security and order so as to protect the confidentiality of the cases. The length
 of the ban is based on the length of time required for the prosecution to prepare
 its case. The Public -Prosecutor reportedly banned publication of news related to a
 strike staged during the summer in Bahariya (see Section 6.b.).
 On December 1, a state security prosecutor charged EOHR secretary-general
 Hafez Abu Se'da with violating Article- 102 of the Penal Code, which relates to delib-
 erate dissemination of false information or inflammatory propaganda that harms
 
 
 1651
 public security or public interests. The charge was based on an EOHR report critical
 of police conduct in the Sohag incident (see Sections 1.d. and 2.c.). Abu Se'da was
 detained and released on December 6. On December 9, a state security prosecutor
 levied the same charge against EOHR attorney Mustafa Zidane. Zidane, who is the
 author of the Sohag report, was not detained. The charges filed against both men
 have not been dropped.
 In May the People's Assembly approved a police law that prohibits current or
 former members of the police from publishing work-related information without
 prior permission from the Interior Minister. Following approval of the law, the Inte-
 rior Minister, Habib Al Adly, suspended Brigadier General Hamdy Al Batran for
 publishing a novel titled "The Diary of an Officer in the Countryside." Although
 Batran had published his book in February, he was charged with failing to secure
 the Minister's approval, making false claims about police conduct, insulting the po-
 lice, and other offenses. In September a disciplinary board found Batran innocent
 of all charges except for failing to secure the Minister's permission. The board also
 lifted his suspension. Both Batran and the Interior Minister are appealing the
 board's rulings. The book is available on the market and the Government has not
 attempted to confiscate it.
 Various ministries are authorized legally to ban or confiscate books and other
 works of art, upon obtaining a court order. The Islamic Research Center at Al Azhar
 University has legal authority to censor, but not to confiscate, all publications deal-
 ing with the Koran and Islamic scriptural texts. In recent years the Center has
 passed judgment on the suitability of nonreligious books and artistic productions.
 In January 1995, an administrative court ruled that the sole authority to prohibit
 publication or distribution of books and other works of art resides with the Ministry
 of Culture. This decision voided a 1994 advisory opinion by a judiciary council that
 had expanded Al Azhar's censorship authority to include visual and audio artistic
 works. The same year, President Mubarak stated that the Government would not
 allow confiscation of books from the market without a court order, a position sup-
 ported by the then-Mufti of the Republic, who is now the Grand Imam of Al Azhar.
 There were no court-ordered confiscations during the year. An appeal to the Court
 of Cassation by author Ala'a Hamed still is pending. Hamed previously was con-
 victed and sentenced to 1 year in prison and a fine of $58.82 (200 Egyptian Pounds)
 for the pornographic content of his book, "The Bed." In a related decision issued in
 July, the Higher Administrative Court upheld a lower court ruling dismissing
 Hamed from his government job in the Ministry of Finance.
 In January state security forces seized several books on religion written by Khalil
 Abd Al Karim, also known as the "Red Sheikh." The books, "Qureish from Tribe to
 State" and "The Situation at the time of the Prophet's Companions" (a trilogy) were
 condemned in a May 1996 report by the Al Azhar Islamic Research Center. In May
 state security forces seized two books written by Hamada Imam. The titles of the
 books are "The Role of the Saudi Family in the Establishment of Israel" and "The
 Lost Pride in the Arab Desert." State security prosecutors are investigating these
 two instances of seizure.
 The Ministry of Interior regularly confiscates leaflets and other works by Muslim
 fundamentalists. It also has the authority, which it exercises sporadically, to stop
 specific issues of foreign-published newspapers from entering the country on the
 grounds of protecting public order (see also Section 1.f.). The Ministry of Defense
 may ban works about sensitive security issues. The Department of Censorship in
 the Ministry of Information has the authority to censor or halt distribution of publi-
 cations printed in the free trade zone under a foreign license. During the year the
 Ministry censored 10 articles of the English-language weekly, the Middle East
 Times. Some of the articles contained "allegations of human rights violations. The
 Government continues to refuse to grant a visa to the weekly's publisher, Thomas
 Cromwell, but cited reasons unrelated to his position as a journalist for the action.
 The Ministry also prohibited distribution of more than 10 editions of the English-
 language weekly, the Cairo Times.
 The council of Ministers may order the banning of works that it deems offensive
 to public morals, detrimental to religion, or likely to cause a breach of the peace.
 Plays and films must pass Ministry of Culture censorship tests as scripts and as
 final productions. Many plays and films highly critical of the Government and its
 policies are not censored. The Ministry of Culture also censors foreign films for
 viewing in theaters, but it is more lenient when the same films are released in video
 cassette format. Government censors ensure that foreign films made in Egypt por-
 tray the country in a favorable light. Censors review scripts before filming, are
 present during filming, and have the right to review the film before it is sent out
 of the country.
 
 
 1652
 Still pending before an appeals court is the case against the film, "Birds of Dark-
 ness." The plaintiffs charge that it is insulting to lawyers. Two related cases against
 the movie were dropped in 1997.
 The Ministry of Information owns and operates all domestic television and radio
 productions. In the past, it has censored artistic works that criticized the Govern-
 ment or dealt with social problems from a nongovernmental perspective.
 Moderate Muslims and secularist writers are still subject to legal action by Is-
 lamic extremists. Cairo University professor Nasr Abu Zeid and his wife continue
 to live abroad following the 1996 Court of Cassation ruling that affirmed lower court
 judgments thatAbu Zeid is an apostate because of his controversial interpretation
 of Koranic teachings. However, the Supreme Constitutional Court agreed in May to
 review the constitutionality of the 1996 ruling. In May the American University of
 Cairo withdrew from its curriculum and library copies of a biography of the Prophet
 Muhammed written in 1967 by the French scholar Maxime Rodinson. The Univer-
 sity took this action following public protests, including complaints by the Minister
 of Higher Education, that the b6ok insults Islam.
 The Government does not directly restrict academic freedom at universities. How-
 ever, some university professors claim that the Government tightened its control
 over universities in 1994 by a law authorizing university presidents to appoint the
 deans of the various faculties. Under the previous law, faculty deans were elected
 by their peers. The Government has justified the measure as a means to combat
 Islamist influence on campus.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government continues to
 maintain substantial restrictions on freedom of assembly. Under a 1923 law, citi-
 zens must obtain approval from the Ministry of Interior before holding public meet-
 ings, rallies, and protest marches. The Interior Ministry selectively obstructs meet-
 ings scheduled to be held on private property and university campuses (also see Sec-
 tion 4). The Government continues to maintain substantial restrictions on freedom
 of association. Under Law 32 of 1964, the Ministry of Social Affairs has extensive
 authority over associations and private foundations, including the right to license
 and dissolve them, confiscate their properties, appoint members to their boards, and
 intercede in other administrative matters. Licenses may-be revoked if such organi-
 zations engage in political or religious activities. The law authorizes the Ministry
 to "merge two or more associations to achieve a similar function," a provision that
 may be used to merge an undesirable organization out of existence. During the year,
 Minister of Social Affairs Mervat Al Tellawy spearheaded an effort to overhaul the
 law by seeking input from community activists throughout the country....
 Since 1985 the Government has refused to license the Egyptian Organization for
 Human Rights (EOHR) and the Arab Organization for Human Rights (AOHR) on
 grounds that they are political organizations. Nevertheless, in general both continue
 to operate openly (see Section 4). Under 1993 legislatioon n professional syndicates,
 an association must elect its governing board by at least 50 percent of its general
 membership. Failing a quorum, a second election must be held in which at least 30
 percent of the membership votes for the board. If such a quorum is impossible, the
 judiciary may appoint a caretaker board until new elections can be set. The law was
 adopted to prevent well-organized minorities, specifically Islamists, from capturing
 or retaining the leadership of professional syndicates. Members of these syndicates
 have reported that Islamists have used irregular electoral techniques such as phys-
 ically blocking polling places and limiting or changing the location of polling sites.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of belief and the
 practice of religious rites, however, the Government places clear restrictions on this
 right. Most Egyptians are Muslim, but at least 10 percent of the population, ap-
 proximately 6 million persons, belong to the Coptic Orthodox Church. There are
 other small Christian denominations, as well as a Jewish community numbering
 fewer than 50 persons.
 For the most part, members of the non-Muslim minority worship without harass-
 ment and maintain links with coreligionists abroad.
 Under the Constitution, Islam is the official state religion and primary source of
 legislation. Accordingly, religious practices that conflict with Islamic law are prohib-
 ited. However, in most matters of family law, Christians are subject to church law.
 While neither the Constitution nor the Civil and Penal Codes prohibit proselytizing,
 Christians have been arrested on charges of violating Article 98f of the Penal Code,
 which prohibits citizens from ridiculing or insulting heavenly religions or inciting
 sectarian strife. There were no reports of such arrests during the year. Some Chris-
 tians have complained that the Government and security forces are lax in protecting
 Christian lives and property (see Section 5). The EOHR and other groups reported
 that police in the mainly Coptic village of Al Kush in Sohag governorate detained
 and tortured a large number of citizens, including the relatives of suspects, women,
 
 
 1653
 and children, during the investigation in August and September of a double murder
 of two Copts. It is unclear whether religion was a factor in the officers' actions.
 There are credible reports that in the course of the interrogations the police dispar-
 aged the religion of the detainees. However, most local Christian leaders and human
 rights activists say the incident was not a case of religious persecution or discrimi-
 nation. They characterize it as an example of systemic police brutality. However,
 confusion and suspicion about police motives remain (see Sections i.c. and 1.d.).
 There are no legal restrictions on the conversion of non-Muslims to Islam. How-
 ever, Muslims may face legal problems if they convert to another faith. In the past,
 authorities have charged a few Muslim converts to Christianity under article 98f of
 the Penal Code.
 In February the Government lifted travel restrictions that had been imposed on
 four former Muslims who had converted to Christianity and consequently been
 charged with violating Article 98f. Following their arrest in 1990, the men were de-
 tained for 10 months until President Mubarak ordered their release in 1991. How-
 ever, at the time of their release the Government did not remove their names from
 an immigration "lookout list" that prohibits Egyptians involved in criminal proceed-
 ings from traveling abroad without government permission. The issue lay dormant
 until recently when the men began traveling. In two separate incidents, one in late
 December 1997 and the other in February, two of the converts were arrested at the
 airport and briefly detained. Following these incidents, the Government removed
 the names of all four converts from the lookout list.
 In other cases involving conversion from Islam to Christianity, authorities have
 charged converts with violating laws prohibiting the falsification of documents. In
 such instances, converts, who fear government harassment if they officially register
 the change from Islam to Christianity, have altered their identification cards and
 other official identity documents themselves to reflect their new religious affiliation.
 There were no confirmed reports of individuals detained or charged during the year
 under these laws. In 1997 human rights activist Mamdouh Nakah filed suit seeking
 removal of the religious affiliation category from identification cards. The court re-
 ferred the case to the State Commissioner's Office, which has not yet issued an opin-
 ion.
 An 1856 Ottoman decree still in force requires non-Muslims to obtain what is now
 a presidential decree to build a place of worship. In addition, Interior Ministry regu-
 lations issued in 1934 specify a set of 10 conditions that the Government must con-
 sider prior to issuance of a presidential decree permitting construction of a church.
 These conditions include the location of the proposed site, the religious composition
 of the surrounding community, and the proximity of other churches. The Ottoman
 Decree also requires the President to a pprove permits for the repair of church facili-
 ties. In response to strong criticism of the decree, President Mubarak in January
 delegated to governors the authority to approve permits for the repair of church fa-
 cilities. Despite this action, the approval process for church construction and repair
 remains time-consuming and insufficiently responsive to the wishes of the Christian
 community. Although President Mubarak has approved all requests for permits pre-
 seated toh (reportedly a total of more than 230 during his 16-year tenure), Chris-
 tians maintain that the Interior Ministry delays--in some instances indefinitely-
 submission to the President of their requests. They also maintain that security
 forces have blocked them from utilizing permits that have been issued.
 During the 1990's, the Government increased the number of building permits
 issued to Christian communities to an average of more than 20 per year, compared
 with an average of 5 permits issued annually in the 1980's. During the year, the
 government approved a total of 30 permits for church-related construction, including
 3 permits for the construction of new churches; 1o permits for the construction of
 additional church facilities; and 17 permits for churches previously constructed
 without authorization. The Government reported that Governors issued a total of
 207 permits for Church-related repair during the year; this total represents a sig-
 nificant increase in approvals. However, the Government was unable to provide a
 breakdown by governorate. Unofficial reports from the goverorates vary. In Janu-
 ary 1996, human rights activist Mamdouh Naklah filed suit challenging the con-
 stitionality of the Ottoman decree. In December an administrative court referred
 Naklah's case to a state body of legal experts. This decision was considered a set-
 back, as the body is not required to issue an opinion expeditiously and its opinions
 are not binding. As a result of these restrictions, some communities use private
 buildings and apartments for religious services. In June state security forces shut
 down a church in the Cairo suburb of Ma'adi. The building had been used for sev-
 eral years for worship by the Coptic Orthodox community, although the community
 never had received a response to its request for a permit. In mid-October the Gov-
 einent permitted the church to reopen.
 
 
 1654
 In 1952, the government seized approximately 1,500 acres of land from the-Coptic
 Orthodox church and transferred title to the Ministry of Awqaf, which is responsible
 for administering religious- trusts. In 1996 Awqaf Minister Hamdy Zaqzouq estab-
 Jlished a committee to address the issue. Based on the committee's recommendations,
 approximately 500 acres have been returned to the church over the past 2 years.
 The committee continues to study the return of the remaining disputed property.
 The Government continued its efforts to extend legal controls to all mosques,
 which by law must be licensed. The Government appoints and pays the salaries of
 the imams officiating in mosques, and proposes themes for andmonitors sermons.
 Of the country's approximately 70,000 mosques, nearly half remain unlicensed and
 operate outside the control of government authorities. In an effort to combat Islamic
 extremists, the Government has announced its intention to bring all unauthorized
 mosques under its control by 2000,
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens and foreigners are free to travel within Egypt except in certain
 military areas. Males who have not completed compulsory military service may not
 travel abroad or emigrate, although this restriction may be deferred or bypassed.
 Unmarried women under the age of 21 must have permission from their fathers to
 obtain passports and travel; married Women require the same permission from their
 husbands. Citizens who leave the country have the right to return.
 In February the Government lifted travel restrictions on four Muslim converts to
 Christianity. The Government imposed the restrictions in 1990 following the arrest
 of the men (see Section 2.c.).
 The Constitution provides for the grant of political asylum and prohibits the ex-
 tradition of political refugees. There were no reports of the forced return of persons
 to a country where they feared persecution. Egypt grants 'first asylum for humani-
 tarian reasons or in the event of internal turmoil in neighboring countries. The Gov-
 ernment cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR). Asylum seekers generally are screened by UNHCR representa-
 tives, whose recommendations regarding settlement are forwarded to the ministries
 of Interior and Foreign Affairs for final determination. Refugees accepted by the
 Government are permitted to live and work in Egypt but cannot acquire citizenship,
 except in rare cases. During the year,- the Government accepted more than 6,500
 refugees, including more than 2,500 Somalis and 2,789 Sudanese, for temporary re-
 settlement. Although there is no pattern of abuse of refugees, the Government tem-
 porarily detained during random security sweeps some refugees who earlier had
 been accorded protection status. Following intervention by the UNHCR, the refugees
 were released.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) dominates the 454-seat People's As-
 sembly, the Shura Council, local governments, the" mass media, labor, the large pub-
 lic sector, and controls the licensing of new political parties, newspapers, and pri-
 vate organizations to such an extent that, as a practical matter, citizens do not have
 a meaningful ability to change their government.
 In 1993 President Hosni Mubarak was elected unopposed to a third 6-year term
 by the People's Assembly. In October of that year, his reelection was approved by
 96 percent of the voters in a national referendum. Under the Constitution, the elec-
 torate is not presented with a choice among competing presidential candidates. Two
 opposition parties urged the public to boycott the referendum, and two other parties
 urged the public to vote against the President. The other opposition parties en-
 dorsed the President's candidacy.
 More than 100 losing candidates in the fall 1995 legislative elections filed com-
 plaints in the administrative courts, alleging ballot-rigging and other irregularities.
 The courts agreed with most of these claims. Although the judiciary has the author-
 ity to determine whether or not irregularities took place, it does not have the au-
 thority to remove an elected member of the People's Assembly, a right that the As-
 sembly claims solely for itself, citing the concept of parliamentary sovereignty. The
 Assembly has not called for any new by-elections in response to the courts' judg-
 ment, nor is it expected to do so.
 The People's Assembly debates government proposals, and members exercise their
 authority to call cabinet ministers to explain policy. The executive initiates almost
 all legislation. Nevertheless, the Assembly maintains the authority to challenge or
 restrain the executive in the areas of economic and social policy, but it may not
 modify the budget except with the Government's approval. The Assembly, exercises
 limited influence in the areas of security and foreign policy, and retains little over-
 sight of the Interior Ministry's use of Emergency Law powers. Many executive
 
 
 1655
 branch initiatives and policies are carried out by regulation through ministerial de-
 cree without legislative oversight. The military budget is prepared by the executive
 and not debated publicly. Roll-call votes in the assembly are rare. Votes generally
 are reported in aggregate terms of yeas and nays, and thus constituents have no
 independent method of checking a member's voting record.
 The Shura council, the upper chamber of Parliament, has 264 members. Two-
 thirds of the members are elected popularly and one-third are appointed by the
 President. One half of the Shura seats are up for reelection or reappointment every
 3 years. In June the NDP won all 88 seats up for election. One Coptic Christian,
 from Alexandria, won a seat. The President made 47 appointments (including an ad-
 ditional 3 over the 44 open seats to replace deceased members). Those appointed in-
 cluded nine women, eight Coptic Christians, and two members of opposition parties.
 There are 13 recognized opposition parties. The law empowers the Government
 to bring felony charges against those who form a party without a license. New par-
 ties must be approved by the Parties Committee, a semiofficial body that includes
 a substantial majority of members from the ruling NDP and some members from
 among the independent and opposition parties. Decisions of the Parties Committee
 may be appealed to the civil courts. The Committee refused the applications of two
 parties during the year. One of the rejected parties, the Egyptian Wasat Party, is
 appealing this decision Eight parties whose applications previously have been de-
 nied are contesting the decisions. During the year, the court rejected an additional
 seven appeals that had been pending.
 According to the law, which prhihits political parties based on religion, the Mus-
 lim Brotherhood is an illegal political organization. Muslim Brothers are publicly
 known and openly speak their views, although they do not explicitly identify them-
 selves as members of the organization. They remain subject to government pressure
 (see Section 1.d.). Some have served in the Assembly as independents or as mem-
 bers of other recognized parties.
 Women and minorities are underrepresented in government and politics. The Con-
 stitution reserves 10 Assembly seats for presidential appointees, which the Presi-
 dent traditionally has used to assure representation for women and Coptic Chris-
 tians. Five women but no Copts were elected in 1995; of the 10 presidential appoint-
 ments, 6 were Copts and 4 were women. The ruling NDP nominated no Coptic can-
 didates in the 1995 parliamentary elections. Two women and 2 Copts serve among
 the 32 ministers in the Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government refuses to license local human rights groups as private entities
 under Law 32 of 1964 (see Section 2.b.). Since 1986 the Government has refused
 to license the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights on grounds that it is a polit-
 ical organization and duplicates the activities of an existing, although moribund,
 human rights group (see Section 2.b.). The EOHR has appealed the denial in the
 courts, and continues to conduct activities openly, pending a final judicial deter-
 mination of its status. In December a state security prosecutor called in EOHR Sec-
 retary General Hafez Abu Se'da and EOHR attorney Mustafa Zidane for questioning
 about the preparation of the September 28 EOHR report critical of police conduct
 during a murder investigation in the village of al-Kush in the Upper Egyptian
 governorate of Sohag during August and September (see Sections l.c. and 1.d.). On
 December 1, abu Se'da was charged with violating 2 articles of the Penal Code. One
 is a felony involving the acceptance of foreign funds with the intent to harm na-
 tional interests and the other is a misdemeanor involving publishing false informa-
 tion with the intent to harm public security. Abu Se'da was detained for 6 days and
 released after paying bail in the amount of $147 (500 Egyptian Pounds). The same
 charges were levied against Zidane, the author of the EOHR report on Sohag, on
 December 9. He was not detained but was required to post bail in the amount of
 $59 (200 Egyptian pounds) (see Section 1.d.).
 The Arab Organization for Human Rights, the EOHR's parent organization, has
 a longstanding request for registration as a foreign organization with the Ministry
 of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry has not approved the request thus far, stating that
 the issue is dependent on the outcome of efforts within the League of Arab States
 to establish a human rights body.
 Despite their nonrecognition, the EOHR and other groups sometimes obtain the
 cooperation of government officials. The Government allows EOHR field workers to
 visit prisons in their capacity as legal counsel, to call on some government officials,
 and to receive funding from foreign human rights organizations. However, many
 local and international human rights activists have concluded that government re-
 
 
 1656
 
 strictions on the activities of nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) have inhibited
 significantly reporting on human rights abuses.
 There were no reports during the year that the Government banned meetings of
 human rights groups, although the Government on occasion makes the holding of
 such meetings difficult. For example, some human rights organizations have found
 requests for conference space turned down for "security reasons" or reservations
 later canceled for "maintenance reasons." Other human rights organizations, such
 as the Center for Human Rights Legal Aid, are registered with the Government as
 corporations under commercial or civil law, thus avoiding the obstacles posed by
 Law 32 (see Section 2.b.). The Cairo-based Arab Program for Human Rights Activ-
 ists reported that police surrounded the organization's offices "on October 15 while
 a police official interrogated an office assistant. Human Rights groups characterized
 this incident as provocative action.
 In 1995 the Ministry of Justice issued a nonbinding advisory ruling stating that
 such organizations properly should be considered nongovernmental organizations as
 defined by Law 32 and registered accordingly, or face punitive action. However, the
 Government did not close down any group during the year.-
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality of the sexes and equal treatment of non-
 Muslims, but aspects of the law and many traditional practices discriminate against
 women and Christians.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women is a significant problem and is re-
 flected in press accounts of specific incidents. According to a study conducted in
 1995, one of every three women who have ever been -married has been beaten at
 least once during marriage. Among those who have been beaten, less than half ever
 have sought help. Marital rape is not illegal. In general, neighbors and extended
 family members intervene to limit incidents of domestic violence. Abuse within the
 family rarely is discussed publicly, due to the value attached to privacy in this tradi-
 tional society. Several NGO's have begun offering counseling, legal aid, and other
 services to women who are victims of domestic violence. Rape is known to occur, but
 reliable statistics are not available. When "honor killings" (a man-murdering a fe-
 male relative for her perceived lack of chastity) occur, perpetrators generally receive
 lighter punishments than those convicted in other cases of murder. The law provides
 for equality of the sexes, but aspects of the law and many traditional practices dis-
 criminate against women. By law, unmarried women under the age of 21 must have
 permission from their fathers to obtain passports and to travel; married women of
 any age require the same permission from their husbands (see Section 2.d.). Only
 males can confer citizenship. In rare cases, this means that children who are born
 to Egyptian mothers and stateless fathers are themselves stateless. A woman's testi-
 mony is equal to that of a man's in the courts. There is no legal prohibition against
 a woman serving as a judge, although in practice no women serve as judges.
 Laws affecting marriage and personal status generally correspond to. an individ-
 ual's religion. A 1979 liberalization of the Family Status Law strengthening a Mus-
 lim woman's rights to divorce and child custody was repealed in 1985 after the Su-
 preme Constitutional Court ruled that use of a presidential decree to implement the
 law was unjustified.
 Under Islamic law, non-Muslim males must convert to Islam to marry Muslim
 women, but non-Muslim women need not convert to marry Muslim men. Muslim fe-
 male heirs receive half the amount of a male heir's inheritance, while Christian wid-
 ows of Muslims have no inheritance rights. A sole female heir receives half her par-
 ents' estate; the balance goes to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits
 all his parents' property. Male Muslim heirs face strong social pressure to provide
 for all family members who need assistance. However, this assistance is not always
 provided.
 Women have employment opportunities in government, medicine, law, academia,
 the arts, and, to a lesser degree, business. Labor laws guarantee men and women
 equal rates of pay for equal work in the public sector. According to government fig-
 ures, women constitute 17 percent of private business owners and occupy 25 percent
 of the managerial positions in the four major national banks. Social 'pressure
 against women pursuing a career is strong, and some women's rights advocates say
 that a resurgent Islamic fundamentalist trend limits further gains. Women's rights
 advocates also point to other discriminatory traditional or cultural attitudes and
 practices such as female genital mutilation and the traditional male relative's role
 in enforcing chastity and chaste sexual conduct.

 A number of active women's rights groups work in diverse areas, including re-
 forming the Personal Status Code, educating women on their legal rights, combating
 FGM, and rewriting the marriage contract.
 Children.-The Government remains committed to the protection of children's
 welfare within the limits of its budgetary resources. Many of the resources for chil-
 dren's welfare are provided by international donors, especially in the field, of child
 immunization. Child labor is widespread, despite the Government's commitment to
 eradicate it (see Section 6.d.).
 The Government provides public education, which is compulsory for the first 8
 academic years (typically until the age of 15). In education the Government treats
 boys and girls equally at all levels of education.
 The Government enacted a new Child Law in 1996. The law provides for more
 privileges, protection, and care for children in general. Six of the law's 144 articles
 set advantageous rules for working children (see Section 6.d.). Other provisions in-
 clude: A requirement for employers to set up or contract with a child care center.
 if they employ more than 100 women; the right of rehabilitation for disabled chil-
 dren; a prohibition on sentencing defendants between the ages of 16 and 18 to cap-
 ital punishment, hard labor for life, or temporary hard labor; and a prohibition on
 placing defendants under the age of 15 in preventive custody, although the prosecu-
 tion may order that they be lodged in an "observation house" and be summoned
 upon request.
 The Government remains committed to eradicating the practice of female genital
 mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health experts as damaging
 to both physical and psychological health. Despite strong government and commu-
 nity efforts to eradicate FGM, government and private sources agree that it is com-
 mon. Traditional and family pressures remain strong; a study conducted in 1995
 p laces the percentage of women who have ever been married who have undergone
 FGM at 97 percent. FGM generally is performed on girls between the ages of 7 and
 10, with equal prevalence among Muslims and Christians.
 The Court of Cassation issued a decision in 1997 that upheld the legality of the
 decree banning FGM issued in 1996 by the Minister of Health and Population Plan-
 ning. In addition to enforcing the decree, the Government supports a range of efforts
 to educate the public. A discussion of FGM and its dangers has been added to the
 curriculum of the school system. The Government broadcasts television programs
 condemning the practice. Government ministers are outspoken in advising citizens
 to cease the practice, and senior religious leaders also support efforts to stop it. The
 Sheilth of A Azhar, the most senior Islamic figure in the country, and the leader
 of the Coptic Christian community, Pope Shenouda, have stated repeatedly that
 FGM is not required by religious doctrine. However, illiteracy impedes some women
 from distinguishing between the deep-rooted tradition of FGM and religious prac-
 tices. A number of NGO's also work actively to educate the public about the health
 hazards of the practice.
 People With Disabilities.-There are approximately 5.7 million disabled persons,
 of whom 1.5 million are severely disabled. The Government makes serious efforts
 to address their rights. It works closely with United Nations agencies and other
 international aid donors to design job-training programs for the disabled. The Gov-
 ernment also seeks to increase                     the capabilities of the dis-
 abled in television programming, the print media, and in educational material in
 public schools.
 By law, all businesses must desigate 5 percent of their jobs for the disabled, who
 are exempt from normal literacy requirements. Although there is no legislation
 mandating access to public accommodations and transportation, the disabled may
 ride government-owned mass transit buses without charge, are given priority in ob-
 taining telephones, and receive reductions on customs duties for private vehicles.
 Religious Minorties.-The Constitution provides that all citizens are equal before
 the law and prohibits discrimination based on religion. For the most part these con-
 stitutional protections are upheld by the Government. However, discrimination
 against Christians still exists.
 The approximately 6 million Coptic Christians are the objects of occasional violent
 assaults by the Islamic Group another trrorists. During the year, extremists were
 responsible for killing eight Christians in the Minya governorate, where about 30
 to 40 percent of the inhabitants are Christian.
 Some Christians have alleged that the Government is lax in protecting Christian
 lives and property. Security forces arrest extremists who perpetrate violence against
 Christians, but some members of the Christian community do not believe that the
 Government is sufficiently vigorous in its efforts to prevent attacks. They also main-
 tai that the Government does little to correct nonviolent forms of discrimination,
 including its own.
 
 
 1658
 There were reports of forced conversions of Coptic children to Islam, but even
 human rights groups find it extremely difficult to determine the actual degree of
 compulsion used, as most cases involve a Coptic girlwho converts-to Islam when
 she marries a Muslim boy. According to the Government, the girl in such cases must
 meet with her family, with her priest, and with the head of her church before she
 is allowed to convert However, there are credible reports of government harassment
 of Christian families that attempt to regain custody of their daughters, and of the
 failure of the authorities to uphold the law that states that a marriage of a girl
 under the age of 16 is prohibited and between the ages of 16 and 21 is illegal with-
 out the approval and presence ofher guardian.
 Government discriminatory practices include: Suspected statistical underrepresen-
 tation of the size of the Christian population; omission of the Coptic Era of Egyptian
 history in the school curriculum; failure to admit Christians into schools of Arabic
 studies to become Arabic teachers, as the curriculum involves study of the Koran;
 negligible media coverage of Christian subjects; job discrimination in the public sec-
 tor-the police, the armed forces, and other government agencies; and reported dis-
 crimination against Christians in staff appointments, at universities. There are no
 Coptic governors and no Copts in the upper ranks of the military or police..
 Anti-Semitism in the Egytian press is found in both the government press and
 in the nonofficial press of the opposition parties. The Government has condemned
 anti-Semitism and advised journalists and cartoonists to avoid anti-Semitism. There
 have been no anti-Semitic incidents in recent years -directed at the tiny Jewish com-
 munity.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers may join trade unions but are not required
 to do so. A union local, or workers' committee, may-be formed if 50 employees ex-
 press a desire to organize. Most union members, about 27 per cent of the labor force,
 are employed by state-owned enterprises. The law stipulates that "high administra-
 tive" officials in government and the public sector may not join unions.
 There are 23 trade unions, all required to belong to the Egyptian Trade Union
 Federation (ETUF), the sole legally recognized labor federation. The International
 Labor Organization's Committee of Experts repeatedly has emphasized that a law
 requiring all trade unions to belong to. a single federation infringes-on the freedom
 of association. The Government has shown no sign that it intends to accept the es-
 tablishment of more than one federation. The ETUF leadership asserts that it ac-
 tively promotes worker interests and that there is no need for another federation.
 ETUF officials have close relations with the NDP, and some are members of the
 People's Assembly or the Shura Council. They speak vigorously on behalf of worker
 concerns, but public confrontations between the ETUF and the Government are
 rare. Disputes more often are resolved by consensus behind closed doors.
 The labor laws do not provide adequately statutory authorization for the rights
 to strike and to engage in collective bargaining. Even though the right to strike is
 not provided, strikes occur. The Government considers strikes a form of public dis-
 turbance and therefore illegal.
 An increasing number of strikes took place in the public sector and at privatized
 companies during the year, mainly over issues of wage cuts and dismissals.. In July
 a strike by workers at the Misr-Helwan Textile Company, a public sector company
 located in Cairo, led to the closure of the factory for 1 month. The workers contested
 the disbursement of incentives. Also in July, workers at a transport and engineering
 company in Alexandria participated in a strike to protest inadequate bonuses and
 allowances. Minister of Public Enterprise Atef Ebeid reportedly assisted in the
 Seaceful resolution of these strikes. During July and August, workers at the
 anaclese Beverage Company in Buheira governorate staged two strikes. The com-
 pany, formerly part of the public sector, is undergoing privatization and the workers
 feared that they would be fired. In September workers at the Egypt-Edco Maritime
 Transport Company, a public sector company located in Alexandria, staged a strike
 over the disbursement of incentives and early retirement-bonuses.
 Workers at the Siklam dairy products company in Alexandria struck in September
 to protest -the management's approach to implementing privatization of the com-
 pany. Also in September, workers at the ship repair and'building company in Alex-
 andria, a public-sector company, struck because they did not receive overtime pay.
 More than 800 workers at the thermal industries company in Helwan, a public-sec-
 tor company, struck in November following the announcement of the liquidation of
 the Helwan site. Following the strike, the company's management agreed not to
 close the site. Workers at a public sector spinming company located in the delta
 struck in November following imposition of harsh disciplinary measures, including
 suspension of the factory's union. A public sector cotton ginning company in Minya
 
 
 1659
 
 faced a strike in November after management failed to distribute promised bonuses.
 Workers at a private sector company in the Sixth of October city struck in protest
 after management fired some employees. More than 750 workers at the Middle East
 Paper Company, a public sector company located in Cairo, struck in November and
 December after management announced a halt to bonus and incentive pay. Police
 surrounded the factory during each incident. Approximately 2,000 workers from the
 al-Mahalla Carpet Factory in Cairo struck in November following news that the
 public sector company would be liquidated and sold.
 Some unions within the ETUF are affiliated with international trade union orga-
 nizations. Others are in the process of becoming affiliated.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Under the law, unions may
 negotiate work contracts with public sector enterprises if the latter agree to such
 negotiations, but unions otherwise lack collective bargaining power in the state sec-
 tor. Under current circumstances, collective bargaining does not exist in any mean-
 ingful sense because the Government sets wages, benefits, and job classifications by
 law.
 Firms in the private sector generally do not adhere to such government-mandated
 standards. Although they are required to observe some government practices, such
 as the minimum wage, social security insurance, and official holidays, they often do
 not adhere to government practice in non-binding matters, including award of the
 annual Labor Day bonus.
 Labor law and practice are the same in Egypt's six export processing zones
 (EPZ's) as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Article 13 of the Constitution pro-
 hibits forced labor. However, the Criminal Code authorizes sentences of hard labor
 for some crimes. Although the law does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded
 labor by children, such practices are not known to occur (see Section 6.d.).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Under the
 Child Law approved in 1996 (see Section 5), the minimum age for employment is
 14 in nonagricultural work. Provincial governors, with the approval of the Minister
 of Education, can authorize seasonal work for children between the ages of 12 and
 14, provided that duties are not hazardous and do not interfere with schooling. Pre-
 employment training for children under the age of 12 is prohibited. It is prohibited
 for children to work for more than 6 hours a day. One or more breaks totaling at
 least one hour must be included. Children are not to work overtime, during their
 weekly day off, between 8 p.m. and 7 a.m., or for more than 4 hours continuously.
 Education is compulsory for the first 8 academic years (typically until the age of 15).
 Statistical information on the number of working children is difficult to obtain
 and often out of date. A comprehensive study prepared by the Government's statis-
 tical agency in 1988 indicated that 1.309 million children between the ages of 6 and
 14 years are employed. Government studies also indicate that the concentration of
 working children is higher in rural than urban areas- Nearly 78 percent of children
 work on farms. However, children also work as apprentices in repair and craft
 shops, in heavier industries such as brick making and textiles, and as workers in
 leather and carpet-making factories. While local trade unions report that the Min-
 istry of Labor adequately enforces the labor laws in state-owned enterprises, en-
 forcement in the private sector, especially in family-owned enterprises, is lax. Many
 of these children are abused and overworked by their employers, and the restric-
 tions in the new Child Law have not improved conditions due to lax enforcement
 on the part of the Government. Although the law does not specifically prohibit
 forced and bonded labor by children, such practices are not known to occur (see Sec-
 tion 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-For government and public-sector employees,
 the minimum wage is approximately $31 (about 106 Egyptian Pounds) a month for
 a 6-day, 42-hour workweek. Base pay is supplemented by a complex system of fringe
 benefits and bonuses that may double or triple a worker's take-home pay. The aver-
 age worker and family could not survive on a worker's base pay at the minimum
 wage rate. The minimum wage also is binding legally on the private sector, and
 larger private companies generally observe the requirement and pay bonuses as
 well. Smaller firms do not always pay the minimum wage or bonuses.
 The Ministry of Labor sets worker health and safety standards, which also apply
 in the export processing zones, but enforcement and inspections are uneven. The
 law prohibits employers from maintaining hazardous working conditions, and work-
 ers have the right to remove themselves from hazardous conditions without risking
 loss of employmenL
