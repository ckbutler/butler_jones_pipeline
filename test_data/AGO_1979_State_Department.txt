 ANGOLA
 There is little reliable information on human rights
 practices in Angola. The United States does not maintain
 diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of.Angola,
 and thus has no diplomatic personnel on the spot to monitor
 numan rights conditions or to evaluate allegations of abuses.
 Of the major human rights organizations, only Amnesty Inter-
 national has reported on human rights in Angola since inde-
 pendence.
 At independence on November 11, 1975, the three major liber-
 ation groups which had fought the colonizers for 13 years
 were engaged in a bloody civil war, marked by extensive
 foreign intervention. By early 1976, the Popular Movement
 for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) had forced the two rival
 movements from Luanda, the capital, and from power. Both
 groups, the National Front for the Liberation of Angola
 (FNLA), and the National Union for the Total Independence of
 Angola (UNITA), reverted to guerrilla warfare. The FNLA has
 since ceased to be a threat to government control of north-
 ern areas of the country. UNITA continues to challenge the
 government's control of large areas of the southern, eastern,
 and central portions of the country.
 In the context of continuing civil war and attacks from
 South Africa, the MPLA government has had to divert thou-
 sands of its best trained people and a substantial share
 of its greatly reduced material and financial resources
 to military ends. Th3 government, moreover, has reacted
 to the internal hostilities, which are in part both cause
 and result of racial and tribal tensions, by repressive
 measures against suspect individuals and groups. In con-
 sequence, political, social, civil and economic rights have
 been added to the war casualty lists.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The constitution charges the State with responsibility to
 guarantee the integrity of the person. Nevertheless, there
 have been allegations of torture practices in Angolan pris-
 ons. Certain Portuguese former prisoners who were released
 or escaped have charged that inhumane practices are used in
 interrogation of war prisoners and those suspected of
 "economic sabotage." For example, there have allegedly
 been instances when food and drink have been withheld from
 prisoners to break their resistance. While it is probable
 that some of the reports of prisoner maltreatment are ex-
 aggerated, it is likely that some instances of torture
 have occurred. The allegations of torture, or the fre-
 quency, extent, and range of methods used cannot be veri-
 fied at this time.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Prisoners' rights to receive visitors, packages, and mail

 are severely restricted. In the case of foreign prisoners,
 arrest notifications to consular officials have been lax,
 and consular access to prisoners has been severely restric-
 ted. For example, despite numerous requests, the three
 American prisoners in Angola, including two convicted of
 being mercenaries and one man who has never been charged,
 have not been allowed prison visits by officials of the
 US or other nations since November 1978. Similarly, it
 has been impossible to verify that mail and packages are
 reaching them.-
 Escaped or released prisoners have alleged that prisons are
 overcrowded, and that diet and sanitation are substandard.
 The substandard diet and sanitation conditions may reflect
 the general state of the economy more than purposeful mal-
 treatment of prisoners. Prison officials do allow food
 to be sent in to detainees to supplement the prison diet.
 While some reports have alleged that foreigners are not
 well treated, the Department of State knows from firsthand
 contacts with the three American citizens imprisoned in
 Angola that in 1978 they were receiving relatively good
 treatment in terms of medical care, jail privileges, and
 in being allowed to share food sent in to cell mates. How-
 ever, due to lack of access, the Department has no first-
 hand knowledge on current conditions.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment, and
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial.
 Two of the most persistently and frequently reported char-
 ges of human rights violations in Angola have been those
 of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment without due process.
 Numerous reports allege that individuals are arrested and
 imprisoned on suspicion or denunciation by another, held in
 some cases for several months or longer without knowing the
 complaints or charges against them, and held without hear-
 ing or trial. The right of the accused to legal counsel and
 defense is guaranteed in the constitution, but the Depart-
 ment of State has insufficient information to permit an
 accurate assessment of the frequency with which this right
 is observed in practice.
 One American has been held since 1977 without having char-
 ges placed against him. Despite numerous efforts. the
 Department has been unable either to effect his release or
 to learn the charges against him. Inquiries by his rela-
 tives have also gone unanswered by Angolan officials.
 Shortly before his death, former President Agostinho Neto
 expressed dismay at the extent of police abuses, and had
 initiated steps to restructure the judicial system and
 restrain excesses. Neto dissolved the secret police organ-
 ization, but transferred many of its functions and personnel
 to a new Ministry of the Interior. The attitude of the new
 leadership toward ending the abuses is unknown.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the domicile, as well as confidentiality
 of correspondence are guaranteed in the constitution. It
 is not known to what extent these rights are presently re-
 spected in practice. However, violations did occur during
 and after an attempted coup in 1977.

 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Angolan economy, basically rural subsistence agricul-
 ture, did have a significant urban and monetarized compon-
 ent in the colonial period. Before independence, an over-
 whelming portion of the economy was controlled by the ap-
 proximately 500,000 Portuguese residents, who possessed the
 bulk of the country's managerial expertise and technical
 skills. Perhaps 30,000 of the Portuguese remain. The 1975
 civil war and continuing guerrilla activitity caused the
 destruction of important infrastructure elements and eco-
 nomic assets. The exodus of the Portuguese and diversion
 to civil warfare of a good number of the country's avail-
 able trained personnel, as well as substantial economic
 resources, have resulted in near paralysis of the economy.
 Today only the oil production sector of the economy is
 generating income at anywhere near pre-independence levels;
 all other sectors are stagnant or operate at a fraction of
 their pre-war levels. The distribution system has been
 particularly affected, resulting in chronic shortages of
 manufactured goods in rural areas and scarcity of food in
 urban areas.
 In December 1977, the MPLA transformed itself into a Marx-
 ist-Leninist "vanguard party", and adopted socialism as its
 long-term goal. *However, at present, the economy may be
 considered "mixed" and government leaders have indicated
 they intend to keep it so. Significant areas of the econ-
 omy such as banking and mining have been transferred from
 private ownership under colonial rule to state ownership.
 Although the right to private property is guaranteed by
 the constitution and a sizeable portion of the economy
 still operates under private ownership, the.State reserves
 the right to confiscate property and assets it considers
 "abandoned"; e.g., due to a resident's departure from
 Angola.
 Although the constitution provides that it is tne duty of
 the State to provide conditions for social development,
 work, health care, and education, continuing internal hos-
 tilities and the exodus of trained personnel have severely
 hampered the government's efforts to provide basic economic
 rights to Angolans. For example, although physicians from
 several countries are serving in Angola under assistance
 programs, the number is insufficient to supply minimum
 health care to more than a fraction of the total population.
 Data on the education system are unavailable. It is believ-
 ed the Government has had some success in expanding its
 basic literacy programs, although the current literacy rate
 is not known. Prior to independence the literacy rate was
 estimated at 15-20 percent.
 Corruption appears to be hindering the distribution of
 scarce economic supplies. A thriving and expensive black
 market is known to exist. There are widespread allegations,
 many of them credible, of corruption by some government
 officials and foreigners working in the government. Despite
 government controls on prices, the scarcity of goods has
 caused the inflation rate to skyrocket. Some unconfirmed
 estimates have placed the annual inflation rate at well over
 100 percent.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of expression, assem-
 bly, conscience, and belief, as well as separation of church
 and state, but qualifies the exercise of these freedoms by
 requirements that activities must fall within "the area of
 realizing the fundamental objectives of the People's Repub-
 lic of Angola," that they must be "in the national interest,"
 or that they "conform to public order." In practice, free-
 dom of the press, religion and assembly are severely abridg-
 ed by the regime.
 The Department of State is unable to determine the extent
 of violations of freedom of speech. However, there are
 numerous allegations of arrests of people who voice support
 of an opposition movement or alternative political systems.
 Censorship of political expression exists, and the circu-
 lation of Western journals and periodicals is tightly re-
 stricted.
 Tne government controls or owns the media. Although oppo-
 sition views are not aired, the press frequently contains
 articles criticizing government failings in the economic
 areas. The government is especially sensitive to criticism
 in the foreign press, and has occasionally expelled foreign
 correspondents for writing articles critical of its poli-
 cies, or those describing activities of opposition move-
 ments. Entry of foreign correspondents into Angola is
 tightly restricted.
 Although, as noted, the constitution guarantees freedom of
 religion, pastoral letters from the Catholic Church criti-
 cizing the government have resulted in restrictions on
 church activities.
 The MPLA-Labor Party is Angola's only legal political party.
 The government has banned other political movements.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 The government has instituted a pass system within Angola,
 and foreigners are generally prohibited from travelling
 outside principal cities. Foreign travel is carefully
 controlled by passport issuance restrictions, delayed issu-
 ance of exit visas, and currency restrictions. Emigration,
 particularly of draft age males, is tightly restricted.
 The frequency of travel abroad by foreigners resident in
 Angola may also be restricted.
 The Angolan government, influenced by the active insurgen-
 cies within the country, is highly security conscious. As
 one result, visa policy is selective and stringent. Visa
 applications are frequently rejected, ignored or subject
 to long delays.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The People's Republic of Angola is a one-party authoritarian
 state. The MPLA-Labor Party is the only legal political
 party. The government has banned all political activities
 
 
 by opposition groups, and denies then access to the state
 controlled media.
 The constitution guarantees the exercise of political power
 to the "masses, through organized forms of popular power."
 In effect, this restricts political expression to partici-
 pation in the MPLA-Labor Party or to one of its controlled
 and sanctioned organizations such as the youth wing, Angolan
 Women's Organization, or trade union movement (UNTA).
 All Angolan citizens over 18 not legally deprived of polit-
 ical rights may participate in the political process, as
 described above. However, Angolan citizenship is denied
 to those Portuguese or other individuals with claims to
 another nationality who have committed homicide, opposed
 the liberation struggle, or joined clandestine organiza-
 tions opposed to the decolonization process.
 The constitution guarantees the equality of all citizens
 and prdscribes discrimination because of color, race, ethni-
 city, sex, birthplace, religion, education, or economic or
 social conditions. Women do participate in the MPLA, not
 only in the Angolan Women's Organization, but also in the
 higher levels of the party. However, women in the higher
 party organs have not been numerous. Only three of the
 MPLA's 45 Central Committee members are women, while none
 of the government ministers is female. Social, cultural
 and traditional factors will probably limit to some extent
 the participation of women at the highest levels of the
 party and government.
 There is a government-sponsored trade movement, the Nation-
 al Union of Angolan Workers (UNTA). Traditional labor union
 activities and rights are tightly restricted by the govern-
 ment. The right to strike is prohibited by law as a crime
 against the security of the State.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 As far as is known, no international or non-governmental
 human rights organization has sought to investigate human
 rights conditions or practices in Angola since independence.
 The 1978 and 1979 annual reports of Amnesty International
 did contain limited discussions of Angolan human rights
 conditions and practices.
