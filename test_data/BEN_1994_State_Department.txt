 BENIN
 The Republic of Benin is a constitutional democracy headed by President
 Nicephore Soglo, who was elected in free and fair elections in 1991. There are 24
 political parties represented in the 64-member National Assembly. No party or
 grouping commands a majority of seats. The President resorted to emergency pow-
 ers to pass his 1994 budget and fulfill the country's commitments to international
 financial institutions.
 The civilian-controlled security forces consist of the armed forces under the direc-
 tion of the Minister of Defense and the police force under the Minister of Interior.
 The two ministers also share authority over the gendarmerie, which exercises police
 functions in rural areas. Although the military continued to play an apolitical role
 in government affairs, there were some concerns about morale within its ranks, its
 ethnic imbalance, and the depth of its commitment to constitutional rule.
 The economy is based largely on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, re-
 gional trade, and small-scale offshore oil production. The Government continued its
 austerity program to privatize state-owned enterprises, reduce fiscal expenditures
 and deregulate trade. However, the country continues to suffer from a bloated and
 inefficient bureaucracy, high debt-servicing costs, and widespread unemployment.
 Overall, the Government continued to respect the fundamental rights provided for
 in the 1990 Constitution. The major human rights problems continued to be the fail-
 ure by police forces to curtail acts of vigilantism and mob justice; serious adminis-
 trative delays in processing criminal cases with attendant denial of timely fair
 trials; harsh and unhealthy prison conditions; societal discrimination and violence
 against women and the abuse of children. The Government finally brought to trial
 those detained for coup plotting in 1992; it acquitted 3 and convicted 24 persons.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killing.
 
 
 9
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment,
 and there were no reports that government forces employed it. The Government
 began making payments to victims of torture under the previous military regime
 which ruled from 1972 to 1989.
 A rising crime rate and a lack of police responsiveness led to more reports of mob
 justice. Mobs reportedly inflicted severe injuries on suspected criminals, particularly
 thieves caught in the act. Although a number of these incidents took place in urban
 areas, there were no indications that the Government investigated or prosecuted
 anyone involved.
 Prison conditions continue to be harsh. Extensive overrwding and lack of proper
 sanitation and medical facilities pose a risk to prisoners' health. The prison diet is
 grossly inadequate, and malnutrition and disease are common. Prisoners are al-
 lowed to meet with visitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits detention of
 persons for more than 48 hours without a hearing by a magistrate, whose order is
 required for continued detention. However, there were credible reports that authori-
 ties exceed this 48-hour limit in many cases, sometimes by as much as a week,
 using the accepted practice of holding a person without specified time limit 'at the
 disposition of" the public prosecutor's office before presenting the case to a mag-
 istrate. There were no reports of incommunicado detention. Approximately 75 per-
 cent of prisoners are pretrial detainees. Arbitrary arrest is not routine but does
 occur occasionally.
 There were no reports that the Government held any political detainees at year's
 end. Early in 1994 the Government provisionally released, pending their trials, the
 country's former intelligence chief and his deputy who allegedly carried out acts of
 torture under the old regime. The Government had held the pair on charges of tor-
 ture, one since late 1991, the other since late 1992.
 President Soglo at the end of the year announced a one-half reduction in the pris-
 on terms of those convicted of offenses after August 1. He excluded those sentenced
 for murder and certain other felonies, as well as those convicted of embezzlement
 Of public funds.
 August the Government began the trial of a group of 27, largely military offi-
 cers, of whom 16 were tried in absentia. Most had been held for over 2 years; inter-
 national human rights groups had expressed concern. The trial ended in September.
 The Constitution prohibits forced exile of any citizens, and many who went into
 exile under previous governments have returned.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The legal system is based on French civil law and
 local customary law. A civilian court system operates on the national and provincial
 levels. Military disciplinary councils deal with minor offenses by military members
 but have no jurisdiction over civilians. There is only one court of appeals.
 The President appoints career magistrates as judges in civil courts. Although the
 Constitution provides that the Ministry of Justice has administrative authority over
 judges, officials are answerable only to the law in carrying out their duties. The
 Ministry may, however, transfer judges. nadeqate facilities and overcrowded dock-
 ets result in slow administration of justice. The relatively low salaries of mag-
 istrates and clerks have a demoralizing effect on their commitment to efficient and
 timely justice and make them susceptible to corruption.
 A defendant has the right to be present at trial and to representation by an attor-
 ney, at public expense if necessary. In practice, the court provides indigent defend-
 ants court-appointed counsel upon request. Trials are open to the public.
 The Supreme Court is the court of last resort in all administrative and judicial
 matters, and the new Constitutional Court is charged with passing on the constitu-
 tionality of laws. The Constitutional Court, seated in June 1993, decides disputes
 between the President and the National Assembly. Its rulings against both the exec-
 utive and legislative branches indicated its independence from these two branches
 of government. The Constitution also provides that a High Court of Justice convene
 when necessary to preside over crimes against the nation committed by the Presi-
 dent or government ministers.
 The Government held no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With PWacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for, and the Government respected in practice, the inviolabil-
 ity of private property and the home, as well as the privacy of personal correspond-
 ence and communications. Police are required to obtain a judicial warrant before en-
 tering a private home, a requirement observed in practice.

 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion and of the press and other media; the Government generally respected these
 rights. There is a large and active private press consisting of more than a dozen
 private newspapers. A major new independent daily newspaper which frequently
 criticizes the Government began publishing in 1994.
 The Government continued to own and operate the local radio and television sta-
 tions and a daily newspaper, the media most influential in reaching the public. Nev-
 ertheless, journalists continued to cover sensitive matters and to criticize the Gov-
 ernment. This included strong criticism of the President's exercise of emergency
 powers to implement the budget.
 A major increase in defamation suits accompanied the rise of the free press. Due
 to the President's grant of a reduction in sentences, authorities released a journalist
 early who had been convicted in 1993 of libel and sentenced to 1 year in prison.
 The Government does not censor foreign books or artistic works and foreign periodi-
 cals are widely available at newsstands. The High Authority for Audio-Visual and
 Communications (HAAC), a new constitutionally mandated body, began its prelimi-
 nary work to develop private radio stations. By year's end, it had not approved any
 licenses. The Government, without prior consultation with the HAAC, adopted two
 decrees in September which regulated movie and video clubs.
 In general, academic freedom is respected. University professors are permitted to
 lecture freely, conduct research, and publish their work.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of peaceful assembly and association, and these rights were generally re-
 spected. The Government on two occasions disbanded labor meetigs (see Section
 6.a.). The Government requires permits for use of public places for demonstrations
 and requires associations to register. However, it routinely grants both permits and
 registrations. The Government did not take any actions against nonregistered orga-
 nizations for failure or refusal to register.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government observed it in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The presence of police, gendarmerie, and illegal roadblocks impedes do-
 mestic movement. Though ostensibly meant to enforce automotive safety and cus-
 toms .regulations, many of these checkpoints serve as a means for officials to exact
 bribes from travelers.
 The Government's policy toward transhumance allows migratory Fulani herdsmen
 from other countries to enter freely; it does not enforce designated entry points. In
 recent years, friction between native farmers and itinerant foreign herders has
 sometimes led to violence.
 The Government does not restrict international travel for political reasons, and
 those who travel abroad may return without hindrance. Benin hosts some 50,000
 Togolese refugees who are protected and assisted by the United Nations High Com-
 missioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The Togolese Government has pressured Benin to
 deny asylum and to repatriate refugees forcibly, most of whom are members of or
 are sympathetic to opposition groups. The Government has resisted this pressure
 and continues to maintain an open-door policy toward refugees. There were no re-
 ports of forced repatriation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised this constitutional right in free and fair elections in 1991. The
 Constitution provides for a 5-year term of office for the President (who is limited
 to 2 terms) and 4-year terms for National Assembly members (who may serve an
 unlimited number of terms). National Assembly elections are scheduled for March
 1995, with presidential elections in 1996. More than a dozen new parties were cre-
 ated in 1994; others folded or merged. Voting is by secret ballot and the franchise
 extends to all adults.
 Women participate actively in political parties, but there are only 2 women in the
 19-member Cabinet and 3 in the 64-member National Assembly. The President of
 the Constitutional Court is a woman, and the HAAC and the Economic and Social
 Council each have one female member.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) monitor human rights without
 restriction or interference by the Government. These organizations include: the
 Human Rights Commission; the Study and Research Group on Democracy and Eco-
 
 
 nomic and Social Development- the Association of Christians Against Torture; and
 the League for the Defense of Auman Rights in Benin. The Human Rights Commis-
 sion regularly investigated complaints it received about police violence, arbitrary ar-
 rests, illegal detentions, abuses of authority, and interference with labor rights.
 In 1994 the Government provided a detailed response to Amnesty International's
 1993 report on the human rights situation in Benin.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, and religion.
 Women.-Although the Constitution provides for equality for women in the politi-
 cal, economic, and social spheres, women experience extensive societal discrimina-
 tion, especially in rural areas, where they occupy a subordinate role and are respon-
 sible for much of the hard work on subsistence farms. In urban areas, women domi-
 nate the trading sector in the open-air markets. By law, women have equal inherit-
 ance and property rights, but local custom in some areas prevents them from inher-
 iting real prop   .  aomen are underrepresented in government positions and do
 not enjoy the same educational opportunities as men. In some parts of the country,
 girls receive no education at all.
 While no statistics are available, violence against women, including wife beating,
 occurs. It is not considered widespread. The press sometimes reports incidents of
 abuse of women, but judges and police are reluctant to intervene, considering such
 abuse a family matter.
 Children.-The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is charged generally with the
 protection of children's rights and focuses primarily on education and health issues.
 Tere is no brad pattern of societal abuse against children, nor is there child pros-
 titution. There are some traditional practices that inflict violene on children ainch
 the Government has been vigorous in its efforts to end, including prosecuting offend-
 ers. These practices include the killing of deformed babies (thought to be sorcerers
 in some rural areas) and a tradition in which a groom abducts and rapes the pr-
 spective (under 14 years of age) bride. In a much-publicized case in July, a criminal
 court sentenced a mother and her accomplices to 15 years in prison at hard labor
 for arranging the 1988 kidnapin and sale of her 8-year-old son.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to physical and mental health, is practiced on females at a young
 age as well as on teenage girls and women up to age 30. Studies su t at least
 4 percent of Beninese women ar   affected by this practice, mostly inthe northern
 provinces. Recent research by an NGO found that those who perform such
 circumcisions, themselves often elderly women, have a strong profit motive in the
 continued practice. The Government has  hperated with an Inter-African commit-
 tee working against FGM by making available locally produced posters and pam-
 plets at government health clinics even though FGM is not illegal.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Benin has a long history of regional rivalry.
 Although southerners dominate the Government's senior ranks, northerners domi-
 nate the military. The south has enjoyed more advanced economic development, a
 lagmer population, and has traditionally held favored status.
 Religous Minorities.-There is no official religion and no single dominant reimion.
 People With Disabiities.-Although the Constitution mandates that the State
 "look after the handicapped," the Government does not mandate accessibility for dis-
 abled persons. The Government operates a number of social centers for dibled per-
 sons to assist their social integration. Nonetheless, many are unable to find mp oy-
 ment and must resort to begging to support themselves.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-aThe Constitution provides workers with the freedom
 to organize, join unions, meet, and strike, and those rights are usually respected in
 practice. The labor force of about 2 million is primarily engaged in subsistence agri-
 culture (80 percent), with less than 2 percent of the population engaged in the mod-
 ern (wage) sector. Approximately 75 percent of wage earners belong to labor unions.
 There are four union confederations; confederations and individal unions have the
 right to affiliate internationally. Unions are genely independent of the Govern-
 ment and political parties, but there were growing efforts by3 some members of the
 National Assembly to coopt the unions in their disputes with the Government. The
 Economic and Social Council, a constitutionally mandated body installed in 1994,
 includes four union representatives.
 Th    er re several instances of labor unrest during 1994 and on two occasions
 the Government disbanded labor meetings. In July authorities denied permission for
 a labor demonstration owing to concern that it would disrupt normal business, then
 
 
 12
 intervened when the demonstration was held anyway. In January the Government
 prevented a union from meeting despite the fact that the union had conformed to
 normal procedures.
 There was a legal 3-day general strike in March called by the four labor unions
 to protest devaluation. There were no incidents or government intervention, even
 though the strike was highly disruptive. There were no known efforts to retaliate
 against strikers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectioely.-The Labor Code provides for
 collective bargaining, and workers freely exercised these rights. Wages in the pri-
 vate sector are set in negotiations between unions and employers. A tripartite
 group, composed of unions, employers, and the Government, discussed and agreed
 to revisions in the former labor code; these are now under consideration by the Na-
 tional Assembly. The Government sets wages in the public sector by law and regula-
 tion.
 The Labor Code prohibits employers from taking union membership or activity
 into account regarding hiring, work distribution, professional or vocational training,
 or dismissal. The Government levies substantial penalties against employers who
 refuse to rehire workers dismissed for lawful union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code prohibits the em-
 ployment or apprenticeship of children under the age of 14 in any enterprise. How-
 ever, the Ministry of Labor enforces the Code in only a limited manner. Child labor
 continues, on rural family farms, in urban areas, andas domestic servants.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government administratively sets mini-
 mum wage scales for a number of occupations. The minimum wage is approximately
 $39 per month (20,300 CFA), not enough to cover the costs for food and housing of
 even a single worker living in an urban area. Many workers must supplement their
 wages by subsistence farming or in informal sector trade. Most workers in the wage
 sector, however, earn more than the minimum wage.
 The Labor Code establishes a workweek of from 40 to 56 hours, depending on the
 type of work, and provides for at least one 24-hour rest period per week. The au-
 thorities generally enforce legal limits on workweeks. The Labor Code establishes
 health and safety standards, but the Ministry of Labor does not enforce them effec-
 tively. The Labor Code does not provide workers with the right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
 The Ministry of Labor has the authority to require employers to remedy dangerous
 working conditions, but does not do so effectively.
