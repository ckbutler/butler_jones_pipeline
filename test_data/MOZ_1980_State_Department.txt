 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambique gained its independence from Portugal in 1975
 after a ten-year war between the Portuguese and FRELIMO
 (Front for the Liberation of Mozambique). FRELIMO is now
 the sole political party in Mozambique. It subscribes to
 the principles of Marxism-Leninism. The constitution pro-
 mulgated at independence guarantees the primacy of the
 party over the government and provides that the President
 of FRELIMO is the President of Mozambique. Many important
 government leaders also hold important positions within
 party.
 At independence only a small percentage of Mozambicans was
 literate. The government has worked with some effect to
 meet the basic human needs of the population. Civil and
 political liberties are considerably circumscribed. During
 the past year there were indications of some relaxation
 of the government's previous restrictions on religious prac-
 tice. Many people remain detained in reeducation camps
 without formal charges but the number of detainees has
 decreased. In 1980 Mozambique maintained its good record
 in advancing racial and ethnic harmony.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There have been no reports of torture, which is prohibited
 by statutory law, being practiced or countenanced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel or inhuman punishment is prohibited by statutory law.
 Conditions in prisons and reeducation centers are severe.
 Food and availability of medical assistance is barely ade-
 quate. These conditions in part reflect nationwide short-
 ages. Prisoners held on criminal charges sometimes are
 allowed visitors; those confined in reeducation centers
 for political prisoners also are allowed visitors although
 few do, given the distance of the camps from Mozambique's
 major population centers.
 No substantiated allegations of corporal punishment in-
 flicted in the prisons or at the camps were received.
 Approximately 35 executions without the right of appeal
 were carried out against individuals convicted of collabo-
 ration with Rhodesia during the Zimbabwe war. In October
 1980 three men were condemned to death by the Revolutionary
 Military Tribunal for espionage and military sabotage and
 executed. No apparent differentiation by social class,
 race, sex or religion is made in treatment of detainees or
 sentencing.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of disappearances in Mozambique
 occurring at government instigation.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under the broad powers granted to the President by the con-
 stitution, detention without trial is practiced frequently,
 ostensibly for purposes of rehabilitation and political
 "reeducation." Knowledgeable sources indicate that between
 2,000 and 10,000 persons remain in detention in reeducation
 camps. The government has declined to provide authorita-
 tive figures on the number of detainees. These detainees
 originally were arrested for having fought alongside the
 former colonial power, engaging in corrupt practices, or
 for criminal acts. In late 1979, the government released
 more than 1,100 individuals formerly held in reeducation
 camps in Niassa province. Habeas corpus, guaranteed by law,
 is honored sometimes but frequently is unavailable because
 persons have been detained without declaration of a specific
 charge. Sentences and limits on periods of detention are
 respected in some, but not all, cases. When rehabilitation
 is deemed complete, prisoners are released and reintegrated
 into society. In some cases, officials accused of corrup-
 tion or negligenbe have returned from detention to their
 former positions or been given equally important positions
 in government upon their release.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution provides that the accused shall have the
 right of defense, that judges shall be independent, and
 that no person may be incarcerated or tried except under
 the law. In urban areas, courts function reasonably well.
 In rural parts of the country, popularly elected "people's
 tribunals" exercise judicial responsibilities. Trained
 judges "ride the circuit" to oversee the operation of
 these tribunals and to hear important cases and appeals from
 lower courts' decisions. In some cases persons are tried
 and sentenced by a state security official and have no re-
 course to any trial. Although guaranteed in all but excep-
 tional cases, public trials are not held. Since the aboli-
 tion of the private practice of law in 1975, all legal
 counsel is provided by the state. The Revolutionary Mili-
 tary Tribunal (RMT) is a military court established in 1979
 to try cases "against the people and state security." It
 was created when Mozambique was under Rhodesian attack and
 in a virtual state of war. Defendants before the RMT are
 not guaranteed the right to a fair public trial. Scores
 of civilians accused of collaboration with Rhodesia were
 given long prison sentences by the RMT; approximately 38
 were sentenced to death and executed.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution guarantees sanctity of the home. This
 principle is not honored when authorities suspect a threat
 to the security of the state. Electronic surveillance by
 state authorities is widely believed to exist in the tele-
 phone network.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The government has chosen a socialist model for its economy
 and development. Nevertheless, the constitution guarantees
 the right to own private property. Laws enacted by the
 government allow an individual and his nuclear family to own
 
 
 182
 two properties--one for residence and one for recreation.
 Foreign investment is permitted, and the government has
 sought actively to attract foreign firms in joint enter-
 prises designed to further the development of the country.
 Mozambique has strict wage and price controls to contain
 inflation and satisfy the precepts of socialism. In 1980,
 wage earners were generally paid a salary adequate to meet
 the cost of price-controlled necessities. A new schedule
 increasing wages and salaries by roughly 20 percent was
 announced in September. There was considerable unemploy-
 ment and underemployment in urban areas, but no figures are
 available on the magnitude of the problem. Annual per
 capita income is about $170. The economy continued to show
 modest improvement in 1980, with notable increases in
 foreign earnings from the export of seafood, sugar and tea.
 Prices paid for staple agricultural products, although
 increased in 1980, did not always provide a fair return on
 investment and labor. Much labor in the countryside con-
 tinued to take place on subsistence plots outside the money
 economy. A severe drought continued for a second year.
 The government and international organizations confirmed
 the existence of related malnutrition and physical in-
 firmities affecting an estimated 1,500,000 in the six
 southern provinces. The government promptly mobilized
 domestic and international organizations to bring relief
 to the affected regions and people. Economic and social
 programs are administered to all without discernible dis-
 crimination.
 At independence, the new government inherited an economy
 weakened by the effects of the liberation struggle and the
 precipitate departure of an estimated 200,000 Portuguese
 settlers who had controlled the economy and the administra-
 tion of the former colony. The number of educated or
 trained Mozambicans was very small. At least 95 percent of
 the population was illiterate. Health care did not exist
 outside the few major cities, and access to health care was
 generally restricted to non-Mozambicans by application of
 fees beyond the means of all but a handful of the indige-
 nous population.
 Following independence, Mozambique was progressively drawn
 into the Rhodesian conflict. The government imposed
 internationally mandated economic sanctions against the
 illegal government of Rhodesia and suffered an estimated
 loss of $500 million in foregone income during the four
 years sanctions were imposed. Only a small fraction of
 this lost income was compensated for by the international
 community. Mozambican territory and citizens became tar-
 gets for military attacks and incursions from Rhodesia and
 Rhodesia-supported Mozambican dissidents as the government
 offered support and sanctuary to Zimbabwean forces. The
 resulting casualties and war damage have been considerable.
 Dissidents were still active in 1980 and reportedly received
 foreign support.
 In 1980 the industrial sector continued to suffer from a
 shortage of raw materials, spare parts, and trained per-
 sonnel which contributed to low levels of productivity.
 The government, beginning in January 1980, began a campaign
 to stimulate industrial and service sectors of the economy.
 It began to return certain small businesses, such as shops,
 
 
 183
 restaurants, and hairdressers, to the private sector. Vigorous
 measures were instituted to root out corrupt, incompetent
 and inefficient workers and administrators. The government
 continued to subsidize prices of staple foods and other
 necessities of life. It also announced that a program of
 rationing these items to assure family groups an adequate
 supply would be put into effect in early 1981.
 Since independence the population of Mozambique's capital,
 Maputo, has grown as a result of internal migration.
 Government efforts to provide health, education, and social
 services in the countryside have retarded this migration
 only marginally, since employment and social advantages in
 the capital city remain a sfrong attraction. An estimated
 35,000 to 50,000 Mozambican males, seeking higher wages,
 annually obtain employment in the mines of South Africa.
 The population is growing at a rapid rate as the govern-
 ment's successful efforts in health care have increased
 longevity and reduced infant mortality. A nationwide
 census was completed in September' but its results have
 not yet been revealed. Previous government figures put the
 the population at 11,500,000.
 Medical care is nationalized and available at very low
 cost, although its effectiveness is limited by a shortage
 of facilities, doctors and other medical personnel. The
 government has stressed preventive medicine. Since inde-
 pendence in 1975 it has conducted several campaigns to
 vaccinate its citizens against common infant and adult
 afflictionsr In mid-1980 government health officials
 innoculated virtually the entire population of Maputo and
 other affected areas following an outbreak of cholera.
 Government health care reportedly has provided 95 percent
 of the population with innoculation against cholera, smalT-
 pox, tuberculosis and measles.
 The government continued in 1980 to place heavy emphasis on
 education. Primary school enrollment was claimed to be 1.6
 million, or three times the number at independence. The
 government reported that approximately half of the adult
 population had been or was then involved in the literacy
 program, with an estimated 300,000 new adults enrolled in
 1980. These figures, however, are diffcult to verify.
 According to data provided to the United Nations in 1980,
 the government allocated approximately 50 percent of its
 budget to the economic sector. This sum includes invest-
 ment in agriculture, public works, transport and communi-
 cations. Nearly 20 percent reportedly was spent in the
 social sectors for education, health and social security.
 The remaining elements of the budget were defense, 15 per-
 cent; government, 12 percent; and public debt and other-
 state expenditures, four percent.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Although the constitution provides that all citizens enjoy
 freedom of assembly and association, constraints on these
 rights continued in 1980. The media in Mozambique is gov-
 ernment controlled. Articles criticizing government, the
 party, their members and policies appear only with prior
 government approval. The government allows importation of
 
 
 184
 foreign books and publications from socialist countries
 and some Western and African countries, but only if those
 publications are deemed to further political, moral, econ-
 omic or social objectives.
 Freedom of assembly does not exist. Mass movements such as
 the National Women's Organization and the National Youth
 Organization are supervised by FRELIMO. Labor associations
 are extensions of the party apparatus. The government has
 encouraged the creation of quasi-official workers' assem-
 blies and production groups at industrial and commercial
 enterprises. Their role is largely to resolve problems
 between management and the labor force. The rights to
 strike, organize freely or bargain collectively are not
 recognized. Forced labor is not practiced and there is
 equal employment opportunity. Mozambique is a member of
 the International Labor Organization.
 Religious freedom is guaranteed in the constitution and
 individuals are assured the right *to practice or not
 practice." Mozambique is a secular state. The govern-
 ment views organized religion as a competitor for the
 allegiance of its citizens and in providing certain social
 benefits. Traditional animist practices are also criti-
 cized by the government. In 1980 there was some relaxation
 in the government's attitude toward religion. Criticism of
 religion in the media decreased. Restrictions on the
 on the movements and activities of, the Catholic clergy
 and church administration were somewhat relaxed in that the
 clergy were increasingly granted permission to travel Out-
 side their parishes. Communication was increased between
 the government and the Catholic Church. Muslims were
 granted a two-day holiday at the end of the month of fast-
 ing. A few formerly closed Protestant churches were
 allowed to reopen and resume services. The contributions
 of religious charitable groups to the relief of Zimbabwe
 refugees and Mozambicans affected by the war in Zimbabwe
 were gratefully acknowledged by the government. In
 general, however, FRELIMO and the government remain sus-
 picious of organized religion and discourage its practice
 through administrative measures and frequent criticism of
 the past role of the church in Mozambique.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Al4hough citizens may travel freely within the country,
 resident aliens must give prior'notification of trips away
 from their places of residence. Non-citizens may emigrate,
 although there are strict regulations on the removal from
 the country of money and property. Emigration of citizens
 is permitted at the discretion of the government on a case-
 by-case basis. Foreign travel is routinely approved for
 business, education, medical treatment, tourism, and
 humanitarian reasons. The right of return is honored.
 Passport fees are modest. Women receive the same treatment
 as do men in matters of internal and foreign travel, emi-
 gration and repatriation.
 In the spring of 1980, the governments of Mozambique and
 Swaziland reportedly signed an agreement under which citi-
 zens who had sought refuge in each other's country could be
 forcibly repatriated. In May, the Maputo press reported that
 a group of 23 Mozambicans who had sought employment and asy-
 
 
 185
 lum in Swaziland had been handed over to the authorities
 in Mozambique by the Swaziland government. There is evi-
 dence that the actual number forcibly repatriated may have
 been considerably larger and that some may have been in-
 carcerated or otherwise persecuted by the Mozambique
 government.
 Mozambique bore the brunt of the exodus of refugees flee-
 ing the fighting in Zimbabwe (Rhodesia). At the time of
 Zimbabwe's independence an estimated 150,000 refugees from
 that country were in Mozambique. The government made
 available to the refugees land for camps, construction
 materials, social services, and some food and clothes as
 part of the international relief effort. In mid-1980, in
 cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees and the Zimbabwean government, those refugees
 seeking repatriation returned to their country. A large
 but unknown number of Zimbabweans remain in Mozambique
 voluntarily.
 Mozambicans during the colonial period and since indepen-
 dence have gone to neighboring countries for political
 reasons and for improved economic opportunities. A fairly
 small number of Mozambicans have sought political asylum
 in neighboring and other countries since 1975. In the
 spring of 1980 President Machel made an appeal to Mozam-
 bicans outside the country to return to assist in re-
 vitalizing the economy and developing the country. No
 figures are available on the response to his appeal.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Mozambique is a one-party state controlled by FRELIMO.
 FRELIMO advocates a society based on Marxist-Leninist pre-
 cepts. The party's membership is a small part of the
 total population. There is some opportunity for intra-
 party debate, but opposition political movements are not
 permitted.
 There is universal suffrage for adults. At the local and
 district levels there is spirited competition for public
 office. A single slate of candidates, prepared by party
 organs and military representatives, is presented for a
 community's consideration. Candidates are then endorsed
 or rejected. Ordinary citizens are encouraged to make
 their views known to party and government officials.
 Election to provincial and national assemblies is in-
 direct.
 Women are constitutionally guaranteed the same civic
 rights and duties as men. The government and the party
 have promoted the concept that all citizens, including
 women, must take an equal responsibility in society.
 Women participate in all aspects of political life and a
 few hold senior positions in the party and government.
 Urban women seem to have the same access to training and
 positions of authority as do men. The National Women's
 Organization is given attention and status designed to
 ensure that women enjoy equal rights and the full protec-
 tion of the law. The organization is particularly active
 in areas of development, adult education, literacy and
 social services.

 4. Governqent Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No outside investigations of human rights are known to
 have been conducted in Mozambique, or to have been re-
 quested by international organizations. Amnesty Inter-
 national's 1980 Report  states that Amnesty's main concerns
 were detention without trial, political imprisonment and
 the death penalty. The report notes that the "reeducation
 camps" include more than 50 officials arrested in early
 1980, when President Machel personally initiated a couhtry-
 wide purge of alleqed corruption, maladministration and
 negligence in state-run enterprises. Mozambique is not a
 signatory to any refugee conventions. However, its per-
 formance in assisting Zimbabwean refugees and supporting
 many of them for up to five years was in the spirit of the
 1951 Convention on Refugees.
