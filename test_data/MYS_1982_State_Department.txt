 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia is a multi-ethnic society in which Malays dominate
 political affairs while ethnic Chinese and, to a lesser extent,
 ethnic Indians continue to play leading roles in the economy.
 Malaysia has a parliamentary system of government and the
 legitimacy of its regime is based on winning power through
 elections. Elections are free and contested by a number of
 parties; the ruling National Front (composed of parties
 representing the major ethnic communities), however, has
 consistently won a two-thirds or better majority in the federal
 parliament. Malaysia has a strong free enterprise economy and
 is one of the most prosperous of developing countries, though
 over the last year it has begun to feel the ilpact of the world
 recession.
 The Government has placed among its highest priorities avoidance
 of a repetition of the severe violence which followed the May
 1969 elections when several hundred persons were reported to
 have died in communal riots in Kuala Lumpur. Moreover, the
 Communist Party of Malaya has been engaged in an armed struggle
 with the Government since 1948 and, though the insurrection is
 well under control and the last serious upsurge was in 1975,
 the government counter-insurgency effort continues to suffer a
 small number of Malaysian police and military personnel killed
 or maimed annually.
 This insurgency and the possibility of renewed communal conflict
 are cited by the Malaysian Government as justification for
 legislation which makes legal both trial under circumstances
 which circumscribe the normal judicial protections guaranteed
 to a defendant and the arrest and detention without trial of
 persons suspected of subversive activity or of other activities
 that threaten general civic order. Despite these problems, the
 state of human rights in Malaysia is relatively good and has
 improved in the past year. In its report for 1982, Freedom
 House classified Malaysia as 'partly free.o A generally
 independent judiciary and a functioning parliamentary system
 safeguard most fundamental human rights.
 The administration of Prime Minister Mahathir has continued the
 policy it began when it came to power in 1981 of releasing
 considerable numbers of individuals held in detention without
 trial, but it has consistently asserted that it will maintain
 intact the framework of security legislation for the foreseeable
 future. There have, however, been some indications that there
 may be a long-term trend toward easing the implementation of
 the legislation, though it is too early to tell whether this
 trend will be borne out by future events.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no instances during the past year of killing of
 opposition or other figures by the Government. (In July 1982
 one cabinet minister was arrested and charged with the murder
 of a political rival within the ruling Malay party.) Malaysian
 police and military personnel have been killed by communist
 insurgents. The insurgents receive moral backing from the
 Chinese and other foreign communist parties, but are not
 officially supported by any foreign government.
 
 
 762
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention although the Government does detain
 people without trial. The government also reserves the right
 to refuse requests for information on specific individuals
 detained under security legislation and some detainees have
 reported not knowing where they were being held during periods
 of confinement.
 c. Torture
 The federal Constitution of Malaysia prohibits torture or
 cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.
 A defendant in a recent trial alleged that police utilized
 harsh and prolonged interrogation techniques on him, and the
 Government has promised an investigation of the matter.
 There have been no other reported instances of torture.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 As mentioned above, such behavior is constitutionally prohi-
 bited. The Constitution stipulates against any derogation of
 the relevant protective provisions. Though capital offense
 trials under the Internal Security Act fall short of normal
 judicial protection, summary executions are not carried out
 and convictions which carry the death penalty are automatically
 subject to appeal to the Federal Court and the Pardons Board.
 Poor living conditions and inadequate medical attention during
 incarceration have in earlier years been reported by former
 detainees or relatives of detainees. In August 1982, a
 delegation of attorneys from France, Japan and the U.S.
 representing various human rights groups who came to Malaysia
 to look into human rights matters briefly visited some prisons
 and Internal Security Act detention camps. They said publicly
 that conditions seemed reasonably good and that they had found
 no specific instances or claims of brutality. They felt,
 however, that Malaysian efforts to rehabilitate detainees
 and get them to sign confessions, while not involving brutal
 treatment, verged on 'brainwashing.'
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Malaysian Constitution provides for the proclamation of
 a state of emergency during which individual rights may be
 limited by law. A state of emergency has existed since it was
 proclaimed in May 1969 during communal rioting. Legislation
 granting extraordinary powers to the Government enables arrest
 and imprisonment without benefit of trial or the right of
 habeas corpus. The Deputy Prime Minister told an audience of
 diplomats and foreign journalists in June 1982 that the number
 of detainees had dropped from 540 when Prime Minister Mahathir
 took power in 1981 to 394. An additional 47 were released to
 commemorate Malaysia's 25th anniversary on August 31, 1982.
 Most of the detainees are allegedly members or supporters of
 the Communist Party of Malaya, with the bulk of the remainder
 characterized by the Government as religious extremists.
 In its report covering 1981, Amnesty International welcomed the
 releases, but stated its concern about the fate of others still
 being held under the Internal Security Act.
 The Malaysian Government considers the communist threat and
 continuing communal tensions to be adequate justification for
 the use of emergency powers, first embodied in regulations by
 the British and later extended and made more comprehensive by
 Malaysian legislation. These regulations permit arrest and
 detention without trial of persons suspected of subversive
 activity and other actions contributing to domestic instability.
 Known as the Internal Security Act and the Emergency (Public
 
 
 763
 Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance 1969 (E.O.), they
 provide for initial preventive detention for up to two years,
 which can be extended indefinitely. A person detained under
 the emergency laws has no recourse to the courts, but as soon
 as possible after arrest must be told the reason and given an
 opportunity to challenge the detention order.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Modeled on the British judiciary, the Malaysian courts are
 generally regarded by the public and the legal community as
 committed to the rule of law. The courts have usually accepted
 the philosophy that it is not their place to overturn parliamen-
 tary legislation, taking the view that the Government can be
 trusted not to abuse its powers. At the same time, they have
 not hesitated to rule against government prosecutors in
 specific cases, both civil and criminal.
 Defendants have the right to counsel, and lawyers are able to
 represent dissidents without penalty to themselves. Most civil
 and criminal cases are tried under this judicial system and
 thus public trial and a fair hearing occur in all but a small
 minority of cases. In non-security related cases, the courts
 apply criminal law and procedures, including strict rules of
 evidence. Charges must be levied against a defendant within 24
 hours of arrest and the police must decide within 14 days
 whether to bring the case to court.
 Persons detained for security reasons and certain classes of
 crimes, however, are held and given hearings under special
 procedures outside the ordinary court system which do not
 afford these basic legal safeguards. The Government uses the
 Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance 1969, which is designed
 to deal with terrorism and political violence, as the basis for
 regulations that substantially diminish the rights of the
 accused by allowing presumption of guilt, in-camera trial, and
 anonymous witnesses. The Government contends that it has never
 invoked these latter two powers. These regulations are used in
 a limited number of security cases when the accused is brought
 to trial rather than simply detained under the Internal
 Security Act.
 I
 These procedures allow suspects to be held without charge for
 seven days, a period which can be renewed for an additional 60
 days. The accused does not receive a statement of the evidence.
 Trial is by a single judge, without a jury. Special procedures
 for examination of witnesses are authorized, including in the
 absence of the accused. Admissibility of evidence includes
 hearsay and secondary evidence, testimony of children and
 spouses, self-incriminating statements to police, information
 from seized records or communications, and evidence by
 affidavit. If the accused is found guilty, the judge must
 impose the maximum penalty (including death, where applicable).
 The Malaysian.Federal Court upheld the constitutionality of
 the mandatory death penalty for Internal Security Act crimes in
 September 1982.
 While the constitutionality of the mandatory death sentence was
 being challenged, executions under the Internal Security Act
 were postponed. The first execution since the constitutionality
 of the mandatory death sentence was upheld took place on
 December 12, 1982. There are reports that as many as sixty
 Internal Security Act prisoners are awaiting execution.
 Defendants (and prosecutors in all trials) may appeal lower
 court decisions to the federal courts. In criminal cases,
 defendants may also appeal for royal clemency to the King or
 the local state rulers, as appropriate.
 Military courts in Malaysia do not try civilians.
 
 
 764
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home is generally limited to cases involving
 security legislation. In its counter-insurgency efforts against
 the communist party, the Government makes extensive use of its
 powers under the Internal Security Act to enter and search the
 homes of suspects. In non-security cases, police of inspector
 rank or higher may search homes without a warrant if they have
 reason to believe a crime has occurred.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Tension between Malays and ethnic Chinese led to race riots in
 1969 and the suspension of parliamentary democracy for two
 years. Since then, under the Constitution (Amendment) Act of
 1971, certain 'sensitive" policies touching on ethnic origins
 or (generally Malay) privileges may not be questioned in public
 or in the parliament. The state of emergency legally proclaimed
 during the 1969 communal rioting continues in effect.
 The emergency laws are designed to reduce the risk of communal
 violence by'forbidding any public exacerbation of racial
 tensions.
 Radio and television are government-controlled. The media
 are constrained by the constitutional prohibitions against
 discussions of 'sensitive" topics. Mindful of the need for
 annual renewal of publishing licenses and generally owned by
 the government coalition parties, the press is circumspect in
 its treatment of government policies.
 Journalists have also occasionally been detained, as in the
 case of two journalists for a Malay language newspaper last
 year who were held in connection with "possible involvement in
 allowing the paper to be used to spread communist propaganda.'
 Both were released in 1982.
 Issues of foreign publications have sometimes been removed
 from circulation or delayed in distribution. There are no
 other restrictions on what may be printed, however, and the
 activities and statements of opposition political figures and
 domestic political developments are covered. Moreover, the
 press reports on violations of legal standards with respect to
 non-sensitive and approved issues and acts as an informal
 ombudsman, as do the parliamentary opposition and the active
 bar association.
 Academic staff members, professors, and students are kept
 under tight restrictions. There are no independent student or
 academic bodies on the campuses and professors are proscribed
 from public comments on controversial issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Malaysian Constitution guarantees the rights of freedom,
 peaceable assembly, and association, although the Constitution
 also grants the Government extensive powers to limit those
 rights by legislation in the interest of security and public
 order. In 1981, the parliament amended the Constitution to
 allow the Minister of Home Affairs to regulate more strictly
 all organizations attempting to influence government policy and
 to preclude judicial review of these actions. In practice, the
 1981 revision of the Societies Act and trade union legislation
 requires that most organizations be registered with the Govern-
 ment and thus subject to close control. In the wake of the
 communal disturbances of 1969, the Government passed laws
 greatly limiting the right to public assembly by large groups.
 
 
 765
 The Malaysian trade union movement consists of 366 separate
 unions representing 594,791 workers, or 15 percent of salaried
 workers. Unions are most active in the plantation, transport,
 and education sectors, but are not permitted in several key
 manufacturing areas, including the electronics plants in the
 free trade zones. Unions exercise considerable freedom In
 pushing "bread-and-butter" issues, but have largely stayed out
 of the political arena. Still, the Government of Malaysia is
 quite sensitive to possible political actions by the labor
 movement and plays an active role in labor relations to
 .ensure that the security and economic life of the nation are
 protected." This attitude, combined with a disruptive strikp
 against the Malaysian national airline in late 1979, led to the
 adoption of amendments to the Industrial Relations Act in May
 1980. These amendments expanded the Government's role and
 placed tighter controls on labor activities; they also drew
 International Labor Organization criticism as running counter
 to the principles of freedom of association.
 While strikes are allowed in Malaysia, the Government rapidly
 refers most industrial disputes to binding arbitration in labor
 courts, at which point strikes must cease. The Malaysian Trade
 Union Congress is the umbrella organization for unions in
 Malaysia, with affiliates representing about half the union
 members. The Malaysian Trade Union Congress maintains close
 relations with international bodies and unions, including the
 International Labor Organization, the International Confedera-
 tion of Free Trade Unions, and the AFL-CIO through the Asian-
 American Free Labor Institute. Malaysian Trade Union Congress
 President Dr. P.P. Narayanan is serving his second term as
 president of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. There has been growing friction in the Malaysian labor
 movement over the past few years, as the Government has adopted
 a more aggressive policy vis-a-vis the Malaysian Trade Union
 Congress and the "confrontational" style of its leadership.
 The Malaysian Trade Union Congress has also been weakened by
 the splintering off of several large civil service unions.
 Other issues in Malaysian industrial relations include (a) the
 role of the labor movement's Indian leadership relative to the
 Government's desire to encourage greater ethnic participation
 by ethnic Malays in the economy under the "New Economic
 Policy;" and (b) the effect of the 1981 revision of the
 Societies Act, which may force Malaysian labor bodies to opt
 between becoming "friendly societies" (and sacrifice rights to
 criticize the government on labor issues and support political
 candidates) or "political societies" (which would among other
 limitations force them to cut ties with foreign bodies).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 While the state religion of Malaysia is Islam and Malaysian
 Muslims are legally bound by Islamic religious laws, the
 federal Government itself does not discriminate against
 practitioners of other religious faiths. In Malaysia, the
 latter include Hinduism, Buddhism, Chinese religions, and
 Christianity. Conversion is permitted, but attempts to
 proselytize among Muslims is forbidden. Attempts of Malaysian
 Muslim fundamentalists to extend the enforcement of Islamic
 laws against non-Muslim Malaysians and even other nationalities
 have caused concern and controversy. The Government has
 regularly declared in parliament in response to the fundamen-
 talist challenge that it would not accede to demands for wider
 enforcement of Islamic law, pointing out that Malaysia is a
 multi-religious country. The judiciary has also spoken out
 against replacing common law with Islamic law.
 
 
 766
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Persons wishing to travel abroad must obtain passports, which
 have been denied in a few cases on what the Government terms
 security grounds. The Government also restricts travel to
 China by ethnic Chinese citizens. Travel between peninsular
 Malaysia and the Borneo states of Sabah and Sarawak is
 constitutionally subject to control by those state governments
 as the result of conditions imposed by the Sabah and Sarawak
 governments at the time of their accession to the federation.
 The Sabah and Sarawak governments have on several occasions
 arbitrarily denied entry to opposition politicians and
 journalists from peninsular Malaysia and abroad, though use of
 these exclusionary powers has declined. Malaysian citizens are
 not barred from returning to the country after residence abroad,
 although acceptance of foreign citizenship or its benefits may
 lead to loss of Malaysian citizenship.
 Malaysia continues to play a key role in providing temporary
 asylum for boat refugees from Vietnam and has taken in over
 174,000 Indochinese refugees since 1975. To date almost all
 of these refugees have been resettled in other countries.
 Malaysia has accepted about 5,000 Muslim Khmer refugees for
 permanent resettlement. Generally, Malaysia has not forced
 refugees to return to homelands from which they have fled;
 however, in 1975, during the floodtide period of refugee exodus
 and expulsion of ethnic Chinese from Vietnam, Malaysia forced
 back to sea thousands of refugees attempting to land along the
 east coast. In late 1982, there were reports that local Malay
 authorities have denied permission to refugee boats from
 Vietnam to land and have forced them to sail on to Indonesia.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Malaysia has a parliamentary system based on the British model,
 with a prime minister and cabinet responsible to parliament.
 The head of state is a constitutional monarch elected for a
 five-year term by the sultans of those Malaysian states which
 are sultanates (nine of thirteen) from among their own members.
 The bicameral parliament consists of a senate (with both
 appointed and elected members) and an elected house of
 representatives, where a small but vocal opposition criticizes
 the Government regularly. Legislative power is further divided
 between federal and state legislatures. State executive admini-
 strations attend to matters .of local concern. Elections on the
 basis of universal suffrage are held at no more than five-year
 intervals as specified by the Constitution. The last national
 parliamentary elections were held in April 1982, when the
 ruling National Front coalition won 132 of 154 seats (of which
 144 were contested).
 In parliamentary and state assembly elections, the National
 Front takes full advantage of its incumbency, and in recent
 elections it has prohibited public rallies, a factor which
 seriously inhibits the opposition. Even the opposition
 concedes, however, that popular votes are cast freely and
 secretly and are recorded accurately. In the 1982 state
 assembly elections, the success of one opposition party, the
 Islamic Party, which increased its representation from 10 to
 18 seats in state legislatures, tends to support this view.
 The position of women in Malaysian society is relatively
 unrestricted, within the constraints of Islam and other
 Eastern cultures in the country. Women have full voting
 rights. Malaysia now has two women cabinet ministers:
 Welfare Services, appointed in 1978, and Public Enterprises,
 appointed in 1980. Two female deputy ministers were'appointed
 in 1982. Political parties representing both Chinese and Indian
 
 
 767
 minorities are part of the ruling National Front. There are
 six Chinese and one Indian serving as cabinet ministers and
 eight Chinese and two Indians as deputy ministers.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Malaysian Government is not a member of any international
 or regional human rights bodies, though individual Malaysians
 and organizations belong to the International Bar Association,
 the Law Association for Asia and the Western Pacific/Australia
 (LAWASIA), and the International Commission of Jurists.
 The Government has not been the subject of resolutions,
 investigations, or other human rights actions by human rights
 organizations.
 In 1982, however, the Government of Malaysia came under
 considerable criticism from human rights organizations, most
 particularly Amnesty International. Their criticisms involved
 continued detention without trial under the Internal Security
 Act and the fact that the death sentence is the mandatory
 penalty for certain Internal Security Act crimes, including
 ones not involving actual commission of violent acts.
 The Government has taken the position that the Internal
 Security Act will remain in effect and that Malaysia is
 the best and sole judge of its security needs.
 At the same time the Government has been willing at the highest
 level to explain its human rights policies to outside visitors.
 In August 1982, for example, the Prime Minister met with a
 visiting delegation of attorneys representing various inter-
 national human rights groups which was in Malaysia to look into
 human rights questions. The Prime Minister has also publicly
 stated, in reply to an apparent query by Amnesty International,
 that Amnesty International would be free to send representatives
 to Malaysia.
 There are no government or private organizations in Malaysia
 created to deal specifically with protection of individual
 liberties. The Bar Association, a Muslim youth movement, and a
 social reform group all devote some time to the subject,
 usually in reacting to government actions that they believe
 endanger civil liberties. The Bar Association also makes some
 effort to investigate instances of possible violation of human
 rights, but more on an ad hoc basis than through set procedures.
 All these organizations support the maintenance of democracy,
 though the youth movement believes that Western democratic
 ideals must be adapted to the needs and mores of an Islamic
 society. There is no evidence that the Government attempts to
 punish these organizations or their members for their support
 of human rights matters, though the effectiveness of the
 organizations in the human rights area appears limited.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The Malaysian Government has demonstrated its commitment to
 meet the economic needs of its people. The country has made
 significant economic advances in the 25 years since indepen-
 dence. It also recognizes and protects the right to own
 property alone as well as in association with others.
 The Government practices "affirmative action" on an extensive
 scale in favor of the politically dominant but economically
 weaker ethnic Malays. Many non-Malays consider this policy
 discriminatory. As a result of these extensive affirmative
 action programs and policies, non-Malays' opportunities for
 education, government employment, and participation in selected
 activities are carefully apportioned. This practice is based
 both on constitutional provisions and government policies.
 
 
 768
 The population of Malaysia is approximately 14.6 million
 people. The health and nutrition situation is relatively
 good. Life expectancy at birth is 64.2 years and the popu-
 lation growth rate is 2.3 percent. Infant mortality runs at
 about 31 deaths per 1,000 live births. Sixty-two percent of
 the population has access to safe water and the caloric supply
 per person meets 117 percent of nutritional requirements for
 the overall population. Elementary education is available to
 all Malaysians, with the Government providing scholarships for
 the children of the poor, particularly Malays. Primary school
 enrollment is at 93 percent. The adult literacy rate is 60
 percent, with the rate of the entire population probably around
 70 percent.
 The per capita income in Malaysia is estimated at $1,668 for
 1981. About 46 percent of the rural population and 16 percent
 of the urban is considered to be below the poverty level.
 In 1980, there was an average of 1.1 household per occupied
 private living quarters.
