 MACEDONIA*
 Macedonia which became independent following the breakup of the former Social-
 ist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, is a parliamentary democracy. The Parliament
 was elected in free and fair elections in 1990 and voted for Kiro Gligorov as Presi-
 dent in January 1991. The Government, a broad-based coalition of Social Demo-
 crats, Socialists, Liberals, and ethnic Albanians completed a year in power in Sep-
 tember 1993. In August Parliament began consideration of new electoral laws, in-
 cluding a proposal for direct, popular election of the president. Divisions, even with-
 in the coalition, however, have delayed action on this and other important pieces
 of legislation. New elections are scheduled for November 1994 at the latest.
 The Ministry of Interior oversees a security apparatus, including uniformed police,
 border police, and the domestic and foreign intelligence services. By law, the Min-
 istry is under the control of a civilian minister and the civilian Government. A
 standing parliamentary commission oversees operations. Charges of exessive use of
 force in connection with the handing of an early 1993 demonstration and public dis-
 turbances in late 1992 led to a formal parliamentary review and debate.
 Historically, Macedonia was the poorest of the former Yugoslav republics. Its
 economy, based on agriculture, mining, and light industry, was closely tied to those
 of the other republics, especially Serbia. Conflict in the region and the imposition
 of international sanctions against Serbia/Montenegro, coupled with dislocations
 caused by the transition to a market economy, have severely disrupted the economy.
 Unemployment stands at approximately 36 percent, production has fallen some 50
 percent, and the Government estimates the cost of sanctions to the Macedonian
 economy at $1.8 billion.  w
 Fundamental human rights are provided for in the Constitution and are gnerally
 respected, but there continue to be credible reports of police abuse of detainees and
 prisoners.
 Minorities, including Albanians, Turks, and Serbs, have raised various credible al-
 legations of human rights infringements and discrimination at the hands of the eth-
 nic Macedonian population. Ethnic Macedonians predominate beyond their apparent
 percentage of the population in civil administration, education, the court system, the
 armed forces, and police.
 Ethnic Albanians, who dispute official 1991 census figures that credit them with
 22 percent of the population, claim to constitute at least one-third of the population.
 They hold far fewer than 10 percent of positions in government employment and are
 particularly underrepresented at senior levels. They also charge economic discrimi-
 nation andincommensurate political rights, particularly inadequate representation
 in local administration. They continue to demand increased Albanian-language in-
 struction, greater representation in public sector jobs, and enhanced media access.
 In a positive development, the Government reached areement with representatives
 of the Serbian community on similar issues. Due to change in the leadership of the
 Serbian community, that agreement has been called into question.
 A striking example of interethnic tension occurred in a February clash between
 ethnic Macedonians and Bosnian Muslim refugees at a camp in Skopje in which a
 number of people were injured (see Section 5). In June the Council or Interethnic
 Relations was established. The Constitution assigns the Council a broad range of
 ï¿½Macedonia has proclaimed independent statehood but has not been formally recognized by
 the United States as a state. There has been a dispute regarding the name under which it
 should be recognized. We use "Macedonia" in this report informally fbr convenience; its use is
 not intended to have interntional or diplomatic significance.
 
 
 responsibilities, including appraisal of interethnic issues and recommendations of
 solutions, which the Parliament is obliged to consider for implementation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings during 1993. An Albanian national implicated in the "All-Albanian Army"
 conspiracy, died while undergoing interrogation. Although the autopsy reported the
 cause of death as a heart attack, credible persistent rumors circulated that the
 heart attack may have been caused by the stress associated with a beating. A par-
 liamentary commission that investigated the November 1992 riot in Skopje exoner-
 ated the police involved.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reported disappearances in 1993.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such treatment and punishment. Early in the year, a
 number of ethnic Albanian prisoners claimed mistreatment was occurring at the
 Idrizovo prison near Skopje. The monitoring mission of the Conference on Security
 and Coo peration in Europe (CSCE) investigated, and conditions improved. Informed
 independent sources describe prison mistreatment as rare. Government sources stat-
 ed that 37 cases brought against police officers for exceeding their authority re-
 suited in disciplinary action; 28 officers were fined and 9 were dismissed.
 One of the ethnic Albanians arrested for alleged involvement in a separatist plot
 claimed he was mistreated at first but not after being transferred to Skopje.
 On New Year's Day, ethnic Serbs clashed with Macedonian police in a village with
 a Serbian majority, and Serbs charged that police used excessive force. Macedonian
 authorities alleged that a Serbian guard had provoked the police by hurling stones.
 The indigenous Forum for Human Rights nuccessfully intervened with the Gov-
 ernment to obtain separate detention for juvenile offenders after receiving reports
 that juvenile detainees were raped by adult inmates.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were no confirmed reports of arbi-
 trary arrest in 1993. Some ethnic Albanians continued to report instances of
 unprovoked harassment such as the June 25 detention of a number of Albanians
 for a pproximately 4 hours. Police explained the incident as a "sweep* for unregis-
 teredand illegal devices in an apartment building. There appears to be little or no
 systematic use of detention as a form of nonjudicial punishment. Incommunicado de-
 tention is not practiced in Macedonia.
 The Constitution states that a person must be arraigned in court within 24 hours
 of arrest and sets the maximum duration of detention pending trial at 90 days. The
 accused must be informed of his or her legal rights and of the reasons for arrest
 and detention. The accused is entitled to contact a lawyer at the time of arrest and
 to have a lawyer present during police and court proceedings. The Constitution also
 provides that a person illegally detained has the right to compensation. Judges issue
 warrants at the request of prosecutors. Practice generally appears to conform to the
 law. Exile, internal or external, is not used as a form of punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Constitution ally, the courts are "autonomous and
 independent." The court system is three-tiered: municipal, district, and the Supreme
 Court. The Constitutional Court deals exclusively with matters of constitutional in-
 terpretation. Although some progress has been made in establishing the system en-
 visioned under the Constitution, parliamentary deadlock has stalled the election of
 new judges and the implementation of the proposed system. As such, the mandates
 of most, if not all, of the country's judges, who were appointed prior to independ-
 ence, expired in 1992. Judges continued to exercise their judicial authority pending
 legislative action on the judicial reform program.
 There were no known trials on purely political charges in 1993, and no political
 prisoners are known to be held. The Government said that the 10 political prisoners
 noted in the Department of State's report for 1992 were released with a finding that
 they had been improperly incarcerated.
 The Constitutional Court has a mandate to protect the human rights of citizens,
 but it has not yet taken any action in this area. Parliament has not passed the nec-
 essary implementing law to establish a people's ombudsman to defend citizens' con-
 stitutional and legal rights.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to privacy of person, home, and correspondence is provided in the Constitution.
 Although no instances of abuse were substantiated, officials of the Internal Macedo-
 nian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO) opposition party charged that their tele-
 phones were tapped and the privacy of communications not respected.

 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution forbids censorship and guaran-
 tees freedom of speech, public access, public information, and freedom to establish
 institutions for public information. These freedoms are generally respected.
 There are several daily newspapers in Skopje and numerous weekly political and
 other publications. An Albanian and a Turkish newspaper are also published nation-
 ally and are directly subsidized by the Government. Other cities publish their own
 dailies or have them printed in Skopje. Some critics complain that the Government,
 through the powerful national daily Nova Makedonija and affiliates, monopolizes
 local press coverage. The Government's ability to present its views through this in-
 fluential medium has led to the criticism that it manages the news. Nove
 Makedonija receives income from its near monopoly on printing, rental space, and
 kiosks.
 Macedonian Radio-Television (MRT) in Skopje, which is state owned, transmits
 programs in the Macedonian Rom, Turkish, Albanian, Serbian, and Vlach lan-
 guages. There are currently three television and four radio stations under MRT's
 control. In addition, there are several private radio and television broadcasters
 throughout the country. Towards the end of the year, a private radio station with
 an all-Albanian format reportedly began broadcasting in Skopje. The Albanian mi-
 nority has complained of insufficient Albanian-language broadcasting on state tele-
 vision, only some 5 hours per week. VMRO complained of unequal access to the
 media. However, several journalists claimed that VMRO does not understand that
 a free press has editorial freedom.
 There are no legal barriers to setting up independent media outlets, although the
 country's difficult economic conditions and the coalition's inability to pass required
 legislation to facilitate the move to a market economy complicate such initiatives.
 Foreign books and publications are freely available, principally in larger cities.
 Academic freedom appeared to be respected despite the fact that the university re-
 lied upon the Government for funding. Reportedly, there was no government inter-
 ference with professorial latitude in research or publishing.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights. Groups and political parties may not advocate the forcible overthrow
 of the constitutional order, encourage the commission of military aggression, or pro-
 mote national, racial, or religious hatred or intolerance. Advance notification for an
 assembly is required to ensure adequate security, but such provisions do not appear
 to have been abused.
 Political parties and nongovernmental organizations are required to register with
 the Interior Ministry in compliance with a comprehensive political party registration
 law. Over 50 political parties and associations are registered, including two major
 ethnic Albanian political parties, a political party of Serbs, and a pro-Bulgarian
 party. An ethnic Albanian party was denied registration. Although the denial was
 supposedly based on the similarity of its proposed name to that of an existing entity
 and because it was not an indigenous organization, critics charged the denial con-
 stituted harassment. In October the Ministry of Interior announced plans to seek
 the deregistration of two parties for advocating the "forcible change of the constitu-
 tional order and/or promoting ethnic or religious intolerance." One of the parties in-
 volved opposes independence and supports reintegration with Yugoslavia. The other
 allegedly espouses the establishment of a fundamentalist Islamic state.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is guaranteed, and there is no gov-
 ernmental interference with the practice of religion. The dominant faiths are East-
 ern Orthodox and Muslim, but many others are active. Although the Macedonian
 Orthodox Church is specifically named in the Constitution, it does not enjoy any
 special legal status. That church and all other religious communities and groups are
 separate from the State and equal under the law. They are free to establish reli-
 gious schools and social and philanthropic organizations.
 There is some sense among non-Orthodox believers that the Orthodox Church
 benefits informally from its position as first among equals. According to some ob-
 servers, it appears easier for the Orthodox than for the others to obtain prime prop-
 erty for construction and building permits. In a positive development, the "agreed
 minutes" negotiated between the Government and representatives of the ethnic Ser-
 bian community provided for treatment for the Serbian Orthodox Church equal to
 with accorded to other faiths. Relations between the Macedonian and Serbian Ortho-
 dox Churches were badly strained because the latter does not recognize either Mac-
 edonia's independence or the separateness of the Macedonian Orthodox Church.
 The Muslim community continued to complain over the placement of crosses on
 the facades of public buildings in some towns, as well as to criticize the reproduction
 on the national currency of cultural monuments, such as churches with crosses. The
 
 
 currency also portrays monuments from the period of Ottoman rule on some de-
 nominations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are permitted free movement within the country as well as the
 right to leave and return. These rights may be restricted for security, public health,
 and safety reasons.
 In August the Government began requiring citizens of Serbia/Montenegro to show
 a passport when seeking to enter Macedonia. Previously, citizens of both countries
 could cross the border on the basis of identity cards. Ethnic Albanians criticized this
 change, claiming that the group most seriously affected are Albanians from Kosovo,
 already pressured and isolated within Serbia. Consequently, they considered it dis-
 criminatory. The Government suggested it would consider special arrangements to
 accommodate inhabitants of immediate border areas, which would require the co-
 operation of the Serbian authorities.
 Macedonia has accepted a number of refugees from the crisis in Bosnia. Since the
 summer of 1992, however, the Government has restricted the entry of additional ref-
 ugees, and it is openly concerned that a rising refugee flow from Kosovo, in the
 event of a crisis in that region, could destroy Macedonia's ethnic identity and its
 fragile economy.
 Se.,tion 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The citizens of Macedonia chose their Government in 1990 by secret ballot in free,
 fair, multiparty, and multicandidate elections. The parliamentary term is 4 years.
 The Constitution allows citizens who are at least 18 years of age to vote. There are
 no formal restrictions on the participation of women in politica activities. Approxi-
 mately 3 percent of the seats in Parliament are held by women. Although two
 women serve as ministers in the coalition Government, most of the senior govern-
 ment and party positions are held by men. Albanians participated in the 1992 elec-
 tions, and the major ethnic Albanian political party is a member of the ruling coali-
 tion. They hold about 20 percent of parliamentary seats and have one deputy Prime
 Minister, a minister without portfolio, and three ministerial psts in the Govern-
 ment.
 A unicameral parliament of 120 members, called the Assembly, governs the coun-
 try. The Prime Minister, who is the Head of Government, is the candidate of the
 party or parties that are in the majority in the Assembly. The Prime Minister and
 the other ministers do not have to be members of the Assembly. The Prime Minister
 is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Assembly. The Constitution pro-
 vides for legislation by initiative and referendum. Although the Assembly elected
 the sitting President, current legislative proposals, when enacted, will result in di-
 rect popular election of the Head of State. In addition to being the Head of State,
 the President is also the chairman of the Security Council and the commander in
 chief of the armed forces.
 The Government, formed in September 1992, is a broad-based coalition that
 unites the Social Democratic Alliance, the Liberal Party, the Party for Democratic
 Prosperity (Albanian), and a number of other small parties. The Prime Minister,
 Braniko Crvenkovski, is a member of the Social Democratic Alliance.
 The main political partr of the Roma is the Party for the Complete Emancipation
 of Romanies in Macedonia (PSERM), which claims 36,000 members and has local
 branches throughout the country. Its president is also a member of the Macedonian
 Parliament, representing the redominantly Romany town of Suto Orizari, located
 on the outskirts of Skopje. i , ERM  was instrumental in securing rights for the
 Roma and successfully campaigned for Romany-language instruction in elementary
 schools, the establishment of Romany studies at the university, and daily television
 and radio news and current affairs programs in Romany.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups and ethnic community representatives meet frequently with
 foreign representatives without government interference. The Forum  for peuman
 Rights was established in 1990 by a group predominantly made up of academics to
 propagate a culture of respect for human rights. While their effort is primarily edu-
 cational, they work with the Government and institutions to improve protection of
 human rights.
 The Government did not oppose visits or investigations by international human
 rights groups. It has cooperated fully with the CSCE apilloves" monitor mission op-
 erating in Skope. The mediator on ethnic groups of the International Conference
 on the Former Yugoslavia visited Macedonia frequently to negotiate "agreed min-
 
 
 969
 utes" between the Serbs and the Government and between the Albanians and the
 Government.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women possess the same legal rights as men. Little is known of the ex-
 tent to which violence against women, including domestic violence, occurs. Macedo-
 nian society, both in the Christian and Muslim communities, is traditionally patriar-
 chal, and the advancement of women into nontraditional roles is still limited. In
 1993 a few fledgling women's advocacy or support groups began to organize.
 Children.-Macedonia's commitment to chldren's rights and welfare is limited by
 its resources. The State does have social welfare programs to support children, but
 the current economic crisis brought on by the sanctions against Serbia have ren-
 dered many inoperative. For example, allowances to parents whose employers have
 gone bankrupt are at least 5 months in arrears. Despite the State's financial limita-
 tions, it undertook a children's vaccination program in the spring of 1993 that re-
 portedly covered at least 95 percent of the country's children. There is no pattern
 of societal abuse against children.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The population of about 2.2 million is com-
 posed of a variety of national and ethnic groups-Macedonians, Albanians, Turks,
 Romas (Gypsies), Serbs, Greeks, and Vlachs (Aromanians). All citizens are equal
 under the law. The Constitution provides for the protection of the ethnic, cultural,
 linguistic, and religious identity of minorities. However, ethnic tension and sus-
 picion are evident within the population, and popular prejudices exist. The Govern-
 ment appears committed to a policy of trying to address nationality concerns with-
 out provoking an extremist, nationalist backlash.
 Representatives of the Albanian community are the most vocal in alleging dis-
 crimination. Expressing concern about undercounting, the Albanian community re-
 fused to participate in the 1991 census. As a result, there are no authoritative fig-
 ures on its percentage of the population. According to the 1981 census, Macedonians
 comprised 67 percent of the population, Albanians 20 percent, Turks 5 percent, and
 Serbs 2 percent. Most observers estimate that Albanians now account for at least
 30 percent of the population, while some Albanians claim 40 percent.
 Albanians also boycotted the 1991 independence referendum because of objections
 to several articles in the Constitution, which referred to them as a minority rather
 than as a separate national group. Much of the Macedonian population considers
 the Albanian desire to be recognized as a nation responsible for its own affairs, rath-
 er than as a minority, as an assault on the unitary nature of the State and a step
 toward secession.
 Albanians point out th ththere is a minimum amount of Albanian-language broad-
 casts on state radio and television, some 5 hours per week of television broadcasts.
 They contend there is inadequate schooling in the Albanian language and charge
 patterns of employment discri~mination. Albanian advocacy groups and political par-
 ties have specifically charged that Albanians are underrpresented in both the mili-
 taryand the police forces.
 The Government has acknowledged underrepresntatio n the military and p-
 lice, and the Ministries of Defense and Interior have instituted moderate measures
 to respond to the imbalance, including special competitions for midevel positions
 open only to members of ethnic minorities and quotas for the induction of ethnic
 minorities into the military college and the police academy. Following the most re-
 cent conscription, the army, some 16,000 troops, is now 26.5-percent Albanian, and
 the police, 7,000 strong, are to reach 15 percent within 2 years, according to the
 Minister of Interior.
 The State defends its record on access to television time. It notes that one of the
 state-owned stations broadcasts international programming which is either in Eng-
 lish, French, or German. The remaining stations carry  rogramming not only in
 Macedonian and Albanian but also in the languages of otber ethnic groups. On the
 question of Albanian education, the State notes that primary and secondary edu-
 cation are povided, as well as Albanian-language courses at the college level to pre-
 pare primary and secondary schoolteachers.
 Ethnic Turks, who comprise almost   percent of the population, have complained
 of governmental, societal, and cultural discrimination. Their main complaints con-
 cern insufficient Turkish-language education, exclusion from Macedoian political
 life, inadequate media access, and incommensurate representationin the state bu-
 reaucracy. For instance, they cited an inability to obtain primary and secondary
 education in Turkish for their children, but in many cases the children did not
 speak Turkish. The State has refused to offer instruction in a language the children
 
 
 970
 do not speak. Citizens have begun to teach their children Turkish in the hopes of
 reversing the decision.
 In the past Serbs who comprise 2 percent of the population, have also complained
 of discrimination. The constitution at the time of independence enumerated only
 substantial minority grou s. Sespite the fact that Serbian minority rights have gen-
 erally been observed, Serts have demanded explicit constitutional recognition as a
 guarantee that they would have equal minority rights. An August 27 agreement be-
 tween the Government and the ethnic Serbian community provided the latter equal
 rights with other minorities and specified an 18-month time frame for amending the
 Constitution. After Serbia/Montenegro criticized the agreement, a new Serbian lead-
 ership emerged and abrogated the agreement.
 Popularly held prejudices were manifested in mid-February during a demonstra-
 tion in the Gjorche Petrov suburb of Skopje against the construction of a refugee
 camp for Bosnian Muslims in the neighborhood. Police intervened to disperse dem-
 onstrators, and in the ensuing Macedonian-Bosnian Muslim melee 14 people, includ-
 ing 8 policemen, were injured. Parliament investigated police actions in the incident
 and exonerated the police of wrongdoing.
 Roma comprise at least 3 percent of the population. and some estimates put their
 percentage as high as 10. President Gligorov has repeatedly and explicitly recog-
 nized Roma as full and equal citizens. There is a commendable lack of tension be-
 tween the Romany population and the majority of Macedonian Slavs. There has
 been progress on concrete issues. For instance, educational issues are the para-
 mount concern of the Roma in Macedonia, and there are frequent contacts and open
 communication between the Romany community and the Ministry of Education. A
 Romany primer has been prepared and will be printed shortly for use in schools.
 The Ministry and leading Romany educational experts have prepared a Romany
 educational program that would reportedly include 2 hours a week of instruction in
 the Romany language in grades one through eight. It is awaiting government ap-
 proval. A 40,000-word Macedonian-Romany dictionary is under preparation, using
 the most widely spoken of the three main Romany dialects in the country. MRT pro-
 vides some daily programming in the Romany language, offering instruction, news,
 and music.
 The 13-member Council on Interethnic Relations, established in 1992 in accord-
 ance with the Constitution, is comprised of the President of the Assembly and two
 representatives each from six national and ethnic groups (Macedonians, Albanians
 Turks, Serbs, Roma, and Vlach). The Council has not yet, however, demonstrated
 an ability to engge itself usefully in resolving ethnic conflicts.
 People with Disabilities.-Social programs to meet the needs of the disabled exist
 in Macedonia to the extent that government resources allow. Discrimination on the
 basis of disability is illegal. So far as is known, there is no law or regulation man-
 dating accessibility for disabled persons.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Constitution guarantees citizens the right
 to form trade unions. There are restrictions on that right for military personnel, po-
 lice, and government workers. However, the Government still has not enacted the
 required laws to implement the constitutional guarantees.
 The Council of Trade Unions of Macedonia (SSSM) is the labor confederation that
 is the successor organization to the old Communist labor confederation. It continues
 to maintain the assets of the Communist group and remains the Government's main
 negotiating partner. An active observer of labor issues has termed it "independent
 of the Government and not associated with any party." The Union of Independent
 and Autonomous Trade Unions was formed in 1992. Perhaps as much as 80 percent
 of Macedonia's work force is unionized, though this situation is a result of the recent
 Socialist past. The absence of the necessary legal framework, combined with difficult
 economic conditions, have restricted labor activism.
 The Constitution guarantees the right to strike. Strikes were common in 1993 be-
 cause of difficult economic conditions as a result of the collapse of markets and limi-
 tations on access to raw materials, further aggravated by the strengthening of inter-
 national sanctions against Serbia. During 1993 only one strike was declared illegal,
 and that action is to be challenged in the courts.
 Trade unions are free to join international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution implicitly
 recognizes employees right to bargain collectively. Collective bargaining, however,
 is still in its formative stages. Formerly, public employee official unions, which en-
 compassed the majority of unionized workers, established so-called collective agree-
 ments with the Government, which set minimum wages and various other stand-
 ards. How this system is to be amended is still not resolved. As such, collective
 
 
 971
 agreements are still common, and they have virtually the status of law. Parliament
 has not yet approved legislation defining collective bargaining rights or prohibiting
 antiunion discrimination, but in practice, such discrimination has not been ob-
 served.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Legal prohibitions against forced
 labor are effectively enforced by the Ministries of Interior and Labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The constitutional minimum age
 for employment of children is 15. Younger children, however, are often observed
 peddling items such as cigarettes, especially in the capital. Children may not legally
 work mghts nor earn more leave than adults. They are permitted to work 42-hour
 weeks. Education is compulsory through grade eight. The ministries of labor and in-
 terior are responsible for enforcing laws regulating the employment of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage, set in March, is approxi-
 mately $50 (denars 1,500) per month. Negotiations involving the Government, em-
 ployers, and labor organizations to increase this figure were under way in 1993, but
 agreement ispyroving elusive due in part to the serious economic conditions facing
 the country. nions demanded an increase to $67 (denars 2,000). By law, in light
 of the fact that the average wage in July was denars 3,837, it shou d be raised to
 $76 (denars 2,302). Even if raised to the latter figure, however, the cost of living
 far exceeds the minimum wage.
 Yugoslavia had extensive laws concerning acceptable conditions of work, including
 an official 42-hour workweek with a 24-hour rest period and generous vacation and
 sick leave benefits. Macedonia adopted many of these provisions, including specifi-
 cally the workweek and rest period.
 The Constitution guarantees safe working conditions, temporary disability com-
 pensation, and leave benefits. Although Macedonia has laws and regulations on
 worker safety remaining from the Yugoslav era credible reports suggest they are
 not strictly enforced. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare is responsible for en-
 forcing regulations pertaining to working conditions.
