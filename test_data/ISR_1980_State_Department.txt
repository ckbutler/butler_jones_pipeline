 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 From its inception in 1948, the State of Israel found
 itself in a continuing state of war with most of its Arab
 neighbors, owing to the refusal of the latter to accept
 its existence and to agree to live in peace with it. The
 Camp David Accords of September 17, 1978 and the Treaty of
 Peace between Israel and Egypt of March 25, 1979 offer hope
 that eventually Israel will be able to make peace with all
 its neighbors. However, the absence of peace treaties be-
 tween Israel and its Arab neighbors (with the exception of
 Egypt) makes security a dominant concern and affects many
 facets of Israel's national life.
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with high standards
 of justice and human rights. These standards are applied
 fully inside Israel. The human rights situation in Israel
 was virtually unchanged in 1980 from previous years. The
 government worked to improve both the material well-being of
 its citizens and the overall quality of life. The presence
 of an Arab minority presents Israel with the challenge of
 integrating into its society a group which has strong and
 varied ties with Arab communities in states around Israel
 and which does not fully share the principles upon which
 the state was founded.
 ISRAEL
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is unacceptable in Israel. Israeli laws governing
 the rules of evidence state that any evidence or confession
 obtained under duress is inadmissable as legal evidence.
 Furthermore, the administrative codes of conduct of both
 the prison and police authorities contain stringent sanc-
 tions against the use of force or brutality. Police offi-
 cers accused of employing brutality or violence on prisoners
 * Because of the sharply differing politico-social
 environments in Israel and in the Arab territories
 Israel has occupied since the 1967 war, discussion
 of these subjects is treated in separate but parallel
 fashion for the two areas. Therefore, this report
 is divided into separate narratives for Israel and
 the occupied territories.

 or suspects may be prosecuted either in administrative courts,
 for violation of the code of conduct, or in regular criminal
 courts for criminal assault, or both. There have been no
 substantiated reports of torture in 1980.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
 Cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment is not sanctioned in
 Israel, and law enforcement generally is carried out without
 the excessive use of force.
 A special committee report on police methods was pub-
 lished on February 4, 1980. Prepared largely by police and
 court officials in Tel Aviv, the report found that police
 officers had used unauthorized force in the investigation
 of a relatively small number of criminal cases. The report
 suggested that violence is caused by a failure to implement
 existing regulations. It recommended the establishment of
 independent investigative units and that the police be re-
 quired to publish results of court actions and disciplinary
 tribunals involving violence by police officers.
 Israel acknowledges problems of serious overcrowding
 in its prisons. The Attorney General has the power to ask
 for the death penalty for those convicted of terrorist acts
 but so far no one has been executed.
 c. Disappearances
 Such practices do not occur in Israel. They would be prose-
 cutable as criminal acts if they did occur.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Israeli law provides strong guarantees against arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment. Writs of habeas corpus and other
 guarantees of due process of law are employed and defendants
 are considered innocent until proven guilty. Preventive de-
 tention is legal and was employed for the first time against
 Israeli Jews in 1980 in the case of Rabbi Meir Kahane and
 one of his followers, because of incitement by Kahane against
 West Bank Arabs. The two since have been released. Although
 in the past this provision occasionally was used against
 Israeli citizens of Arab origin, there were no known instances
 in 1980.
 Under the provisions of Article III of the Defense Emer-
 gency Regulations, judicial review is required at several
 crucial points in the process of applying administrative
 detention. Any individual who is the subject of administra-
 tive detention must be brought before a judge of the appropri-
 ate District Court within 96 hours of his being taken into cus-
 tody. The detainee has the right of appeal to the president of
 the court. In addition, each case of administrative detention
 must be subjected to judicial review every three months there-
 after for the entire period of detention. Both at the time of
 the initial order of detention and at each subsequent review,
 the judicial authority is empowered to rule on both the procedural
 
 
 996
 
 and substantive aspects of the case.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair hearing by an impartial tribunal with
 representation by counsel is observed. With the exception
 of security cases, all trials are open. In security cases,
 Israeli law provides that part or all of a trial may be
 closed, with the burden of justifying in camera proceed-
 ings falling on the prosecution. Counsel is always pres-
 ent during closed proceedings.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 There are effective legal safeguards against arbitrary
 invasion of the home. There have been no recorded invas-
 ions of the home in 1980 or in prior years.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care, Employment
 and Education.
 Israel is a welfare state with a mixed economy, similar to
 those of many Western European states. The proportion of
 national resources devoted to defense is the highest in the
 world, roughly one-third of Gross National Product (GNP).
 In addition to this heavy defense burden, continued large
 social welfare expenditures and the skyrocketing cost of
 oil imports have combined to create serious inflationary
 and balance of payments problems for Israel. The price
 index rose 48 percent in 1978, 11 percent in 1979, and
 is running at an annual rate of about 140 percent in the
 first eleven months of 1980.
 Although real economic growth was reasonably good in
 1978 and 1979 (4.8 percent each year), a government auster-
 ity program aimed at controlling inflation is expected to
 slow the 1980 growth rate to approximately one-half of that
 figure. Unemployment, which is normally quite low, rose
 to more than four percent of the work force in the first
 half of 1980. Despite the high rate of inflation and the
 increased level of unemployment, real wages have generally
 continued to rise, and income distribution is relatively
 egalitarian. Even so, because of the differences in edu-
 cation and cultural backgrounds, there remains an economic
 and social gap between the Ashkenazi (European) community
 on the one hand and the Sephardic (Middle Eastern) Jewish
 community (along with the Arab community) on the other.
 Despite extensive irrigation and advanced agricultur-
 al techniques, the arid conditions prevailing in most
 parts of Israel make it necessary to import a substantial
 portion of some food items, although Israel is a heavy
 exporter of fruits and vegetables. Malnutrition is not
 a problem. Israeli citizens consume over 3,000 calories
 and almost 100 grams of protein on the average per day.
 
 
 997
 To help ease the impact of the high cost of living, the
 government subsidizes the cost of some basic food items.
 Title to 93 percent of the land in Israel is held
 by the state or quasi-public organizations in trust for
 the Jewish people. Anyone, including Israeli Arabs, may
 purchase the remaining 7 percent of privately-owned land
 through ordinary commercial transactions. There have been
 complaints that expropriations of Arab land (although sub-
 ject to legal review as to purpose and amount of compensa-
 tion) have been used for promoting Jewish settlement in
 densely Arab-populated areas.
 On August 7, 1980, the Knesset (Parliament) passed
 a law preventing Israeli Bedouin Arabs from appealing in
 the courts expropriations of their tribal lands in the
 Negev to make way for the construction of an airbase re-
 quired by Israel's commitment to withdraw from Sinai by
 April 1982. There were clashes between Bedouin in the
 Negev and police as a result of government attempts to
 expropriate these tribal lands and resettle Bedouin in
 towns. "
 The shortage of reasonably priced housing is a
 chronic problem in Israel. The fairly rapid population
 growth, due in part to immigration, has outpaced the con-
 struction of new housing. In the 1970's, the government
 planned programs to ease the housing problem, including
 extensive new construction and modest housing subsidies
 for the poor. Budget restrictions, however, limited
 the funds available to implement the new programs.
 In keeping with its welfare state traditions, the
 ,government has invested a large share of its resources
 in education and health care programs. State education,
 in either secular or religious schools, is free and
 compulsory for all Israeli citizens through age fifteen.
 National expenditure on education rose from six percent
 of GNP in the early 1960's to almost nine percent in
 recent years, with the Government providing about
 three-fourths of the funds.
 The parallel educational systems in Israel for
 Jews and Arabs, conducted in Hebrew and Arabic re-
 spectively, show a disparity in quality with greater
 resources per student going into the Jewish system.
 Nevertheless, the Arab literacy rate of 64 percent
 (compared with 90 percent for Jews) is one of the
 highest in the Middle East.
 Arabs are not represented in institutions of
 higher learning in percentages equivalent to their
 proportion of the population. Although there are
 no legal barriers to the admission of Arab citizens
 to institutions of higher learning, they make up
 only 3 percent of university students (Arabs and
 other non-Jewish citizens constitute 16 percent of
 
 
 998
 the total Israeli population). Some Israeli Arabs seek
 education and employment abroad.
 Israel has an excellent health care system, with
 one of the highest physician-to-patient ratios in the
 world. Over the past ten years, national expenditure
 for health has risen from about 5.5 percent to over 6
 percent. In Israel, the average life expectancy is
 75.6 years for Jewish females, 71.9 years for Jewish
 males, 72 years for non-Jewish females, and 69.1 years
 for non-Jewish males. Infant mortality has declined
 steadily over the past 30 years to 13.2 deaths for 1000
 live births for Jews and 25.6 deaths for non-Jews.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly.
 Israelis of all faiths and ethnic groups enjoy freedom
 of religion, expression, and assembly. An anti-prosely-
 tizing measure, adopted by the Knesset in late 1977,
 outlaws the offering of bribes or material benefits as
 an inducement to religious conversions. It continues
 to cause uneasiness among certain Christian groups in
 Israel. In a clarification placed in the Knesset record
 on January 15, 1979, the Minister of Justice stated that
 the law is not intended to restrict the religious free-
 dom of any community, or to impede them from the pursuit
 of normal educational or philanthropic activities. The
 Attorney General has ordered that no action be taken
 under the law without his express permission, and the
 law has never been employed.
 Preedom of speech, with a few exceptions, is a
 basic right in Israel. Both the Hebrew and Arabic
 press are free and express a wide variety of political
 opinions, although all media are subject to censorship
 on security and military matters. In 1980, the Order
 for Prevention of Terror law was passed to forbid tangi-
 ble public manifestations of support for organizations
 defined as terrorist. Such acts could include, illus-
 tratively, flying certain flags, displaying slogans, or
 publicly expressing support for such organizations. In
 an unusual case in December 1980, a political rally
 scheduled for the Arab village of Shfar 'Am was can-
 celled by government order under Emergency Defense
 Regulations.
 There are active human rights groups in Israel
 working for the protection of individual liberties
 and the government maintains an office of human rights
 in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 
 
 999
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.
 Israeli citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the
 country and are free to travel abroad or to emigrate.
 However, 13 Israeli citizens of Arab origin were con-
 fined at various times during 1980 to their neighbor-
 hoods or villages by military orders as a "preventive"
 measure under Article 110 of the security regulations
 carried over from the Mandatory period.
 The Law of Return of 1950 abolished all restrict-
 ions on Jewish immigration and the citizenship law of
 1952 granted every Jew the right to citizenship upon
 arrival in Israel. Since 1948, Israel has taken in
 well over one million largely impoverished Jewish
 refugees from Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa,
 and has worked to integrate them fully into its society
 and economy. Integration of smaller numbers of immi-
 grants continues at present.
 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194 of
 December 11, 1948, calls upon Israel to permit Arab ref-
 ugees who left their homes in the 1947-48 fighting to
 return if they are willing to live in peace or, if they
 so choose, to be compensated for their losses. Israel
 has not recognized the validity of this resolution, point-
 ing out the losses of its own citizens who fled Arab states,
 but has on occasion indicated a willingness to take back
 some refugees in the context of a final settlement.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process.
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multi-party
 system. Israeli citizens enjoy the freedom to partici-
 pate in the political process. The organized labor
 movement functions without hindrance and wields substan-
 tial political and economic power. The right to strike
 is exercised frequently and effectively. Most workers,
 Arab and Jewish, are members of the Histadrut, the gen-
 eral confederation of workers.
 Because of the explicitly Jewish character of the
 state, and the continuing state of war between Israel
 and most of its Arab neighbors, the Arab minority tends
 to feel powerless and largely alienated. Despite some
 limited governmental and private efforts to bridge the
 gap, there is little social interaction between Israeli
 Arabs and Jews.
 
 
 1000
 The Arab minority has equal rights under the law,
 although discrimination reportedly occurs in such
 areas as employment and appointment to government
 positions. Some Arabs have risen to responsible posi-
 tions in the civil service, generally in the Arab
 Departments of government ministries. Several Arabs
 are members of the Knesset, Israel's parliament. Druze
 and Circassians are subject to Israel's military draft
 and some Bedouins serve voluntarily in special units.
 Other Muslims and Christians are not permitted to serve
 and therefore do not qualify for those economic and
 social benefits that derive from military service.
 Since the founding of the state, Jewish women
 have played an active role in every sphere of life
 in Israel. The Equal Rights for Women Law (1951)
 formalized women's rights in Israel, granting them
 the right to own and deal in property and the right
 to guardianship of their children. It also abolished
 unilateral divorce by the husband. Polygamy and
 child marriage also were abolished. Minor females
 were included in compulsory education laws. Under
 the Employment of Women Law (1954), women have the
 right to work, at equal pay for equal work, without
 discrimination in the same jobs as men so long as
 they are physically able to do the job without impair-
 ing their health.
 There are strong secular and religious forces
 in contest over changes in the status of women in
 Israel. Since the establishment of the state, all
 matters relating to the family have been handled
 by the religious courts. These courts, while opera-
 ting within the confines of the law, base their de-
 cisions on religious law, which secular women find
 discriminatory in some instances.
 However, the religious family law includes the
 advanced legal concept which protects married women
 from marital rape. A ruling of the religious courts
 based on this concept was upheld in a recent appeal
 decision of the Israeli Supreme Court. A suggestion
 to alter Israeli criminal law to bring it into con-
 formity with the more advanced religious concept has
 been approved by the government and will be submitted
 to the Knesset for enactment in the near future.
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 The territories occupied in 1967 consist of the
 West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai
 Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. Under the terms of
 the Egyptian-Israeli Treaty, Israel has already evacu-
 ated some two-thirds of Sinai and complete evacuation
 of Sinai is to take place in April 1982.
 
 
 1001
 The complex human rights situation in the occupied
 territories, particularly in the West Bank and Gaza,
 where almost all of the settled Arab population is loca-
 ted, is largely a result of the tensions which exist be-
 tween the occupying authorities and the indigenous popu-
 lation. There was a worsening trend in the occupied
 West Bank in 1980, during which a number of Israelis
 were killed in Hebron and the occupying authorities
 adopted a series of stringent measures toward the Arab
 population. This situation further was exacerbated by
 the activities of certain settler groups and by the
 maiming of two prominent Arab mayors.
 During 1980, Israel and Egypt continued negotia-
 tions to define the powers and responsibilities of the
 Self-Governing Authority that, pursuant to the Septem-
 ber 1978 Camp David Accords, is to be established in
 the West Bank and Gaza, with further negotiations to
 follow to determine the final status of these territor-
 ies at the end of five years. The basic solution to
 the tensions that prevail on the West Bank is to reach
 a new relationship in which Israel's security needs are
 fully assured and the legitimate rights of the
 Palestinians are fulfilled.
 The occupied territories are under military govern-
 ment, and law enforcement and public security are in
 military rather than in civilian hands. The occupation
 authorities govern the territories with a combination
 of pre-existing law and military orders which does not
 offer to the inhabitants all the human rights guarantees
 available within Israel itself. The United Nations holds
 that the Fourth Geneva Convention concerning the protec-
 tion of civilian populations under military occupation
 applies to Israel's governance of the occupied territor-
 ies. Israel declares that it voluntarily observes most
 of the Fourth Convention's provisions, but that it does
 not accept that these territories are within the purview
 of the Convention.
 The major differences regard the applicability of
 those provisions prohibiting the introduction of civil-
 ian settlers from the occupying power into occupied
 territories (see Section 2) and prohibitions against
 the use of certain forms of punishment to maintain
 order. (See Section lb.) In addition, some Palestinian
 Arabs have complained that Israel has neglected its
 duty as an occupying power to provide adequate protec-
 tion against vigilante actions by Israeli settlers.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Allegations about torture including psychological
 pressures, physical maltreatment, and instances of
 brutality by Israeli officials during interrogation of
 
 
 1002
 Arab security suspects have been publicized widely in
 past years but have been heard less frequently in 1980.
 Israeli authorities have stressed repeatedly that such
 practices are forbidden by Israeli law and that viola-
 tors are punished. There is no evidence to substantiate
 such allegations or that torture is condoned by Israel's
 occupying authorities.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment.
 There have been problems in past years in these areas,
 but after the May 2 murders of Jewish settlers in
 Hebron, the frequency and severity of their occurrence
 increased. During 1980, severe curfews were twice
 imposed on the town of Hebron and, in other instances,
 on other towns and refugee camps where security inci-
 dents occurred, most notably following the killing of
 a Yeshiva student on January 31 and the May 2 murders
 of Israeli settlers in Hebron by Arab terrorists. Such
 curfews caused considerable hardship to many inhabitants.
 In other instances, males in villages and refugee camps
 have been rounded up and held outdoors for extended
 periods of time as a form of general punishment against
 the community for security incidents. Such punitive
 curfews and round-ups contravene the Fourth Geneva Con-
 vention relating to the treatment of civilians in time
 of war.
 There have been credible reports of beatings and
 other forms of degrading treatment during the period
 of high tension following the Hebron murders and in
 connection with round-ups of suspects following secur-
 ity incidents. In one instance, a Palestinian youth,
 who subsequently was convicted of throwing a rock at a
 military vehicle, was beaten so severely by those who
 arrested him that he suffered internal injuries requir-
 ing several operations. His family forcibly was removed
 to a distant abandoned refugee camp, but the authorities
 later ordered its return.
 Excessive force at times has been used to quell
 demonstrations and on several occasions during 1980
 Arab youths have been wounded by gunfire. In November
 1980, troops deliberately fired at the legs of demon-
 strating youths when they refused to disperse, and
 wounded at least 16 boys and girls in five separate
 incidents. In several other shooting incidents, the
 press has alleged that settlers, rather than soldiers
 or border police, were responsible.
 In the Knesset on May 19, 1980, a member charged
 that according to a group of soldiers, local commanders
 had ordered or condoned brutal acts in Hebron and else-
 where after the May 2 murders.
 
 
 1003
 In further contravention of the Fourth Geneva Conven-
 tion, occupation authorities summarily deported to Lebanon
 the elected Mayors of Hebron and Halhul and the Qadi
 (Islamic judge) of Hebron, in May, immediately following
 the murder of the settlers. The government justified the
 deportations on the grounds that speeches they made some
 weeks prior to th murders constituted incitement of the
 Arab population
 The Isra 1i Supreme Court refused to overturn the
 decision but encouraged the Military Review Board to re-
 consider the deportations of the two mayors if they would
 pledge to obey existing laws on the West Bank. The mayors
 filed such affidavits with the Court, pledging to obey
 the existing laws, and were subsequently readmitted to the
 West.Bank, although under detention, to present their
 appeal in person. The Military Review Board recommended
 that the original expulsion order be enforced. That
 recommendation was accepted and confirmed by the West Bank
 Military Governor and upheld by the Supreme Court. However,
 the Court recommended that the decision be reconsidered
 by the political authorities. Nevertheless, the Govern-
 ment re-deported the mayors on December 5, 1980.
 Overcrowded prison conditions continue to be a
 problem. At the Nafha prison, a newly opened maximum
 security facility for West Bank detainees, two Arab
 prisoners who took part in a mass hunger strike protesting
 the conditions of incarceration died in July. The
 Israeli Ministry of Interior appointed a special
 committee to investigatge the circumstances surrounding the
 deaths of the two prisoners. The committee stated that
 one prisoner, Muhammed Hulwa, died from "aspiration
 pneumonia," due to aspiration of acid and food from the
 stomach to the lungs. It found a reasonable possibility
 that this was due to his objection to being force-fed
 and to the misinsertion of the tube used for force-feeding.
 The committee recommended some changes in prison condi-
 tions and certain improvements in prison regulations
 concerning hunger strikes and their definition. Israeli
 authorities allowed newsmen and photographers to visit
 the prison during the hunger strike, which ended in late
 August.
 In response to requests for accelerated access to
 detainees, Israel in 1978 agreed with the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to allow its representa-
 tives resident in Israel and the occupied territories to
 visit detainees without witnesses during the period of their
 interrogation. They now can do so no later than the twelfth
 day after arrest to determine identity, state of health, and
 conditions of detention; on subsequent visits, allowed every
 14 days, they are permitted complete freedom of discussion
 (i.e., beyond identity and health). Also Israel agreed to
 allow the immediate examination of the detainee by an ap-
 proved physician, and to investigate any complaints as
 requested. Israel maintains that 97 percent of all detain-
 ees are visited within the specified period, although in
 certain cases Israel can suspend notification and visitation
 on security grounds.
 
 
 1004
 Generally, the ICRC at any time may visit prisoners
 except those who the Israeli authorities indicate are
 under interrogation. In addition to visits to detainees,
 ICRC delegates visit convicted Arab security prisoners
 in Israel and the occupied territories. Whenever the ICRC
 considers it necessary, the ICRC physician may conduct
 medical examinations without witnesses. The ICRC may
 submit inquiries about specific cases to the Israeli
 authorities.
 c. Disappearances.
 It is reported that arrests occasionally have occurred
 without prompt notification of the family.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment.
 Administrative detention is authorized under Israeli law
 as well as under the Jordanian and British mandatory
 codes which were in force before 1967 in the West Bank
 and Gaza respectively, and which continue in force there.
 In mid-1979, Israeli authorities issued new administra-
 tive regulations restricting the use of administrative
 detention in Israel proper, and in early 1980 extended
 the new regulations to the occupied territories as well.
 The new regulations restrict the initial application of
 administrative detention and provide for more frequent
 review.
 As of October 1, 1980, there were about 2,190 non-
 Israeli citizen Arabs in prison for security offenses in
 Israel or in the territories. Of this number, nine were
 under administrative detention. An additional number of
 suspected security offenders was awaiting trial. In
 1980, the military governor commuted the sentences of at
 least 48 Gazans convicted of security and other criminal
 offenses, and reduced the sentences of 21 others.
 Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, administrative
 detention is not permissible beyond one year from the
 "general close of military operations." Israel maintains
 that administrative detention is occasionally necessary to
 prevent terrorist operations when a court proceeding
 would jeopardize sensitive security information.
 Administrative detainees have several forms of recourse
 from detention orders, but the right of appeal is rarely
 excercised. Appeals are not known to have resulted
 in a reversal of the decisions of the military authorities
 in 1980.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Jordanian law (as modified by Israeli authorities) is
 still in force in the West Bank in civil and criminal
 matters, as is British Mandatory law in Gaza. Its
 adjudication has been left in the hands of the indigenous
 judiciary, which carries out its duties in an equitable
 manner. Residents of the occupied territories accused
 of non-security offenses receive fair public trials by
 local civilian courts.
 
 
 1005
 
 Alleged security offenders are tried in Israeli
 military courts, with a military judge trained in law
 presiding, and are defended by counsel. Most military
 trials are open to the public. While military
 regulations require simultaneous translation of trial
 proceedings into the language of the accused,-there
 have been complaints from Arab prisoners that
 insufficient steps have been taken to enable them
 to follow the proceedings, or that they signed
 confessions written in Hebrew, a language most of
 them do not understand.
 Legal procedures at such trials generally appear to
 meet the standards of a fair trial. Arab prisoners have
 charged that convictions frequently are based on confess-
 ions obtained through coercion but evidence to substanti-
 ate their charges is lacking. No appeal of military court
 verdicts is possible. The area military commander can and
 does exercise the right of commutation. Non-judicial
 administrative orders by the military government may be
 appealed to the area military commanders and to the
 Israel Supreme Court.
 f. Invasion of the Home.
 Under emergency regulations, military authorities can
 and do enter private homes and institutions in pursuit
 of security objectives as they see fit. During the May-
 June crackdown, numerous allegations of breakage, despol-
 iation and beatings were raised, including reports that
 some local military commanders may have acquiesced in
 such actions. There were also reports that some settlers
 took advantage of the situation to engage in vandalism
 and looting. Similar charges concerning a group of sol-
 diers were raised in connection with a military search
 of the village of Silwad in December 1980.
 In violation of the Geneva Convention, houses of
 individuals believed to have been involved in terrorism
 or located in the vicinity of terrorist incidents have
 been demolished or sealed up and families displaced.
 In 1980, at least 23 homes were demolished and there
 were at least six other houses sealed up on security
 grounds. Among these, incidents, Israeli authorities
 blew up a number of commercial establishments in Hebron
 near the site of the May 2 attack.
 Residents of the territories, both Arabs and Jews,
 suffer from terrorist acts in the form of bombings and
 other forms of violence. Responsibility is usually
 
 
 1006
 claimed by Palestinian organizations located outside
 Israel and the territories. In the first ten months
 of 1980, at least 32 bombs were placed in Jerusalem,
 the West Bank and Gaza, resulting in 12 killed and 23
 wounded. There were several terrorist acts against
 Arabs by extremist Israelis. On June 2 the Mayors of
 Nablus and Ramallah were maimed by bombs allegedly set
 for them by Jewish extremists. No arrests have been
 made as yet in these cases. Charges have appeared in
 the Israeli press that the government has failed to
 pursue the investigation in full vigor. The govern-
 ment has flatly denied these charges.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfill-
 ment of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education.
 Investment in economic infrastructure in the
 territories has been small; only Israeli banks are
 allowed to operate in the West Bank and Gaza.
 Numerous complaints have been received that Israel
 restricts economic development on both political
 and commercial grounds, thereby keeping the West Bank
 and Gaza as captive markets. Nevertheless, accord-
 ing to official government statistics, unemployment
 in the occupied territories is very low and real
 per capita income has more than doubled since 1967.
 Much of this increase in per capita income can be
 attributed to the large number of Palestinian
 workers employed in Israel. Many individuals,
 especially those with higher education, migrate to
 other countries where greater professional
 opportunities exist.
 Israeli settlement activity in the occupied
 territories has adversely affected the livelihood
 of some Arab residents, particularly as the result
 of the taking of land for settlements. In many
 instances, those affected have had to leave farming
 to become day laborers. In contravention of the
 generally accepted interpretation of the Fourth Geneva
 Convention's Article 49, Israel has established more
 than 120 non-military settlements in the occupied
 territories, with a total population of about 22,200
 people, excluding East Jerusalem. Of these settle-
 ments seven were established in the first ten months
 of 1980, including six on the West Bank and one in
 Gaza. Also included are 19 in Sinai which Israel has
 agreed to remove by April 1982 as part of its with-
 drawal under the terms of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace
 Treaty.

 The Government of Israel allows the inhabitants of
 the occupied territories access to the Israeli court
 system, in cases where Israel recognizes ownership of
 the land, to appeal the taking of land. The Israeli
 High Court in 1979 ruled that private land in the
 occupied territories legally may be requisitioned by
 the military for civilian settlements only when
 justified primarily on security grounds. Despite this
 decision, however, landowners generally have failed to
 win back requisitioned land, although Israel has tended
 to avoid requisitioning strictly documented private
 land since the Court's decision. The Arab residents
 have found it difficult to challenge land requisitions
 because title requirements are quite strict and many
 settlements are justified initially on military or
 security grounds; even after conversion from parami-
 litary to civilian status this justification continues
 to be advanced. Groups of Arab landowners, however,
 have won several court orders delaying settlement
 activity.
 Israeli officials announced in September that
 the government will restrict itself to building four
 more settlements on the West Bank. Many existing
 settlements continue to growo both in area - through
 further requisitions -  and in population. Compen-
 sation for expropriated land is sometimes offered,
 but is rarely accepted by Arab residents because
 acceptance might compromise any future claim to the
 land and because Jordanian law treats such trans-
 actions as a capital crime.
 A further problem results from the exploitation
 of a part of the West Bank's limited water resources
 for the use of Israeli settlements. There have been
 allegations that in some cases the use of West Bank
 and Gaza water resources for Israeli settlements had
 detrimental effects on Arab agriculture and livestock,
 and on the rural population. The government on the
 other hand maintains that Israeli exploitation of
 West Bank water has been limited to new water sources
 discovered and developed by Israeli technology or to
 surplus water from existing water systems, and that
 Arab users of agricultural water have not been denied
 any of their traditional water rights. Israeli
 authorities cite substantial gains in Arab agricul-
 tural production - particularly in crops that are
 relatively heavey water users - as proof that the
 strict Israeli conservation measures have not been
 detrimental. Istaeli water control policies in the
 West Bank and Gaza, beyond conservation measures, aim
 to ensure that water in the area will be available to
 support the development of an infrastructure of Israeli
 settlements in the territories. Diversion of new water
 resources to these settlements deprives Arab
 agriculture and industry of them.

 The military government meets the basic educational
 needs of students in the occupied territories as does
 the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for the
 refugees. Following student demonstrations in the spring
 of 1980, the military government closed many schools,
 including Bir Zeit University, for a period of several
 months. Since then, the authorities have closed the
 high school in Bir Zeit, (which had been the site of a
 number of confrontations) dispersing its students among
 a number of less well-equipped schools in nearby
 villages. In July 1980, the military governor amended
 Jordanian law regarding educational institutions to
 give himself the power to dismiss university students,
 bar professors and revoke university charters. This
 move was seen by many Palestinians as an attempt to
 exert greater political control over the West Bank
 universities. An Israeli spokesman stated that these
 measures were meant to regulate an area of education
 not existing under Jordanian rule and to protect the
 integrity of the educational process.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly.
 Freedom of religion in the occupied territories is
 generally unqualified. Israel has scrupulously
 protected Muslim and Christian holy places and has
 assured full freedom of access thereto. There were
 instances in 1980, when extremists vandalized Christian
 institutions in Jerusalem. The Government of Israel
 and the Mayor of Jerusalem deplored these acts and
 called for respect for these and for other religious
 institutions. The municipality of Jerusalem reim-
 bursed the institutions for the damages.
 Freedom of expression and assembly is restricted
 on security grounds. Permits are required for public
 meetings and rallies, and few have been granted.
 Commercial and school strikes are not allowed and
 coercive methods are often used to force reopenings.
 The East Jerusalem press is subject to censorship
 but generally is allowed to operate freely and is
 frequently outspoken in its criticism of Israeli
 policies. In 1980, the government briefly prohibited
 the distribution of three Arab publications.
 Editorials are regularly censored or excised. Sev-
 eral editors were restricted to their homes or villages
 and no longer can work at their offices in East Jerusalem.
 Educational materials originating in Arab countries are
 screened and censored for anti-Israel or anti-Jewish content
 An increasing number of books has been banned during 1980 in
 the occupied territories.
 
 
 1009
 Individuals generally are not arrested because of
 privately held views but membership in a proscribed or-
 ganization, (e.g., the Palestine Liberation Organization
 or one of its constituent elements) is grounds for arrest.
 Moreover, the deportations of several Palestinian figures
 in part were linked to strongly nationalist statements they
 made in public. The Mayor of Qalqilya was detained briefly
 in October for distributing "inflammatory" statements.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.
 Freedom of movement for most Arabs generally is
 unrestricted in the occupied territories and thousands
 of Arabs travel dally to Israel for work. Vehicles
 owned by inhabitants of the occupied territories are
 so marked, and are frequently stopped for security
 inspection. Arab inhabitants of the territories are
 required to obtain permits to stay overnight within
 Israel.
 Inhabitants of the territories crossing from Jordan
 into the West Bank, as well as other Arabs or persons of
 Arab descent, are subject to searches for weapons and
 contraband. There have been complaints that these
 searches are more rigorous than necessary on purely
 security grounds, and constitute harassment.
 Inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza are free to
 travel abroad and return. Many thousands do so each year,
 although the frequency of travel, particularly of young
 men, is sometimes restricted. Increasingly, the
 military government has restricted the travel of specific
 individuals, most notably various Gaza and West Bank
 mayors and other leaders. Several prominent .Palestinlans
 have been refused permission to attend conferences on
 Palestinian issues in the United States and elsewhere.
 Meetings of municipal leaders within the territories also
 have been curtailed and mayors frequently have been
 restricted to their towns in 1980. Temporary travel bans
 occasionally have been applied to large population groups
 following suspected terrorist acts or demonstrations. The
 most notable instance was in Hebron, following the slaying
 of six Israeli settlers on May 2, in which residents were
 prohibited from travelling to Jordan for some weeks
 following the lifting of the curfew.
 The government states that it has allowed since 1967
 more than 50,000 Palestinians to return permanently to
 the occupied territories for family reunification. Most
 returned in 1968, with smaller numbers in the years since.
 In 1977, there were 1,397; in 1978, there were 1,511;
 in 1979, there were 1,008; and from January through
 September 1980 there were 1,200. A number of individuals
 have returned on tourist visas, and have remained without
 interference. At least several hundred thousand additional
 
 
 1010
 Palestinians who left the area during the 1967 hostilities
 have not been allowed to return. The Camp David
 Accords call for the eventual establishment of a
 commission to decide the modalities for the return of
 displaced persons.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process.
 There have been two elections of mayors and city
 councilmen in the West Bank since the beginning of the
 Israeli occupation, in 1972 and again in 1976. Israel
 permitted Arab nationalists outspokenly hostile to Israeli
 occupation to run for office in the second West Bank
 election and honored the results of those elections.
 Since the Hebron attack, it has proscribed political
 activities by these men not directly related to their
 municipal duties. The municipal elections that were to
 be held in the spring of 1980 were postponed because of
 uncertainty whether elections might be held later that
 year for the Self-Governing Authority envisioned in the
 Camp David Accords. The military government must approve
 all candidates for labor union elections.
 The status of women in the occupied territories
 reflects traditional Palestinian values and practices.
 Matters pertaining to marriage, family and personal status
 are governed by Muslim or Christian religious law as inter-
 preted by religious courts; accordingly women generally
 do not have equal status. Changes are taking place,
 however. Since 1967, the proportion of women in school
 has steadily increased so that now they comprise
 roughly one-half of the school population. Education and
 enfranchisement are affecting the traditional status of
 women. Unenfrancised under the law enforced before 1967,
 women are now permitted by the military government to vote
 in municipal elections. The younger generation of women is
 growing up with different expectations about its status.
 Relatively few women in the population of the occupied
 territories participate in the hired labor force. Many
 women workers are not counted since they are employed on
 farms, at home, or in small family enterprises excluded
 from statistics. Women who work in Israel or for Israeli
 firms receive equal benefits of Israeli labor laws and
 practices.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Since 1976, Amnesty International and other groups
 repeatedly have requested an outside investigation of
 allegations of mistreatment of prisoners and security
 detainees. In September 1980, Amnesty International (AI)
 released a report which consists of a 1979 memorandum
 calling on Israel to permit an independent investigation
 of allegations of mistreatment, and Israel's rebuttal of
 
 
 1011
 the report's findings. The report, based on allegations
 gathered up to June 1979, concludes that there exists
 sufficient prima facie evidence of ill-treatment of
 security suspects by interrogators to warrant establish-
 ment of a public inquiry. AI charges that Israel's own
 pre-trial administrative and legal procedures, which tend
 to isolate suspects, prevent Israel from conclusively
 refuting such allegations. The report concedes that in
 some cases those allegations could be politically
 motivated. Specifically AI expresses concern that too
 many cases are decided on the basis of confessions given
 prior to the detainee's contact with counsel and family.
 Israel's Attorney General has replied that the
 Amnesty International report lacks objectivity, is
 erroneous, and does not sufficiently take into account
 the problems confronting Israel as it tries to maintain
 security and protect its own population from violence.
 The Attorney General rejected any need for a committee
 of inquiry but stated that Israel will continue to
 consider ways of improving its practices and procedures.
 As noted above (in Section lb.), the ICRC regularly
 inspects prison conditions in the occupied territories
 and makes recommendations for improvement.
