 MALAWI
 Virtually all effective authority in Malawi is exercised by
 life President H. Kamuzu Banda through a government struc-
 ture which interacts closely with the only political party,
 the Malawi Congress Party. Malawi's political system has
 its base in popular recognition of President Banda as the
 architect of the movement for national independence, gain-
 ed in 1964, and as the leader responsible for the coun-
 try's consistent and widely recognized economic development.
 Economic growth and political stability, however, have been
 accompanied by restraints on human rights. Until 1977 there
 had been periods of government violations of civil and
 political rights, including arrest and prolonged detention
 without charges or trial, confiscation of personal property
 and exclusion from the political process by expulsion from
 the party. These restraints occurred in reaction to per-
 ceived challenges to the government by political and reli-
 gious dissidents, particularly Jehovah's Witnesses. An es-
 timated 25-30 persons are believed to remain in detention
 for political reasons although this number may have been
 reduced by unpublicized releases in late 1978. One known
 arrest on apparent political grounds occurred in late 1979
 but there has been a general trend of liberalization since
 early 1977 when 2,000 detainees were released. The treat-
 ment of Jehovah's Witnesses has improved significantly.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not condoned by the Government and there is no
 evidence that it occurred in 1979 or previous years. While
 it was probably true that Jehovah's Witnesses were physical-
 ly mistreated and even killed in the early 1970's by local
 villagers, no murders are believed to have occurred since
 1975-76 when Government agreement was reached with the
 Jehovah's Witnesses that the latter would cease their prose-
 lytizing and would pay taxes. Abuses of power by local
 officials were punished. While there were a few reports
 that Jehovah's Witnesses were beaten by local villagers in
 1976 to 1978, no such instances are known to have occurred
 in 1979.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Malawi prisons are adequate and reflect a general policy of
 striving for humane standards. While the quality and quan-
 tity of food is poor by Western standards, it is not signif-
 icantly worse than that available to the citizenry. Prison
 administrators also provide for basic health and hygiene
 needs. While there have been occasional reports of rough
 handling and verbal abuse of detainees, this has not extend-
 ed to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The most re-
 cent indications are that teachers and students released
 after their detention in 1975-76 are being permitted to re-
 turn to their jobs. There is no effort to prevent former
 detainees from obtaining employment in the private sector
 and many are believed to have done so.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or -Imprisonment
 There has been a decline over the past three years in Gov-
 ernment use of arbitrary detention powers provided for by
 public security regulations. However, one such arrest is
 known to have occurred in late 1979. There also was an un-
 confirmed report that a few other arrests may have occurred.
 Nevertheless, there were also indications of continuing re-
 leases of political detainees in the latter part of 1979
 suggesting continued liberalization in the use of police
 powers. Those in prison under long term detention include
 Jehovah's Witnesses who have refused to abide by the under-
 standing of proselytization and one individual connected
 with the former Minister of State Albert Muwalo who was
 tried and executed for treason in early 1977.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Individuals arrested and charged with criminal offenses are
 generally dealt with promptly and fairly. There are occa-
 sional instances of administrative delays which are not
 known to be deliberately imposed. Legal counsel and a fair
 public trial are afforded all criminal and civil defendants.
 In political cases, however, there is neither assurance of
 open public trial nor a prompt administrative review of the
 defendant's case.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 No instances of invasion of the home are known in the past
 two years. This abuse occurred frequently in the mid-1970's
 when Government authorities employed a special entry authori-
 ty available under law.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Malawi has a predominantly agricultural economy, possesses
 virtually no mineral resources and functions under an es-
 sentially free market system with parastatal corporations
 that play a significant role in agricultural marketing,
 housing and in some areas of commercial distribution of
 goods and services. While Malawi still figures among the
 25 poorest developing countries, the country has progressed
 steadily towards its stated goals of improving the food,
 clothing, shelter, health care and education available to
 all Malawians. These objectives are central to the coun-
 try's priority development plan, the National Rural Devel-
 opment Program. Malawi has achieved self-sufficiency in
 food; an attainment underscored in 1979 by its regional
 exports of corn, which in at least one instance was a gift.
 Public education at the primary and secondary levels is
 increasingly available for the payment of small fees for
 tuition and uniforms and is within the means of even the
 rural poor. Literacy has steadily increased from virtually
 nil at independence to an estimated 30 percent at present.
 University-level educational opportunities are restricted
 by a lack of facilities, but there are no tuition charges
 and the government has undertaken a large expansion of
 higher education. Health care remains inadequate despite
 a steady expansion of dispensaries and hospitals throughout
 the country.

 There are wide ranges of income in Malawi.  Senior level
 officials enjoy relatively large incomes from farms and
 businesses acquired as a result of their official positions.
 At the same time, industrial and agricultural wages are kept
 at low levels to discourage inflation and encourage economic
 development. Income taxes are levied on a progressive basis.
 The standard of living of most Malawians has steadily im-
 proved proved over the past 15 years in striking contrast
 with the pre-independence period. Corruption is subject to
 stringent punishment and does not represent a perceptible
 drain on the country's resources.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The exercise of these freedoms is restricted under law and
 in practice to preclude any criticism of government offi-
 cials and policies. Association for the purpose of forming
 political opposition is also prohibited. These prohibitions
 are reinfored by social attitudes that disapprove of overt
 criticism of persons in positions of traditional or official
 authority. Freedom of religion is protected with the excep-
 tion of the Jehovah's Witnesses, whose practices are seen as
 defying the authority of the state.
 In 1979 practical enforcement of Malawi's extensive censor-
 ship regulations which prohibited both dissident political
 commentary and dissemination of material deemed sexually im-
 moral was eased somewhat, especially with respect to cover-
 age of international and other foreign issues. Criticism
 of the government is still proscribed. Regulations for pub-
 lications were being prepared in late 1979, which may formal-
 ize this liberalization. The sole national newspaper is
 government-controlled but operates under informal self-
 censorship guidelines. Much more stringent control is exer-
 cised over the sole radio network, which is owned and operat-
 ed by the government.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There were no known restrictions on movement within Malawi
 in 1979. Legal provisions for restricting the movement of
 persons convicted of criminal or political offenses were ap-
 plied against those expelled or suspended from the party sev-
 eral years ago but were lifted when these persons were re-
 instated. Foreign travel of civil servants requires offi-
 cial clearance and passports have been denied to persons po-
 litically suspect. Nevertheless, in 1979, as in 1978, there
 was no significant restriction in practice on travel abroad.
 Over the period 1975-1978, Asian residents of Malawi were
 progressively restricted to Malawi's three main urban cen-
 ters, allegedly in order to promote the entry of Malawians
 into retail businesses throughout the country. Many Asians
 left in response to Government statements that Asians did
 not have a long-term future in the country. Nevertheless,
 the substantial number that remain play an important role
 in urban commercial activities, are free from harassment
 and hold some positions in municipal bodies.

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Malawi has an authoritarian political process. The sole le-
 gal Party, the Malawi Congress Party, actively seeks to
 encourage broad mass membership and participation, and has
 an extensive network of local organizations for youth and
 women, and interacts closely with the government in activi-
 ties such as determining priorities for development projects.
 Party membership is limited to indigenous Africans and only
 party members may seek election to Malawi's parliament. The
 Party presented single candidates in about one-third of the
 districts in the 1978 parliamentary elections. The remain-
 ing seats were contested and included races involving promi-
 nent political figures; two ministers were defeated. The
 party functions both as a conduit for grass roots opinions
 upward and to ensure government control throughout the
 country.
 While women have traditionally played a subordinate role in
 Malawi, government policy has in recent years begun to call
 for increased participation and recognition of women in all
 aspects of national life. The highly organized League of
 Malawi women has an active mass membership and is an
 influential source of political support for President Banda.
 Women are prominent in party activities and several hold
 parliamentary seats. Women are still underrepresented in
 senior government positions but their increasing access to
 higher education holds out long-term prospects for advance-
 ment. The labor movement in Malawi is centered in the
 Malawi Trade Union Congress (MTUC) which comprises unions in
 key sectors of the economy, and is subordinate to the Malawi
 Congress Party. While union influence is generally weak and
 wage levels are controlled by the government, negotiations
 in recent years have resulted in upward revisions of minimum
 wages in several sectors. Actual wage levels have risen
 sharply for many as a result of market demands. Labor ap-
 pears to have accepted government controls on wages as part
 of an anti-inflationary policy that also controls the cost
 of food and other basic necessities, including housing, edu-
 cation and health care.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Government has not responded to a complaint lodged
 against it several years ago with the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission regarding persecution of Jehovah's
 Witnesses. The complaint has not since been actively
 pressed. While the government of Malawi has made no state-
 ment regarding cooperation with investigations by interna-
 tional bodies into alleged violations of human rights in
 Malawi, such cooperation would probably be denied. Never-
 theless, over the past two years, Malawi has freely
 admitted numerous foreign journalists, including several
 who previously had written articles critical of the human
 rights violations of the mid-1970's.
