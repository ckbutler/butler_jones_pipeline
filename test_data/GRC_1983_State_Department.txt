 GREECE
 Greece is a republic with a democratically elected parliament.
 A full member of the European Economic Community, Greece is
 classified according to United Nations standards as a developed
 country. Nevertheless it has some attributes of a developing
 economy, including a tradition of state intervention.
 The full range of universally acknowledged human rights is
 guaranteed by the language of the Constitution, which includes
 many of the provisions of the United Nations' Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights. Parliamentary elections were held
 most recently in 1981 and local elections in 1982. Both were
 vigorously and freely contested.
 The judiciary is independent of both the executive branch of
 government and Parliament and operates within a civil law
 framework with precedents from Roman Law and French and German
 sources. An active and unfettered press functions throughout
 the country. Radio and television are state operated, but
 function with a significant degree of independence from the
 government. In general, through a combination of
 constitutional guarantees and administrative practices, Greece
 maintains an excellent human rights record.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 In general, the individual is secure in Greece. However, there
 were several as yet unsolved cases of murder which were widely
 attributed to extremists, including the killing on November 15
 of U.S. Navy Captain George Tsantes, an official of the U.S.
 Embassy in Athens. The militant leftist group which claimed
 responsibility for the Tsantes assassination, the Seventeen
 November Revolutionary Organization, claimed responsibility for
 four other politically motivated murders several years ago.
 The Greek Government has strongly condemned all terrorist
 killings and is committed to apprehending and bringing to
 justice perpetrators of such acts.
 b. Disappearance
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested, or held in
 clandestine detention either by legal authorities or others.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by the Constitution.
 Torture and bodily maltreatment, impairment of health, or the
 use of psychological violence, as well as any other offense
 against human dignity, are prohibited and punished as provided
 by law. These provisions are generally respected in practice.
 Amnesty International, however, reported in its 1983 report (on
 the year 1982) that four Greek prisoners had initiated a
 lawsuit alleging they were tortured while in custody and that
 it had received other allegations of torture in police stations
 and prisons. Freedom from cruel, inhuman, and degrading
 treatment or punishment is also guaranteed by the Constitution,
 
 (1002)
 
 
 1003
 and was respected in practice during 1983. Physical
 punishments are not administered as sentences for crimes.
 Conditions in prison and detention facilities are
 satisfactory. Adequate health care and diet are provided.
 There is no distinction in treatment among prisoners of
 different social class, race, sex, religion, or type of
 conviction. Cases requiring medical treatment receive special
 attention. Once sentenced, prisoners may be visited by family
 members three times per week.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 the Constitution, which states "no person shall be arrested or
 imprisoned without a reasoned judicial warrant which must be
 served at the moment of arrest or detention pending trial,
 except when caught committing a criminal act." This provision
 is respected in practice. Preventive detention does not exist
 in Greece. A person arrested on warrant or while committing a
 crime must be brought before an examining magistrate within 24
 hours and charged. This magistrate must issue a warrant of
 imprisonment or order the release of the detainee within three
 days of the examination unless special circumstances require a
 two-day extension of this time limit. The Constitution further
 states that the maximum duration of detention pending trial
 "may not exceed a period of one year in the case of felonies or
 six months in the case of misdemeanors." A decision of a
 judicial council is required to effect extensions of these
 maximum durations (by six or three months, respectively)
 in exceptional cases. In practice, trials generally take place
 within four months of the submission of charges. Exiling as a
 judicial remedy or government practice does not occur in Greece.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and the
 military. Fair and public trials are guaranteed by the
 Constitution and provided in practice. Defense lawyers are
 always available. Court sessions are public unless, as
 provided in the Constitution, the court decides that privacy is
 required for the protection of victims, when juveniles or
 morals offenses are involved, or in matters of national
 security. This latter provision is not abused. There is also
 a legal provision permitting a closed hearing for the sensitive
 portion of cases dealing with public order. In such instances,
 none of which are known to have occurred during the past year,
 the court by law must publicly pronounce its "reasoned
 decision" on the matters heard privately. A defendant may
 appeal a court verdict to an appeals court.
 The Constitution stipulates that military courts shall have no
 jurisdiction over civilians. During a period lasting several
 months between late 1982 and mid-1983, marked by strikes and
 demonstrations at a United States Air Force base close to
 Athens, one U.S. serviceman was summarily expelled and two
 others were tried in absentia in disregard both of applicable
 status of forces arrangements and of minimum standards of due
 process. These cases were not repeated, and appear to be
 exceptions to the normal operation of Greek justice.
 
 
 1004
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home as well as of an individual's
 personal and family life are guaranteed by the Constitution,
 which states "every person's home is a sanctuary." The
 personal and daily life of the individual is inviolable. No
 house search may be made except when and as specified by law
 and always in the presence of representatives of the judicial
 power. These constitutional guarantees are respected in
 practice. Warrants, issued by a district attorney (who is
 considered a judicial officer in Greece) are required for an
 official to enter a private home. No cases are known in which
 forced entry has been alleged or in which the Government has
 practiced other violations of the home. A constitutional
 provision requires punishment and "liability to full damages to
 the sufferer" for violations of the sanctuary of the home and
 for the abuse of power. The Constitution further guarantees
 that the "secrecy of letters and all other forms of free
 correspondence or communication shall be absolutely
 inviolable." This guarantee has been respected in practice in
 1983.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Constitution, which
 states that every person may express and propagate his thoughts
 orally, in writing, and through the press, with due regard to
 the laws of the State.
 The Constitution states "the press is free. Censorship and all
 other preventive measures are prohibited." Opposition
 viewpoints are constantly ventilated in the active Greek press,
 and criticism of the Government is unhampered. While radio and
 television are government owned, opposition viewpoints are
 aired, though not fully enough to satisfy the opposition. The
 Constitution allows for seizure, by order of the public
 prosecutor, of publications which insult the President, offend
 religious beliefs, contain obscene articles, advocate a violent
 overthrow of the political system, or disclose military and
 defense information. No periodicals or newspapers were seized
 in 1983. Greece has strict libel laws. Violations of these
 laws are prosecuted under established legal procedures with the
 safeguards of due process.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the Constitution, which
 states "Greeks shall have the right to assemble peaceably and
 unarmed." Limits on outdoor public meetings do exist, however,
 if it is determined by police authorities that a serious
 disturbance of social and economic life is threatened. In 1983
 no public assemblies were prohibited.
 Labor rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and are
 respected in practice. The right to bargain collectively and
 the right to strike are exercised freely.
 
 
 1005
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion and prohibits
 discriminatory practices against religious minorities. The
 prevailing religion is Eastern Orthodox. There are several
 small minorities including Muslims, Jews, and non-Orthodox
 Christians. They participate freely in the economic life of
 Greece and enjoy full political rights. Currently there are
 two Muslim members of Parliament. The Greek Government states
 that it is committed to observing the provisions of the Treaty
 of Lausanne relating to the education and political rights of
 the Muslim minority.
 The Muslim minority has alleged discriminatory practices by
 Greek officials in the areas of education (including selection
 of textbooks and teachers), building permits, licenses for
 conducting businesses, drivers' licenses, travel permits,
 religious endowments, and land sales. The minority claimed
 discriminatory eviction practices by local authorities in two
 court cases. The first involved a 1982 lower court decision
 evicting Muslim farmers from land in the village of Evlalos.
 That decision upheld government claims that the Muslim land
 titles, many dating from the Ottoman period, were invalid. The
 Muslims appealed and in 1983 obtained a reversal of the court's
 decision to evict, thereby allowing the farming to continue.
 The Muslims maintain, however, that the legality of their
 titles remains in question, making them vulnerable to further
 expulsion attempts. They are seeking a further court decision
 which recognizes their titles.
 The second case concerned property rights near the town of
 Komotini. In 1978 the Government had expropriated Greek and
 Muslim-owned land for the construction of a university,
 offering a price the farmers considered inequitable. As actual
 construction was postponed, however, the farmers continued to
 farm. Then, in late 1982, construction began on a corner of
 the land, leading to fears of eviction and to demonstrations by
 the Muslim minority. Local officials argue, however, that the
 state has an ultimate right of expropriation with payment for
 land needed for state purposes: roads, schools, hospitals,
 etc. In this case, the decision on the university site, they
 state, applied to Greek as well as Muslim farmers and was
 non-discriminatory.
 Greece's small community of Jehovah's Witnesses was affected by
 the provision in the Constitution which states that *no person
 shall be exempt from discharging his obligations to the State
 or may refuse to comply with laws by reason of his religious
 convictions." In deference to the Jehovah's Witnesses, the
 Government in 1979 modified the compulsory military service law
 to provide for alternative, noncombat service. While courts of
 first instance have, on occasion, handed down lengthy sentences
 to conscientious objectors who refuse military or alternative
 service altogether, prison terms are sharply reduced in the
 appellate process. Under the law, work can be undertaken in
 connection with prison sentences so that, in practice, a
 conscientious objector does not serve a sentence longer than
 his period of military obligation and could serve a shorter
 period.
 
 
 1006
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of movement within the
 country, foreign travel, and emigration. This right is
 generally respected in practice. Intending emigrants and those
 returning experience no discrimination. Refugees are not
 forced to return to homelands from which they fled.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Greece is a multi-party democracy in which all citizens enjoy
 full political rights, without regard to race, sex, religion,
 or political persuasion. Greek citizens freely choose the laws
 and the officials that govern them. The opposition parties
 function freely, have access to the media, and hold public
 meetings.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Greek Government has not objected to visits and
 investigations by human rights organizations. Freedom House
 regards Greece as "free." Amnesty International in its 1983
 Report expressed concern about several cases of conscientious
 objectors who had been imprisoned, and reported allegations of
 torture which took place in 1982 (see section 1 c
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Living standards are relatively high, as reflected in social
 data on Greece. Greeks are well-fed; the ratio of calorie
 supply relative to nutritional requirements is 135 percent.
 Life expectancy at birth is about 74 years, and the adult
 literacy rate is 86 percent for the total population, but
 almost 100 percent for adults below 55 years of age. Moreover,
 100 percent of the population has access to safe water, and
 primary school enrollment exceeds 100 percent (i.e., some
 children older or younger than the normal ages are in primary
 school). The infant mortality rate is 16.4 per 1,000, live
 births, and the quality of medical care, particularly outside
 the three major cities, is substandard.
 Unofficial estimates describe the ethnic composition of the
 Greek population as approximately 98 percent Greek, about one
 percent Muslim (mostly ethnic Turkish), with the remaining one
 percent divided between Vlach, Albanian, and Jewish. The
 Muslim minority, estimated at approximately 120,000, lives
 primarily in Thrace. Many villages in Thrace regularly elect
 Muslim mayors, and there are over 250 mosques in Greece.
 Women are guaranteed the same individual, political, and social
 rights as men by the Constitution. Women play an active role
 in the political life of the country. At present there are 13
 women in the 300 member Parliament and one minister and two
 deputy ministers in the Cabinet. The position of women in
 Greek society has undergone rapid change in conjunction with
 the process of industrialization and modernization. Recent
 
 
 1007
 governments have addressed the role of women in Greece, and
 significant reforms have been made in divorce and property
 laws. Women comprise over one third of the industrial labor
 force, and the percentage is increasing.
 The economy is experiencing problems. Overall production is
 declining, along with per capita gross national product (GNP).
 The latter has declined from $4,300 in 1980 to an estimated
 $3,770 in 1983. The rate of inflation, as measured by the
 consumer price index, is expected to be about 21 percent for
 1983 as a whole and is comparable to the 1982 rate. This
 result, however, has been achieved partly through price
 controls. Exchange controls are a common feature of economic
 life.
 Greece has a tradition of state economic activities, and the
 public sector accounts for over 50 percent of the GNP. The
 Greek Government establishes a wide range of controls on retail
 and wholesale prices, maintains an overvalued currency, places
 strict limitations on the transfer of private capital abroad,
 rations credit to the private sector, and restricts the ability
 of companies to lay off workers.
