 BURUNDI
 Burundi's democratically elected president was overthrown in a military coup on
 July 25. Despite the coup, the National Assembly and political parties continue to
 operate, although under constraints. The present regime, under the self-proclaimed
 interim President, Major Pierre Buyoya, abrogated the 1992 Constitution and, dur-
 ing the so-called Transition Period, replaced the 1994 Convention of Government
 with a decree promulgated on September 13. Under this decree, the National As-
 sembly does not have the power to remove the President of the Republic. The Prime
 Minister, appointed by the President, replaces the President in the event of the
 President's death or incapacity. Under the former constitution, the President of the
 National Assembly replaced the President.
 Buyoya holds power in conjunction with the Tutsi-dominated military establish-
 ment. The judicial system remains under the control of the Tutsi minority, and most
 citizens consider it biased against Hutus. Violent conflict among Hutu and Tutsi
 armed militants and the army plunged the country into a civil war marked by eth-
 nic violence, which included fighting between the army and armed rebel groups. The
 fighting resulted in the death, injury, and displacement of large numbers of civil-
 ians. Tens of thousands of people, both Hutu and Tutsi, have been massacred in eth-
 nic violence since independence, especially in 1972, 1988, 1993, and since 1995. As
 the U.N. Commission of Inquiry in Burundi concluded in 1996, much, but not all,
 of the ethnic violence in Burundi since 1993 constituted genocide.
 The security forces consist of the army and the gendarmerie under the Ministry
 of Defense, the judicial police under the Ministry of Justice, and the documentation
 police under the Ministry of the Interior. The army remains committed to protecting
 the interests of the Tutsi minority. The security forces committed numerous, seri-
 ous, human rights abuses and also permitted Tutsi extremists to commit abuses.
 Burundi is poor and densely populated, with over four-fifths of the population of
 7 million engaged in subsistence agriculture. Per capita gross national product is
 estimated atless than $200 per year. The small modern sector, based largely on the
 export of coffee and tea, was damaged by an economic embargo imposed by neigh-
 boring countries July 31. The ongoing violence since October 1993 has caused severe
 disruptions and dislocations. Large numbers of internally displaced persons were
 unable to produce their own food crops and depended largely on international hu-
 manitarian assistance. Government efforts to pnvatize state-owned enterprises have
 come to a virtual halt.
 The human rights situation continued to deteriorate. The security forces contin-
 ued to commit numerous, serious human rights abuses, including extrajudicial
 killings. Military forces committed massacres of unarmed civilian Hutus and fre-
 quently permitted Tutsi extremists to engage in violence against Hutus. The Gov-
 ernment was largely unable to prevent such abuses, and perpetrators generally
 went unpunished. Serious incidents of ethnically motivated extrajudicial killing and
 destruction of property occurred throughout the country. Armed troops and civilian
 militias killed both armed and unarmed ethnic rivals, including women, children,
 and the elderly. They also killed expatriates.
 Government efforts to restore security were inadequate. Members of the armed
 forces and vigilante groups committed serious human rights violations with impu-
 nity. The continuing lack of accountability for killings and ethnic violence, and for
 those responsible for the 1993 coup attempt and the massacres that followed, con-
 tributed significantly to national insecurity. The dysfunctional justice system could
 not satisfactorily address these problems due to its own lack of independence, ineffi-
 ciency, administrative disru ption, and the partiality of Tutsi officials. The U.N.
 International Commission of Inquiry has issued a report about the events of October
 1993, although no one involved has yet been brought to justice. Disappearances con-
 
 
 tinued, and prison conditions remained life threatening. Arbitrary arrest and
 lenghy pretrial detention are problems. The court system suffers under a heavy
 backlog. The Government controls nearly all the media and banned public assembly.
 There are some restrictions on movement.
 Legal and societal discrimination against women continues to be a serious prob-
 lem; violence against women also occurs. Citizens do not have the right to change
 their government. Ethnic discrimination against Hutus is widespread. The Twa
 (Pygmy) minority remained almost completely ma naized.
 lutu rebel forces massacred both Hutu and Tutsi civilians, including women, chil-
 dren, the elderly, and expatriates, and the numbers killed increased, reflecting the
 increased scope of rebel activity during the past year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Amnesty International estimated
 that between October 1993 and December 1995 more than 100,000 people were
 killed in ethnic violence. The army was more responsible than any other group for
 these deaths. The United Nations Human Rights Rapporteur for Burundi estimated
 in June that 800 people per month were being killed; the majority of deaths con-
 tinue to be attributed to government security forces. Organization for African Unity
 (OAU) military observers estimated that an average of 500 people per month were
 killed during the first 6 months of the year. Western nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's) believe that about 10,000 people died in conflict during the year, although
 these sources acknowledge that their figures lack any degree of precision. In August
 the U.N. Center for Human Rights in Geneva issued a report that said that the
 Tutsi-led army killed 2,100 to 3,000 civilians in a series of incidents that took place
 between April and July. Between October and December, massacres of civilians by
 the military forces and the killing of innocent civilians by Hutu rebels occurred reg-
 ularly. According to human rights monitors, there were more than 20 incidents in
 which civilians were killed, mainly by the army, but also by Hutu rebels. The num-
 ber of civilians killed, estimated at 2,000 during the months of October through De-
 cember, was the heaviest of the year. The U.N. International Commission of Inquiry
 concluded in 1996 that much but not all of the ethnic violence since the 1993 assas-
 sination of Burundi's president has constituted genocide.
 A report released in February from the office of deposed President Sylvestre
 Ntibantunganya said that the army killed 44 civilians (9 men, 10 women, and 25
 children) during an operation in late January at Kabarore in northern Burundi.
 In March the Papal Nuncio reported that the municipal police killed a Hutu mer-
 chant from the Bujumbura central market along with five other Hutus near
 Bujumbura.
 On April 26, the army-or possibly the Tutsi militia-reportedly killed 236 Hutu
 civilians, mostly women and children. An additional 42 people from Buhoro were
 treated for stab wounds at a nearby hospital. The army initially denied any involve-
 ment but said later that Hutu rebels had used civilians as "human shields" during
 the course of a military operation at Buhoro. Both U.N. human rights monitors and
 government investigators found 20 graves with an unknown number of corpses at
 Buhoro.
 Government troops reportedly killed 14 civilians in Gitega province between April
 20 and 27; Hutu rebels killed 5 civilians at a Catholic mission May 16.
 U.N. human rights monitors investigated allegations of a possible massacre by
 government troops at Musigati in Bubanza province on May 6. The results of their
 investigation were inconclusive, although the U.N. investigators found 82 graves
 near Musigati.
 In Gitega province, Western aid workers reported that six trucks carrying soldiers
 arrived at Kibimba Hill on June 13. According to the aid workers, the soldiers used
 machine guns and bayonets to kill between 70 and 100 Hutu civilians, including
 women and children.
 Army troops reportedly killed about 40 Hutu civilians at a wedding ceremony on
 Mpfunda Hill in Kayanza province on July 13.
 Government forces reportedly took revenge for Hutu extremist kills and killed
 about 60 Hutu civilians at Muzinda, 7 kilometers from Bujumbura, on July 23.
 In late October, government radio reported that troops had killed 102 Hutu civil-
 ians in revenge for the killing of 26 Tutsis by Hutu rebels in Rutana province.
 In October the military forces admitted that its troops had killed 40 civilians near
 Mutana October 14; an inquiry is under way. Credible sources also reported a mas-
 sacre by military forces of between 100 and 400 recently returned refugees at a
 church in Murambi on October 22.
 
 
 In November the U.N. Human Rights Observer Mission reported that soldiers
 killed between 200 and 400 Hutu refugees in a church in Murambi in Cibitoke prov-
 ince, supposedly in revenge for the killing of the governor of Citiboke hours earlier.
 A government nquiry was promised.
 In early December, the military committed a series of killings in the southern por-
 tion of K ayanza province. According to U.N. Human Rights Observers, between 200
 and 300 Hutus were killed as the army implemented a forced resettlement policy.
 In mid-December, military forces killed 70 civilians near Rumonge, and NGO's re-
 ported that an undetermined number of civilians were killed by troops in Makaba
 province December 13.
 The three people accused of the 1995 killings of Italian religious workers in
 Bururi province have not been brought to justice. According to the public prosecutor,
 the Government is seeking the extradition of the three men accused of the killings
 from Rwanda and Uganda, where they are believed to have fled following their "es-
 cape from custody" in October 1995.
 Criminal courts resumed operations this year after a lapse of more than 2 years.
 The courts tried 79 people for capital crimes, of whom 60 were found guilty and sen-
 tenced to death. The courts acquitted the other 19 defendants. Other cases are pend-
 ing (see Section i.e.).
 During April and May, seven Hutu officials and one Tutsi military officer were
 killed by uneown assailants in Bujumbura. Two other prominent Hutus survived
 attempts to kill them. One National Assembly Deputy was killed and another
 wounded. No one has been brought to justice in connection with these murders and
 attempted murders. However, military forces claim that they arrested 25 suspects
 involved in these killings. Since 1993, 22 regular and alternate members of the Na-
 tional Assembly have been killed.
 Numerous Hutu civilian administrators were also killed during the year.
 On May 9, unknown gunmen fired automatic weapons and threw grenades into
 huts at a displaced persons' camp that housed about 6,000 Hutus in an outlying
 neighborhood of Bujumbura. Seven people were killed in the attack, and 32 others
 were wounded.
 On June 4, unknown gunmen killed three expatriate employees of the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Cibitoke province. A promised gov-
 ernment investigation has produced no results.
 In late February, Palipehutu rebels reportedly killed about 45 Hutu civilians in
 Cibitke province, according to Hutu sources.
 In late March, Hutu rebels near Snga in Bururi province killed about 110 Hutu
 and Tutsi civilians, according to OAU military observers. Houses were also burned.
 The Songa incident was the most severe of a series of rebel attacks in Bururi prov-
 ince during March and April.
 On May 3, Hutu rebels attacked the King Khaled Hospital in Bujumbura, killing
 a guard and injuring three other people, including a baby girl. Rebels also attacked
 a hospital rn by Medecins sans Frontieres-France in Makamba in early May.
 hutu rebels attacked a tea factory at Teza in Muramvya province on July 3.
 About 150 civilians, mainly TutSis, were killed in the attack, according to local and
 expatriate sources.
 A July 20 attack by Hutu rebels resulted in the deaths of a large number of Tutsi
 civilians at a displaced persons camp at Bugendana in Gitega province. A Western
 journalist counted 250 corpses at Bugendana, and government radio reported that
 342 people had been killed in the massacre.
 In September the Catholic archbishop of Gitega, a Tutsi, was killed in an ambush.
 It is not known who was responsible for his murder, but Church officials believe
 that Hutu rebels killed the arc bishop.
 Credible sources also reported that 87 civilians were killed inwen attack by Hutu
 rebels in Cibitoke province December 18.
 There is little reliable information about the interior since the July 25 coup. How-
 ever, U.N. human rights monitors reported that an undetermined number of civil-
 ians were killed ning      pce during fighting between rebel forces and govern-
 ment troops.
 b. Dsappearance.-Local human rights groups reported that abduction and dis-
 appearance were commonplace. Disappearances were the result of bth ethnic and
 political rivalry. Reliable numerical estimates are not available, but the U.a. human
 rights monitoring mission is aware of three cases in Bujumbura and has received
 a report concerning the disappearance of 31 children in the interior. There was no
 further information on six Tutsis who disappeared in August and September 1994.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The decree of September 13 and the suspended constitution prohibit these abuses,
 but they occur in practice.
 
 
 Prison conditions were life threatening and characterized by severe overcrowding
 and inadequate hygiene, clothing, medical care, food, and water. Prisoners had to
 rely on family members to ensure an adequate diet, and officials acknowledged that
 digestive illness was a major problem among the prisoners. Women were held sepa-
 rately from men. U.N. human rights monitors reported that Tutsi prison guards per-
 mitted Tutsi prisoners to assault Hutu prisoners in Bujumbura's main prison.
 U.N. human rights monitors and representatives of the ICRC were permitted to
 visit prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention are prob-
 lems. The law places no limit on the total length of pretrial detention. The police
 are obligated to obtain arrest warrants but have detained people for extended peri-
 ods without announcing charges, certifying the cases, or forwarding them to the
 Ministry of Justice as required. Bail is permitted in some cases. Incommunicado de-
 tention reportedly exists, although the law prohibits it.
 Presiding magistrates are authorized to issue arrest warrants. Regular police and
 gendarmes can make arrests without a warrant but must submit a written report
 to a magistrate within 48 hours of any arrest. A magistrate can order the suspect
 released or confirm the charges and continue detention, initially for 15 days, then
 subsequently for periods of 30 days, as necessary to prepare the case for trial. The
 Buyoya regime frequently and arbitrarily arrested foreign journalists (see Section
 2.a.).
 Despite the reestablishment of the criminal justice system, many of those arrested
 in conjunction with the events of 1993 remain in detention and have not faced trial.
 An attempt in April to bring foreign lawyers to the country to assist in the defense
 of those accused of crimes from 1993 failed.
 The disruption of the political process and the general level of insecurity severely
 impeded the judicial process. Pretrial detainees constituted about 80 percent of the
 prison population of approximately 6,900 inmates.
 The rlitary Government has not used forced exile as a means of political control.
 However, many people remain in voluntary exile in Belgium, Kenya, Tanzania, and
 Zaire. Many senior officials continue to keep their families outside the country. A
 number   of officials  of the  government    of deposed   President  Sylvestre
 Ntibantunganya fled the country in August. The Buyoya regime has refused to allow
 Ntibantunganya and National Assembly President Leonce Ngendakuma permission
 to leave the country (see Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The decree of September 13 provides for an inde-
 pendent judiciary, but in practice the judiciary is dominated by Tutsis.
 When it operated normally, the judicial system was divided into civil and criminal
 courts with the Supreme Court at the apex. The military services have a separate
 judicial system.
 Citizens do not have regular access to civilian and military court proceedings, al-
 though trials are ostensibly public. Defendants are presumed innocent and have the
 right to appeal. While defendants have a right to counsel and to defend themselves,
 few have legal representation in practice.
 Most citizens assume that the courts still promote the interest of the dominant
 Tutsi minority, and members of the Hutu majority believe that the Tutsi-dominated
 judicial system is biased against them. Hutus accounted for only 13 of the country's
 228 judges.
 In February Tutsi extremists tried to use the judicial system to challenge the
 means by which former President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya had been chosen Chief
 of State. The Constitutional Court ruled against the extremists' legal challenge.
 The criminal court system began to function again during the year. The vast ma-
 jority of those arrested on criminal charges since October 1993 remained in custody
 awaiting trial. Criminal courts were reestablished in Bujumbura and in the provin-
 cial centers of Citega and Ngozi. The criminal courts heard 79 cases relating to the
 1993 massacres. According to the State Public Prosecutor, 60 of the cases resulted
 in convictions and in 19 cases the defendants were acquitted. All those found guilty
 received the death penalty. A further 400 cases are now ready to be heard before
 the courts. About 5,000 more cases were under investigation at year's end.
 The civil court system functioned, although the lack of a well-trained and ade-
 quately supported judiciary constrained expeditious proceedings.
 Besides the frequent lack of counsel for the accused, other major shortcomings in
 the legal system include the lack of adequate resources and trained personnel, and
 an outmoded legal code. Most citizens have lost confidence in the system to provide
 even the most basic protection. This circumstance has contributed to the growing
 level of vigilante violence.
 
 
 There are no clearly identifiable political prisoners. However, police often bring
 charges of involvement in violent crimes or disturbance of the peace against detain-
 ees in connection with political issues.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The de-
 cree of September 13 provides for the right to privacy, and the authorities generally
 respect the law requiring search warrants. Security forces are assumed to regularly
 monitor telephones.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Vilations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-NGO's believe that about 10,000 persons died in conflict during the year (see
 Section L.a.).
 Continuing insecurity has limited international humanitarian relief operations in
 most areas outside of Bujumbura and brought them to a complete halt in Cibitoke
 and Bubanza provinces.
 In May civilian relief supplies were stolen from a truck in Muyinga province.
 The June 4 killing of three expatriate employees of the ICRC in Cibitoke province
 caused humanitarian workers to reevaluate their operations in some areas of the
 country. While operations continue in other areas, concerns about security remain.
 Government forces have compelled Hutu peasants to leave their homes in Karuzi
 province and move into displaced persons' camps, according to international relief
 agency officials.
 The army has also burned large numbers of civilian homes in the course of mili-
 tary operations in Gitega, Karuzi, Muramvya, Bubanza, Cibitoke, and Bujumbura
 rural provinces.
 A series of killings in early December by military forces in the southern part of
 Kayanza province resulted in 200 to 300 civilian deaths, according to the U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). These killings took place as the army was im-
 plementing a policy of forced resettlement of Hutus.
 Hutu rebels killed Hutu civilians who refused to pay "taxes" to the rebels, accord-
 ing to sources in the interior.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There are no restrictions imposed on the press
 in the decree of September 13; however, the regime owns the only newspaper and
 the two major radio stations.
 Newspapers, with the exception of the thrice-weekly government owned Le
 Renoveau, have ceased publication, generally for financial reasons. As a result,
 there is no opposition press. Newspaper readership remains limited. Numerous po-
 litical tract$ continue to circulate; however, these political pamphlets represent a va-
 riety of political viewpoints, often of an extremist nature.
 Most people rely on the two government-owned radio stations for information. One
 station broadcast in Kirundi, the other in French, Swahili, and English. An inde-
 pendent radio station, Radio Umwizero, financed by the European Union, began
 broadcasting during the year but has no political content.
 Since 1994 a clandestine radio station supporting Leonard Nyangoma's predomi-
 nately Hutu insurgent group, the National Council for the Defense of Democracy,
 broadcasted intermittently and attacked the Government and the Tutsi establish-
 ment.
 Foreign journalists were frequently questioned by the authorities. American, Bel-
 gian, British, Canadian, Danish, and French journalists were detained briefly by the
 gendarmerie.
 No laws or regulations limit the academic freedom of professors at the university.
 Although no persons were persecuted for what they published or said, the university
 remains mostly a monoethnic institution. Hutu students are discouraged from re-
 turning by other students. The security forces entered the university campus to
 break up political meetings in October.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government banned pub-
 lic political demonstrations. Prior to the July 25 coup, street demonstrations took
 place regularly in Bujumbura, often in contravention of the requirements then in
 orce that demonstrations be authorized in advance.
 The Government banned political parties immediately following the coup. Under
 the decree of September 13, they were again permitted to operate.
 Political associations generally did not operate in the interior of the country.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion, and the Government made no
 attempt to restrict freedom of worship by adherents of any religion. However, the
 Catholic archbishop of Gitega was murdered and other church officials have been
 wounded or killed in ambushes (see Section L.a.). The Government has little ability
 to protect politically targeted clergy.
 
 
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The September 13 decree did not restrict citizens' travel, and in gen-
 eral, the Government made no attempt to restrict travel for political reasons either
 internally or abroad, although the right to travel of those under criminal investiga-
 tion, including officials of the FRODEBU party, is limited. An additional exception
 was the refusal of the Buyoya regime to permit the departure from the country of
 President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya or National Assembly President Leonce
 Ngendakumana from the country.
 reneMay the Government closed the border with Zaire. It has not been officially
 Despite the imposition of a postcoup economic embargo by neighboring
 countries, which included air travel, citizens continue to be able to leave by read.
 Political parties and civilian militant groups at times prevented citizens from
 traveling to work and other locations.
 Movement throughout the country has been restricted by security problems that
 the Government has not resolved. Increasing banditry and ethnic violence per-
 petrated by armed gangs and the military has rendered travel in the countryside
 perilous. In most of the country, Hutus rarely enter Tutsi areas; Tutsis rarely enter
 Hutu areas. Military security checkpoints throughout the country effectively restrict
 movement.
 The UNHCR reported that about 180,000 Burundian refugees, most of them
 Hutu, remained in Zaire and Tanzania at year's end. Many had fled following the
 assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye in October 1993. Others fled as early
 as 1972. The UNHCR estimates that between 40,000 and 50,000 citizens left the
 country during the year. About 60,000 Burundian refugees returned in October and
 November following upheavel in eastern Zaire.
 All but 223 of the 140,000 Rwandan refugees who were in Burundi at the begin-
 ning of the year were repatriated by July 25. Some of the repatriations may have
 been coerced, according to the UNHCR, especially those from Ntamba camp in Jan-
 uary, and from the camps in Ngozi province in July. However, the majority of
 Rwandans returned to Rwanda voluntarily.
 More than half the population of the provinces of Cibitoke, Bubanza, Bujumbura
 rural, and Karuzi were estimated to be internally displaced persons. At least
 255,000 Burundians have been internally displaced, according to government esti-
 mates. Humanitarian agency officials believe that up to 400,000 Burnndians may
 be internally displaced. The high level of insecurity continues to make it difficult
 to assess accurately the number of internally displaced people or to provide ade-
 quate humanitarian assistance for them.
 The Government approved first asylum in recent years. This year, it hosted about
 100,000 refugees from Rwanda. While the national government respected refuguee
 conventions, local authorities forced large numbers of Rwandans to return to that
 country during the year. Refugees returning to Burundi were killed by Burundian
 security forces this year (see Section 1.g.).
 Refugees from other African countries, includingZaire and Somalia, have lived in
 the country for many years without encountering difficulties.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The September 13 decree makes no provision regarding elections, and following
 the July coup citizens did not have the right to change their government.
 Under the constitutional arrangements that were suspended by the coup, the now-
 deposed President should have remained in office until 1998, when legislative elec-
 tions were also scheduled.
 The decree of September 13 stipulates that the National Assembly consist of par-
 liamentarians elected in 1993 who sat in the previous National Assembly. Under the
 decree, the interim President may appoint additional Parliamentarians, but he has
 not yet chosen to exercise this power. While the National Assembly has nominal
 budgetary oversight, the decree of September 13 allows the Council of Ministers to
 enact a budget if the National Assembly fails to do so, and it gives the interim
 President the authority to declare a state of emergency by decree and without ref-
 erence to the National Assembly.
 On September 13, Major Buyoya announced the restoration of the National As-
 sembly and political parties with certain restrictions. In practice the National As-
 sembly is not expected to meet regularly until its members determine under what
 authority it can act. Many of its members are unwilling to operate under the au-
 thority of Major Buyoya's decree of September 13, the regime's declared legal frame-
 work for the transitional period. Of the 81 members of the Assembly who were elect-
 ed in 1993, 38 remain outside the country.
 
 
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women or indigenous people
 in elections or plitics. In practice, however, both women and ethnic Twa (Pygmies)
 who comprise a ut 1 percent of the population are underrepresented in government
 and in politics. Women currently hold 2 of the 22 Cabinet seats (no change from
 the number in the previous government) and 9 of the 81 seats in the National As-
 sembly. There are no Twa in either the Cabinet or the National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups received varying degrees of cooperation from govern-
 ment ministries and local authorities. The human rights group Iteka continued to
 operate and publish a newsletter on the human rights situation. International
 human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights/Watch
 Africa visited the country. The United Nations deployed a five-member human
 rights observer mission in April. Its work was hampered, however, by insecurity in
 the countryside and by the Government's inability, and in some cases unwillingness,
 to protect human rights workers.
 The 62-member OAU military observer mission was withdrawn by the OAU after
 the July 25 coup.
 Local military authorities frequently refused access to areas of the interior to jour-
 nalists, human rights workers, and international relief officials. Militant extremists,
 both Hutu and Tutsi, threatened the lives of people investigating human rights vio-
 lations.
 The U.N. International Commission of Inquiry worked in the country between Oc-
 tober 1995 and May 1996, investigating the events surrounding the killing of Presi-
 dent Melchior Ndadaye in October 1993 and the massacres that followed. The Com-
 mission produced a report that circulated in ]Bujumbura but was not officially re-
 leased. The Government has asked for the establishment of an international tribu-
 nal to try those implicated in the events of 1993.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The September 13 decree explicitly provides equal status and protection for all
 citizens, without distinction based on sex, origin, ethnicity, religion, or opjnion.
 However, the Government failed to enforce effectively all these provisions. Hutus
 continue to perceive, correctly, that there is discrimination against them by the
 Tutsi-dominated Government.
 Women.-Violence against women occurred, but there was no documentation of its
 extent. Wives have the right to bring physical abuse charges against their hus-
 bands; in practice, they rarely do so. Police do not normally intervene in domestic
 disputes, and the media do not report incidents of violence against women, including
 rape. There were no known court cases dealing with the abuse of women.
 Women hold a secondary place in society and face both legal and societal discrimi-
 nation. There continue to be explicitly discriminatory inheritance laws and discrimi-
 natory financial credit practices. Although women by law must receive the same pay
 as men for the same jobs, women are far less likely to hold any mid- or high-level
 positions. In rural areas, women traditionally perform hard farm work and have less
 opportunity for education than men.
 Children.-The Government has taken no action to protect children's rights, nor
 has it addressed the growing problem of the increasing population of orphans that
 resulted from the continued violence since 1993. Children have not been spared by
 belligerents in the civil conflict; many of the victims of massacres have been chil-
 dren.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has not enacted legislation or other-
 wise mandated access to buildings or government services for people with disabil-
 ities. The rudimentary economy effectively excludes the physically disabled from
 many types of employment.
 Indigenous People.-The Twa (Pygmy) minority remained almost completely
 marginalized--economically, socially, and politically. Most Twa continued to live in
 isolation, uneducated, and without access to government services, including health
 care. The Twa remain essentially outside of the political process.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Burundi's fundamental problem continued
 to be ethnic conflict between the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsis. Tutsis
 have historically held power and still control the military and dominate educated
 society. The July 25 coup that deposed Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya
 replaced him with a Tutsi, Major Buyoya. Ethnic discrimination against Hutus, 85
 percent of the population, affects every facet of society and institutions, including
 the military services and the judiciary.
 
 
 There are few Hutus in attendance at the University of Burundi. A government
 effort in March to recruit Hutus into the army produced no positive results. The
 army remains overwhelmingly Tutsi.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Code nominally protects the rights of
 workers to form unions, although the army, gendarmerie, and expatriates working
 in the public sector are prohibited from union participation. Most union workers are
 urban civil servants.
 The country's first national umbrella trade union, the Organization of Free
 Unions of Burundi (CSB), remains financially dependent on a system of checkoffs,
 as do local unions. The CSB represented labor in collective bargaining negotiations
 in cooperation with individual labor unions. Unions are Tutsi-dominated, reflecting
 Tutsi control of the formal sector of the economy. The unions have also been strong

 The Labor Code permits the formation of additional unions or confederations out-
 side the CSB. When settling disputes in which more than one labor union is rep-
 resented, the law stipulates that the Minister of Labor will chose the union rep-
 resenting the greatest number of workers to participate in the negotiations.
 The Labor Code provides workers with a restricted right to strike. There are sev-
 eral restrictions on the right to strike and to lock out employees: The action must
 be taken only after exhausting all other peaceful means of resolution; negotiations
 must continue during the action, mediated by a mutually agreeable party or by the
 Government; and, 6 days' notice must be given. The law prohibits retribution
 against workers participating in a legal strike, and this provision is upheld in prac-
 tice.
 In January activity in Bujumbura came largely to a standstill during a week-long
 general strike organized by extremist Tutsis.
 Unions are able to affiliate with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code recognizes
 the right to collective bargaining, which had formerly been acknowledged only by
 ordinance. Since most workers in the formal sector are civil servants, government
 entities are involved in almost every phase of labor negotiations.
 Public sector wages are set in fixed scales in individual contracts and are not af-
 fected by collectivebargaining. In the private sector, wage scales also exist, but indi-
 vidual contract negotiation is possible.
 The Labor Code gives the Labor Court jurisdiction over all labor dispute cases,
 including those involving public employees. Labor negotiations are still conducted
 largely under the supervision of the tripartite National Labor Council, the Govern-
 ment's highest consultative authority on labor issues. The Council represents gov-
 ernment, labor, and management and is presided over and regulated by the Min-
 ister of Labor.
 The Labor Code prohibits employers from firing or otherwise discriminating
 against a worker because of union affiliation or activity. This right is upheld in
 practice.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code states that chil-
 dren under the age of 16 are not allowed to be employed by "an enterprise even
 as apprentices, although it also states that they may undertake occasional work that
 does not damage their health or interfere with their schooling. In practice, in rural
 areas children under the age of 16 do heavy manual labor such as transporting
 bricks in daytime during the school year.
 Children are legally prohibited from working at night, although many do so in the
 informal sector. Children are obliged by custom and economic necessity to help sup-
 port their families by participating in activities related to subsistence agriculture,
 in family-based enterprises, and in the informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The formal minimum wage for unskilled work-
 ers is $0.46 (145 Burndi francs) per day in Bujumbura and Gitega and $0.38 (120
 Burndi franca) per day in the rest of the country, with a graduated scale for great-
 er skill levels. This amount does not allow a worker and family to maintain a decent
 standard of living, and most families rely on second incomes and subsistence agri-
 culture to supplement their earnings. Employees working under a contract, particu-
 larly in urban areas, generally earn significantly more than the minimum wage. All
 employees in the public sector work under contract. The CSB estimates that 70 per-
 cent of employees working in the formal private sector are covered by a contract.

 The Labor Code imposes a maximum 8-hour workday and a 45-hour workweek,
 except in cases where workers are involved in activities related to national security.
 Supplements must be paid for overtime work. The Labor Code establishes health
 and safety standards requiring an employer to provide a safe workplace and assigns
 enforcement responsibility to the Minister of Labor. However, the Ministry does not
 enforce the code effectively. Health and safety articles in the Labor Code do not di-
 rectly address workers' rights to remove themselves from a dangerous work situa-
 tion without fear of losing their jobs.
