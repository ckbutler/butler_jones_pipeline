 MAURITANIA
 Since taking power in 1978, Mauritania's ruling military
 Committee for National Salvation (CMSN) has faced severe
 problems stemming from political instability and an economy
 weakened by drought and war in the Western Sahara and from
 internal social conflicts. The 1979 peace treaty with the
 Polisario Front (Popular Front for the Liberation of Sakiet
 Al-Hamra and Rio de Oro) removed Mauritania from direct
 participation in the Western Sahara conflict, but solved
 neither the problem of the debts incurred fighting the war
 nor the delicate issue of remaining neutral in a conflict
 involving all the other countries in the sub-region. Erratic
 iron ore prices, consistently rising energy and food import
 prices,.and several large, uneconomic industrialization
 projects inherited from the former regime, all complicate
 Mauritania's poor economic situation. Socially, in its
 attempts to end discrimination and integrate the varied
 ethnic groups in the country, the government is faced with
 such delicate and contentious issues as the abolition of
 slavery, Arabization of the school system and institution of
 the Sharia code of Islamic law, all of which strain the
 capabilities and resources of a government still attempting
 to assert its authority within the country.
 The country also has been plagued by internal political
 difficulties. Mauritania's dominant Moors and ethnic black
 population have clashed over the issue of Arabization of
 the schools. Renewed efforts to abolish slavery and intro-
 duce the Sharia Islamic law in criminal cases have been
 similarly contentious; both constitute ambitious efforts to
 reshape the bases of Mauritanian society. By attempting to
 end vestiges of slavery, the government hopes to reduce
 ethnic tensions between the blacks and Moors. By intro-
 ducing a strict and simple criminal code last year, relying
 on corporal punishment to deter crime, the government hoped to
 reinforce the government's identification with Islam and
 reduce common crimes substantially.
 In the face of these critical problems, the CMSN has imposed
 firm controls over the country and restricted political
 activity. It has strictly enforced a ban on all assemblies
 organized for the purpose of political discussion, whether in
 public or in private dwellings. Opposition groups are not
 permitted and the media are strictly controlled. But the
 government has generally adhered to sections of Mauritanian
 law that guarantee the integrity of the person. There is no
 evidence of mass arrests or brutality. Trials generally are
 open to the public, and the administration of justice is
 strict but fair. A return to civilian rule has been openly
 discussed by the government ever since taking power, and
 remains its stated goal.
 A coup attempt against the CMSN on March 16, 1981 led the CMSN
 to take strong steps to reassert its control. Although the
 coup was put down, the CMSN reacted by executing or imprisoning
 the participants after a trial and by breaking diplomatic
 relations with Morocco, which it accused of harboring and
 supporting the coup plotters. The civilian government of
 Prime Minister Bneijara was dissolved in April and a military
 government established in its place. A slowly advancing
 program of democratization was put off indefinitely. At
 
 (164)

 the same time, however, Mauritania's respect for the integrity
 of the person has remained unchanged by the coup, and the
 basic human rights climate is the same as it was prior to
 March 16.
 Government attempts to fill the basic vital needs of the
 'people and reduce social and economic inequities are hindered
 as much by Mauritania's extremely low population density as
 by the severe economic constraints the Tovernment faces.
 The broad dispersion of the population makes implementation
 of ambitious health and education programs extremely difficult.
 Enforcement of the 1980 declaration abolishing slavery is
 complicated by opposition from traditional elements, and the
 issue of compensation. This issue involves the central
 problem for the government of integrating the diverse ethnic
 groups in the country and of averting ethnic conflict.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Mauritanian law prohibits the use of torture and there is
 no clear evidence that it was practiced in 1981, although
 Amnesty International has reported instances of torture in
 past years.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There is no record of either summary executions or of degrad-
 ing treatment of prisoners. Four participants in the March 16
 coup attempt were executed 10 days after the coup took place;
 their executions were preceded by a public trial and a review
 of the sentences by President Haidalla. Since the institution
 in 1980 of the Sharia Islamic code for certain criminal
 offenses, there have been two public executions for murder and
 on one occasion three men had their right hands cut off for
 personal theft. The cutting off of hands occurred shortly
 after the Sharia code was introduced and has not been repeated
 since. Public flogging of convicted thieves has taken place
 on several occasions.
 The July 1980 declaration that slavery was abolished in Mauri-
 tania drew international attention to this complex social and
 economic phenomenon. The institution persists largely in
 southern Mauritania, where it orginated in conflicts between
 nomadic Moors and the settled blacks. The Moors gradually
 exerted their domination over some black groups, most of whom
 originally inhabited the Senegal River basin, reducing them to
 various forms of servitude. French colonial administrators
 outlawed slavery in the early part of this century. It also
 was prescribed in the constitution promulgated at independence
 in 1960. The July 1980 declaration of the abolition of
 slavery is thus the second time that the Mauritania government
 has declared the institution of slavery to be.illegal. Slavery
 in Mauritania is, characterized and regulated by complex social
 obligations between master and slave. Masters, for instance,
 ,provide food and clothing and sometimes guarantee employment.
 On the other hand, many freed slaves must still give part of
 their harvest or wages to their former masters. Some slaves
 are regarded as an integral part of their owner's family;
 
 
 166
 others are consciously kept apart and treated as servants.
 There is no open market for slaves, although private trans-
 actions still occur. Value is determined not only by owners'
 needs but also by local norms and traditions. In fact many
 'sales' are really instances of *social" emancipation whereby
 one party, sometimes the slave himself, pays the master so
 that the slave will be declared free, since de facto freedom
 generally does not remove the social stigma.
 The institution of slavery is a deeply ingrained practice
 in Mauritania, and its abolition raises a variety of delicate
 ethnic and economic issues. Social stratification is very
 rigid in Mauritania, and freed slaves remain a lower class
 long after freedom has been achieved. Economically, the
 government has yet to resolve the issues of compensation to
 slave owners and the need for land reform. In addition, many
 Moors fear that its extirpation will not only cause economic
 hardship but will serve as a catalyst for the overthrow of
 other traditional institutions.
 Since the 1980 declaration, the government has moved slowly
 and carefully on this issue. It has formed a national
 committee of government officials, religious leaders and
 economists to determine the nature of compensation to be
 made. The committee has yet to report its recommendations.
 The government has protested allegations that it is not
 following up on the declaration, noting that such a deeply
 ingrained practice cannot be ended overnight and that it
 will be some years before slavery can be eradicated. Some
 observers estimate that as many as 200,000 Mauritanian
 slaves and their masters could be affected by the formal
 end of slavery.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no evidence that official security forces have
 authorized or participated in abductions, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detentions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 A law passed under the former civilian government permits
 authorities to detain anyone whom they judge to be a threat
 to national security. This power of preventive detention
 is an administrative measure which exists outside the defined
 system of law. Detention has no time limit and there is no
 right of habeas corpus. Detainees are usually confined to
 their residence. Mauritania's ruling military leaders con-
 tinue to make use of this power. Approximately 20 former
 civilian and military officials are held under what is, in
 essence, a form of strict surveillance. Other officials have
 been banished to a remote part of the country under orders to
 refrain from political activity. Former President Moktar Ould
 Daddah and former Foreign Minister Hamdi Ould Mouknass, while
 under surveillance, were allowed in 1979 to travel to France
 for medical reasons. Both reportedly remain in France.
 Following the March 16 coup attempt, approximately 20 people
 suspected of some form of involvement were detained by the
 government. They were held without charge, and none were ever
 brought to trial. All were released by late August.
 
 
 167
 Since the 1979 peace treaty, the Polisario has continued to
 hold a large number of Mauritanian prisoners of war. They
 are reported to number approximately 1,000. Reports that
 black prisoners have been mistreated or massacred remain
 unsubstantiated. In early September, the Polisario released
 85 prisoners, all of whom were reported to require medical
 treatment. It is unclear how many, if any, Mauritanians
 remain prisoners of the Polieario, but the number is apparently
 small.
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Although the goverment is generally committed to providing
 prompt judicial proceedings, an inadequate and underfinanced
 judicial system means that suspects sometimes are held for
 long periods before trial. Amnesty International's 1981
 report cites instances of trials held in the absence of the
 accused, in camera, and without representation. In March
 1981, a special military court delivered three death sentences
 in absentia to individuals allegedly involved in the March
 coup attempt.
 The government instituted the Sharia Islamic code in July
 1980. Sharia law as adopted in Mauritania covers three
 types of crime:  adultery, personal theft and murder. A
 Muslim judge presides over a jury chosen by the governor of
 the region with jurisdiction over the case. The defendant
 has a right to counsel and can appeal a guilty verdict to
 the supreme Islamic court within 15 days. Circumstantial
 evidence cannot be admitted as proof of guilt. All sentences
 must be approved by the president. Mauritanian authorities
 have claimed that Sharia law has caused a dramatic decrease
 in crime levels, but there is no independent confirmation of
 this contention
 f. Invasion of the Some
 The law prohibits such intrusions and there is no evidence
 that violations have occurred.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includings
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press and assembly is restricted. Mauri-
 tania's only newspaper, news agency and radio station are
 government-operated. The editorial content of each is con-
 trolled and criticism of goverment policies is generally not
 permitted. Foreign newspapers and magazines are sold in the
 major towns and rarely are censored.
 Freedom of assembly has been suspended since the military
 assumed control of the country in July 1978. Following
 the reorganization of the military committee in April 1979,
 the government warned that political assembly, whether
 in public or in individual dwellings, would not be toler-
 ated. At that time, and again after the March 1981 coup
 attempt, curfews were imposed to discourage public gatherings.
 Both curfews were lifted within a few months of being imposed.
 Labor unions are the sole political organizations not dis-
 solved after the 1978 military coup. Union activity is
 
 89-510 .0 - 82 - 12
 
 
 168
 supervised by the Union of Mauritanian Workers (UTM), a
 governmental organization attached to the Ministry of Health,
 Work and Social Affairs. A union is recognized only when it
 registers with the UTM and accepts a UTH appointed director
 general. The director general serves as an advisor to the
 secretary general, appointed from within the union membership,
 who controls the day-to-day operation of the union. The union
 members pay nominal dues to the union, but the UTM finances
 most union activities and decides the time and place of all
 union meetings. As under the Ould Daddah regime, the unions
 continue to work closely with the various ministries.
 Islam is the official religion of Mauritania. Virtually all
 citizens are Muslims, and the country's official name is
 the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. However, there are no
 restrictions on other religious expression and practice.
 Several Catholic churches operate freely.
 In December 1980 the civilian government released a draft
 constitution which provided for broad reforms in the area of
 civil liberties. Freedom of speech and assembly were to be
 assured, as were the rights to join the labor union of one's
 choice and to strike. (No mention was made of freedom of
 the press.) Discussion of the draft constitution was encour-
 aged in early 1981, but in the aftermath of the March 16
 coup attempt and the April reorganization of the government,
 its adoption was put off indefinitely.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Free movement is allowed within Mauritania. Foreign travel
 requires an exit visa from the national police office, which
 in practice, requires only that the traveler state his reasons
 for travel and destination. Some members of the former
 government have been refused permission to leave the country
 and, in some cases, have had their passports confiscated.
 No refugee groups have been resettled or granted a safe
 haven in Mauritania. Allegations that the Polisario have used
 Mauritania as a base for attacks on the Western Sahara
 have been denied by the Mauritanian government and are
 unsubstantiated. A small group of Mauritanians have left
 the country because of political opposition to the present
 regime.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Freedom to participate in the political process has been
 abridged since 1978 when the military abolished Mauritania's
 only political party. At the present time, there are no
 elected representatives. Opposition groups are not permitted.
 A government-sponsored national voluntary movement launched
 in the spring of 1980 to encourage Mauritanians to fight
 economic misery has generated minimal response from the
 people.
 Claiming that blacks constitute a majority of the population,
 many blacks charge that the Moors are substantially over-
 represented in government and religious institutions. They
 
 
 169
 point to the fact that only one of every three members
 of the Council of Ministers and the CMSN is black. The
 government insists that a substantial majority of Maurita-
 nians are Moors. Few reliable statistics exist to buttress
 the arguments of either gr9up.
 Traditional cultural and social values limit the role of
 Mauritanian women in government and, to a lesser extent,
 business. Some vomen have risen to prominent positions in
 the fields of health and education, and many women are
 employed as teachers and middle or low-level government
 bureaucrats. Statistics indicate that only half as many
 women as men are taking advantage of available educational
 opportunities although it spears to be due to cultural
 constraints rather than physical ones. The ministry of
 social affairs has for a long time had a divison for the
 ocio-educational advancement of women, which maintains
 offices in several areas of the country..
 The civilian government of Prime Minister Oneijara began in
 late 1980 to take initial steps toward a return to democracy.
 The December 1980 draft constitution called for a multiparty
 parliamentary system based on universal suffrage. Progress
 toward democratization was suspended following the March 16
 coup attempt, but it remains the stated goal of the CMBN.
 Recent speeches indicate that its application will 'take far
 longer than originally expected.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International requested information from the govern-
 ment concerning the detention of former members of the Ould
 Daddah government. Although the Mauritanians never formally
 responded to the inquiries, the officials in question were
 apparently released from detention in July 1981. It is
 possible that several of them remain under some loose form
 of house arrest.
 In August 1981, the United Nations Human Rights Subcommis-
 sion's working Group on Slavery heard a report from the
 United Kingdom based Anti-Slavery Society on slavery in
 Mauritania. The report accused the Mauritanian government
 of taking no action to abolish slavery beyond the 1980
 declaration making it illegal. The Mauritanian observer at
 the session criticized the report, saying that the informa-
 tion had been badly analyzed, and invited the subcommission
 to send an expert of its own to investigate the situation
 first hand. The subcommission in September recommended to
 the Human Rights Commission that the invitation be accepted.
 The Mauritanian Embassy in Paris issued a protest against
 the report, noting that social ties formed over centuries by
 a practice like slavery cannot be effaced all at once and
 expressing its "amazement' that the Anti-Slavery Society had
 not offered Mauritania any assistance in working toward the
 suppression of slavery in the country.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The ability of the Mauritanian government to provide for
 the basic human needs of the people is seriously constrained
 
 
 170
 oy the poor state of the Mauritanian economy. The war in
 the Western Sahara, the severe drought in the Sahel and
 many unproductive capital-intensive investments combined to
 nearly cripple the Mauritanian economy in the late 1970s.
 Additional major economic burdens include rising food and
 energy import costs and stagnant iron ore revenues. A
 major economic crisis has been averted only through a
 continuing austerity program based on a rehabilitation plan
 instituted by the government on the recommendation of the
 World Bank. It combines reductions in government spending
 with large inputs of foreign financial assistance.
 The unemployment situation in Mauritania is already serious
 and threatens to become critical in the near future. The
 Sahelian drought has had disastrous effects on the principal
 occupations of herding and farming, forcing many herdsmen
 and farmers to flee to the cities and contributing to what-
 is generally recognized as the highest urbanization rate in
 the world. Once in the cities, these people face severely
 restricted employment opportunities. Sluggish growth in the
 overall economy has generated far fewer additional employment
 opportunities than there are people to fill them.
 Mauritania's attempts to improve health and nutrition levels
 within the country have been slowed by economic constraints.
 In addition, a high population growth rate of 2.5 percent
 and a high total fertility rate of 6.9 indicate that the
 strains on limited resources will expand rather than contract
 during the 1980s. Low life expectancy (40 years in 1978)
 and high infant mortality (169 per 1,000 live births) rates
 are slowly being improved. The government's main focus in
 the health field has been on regional primary health care
 programs, which train village health care workers and a
 national vaccination program. It is estimated that by the
 end of 1982, approximately 80 percent of the children age
 zero to five years will be covered by the vaccination
 program. Several well projects planned or underway should
 raise the percentage of the rural population with access to
 safe water from the extremely low current rate of 10 percent.
 Finally, the government has undertaken a broad program of
 health and nutrition counselling as well, in the belief that
 access to health facilities is not enough and that the best
 way to improve health and nutrition levels is through
 education of the people. The effect of these programs is as
 yet unknown, and will probably become evident only over
 time.
 Improvements in education face much the same constraints as
 health and nutrition. The adult literacy rate of 17 percent
 is rising only slowly, but the faster rise in primary school
 enrollment, currently 34 percent of the children of primary
 school age, indicates that the government is making at least
 quantitative advances in this sector, although there are
 indications that the quality of education is going down.
 The government's efforts to improve secondary education have
 been complicated by the very sharp divisions between the
 Moors, who insist on being taught in Arabic, and the blacks,
 who traditionally prefer to be educated in French and local
 languages. Prior to the last school year, the government
 reached a compromise on the issue of Arabization of the
 school system, whereby although some Arabic is mandatory for
 all students, students are free to choose French or Arabic
 as the primary language of their schooling. Two years of
 primary school conducted entirely in Arabic remain mandatory
 for all students.
