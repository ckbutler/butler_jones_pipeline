 YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
 The Yemen Arab Republic is extremely poor. It has no
 oil wealth and few other natural resources. Yemen
 was isolated from the outside world by the theocratic
 government of the Imam until the Republican Revolution
 of 1962. After 1962 the Government's effectiveness
 was limited by a long civil war.
 Two Yemeni Presidents have been assassinated for
 political reasons during the past sixteen months. The
 current president, Lieutenant Colonel Salih, has
 pledged himself to continue the development-oriented
 policies of his predecessors. In October 1978, yet
 another coup was attempted by disaffected military
 units. The coup failed, and several prominent
 military and civilian leaders, including the former
 Minister of Social Affairs and Youth, have been tried
 for treason and executed.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law and seldom, if ever,
 occurs. Instances of torture which may have occurred
 were not condoned by the Government, but resulted from
 poorly developed governmental institutions and primi-
 tive social and prison conditions in remote parts of
 the country where the Government has been unable to
 exercise complete control over local law enforcement
 and prison officials.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Islamic law, which is observed in Yemen, sanctions the
 severing of the hand of convicted thieves, but such
 penalties have not been imposed recently. Although
 prisoners live under difficult conditions,: they are
 
 (654)
 
 
 not wantonly mistreated. Prisoners incarcerated in
 remote areas, in which the authority of the state is
 not yet fully established, are still sometimes sub-
 jected to cruel or degrading treatment, often a result
 of primitive prison conditions.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Yemen Constitution and central government
 directives provide that an accused must be brought
 before a court within one week of arrest and tried
 within three months.- Detainees are permitted access
 to family and lawyers. There are credible reports
 that arbitrary arrests and detention, for one- or
 two-day periods, take place, often in connection with
 civil disputes. There also have been isolated
 instances in which local authorities have, on their
 own initiative, arrested and detained individuals for
 lengthy periodpof time without adequate grounds or on
 the basis of hearsay or circumstantial evidence.
 Political uncertainty resulting from political
 assassinations and subversion attributed to South
 Yemen aggravate this situation.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Yemenis can obtain fair public trials under the
 procedures prescribed by Islamic law. Law courts
 in Yemen have a tradition of fairness and impar-
 tiality. The impartial judge plays an activist role
 in questioning the witnesses, seeking to establish
 .the guilt or innocence of the accused.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Search warrants are not required, but traditional
 respect for the integrity of the home minimizes govern-
 mental invasions, which occur infrequently under normal
 conditions. However, during periods of national
 emergency, such as following the October 1978 coup
 attempt, searches are conducted without warrants.
 
 
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Yemen Government policies have tended to be supportive
 of Yemenis' basic needs for food, shelter, health care
 and education. The needs of individuals have been met
 largely by private remittances from Yemenis working
 abroad (an estimated $1.5 billion in 1978). Relying
 largely on foreign aid, the Government has embarked
 upon an ambitious $3.6 billion five-year development
 plan which seeks to alleviate the problems of the
 nation's poor through a variety of infrastructure,
 capital development, training and education and basic
 human needs programs. Development spending accounted
 for 42 percent of the 1977-78 budget. The Government
 is aware of the problem of corruption in public life
 and has established high-level committees to investi-
 gate allegations of corruption.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 While Yemenis are free to express their political
 views, the Government does not tolerate those mass
 political rallies which, in its view,-are potential
 threats to the state's internal security. The Govern-
 ment s6metimes organizes rallies to support its own
 policies.
 Explicit and officially condoned religious intolerance
 is rare. The small Jewish community, after a mass
 emigration to Israel after that State was established,
 resides in remote sectiornof the country and is
 accepted by the society. Its members are under no
 restrictions as to movement or emigration. Foreign
 Christians are also allowed to worship freely, and
 Christian missionaries are permitted to operate
 hospitals and clinics. Religious proselytizing is
 
 
 forbidden by law.
 The Labor Law of Yemen is a detailed document which
 has been well-implemented and which protects labor
 from illegal arbitrary actions on the part of
 management. Under the law, labor unions and strikes
 are illegal.
 Women in Yemen continue to lead a traditionally re-
 stricted existence.' The beginnings of change in their
 overall status are beginning to appear. Women attend
 Sana University with male students and are increas-
 ingly employed in government offices. The Yemen
 Government is publicly committed to improving the'
 status of women.
 The Yemen media are in a rudimentary stage of develop-
 ment. They are predominantly government-owned and
 are used to communicate government policies and
 positions.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Yemenis are free to travel within and outside the
 country and to emigrate freely. Emigration, now as
 traditionally, has proceeded at very high levels.
 Remittances from Yemenis working abroad are an impor-
 tant source of government income.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The opportunities for participation in the political
 process take a traditional form, through the inter-
 cession of tribal or other respected leaders, but are
 widely available to the population and actively
 exploited.
 After a hiatus of three years, the Consultative
 Assembly was reconstituted by appointment in 1978. It
 has elected the last two presidents and has taken up
 anew its constitutional powers over the budget, con-
 stitutional change, codification of Islamic law and
 
 
 658
 provisions for new elections.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 To the knowledge of the Department of State, there
 have been no requests by international or non-
 governmental organizations to investigate human
 rights concerns in Yemen.
