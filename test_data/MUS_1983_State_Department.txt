 MAURITIUS
 Mauritius is a small island state which has had a multiparty
 system of government since independence in 1968. The parlia-
 mentary political system is modeled on that of Great Britain; and
 the Governor General, appointed on the advice of the Prime
 Minister, represents the Queen of England who is also the head of
 state as Queen of Mauritius. Mauritian citizens participate
 freely in the electoral process, having done so most recently
 (during the past 16 months) in two parliamentary general elec-
 tions, municipal elections, and village council elections. There
 are four major political parties, three of which successfully
 contested the August 1983 general elections as an alliance, and a
 host of minor political parties.
 The economy is essentially a mixed one, with the private sector
 and state-owned organizations existing side by side. Although
 the Mauritian standard of living is equal to or slightly higher
 than that of the average middle income developing nation, it has
 faced serious economic problems which date from the short-lived
 sugar boom of the mid-1970's. During recent years, the Mauri-
 tian Government has negotiated a series of stabilization programs
 and structural adjustment loans with the International Monetary
 Fund and the World Bank.
 As demonstrated during the electoral campaign leading up to the
 August 21 general elections, political and civil rights are
 effectively exercised. An independent and impartial electoral
 supervisory commission oversaw the elections which were free of
 violence and untainted by any noteworthy charges of fraud. In
 the context of these elections, almost daily political rallies
 were held by the various contending parties. Free air time was
 provided on Mauritian television to all major political parties,
 including the opposition, for their political broadcasts.
 Mauritius has six daily newspapers and eight weeklies which also
 took an active role in support of different parties.
 Mauritius has an independent judiciary which administers a legal
 system based generally on that of the United Kingdom. Health and
 social services are basically free and available to most Mauri-
 tians. Notwithstanding a shortage of certain medicines in
 hospitals, the Mauritian Government has been trying to upgrade
 medical care and has announced its intention to create new health
 care centers. The 1983-84 Mauritian budget has earmarked approxi-
 mately $3 million for an unemployment hardship relief fund to
 which the private sector will also be asked to contribute.
 Education is free up through the secondary level. Standards are
 generally good, although there is a shortage of textbooks and
 scientific laboratory equipment. Labor unions, of which there are
 more than 300 registered, are very active. They are free to
 organize, bargain collectively, strike, and to affiliate with
 international labor organizations. No serious labor strikes or
 violent demonstrations have occurred in this decade.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Since independence in 1968, there have not been any substantiated
 reports of violations concerning unlawful or arbitrary depriva-
 tion of life. There has not been any insurgent activity during
 
 
 245
 this period, nor have there been any terrorist killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There have not been any reports on the disappearance of persons
 in Mauritius for political causes.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Any use of torture or inhuman punishment is prohibited by law.
 There are no reports of degrading treatment or punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrests and/or detention have not occurred since the
 early 1970's when the Government jailed opposition political
 and trade union leaders whom it accused of creating chaos and
 anarchy. Habeas corpus does exist in practice, and a person
 can be held only up to 48 hours without being charged. Bail is
 common. Exile has never been used in Mauritius as a means of
 punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mauritius' judicial system, modeled on that of Great Britain,
 consists of a Supreme Court with appellate powers and a series
 of lower courts. Final appeal to the Queen's Privy Council in
 the United Kingdom is provided for. There are no political or
 military courts. The courts' record of assuring fair, public
 trials to all offenders has been very good. Defendants have the
 right to private or court-appointed legal counsel. There have
 not been allegations by political parties (including the opposi-
 tion) or the media that the judicial system is anything but
 independent. During the recent political campaign, all of the
 political platforms commented on the necessity for maintaining
 an independent judiciary. In the past, the judiciary has made
 several politically unpopular decisions, such as finding a
 prominent minister guilty of corruption.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. The search of personal property or premises is allowed
 only under certain clearly specified conditions by order of the
 court, or by police decision if any illegal act has been committed.
 There is no arbitrary intrusion of the state or of political
 organizations into the private lives of individuals. There have
 been unsubstantiated allegations that the Government occasionally
 opens mail and carries out wiretaps on opposition leaders.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is protected both in the Constitution
 and in practice. Some 15 privately owned daily and weekly news-
 papers, representing all hues of the political spectrum, freely
 propogate their partisan and often highly critical views. These
 newspapers operate subject only to the legal constraints of libel
 and slander. The 1982 and 1983 parliamentary campaigns provided
 
 
 246
 numerous examples attesting to the respect of freedom of speech
 and press in Mauritius.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no government or policy prescriptions against the right
 of individuals formally or informally to form associations. This
 applies to political, trade, union, religious associations, etc.
 Although the Public Order Act requires police permission for
 demonstrations and mass meetings, such permission is rarely
 refused. Typical of the freedom to associate is the fact that all
 political parties were allowed to hold almost daily rallies during
 the various national and local level electoral campaigns during,
 the past 16 months. For example, on August 14, 1983, one week
 before this year's parliamentary general elections, both major
 contending factions held mass rallies in Port Louis which together
 drew at least 15 percent of Mauritius' population of just under
 one million persons. These rallies occurred less than two miles
 apart, and there were no reported incidents of violence of any
 type. Labor unions in Mauritius are free to organize, bargain
 collectively, strike, and affiliate with the international bodies
 of their choice. In December 1980, there were 304 registered
 unions in Mauritius with a total of 78,417 members (1983 figures
 are probably slightly higher). While labor strife characterized
 Mauritius up to the late 1970's, this has not recurred in the last
 three years. This decade, notwithstanding two vigorously con-
 tested general elections, has been one of relative labor calm.
 The Industrial Relations Act is scheduled for amendment to make
 labor relations even more democratic. Pursuant to a request by
 the International Monetary Fund, the Mauritian Government has
 agreed that salary negotiations will henceforth be done on a
 sectoral rather than on a national basis, as in the past.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no official state religion in Mauritius. Christians,
 Hindus, Tamils, Muslims, Buddhists, as well as a number of other
 religions and sects, openly practice and teach their own religion
 without prejudice. All religious institutions receive state
 subsidies in proportion to their number of adherents--a subsidy
 which is scheduled to be increased according to the national
 budget proposed for 1983-84. There is no state-sanctioned
 discrimination against any of Mauritius' ethnic and religious
 communities. Political candidates are often chosen on the basis
 of their ethnic/religious affinity and the composition of the
 particular electoral constituency. There have also been allega-
 tions that certain communities, particularly the Muslim, are
 underrepresented in the civil service, particularly at higher
 levels. This does not, however, apply to the Legislative Assembly
 itself, as the Constitution guarantees through a "best loser"
 system that all communities shall be fairly represented in Parlia-
 ment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are-no restrictions on movement within the country, foreign
 travel, emigration, and repatriation. Fewer than 10 people have
 applied for refugee status in Mauritius during the past three
 years. There is no forcible repatriation.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Mauritius is a participatory democracy with a parliamentary system
 patterned after that of Great Britain. The country is governed by
 a freely elected, unicameral Legislative Assembly, with executive
 direction coming from a Council of Ministers headed by the Prime
 Minister. Although there have been proposals to make Mauritius a
 republic, a Governor General, appointed on the advice of the Prime
 Minister, still represents the Queen of England who is also Queen
 of Mauritius. The Governor General's role is largely ceremonial,
 with real executive power resting with the Prime Minister.
 The Governor General could play a significant role, however,
 should elections be very close, as he is the individual who would
 designate the person he believes could best form a new government.
 Voting and standing for office are open to all citizens 18 years
 of age and over. Two major elections took place in June 1982 and
 August 1983. During these elections opposition groups were active
 and campaigned openly. The parliamentary opposition is headed by
 an officially and constitutionally recognized leader elected by
 the members of the Legislative Assembly. During and after the
 June 1982 and August 1983 elections, the international media
 commented favorably that power changed hands as the result of
 elections.
 Women in Mauritius are free to participate in all types of polit-
 ical, business, and social activities, and a few hold high posi-
 tions. Nonetheless, the fact remains that conservative religious
 and ethnic attitudes do inhibit women.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known reports of requests by outside or domestic
 organizations to investigate the human rights situation in Mauri-
 tius. Amnesty International maintains two branches in Mauritius.
 In addition, there is a local Roman Catholic human rights organi-
 zation, the "Justice and Peace Commission." Neither of these
 organizations has expressed concern with the Government of Mauri-
 tius about its human rights situation. Freedom House rates
 Mauritius "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Mauritius is a small and very densely populated, island nation
 with a mixed economy which continues to be dominated by the sugar
 industry, despite Government attempts to diversify and expand it.
 While Mauritius has made progress in the last few years in read-
 justing its economy, it still faces serious balance-of-payments
 problems and a significant debt burden. Unemployment is now close
 to 25 percent. The continuing worldwide recessionary condi-
 tions which affect foreign investment and exports from the export
 processing zone and tourism combined with the low price of sugar
 render economic recovery more difficult. Nothwithstanding the
 fact that Mauritius continues to pursue a program of structural
 readjustment, with particular emphasis on export-led industriali-
 zation and promotion of investment, tourism, and exports, develop-
 ment prospects remain bleak in the near term.
 Despite devaluations in 1979 and 1981, per capita gross national
 product reached $1,157 in 1981. Mauritius' population (1,0,02,000
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 17
 
 
 248
 including Rodrigues and the other outer islands) has a standard of
 living (according to the World Bank) typical of a middle income
 developing country. The basic human needs of Mauritius' popula-
 tion are covered through extensive Government programs. Life
 expectancy at birth in 1980 was just over 65 years; the adult
 literacy rate in 1980 was just under 85 percent.
 Generally free medical care is available to all Mauritians in an
 expanding network of government-owned and -operated hospitals and
 dispensaries. The Government has successfully pursued a pragmatic
 population control policy. The population growth rate has varied
 recently between 1.3 percent (1979), 2.0 percent (1980), 1.8
 percent (1981), and 1.6 percent (1982). The standard of nutrition
 is relatively good (the available calorie supply exceeds nutri-
 tional requirements--116.62 percent in 1977). Officially,
 infant mortality in 1983 stands at 33.5 per 1,000, although the
 Mauritius Family Planning Association puts the current rate at 29
 per 1,000. Recent economic indicators show that neither the
 urban nor the rural population has any significant proportion
 living below the absolute poverty level. Nevertheless, the level
 of nutrition is generally much lower among the rural poor than
 among the city dwellers and the more affluent sectors of Mauritian
 society. Access to safe water continues to be a problem, particu-
 larly in the rural areas. 1975 statistics indicate that 60
 percent of the total population had access to safe water (100
 percent in the urban areas and 22 percent in the rural areas).
 while improvement has occurred since 1975, there still remain
 significant areas without easy access to potable water.
 Education in Mauritius up to the preuniversity level has been
 free and available to all sectors of the population since 1977.
 In 1979, primary school enrollment was 99 percent for both males
 and females. Adult literacy in 1980 was just under 85 percent.
 University education was also free until 1980 when tuition fees
 were reimposed as a result of increased budget deficits primarily
 due to the deteriorating economic situation in Mauritius.
 The Mauritian Government seeks to insure that there is no dis-
 crimination against women. In October 1980, the Legislative
 Assembly passed a bill abolishing most if not all Napoleonic Code
 provisions discriminating against women. In June 1982, a woman
 was named concurrently as Minister of Justice and Minister of
 Women's Affairs; and following the August 1983 elections, a woman
 was appointed as Minister for Women's Rights and Family Affairs.
 March 1983 amendments to the Emigration Act and the Deportation
 Act gave the right to any spouse of a Mauritian citizen to acquire
 the status of resident of Mauritius and also offered protection
 against deportation. Prior to the enactment of these amendments,
 only the spouse of a Mauritian male citizen was entitled to these
 privileges. These amendments have now extended similar rights to
 the spouse of a Mauritian female citizen.
 Despite progress in some areas, there are still a number of
 problems which the Government faces. The most pressing of these
 is the continuing one of providing basic social services for a
 society in which unemployment has reached just under 25 percent.
