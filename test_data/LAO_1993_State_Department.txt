 LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) is a Communist, one-party state.
 The Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) is the primary source of political au-
 thority in the country. The party's leadership imposes broad controls on Laos' 4.5
 million people.
 The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) remains the main instrument of state control.
 MOI police monitor Lao society and foreign nationals in Laos, and the LPRP uses
 informants in workplaces and residential communities.
 Laos is one of the world's poorest and least developed countries. In the first few
 years after the LPDR came to power in 1975, at least 350,000 Lao fled the country
 to escape the Government's harsh political and economic policies. Since then, the
 Government has largely abandoned its Socialist economic agenda. Economic reforms
 have moved the country from a moribund, centrally planned system to a growing,
 market-oriented economy open to foreign investment.
 Even with the onging economic liberalization, the adoption of a Constitution in
 1991, the death of the LPRP's longtime leader in November 1992, National Assem-
 bly elections the following month, and a government reorganization in February
 1993, restrictions on basic freedoms have eased only a little in recent years. The
 right to privacy and the right of citizens to change their government are absent.

 The Constitution is the supreme legal document, but in many instances there is
 no or inadequate implementing legislation. Freedoms of speech, assembly, and reli-
 gion are restricted in practice even though provided for in the Constitution. At the
 same time, however, the Government has been working to develop a legal system
 with a codified body of laws consistent with the Constitution and its economic and
 legal reform policies.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killing by the Government in 1993, although police were involved in one confirmed
 extrejudicial killing. In April police in Vientiane shot and killed an unarmed teen.
 ager at a roadblock set up to check for vehicle registrations. The policemen involved
 are in prison but have not yet been tried.
 Extra*udicial killings have also occurred in the context of the continuin insur-
 gency. Drawing primarily from Hmong tribesmen supported by their brethren in
 Thailand and abroad, the low-level insurgency that has existed since 1975 continued
 in 1993 in spite of the December 1992 closing of a refugee camp near the Laos bor-
 der in Thailand and enhanced Thai efforts to prevent use of that country as a base
 for insurgent attacks into Laos. In 1993 there were reports of insurgent attacks to
 the east and the west of their traditional area of operations north of Vientiane and
 south of Luang Prabang. Both sides have reportedly used brutal tactics on occasion,
 with the insurgents occasionally assassinating military and local officials, ambush-
 ing vehicles and attacking villages. They reportedly killed about 15 persons in a
 road ambusA in April and 7 Lao road construction workers in May. The insurgents,
 in turn, have claimed repeatedly that the Government employs chemical weapons
 against them, but extensive investigation of these allegations have produced no con-
 clusive evidence to support these claims.
 b. Disappearance.-In September Vue Mai, a Hmong leader who in November
 1992 had returned voluntarily to Laos from a refugee camp in Thailand to seek a
 settlement site for his family and adherents, disappeared in Vientiane. The Govern-
 ment said its investigation produced no solid leads, and there was no evidence to
 implicate LPDR officials in Nue Mai's disappearance. In 1991 Vue Mai had been
 evacuated from a refugee camp in Thailand. A grenade was thrown at his house in
 the camp after he spoke out in favor of voluntary repatriation, which the Lao insur-
 gents have opposed.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code prohibits torture or mistreatment of prisoners, and the police do
 not appear to use torture or abuse during arrest and detention. Jail conditions, how.
 ever, are harsh, and prisoners are routinely denied family visitations and proper
 medical care. Prisoners in some jails reportedly must resort to bribing their guards
 to obtain food and medicines.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Those accused of hostility to the regime
 are subject to arrest and confinement for long periods. Three former government of-
 ficials continued to serve their 14-year sentences for advocating a multiparty system
 and criticizing restrictions on political liberties. Three men who had been detained
 since 1975 were serving life sentences handed down in 1992 for various crimes al-
 legedly committed during their tenure as officials under the previous regime. Three
 other officials of the former government continued to remain in the remote province
 where they had been detained, raising questions about their freedom of movement.
 Reprtedly in December 1992 a Lao student was detained by the Lao Embassy
 in Moscow for his alleged opposition to the LPRP and then flown against his will
 under official escort to Laos, where he was detained for 7 days and then released.
 The Constitution and Penal Code contain some protection for those accused of
 crimes, such as a statute of limitations; however, these protections have not been
 effectively implemented. Arrests, trials, and convictions are frequently not an-
 nounced, making it impossible to obtain exact figures of the number of political pris-
 oners. People may be arrested on unsupported accusations and without being in-
 formed of the charges or of the accusers' identities. Those accused of what the Gov-
 ernment calls "socially undesirable habits" such as prostitution, drug abuse, and va-
 grancy are subject to arrest and detention in "rehabilitation centers," usually with-
 out public trial. Most of those sent to rehabilitation centers are allowed to return
 home after a confinement that typically includes forced labor, political indoctrina-
 tion, and admission of guilt.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial. -Although regulations call for judgment to be given
 in public, this amounts to public announcement of the sentence and not a true pub-
 lic trial. There is some provision for appeal, and the Council of Ministers must ap-
 
 
 679
 prove death sentences. Reportedly there is also high-level review of other important
 political cases. Under the Constitution, judges and prosecutors are supposed to be
 independent and their decisions not subject to outside scrutiny. In practice, the
 courts appear to accept recommendations of other government agencies, especially
 the MOL in making their decisions.
 While in theory government-provided legal counsel is available to the accused, in
 fact persons accused of crimes must defend themselves without outside legal assist-
 ance. The Government suspended the bar in late 1992, pending the introduction of
 rules regarding the fees and activities of private lawyers. The few private lawyers
 in Laos may still provide legal counsel, at least on civil cases, but they may not set
 themselves up as attorneys-at-law. In civil and commercial matters, the Government
 is promoting the rule of law, often with technical support from Western donors. As
 indicated above, the Government has been developing a legal system with a codified
 body of laws dealing with contracts, companies, foreign investment private prop-
 erty, civil procedure, inheritance, labor, and family, and a Penal Code. In 1993 the
 Government began publishing an official gazette, which for the first time provides
 a systematic means for disseminating laws, decrees, and regulations. Recently the
 Ministry of Justice added a fourth year of studies to the law program that trains
 the nation's future magistrates and judges. Courts are being established at the dis-
 trict level, often for the first time.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Con.
 comitant with liberalization of the economy, the Government has relaxed some ele-
 ments of state control, including police monitoring of personal and business activi-
 ties and enforcement of the nighttime curfew. However, while the Constitution pro-
 hibits arrests or searches in homes without warrants or authorization, search and
 seizure continue to be authorized by the security bureaus themselves rather than
 by judicial authority. The Government and the party continue to monitor some as-
 pects of family life through a system of neighborhood and workplace committees.
 The neighborhood committees have responsibility for maintaining public order in
 their nghbrhood and reporting "bad elements      tthe police. These committees
 usually conern themselves more with street crime and instanes of moral turpitude
 rather than wit political activism. In 1992 the MOI began making late-night in-
 spections of households to insure that all those in the house were registered with
 the police. Those found unregistered were often detained for several days. The Gov-
 ernment also began reinstating workers' committees among Lao employees of em-
 bassies and international organizations. The committees are charged with conduct-
 ing political training and maintaining discipline among employees.
 The Penal Code outlaws listening to telephone calls without proper authorization,
 but the security bureaus themselves probably have the right to make such author-
 ization. As far as is known, monitoring of international mail and tele hone calls
 continues. Under the new land decree, the "national community" owns a I land.  -
 vate "ownership" is in the form of land use certificates. The Government has lifted
 restrictions on the sale of such certificates and has implemented a decree to return
 property confiscated after 1975 to those original owners who repatriate to Laos.
 However, in cases where the property is now used as housing by government offi-
 cials, the petitions to have property returned remain in litigation, and the 30-some
 officials of the former government who were convicted in absentia in 1975 are not
 eligible. A 1990 decree confiscated their property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Despite the constitutional guarantees of free-
 dom of speech andfreedom of the press, the exercise of these freedoms is broadly
 controlled by the Government. The Government reacts harshly to expressions of po-
 litical dissent. As noted above, three persons arrested in 1990 for reportedly advo-
 cating a multiparty system each received 14-year sentences. The Penal Code bars
 slan ering the State, including distorting party or state policies, and spreading false
 rumors conducive to disorder. It also bars disseminating books and other materials
 that are deemed indecent or that would infringe on the national culture. In January
 the Government released from jail and expelled from the country two Americans
 who had been separately arrested the previous fall, allegedly for having imported
 politically sensitive and pornographic materials and for taking pictures in off-limits
 areas and bearing false documents.
 Newspapers, radio, and television are instruments of the Government, reflecting
 its views. The Government has traditionally sought to control the flow of informa-
 tion from abroad, and there are limitations on the importation of foreign publica-
 tions, though some Thai and Western newspapers and magazines are sold. The Gov-
 ernment makes no effort to discourage reception of Thai radio or television broad-
 casts, which are widely listened to and watched in the Mekong river valley. In Vien-
 
 
 680
 tiane, the capital, satellite televisionreceiving dishes have proliferated in the yards
 of foreign residents and others who can afford them. Video rental stores operate
 largely without restrictions in most Lao cities, although such stores are prohibited
 from carrying pornographic or politically inflammatory material.
 Academic freedom remains tightly controlled. Lao academicians are sometimes de-
 nied permission to travel abroad for conferences or training. The Government also
 restricts and monitors the activities of Western scholars doing research in Laos.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government controls and
 organizes most large public gatherings except for religious, athletic, and communal
 events. The Pena[ Code expressly prohibits demonstrations or protest marches
 aimed at causing turmoil and social instability, prescribing penalties of from 1 to
 5 years' imprisonment. Unspecified "destabilizing subversive activities" are also
 banned. Although the Constitution specifies the right of Lao citizens to organize and
 join associations, all associations areparty controlled and disseminate official policy.
 Contact between ordinary Lao and foreigners have increased in recent years as
 restrictions such as the requirement for government approval of invitations to most
 foreigners' homes, are no longer enforced. The prohibition against foreigners staying
 with Lao families has also been eased in urban areas, and the Government allows
 Lao citizens to marry foreigners as long as government approval of the marriage is
 obtained first. Marriages conducted without government approval may be annulled
 anti the foreign spouse subject to fine or arrest.
 Other restrictions on association with foreigners still apply. Government officials
 require government approval to travel in other countries. The Government some-
 times requires that diplomats hire domestic help only from a list provided by the
 Government. Restrictions on foreigners traveling upcountry appear aimed in part at
 forestalling contact with insurgent groups or at preventing religious proselytizing.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-In official statements the Government,as recognized the
 right to freedom of religion as well as the contributions religion can make to the
 development of the nation, and the Constitution contains provisions for religious
 freedom. However, the Government continues to restrict freedom of religion, espe-
 cially for non-Buddhists.
 Links with coreligionists and religious associations in other countries require gov-
 ernment approval. The Government does not formally ban missionaries from enter-
 ing Laos to proselytize but almost always denies them permission to enter. Many
 resident foreigners are active in Lao churches and provide assistance in setting up
 new churches. The Government welcomes nongovernmental organizations with reli-
 gious affiliations as long as they contribute to national development and do not
 proselytize openly.
 All Christian seminaries were closed by the new Government in 1975, and they
 have not reopened. Those wishing to enter the priesthood must study privately with
 riests or ministers. Almost all Protestant ministers are lay preachers. Even so,
 Roman Catholics and Protestants are permitted to worship openly, and new church-
 es have opened since 1990. About a dozen Catholic and Protestant churches are ac-
 tive in Vientiane, with many other churches scattered throughout the country.
 Although many highland Lao are animists, and there are Christian and Moslem
 minorities, nearly all lowland Lao are Buddhists. Having restructured the Buddhist
 organizations after coming to power in 1975, the Government now tolerates and en-
 courages the open practice of Buddhism, and it has openly supported Buddhist orga-
 nizations in the last few years. High-ranking government officials routinely attend
 Buddhist functions, and Buddhist clergy are prominently featured at important
 state and party functions. The Government permits religious festivals without hin-
 drance. Many temples are being repaired and restored, and the number of Buddhist
 monks has increased in recent years; about 30,000 are now practicing in Laos.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government retains the right to require citizens to obtain official
 permission for internal travel, and foreign residents in Vientiane must obtain per-
 mission to travel outside the prefecture. Similar restrictions apply to foreign tourists
 except when their travel in Laos is with an officially sanctioned tour group. In con-
 trast, most Lao may easily obtain passports and exit permits from the Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs for travel abroad. Border-crossing permits for Lao to visit Thailand
 are routinely available from local village committees for a modest issuance fee.
 Travel to the United States and other Western countries has risen dramatically in
 the past several years. In recent years the number of Lao emigrating to live with
 relatives abroad has increased sharply, and the Government does not appear to
 interfere with persons desiring to emigrate.
 The stated government policy since 1977 has been to welcome back the approxi-
 mately 10 percent of the population who fled after the change of governments in
 1975 (except for the 30-some persons convicted in absentia; see Section l.f.). Since
 
 
 1988 thousands of Lao living abroad have returned to visit family and friends. A
 number of Lao have returned to investigate business possibilities, and several have
 remained to operate businesses.
 Almost 19,000 Lao have voluntarily returned to Laos since 1980 under the aus-
 pices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), including
 some 4,200 in 1993. Perhaps another 30,000 have repatriated without official in-
 volvement. About 30,000 Lao refugees and asylum seekers remain in Thailand; and
 another 1,700 in China.
 Laos, hailand, and the UNHCR are cooperating on a phased return of the
 hilltribe Lao remaining in Thailand who wish to return to Laos. This program in-
 cludes provisions for the careful monitoring of returnees to ensure they are given
 the same rights and treatment as resident Lao.
 According to the UNHCR and voluntary agencies that work with it returnees
 have not been the subject of discrimination or persecution and are allowed back
 with all the belongings they accumulated while outside of Laos.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the ability to change their government despite constitutional
 provisions for secret ballots and universal suffrage in the public election of National
 Assembly members. The Assembly elects the President, and it is beginning to assert
 itself on matters that do not affect the fundamentals of the political system. How-
 ever, because the LPRP continues to dominate government and politics, there is no
 structured way in which citizens could remove the LPRP from power. Its primacy
 is set forth in the Constitution. All candidates for the National Assembly election
 in December 1992 had to be approved by the party, no other parties were permitted
 to organize, and voting was mandatory. Nevertheless, the Assembly does include a
 number of non-LPRP members.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vest igation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no domestic human rights groups. Any organization wishing to inves-
 tigate and publicly criticize the Government's human rights policies woul face seri-
 ous obstacles, if it were tto operate at all. Laos generally does not
 cooperate with international human rights organizations. The Government has,
 however, permitted visits by officials of international humanitarian organizations
 and has communicated with them by letter.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-There is no pattern of widespread domestic or culturally app roved vio-
 lence against women, and reports of sexual harassment are rare. But lowland Lao
 and especially some hilltribes tend to hold women in lower esteem than men. Tradi-
 tionally, women in Lao society have been subservient to men and have often been
 discouraged from obtaining an education, in part because some families tend to keep
 school-age daughters at home to tend to domestic duties. The Government claims
 a higher percentage of girls are in school now than before 1975 and that women
 are being encouraged to assume a greater role in economic and political activity.
 The Government relies on the Women s Union and youth organizations to educate
 girls and young women against the schemes of recruiters for brothels and sweat-
 shops in Bangkok and elsewhere. Many women occupy responsible positions in gov-
 ernment and private business, and in urban areas their income is often higher than
 that of their husbands. Yet only 7 of the 78 members of the National Assembly are
 women, the 53-member Central Committee has only 2 women on it, and there are
 no women on the Politburo or Council of Ministers.
 Children.-Physical abuse of children is rare, although many drop out of school
 at an early age, and children commonly work on their families' farms and shops.
 The Government is concerned about the welfare of Lao children, but in light of
 many pressing demands on very limited resources, it has not committed the funding
 or. persnnel needed to implement its good intentions effectively.
 National/Racial/IEthnic Minorities.-Approximately one-half of the population is
 ethnic Lao, also called "lowland Lao," and most of the other half is a mosaic of up-
 land hilltribes. There are also ethnic Vietnamese and Chinese, particularly in the
 towns. Their rights to Lao citizenship are uncertain as long as the law on national-
 ity, which would convey that right, remains unimplemented. The Constitution pro-
 vides for equal rights for all minorities, and there is no legal discrimination against
 them.
 The Government attempts to integrate the hilltribes through voluntary programs
 and to overcome traditional antagonisms and prejudice between lowland Lao and
 
 
 minority groups. While the Government encourages the preservation of minority cul-
 tures and traditions, minority tribes have virtually no voice in government decisions
 affecting their lands and the allocation of natural resources. The party and the Gov-
 ernment continue to be dominated by lowland Lao males, though efforts have been
 made to include minorities in the political and governmental elites. The Minister
 of the Interior is a member of an ethnic minority, but there are no minorities rep-
 resented on the Politburo and only five on the Central Committee.
 The Hmong, the largest highland tribe, are split along clan lines. During the Viet-
 nam war, many were strongly anti-Communist while others sided with the Lao and
 Vietnamese Communists. The Government has repressed many of those who fought
 against it, especially those perceived to be still resisting its authority. On the other
 hand, many Hmong who supported the Lao Communists before 1975 today occupy
 important positions in the Government, and an increasing number of Hmong who
 fled the country after 1975 have repatriated back to Laos without suffering persecu-
 tion by the Government.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no outright discrimination against people with
 disabilities. Neither is there any government assistance, save for casual ties of the
 revolutionary war that brought the Government to power. Typically, the family and
 the community take responsibility for the disabled. Unless severely disabled, such
 children attend public schools despite the absence of special facilities for them. Pro-
 vision of accessibility for disabled persons has not been manadated legislatively or
 otherwise.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although the Constitution provides citizens the right
 to organize and join associations, all associations are party controlled and dissemi-
 nate official policy (see Section 2.b.).
 An estimated 85 percent of Lao are subsistence farmers. Among salaried workers,
 the majority are employed by the State, though this has been changing as the Gov-
 ernment privatizes state enterprises and encourages private investors to open new
 factories. in response to the emerging private sector, the Government in 1990 adopt-
 ed a Labor Code that permits labor unions to be formed in the private enterprises
 so long as they operate within the framework of the officially sanctioned Federation
 of Lao Trade Unions (FLTU), which in turn is controlled by the LPRP. The extent
 to which the FLTU is free to engage in contacts and activities with foreign labor
 organizations is unknown.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no right to organize
 and bargain collectively. Wages and salaries for government employees are set by
 the Government, while wages and salaries for private business employees are set
 by management. The Labor Code stipulates that disputes should be resolved
 through workplace committees composed of employers, representatives of the local
 labor union, and representatives of the FLTU, with final authority at the Ministry
 of Labor and Social Welfare. The incidence of labor disputes has risen with the in-
 crease in foreign investment. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 labor except in time of war or national disaster, when the State may conscript labor-
 ers. In practice, however, prisoners in work camps must do manual labor, including
 growing their own food. They are routinely required to work on nearby state and
 private enterprises without wages.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the Labor Code, children
 under 15 may not be recruited for employment. Because many children help their
 families on farms or in shops, the Labor Code allows younger children to work for
 their families, provided they do not engage in dangerous or difficult work. Employ-
 ment of children in industry is not widespread, although it is common in urban
 shops. The MOI and Ministry of Justice are responsible for enforcing these provi-
 sions, but enforcement is ineffective owing to a lack of inspectors and other re-
 sources. Education is compulsory through the fifth grade, but this requirement is
 rarely observed in the rural areas or among the urban poor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code has provisions for a broad
 range of worker entitlements, including a workweek limited to 48 hours (36 in dan-
 gerous activities) and safe working conditions. The Labor Code requires employers
 to provide a safe work environment and offers special compensation for dangerous
 work. Employers are supposed to provide all expenses for a worker injured or killed
 on the job. The government-stipulated daily minimum wage is $1.39 (1,000 kip), ef-
 fective December 1992, which is insufficient to provide a decent standard of living
 for a worker and his family. However, almost no families in the monetized economy
 depend only on one breadwinner. Some piecework employees, especially on construc-
 tion sites, make less than the minimum wage. In April the Ministry of Labor and
 
 
 Social Welfare announced that employers would have 30 days to comply with Labor
 Code provisions on minimum wage, overtime, leave, social security, and health care,
 and that it would periodically inspect workplaces to ensure compliance. Despite its
 intentions, the understaffed Ministry lacks effective enforcement mechanisms, and
 the Labor Code is not effectively enforced.
