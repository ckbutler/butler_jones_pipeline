 GABON
 A one-party state until 1990, Gabon held its ir-st multiparty elections in 1991,
 with President Omar Bongo's p arty retaining a large majority in the National As-
 senmbly. President Bongo, in office since 1967, was reelected in 1993 in an election
 marred by serious irregularities. After several months of contention and civil unrest,
 political parties supporting the President and the principal opposition parties nego-
 tiated in October 1994 the "Paris Accords." These agreements included promises of
 reforms to amend electoral procedures, to include opposition leaders in government,
 and to assure greater respect for human rights. These were approved by a national
 referendum in ,July 1995. Opposition parties won disorganize municipal elections
 in the capital in October andovember, while in December parties supporting the
 President won more than two-thirds of the seats in the National Assembly in elec-
 tions that the opposition claimed were marred by massive fraud. The judiciary is
 independent but remains vulnerable to government manipulation.
 The national police and the gendarmerie enforce the law and maintain public se-
 curity. In conformity with the Paris Accords, the National Assembly reassigned au-
 thority over these security forces from the Ministry of Defense to the Ministry of
 the Interior and redesignated as the "Republican Guard,' an elite, heavily armed
 corps that protects the President. In 1994 the Defense Minister used this corps for
 violent repression of public dissent, but more recently it has not acted with undue
 force. Security forces on occasion beat persons in custody.
 The Government generally adheres to free market principles, particularly in the
 export sector, in which trade is dominated by petroleum, timber, and minerals. A
 
 
 majority of workers in the formal sector are employed by the Government or by
 large inefficient state-owned organizations. Per capi inincome is approximately
 $4,600 annually, and income distribution is badly skewed in favor of urban dwellers
 and a small economic elite. Immigrants from other African countries dominate the
 informal sector. The rural population is poor and receives few social services. Finan-
 cial mismanagement and corruption have resulted in significant arrears in domestic
 and external debt. The Government continued to meet most of its structural adjust-
 ment prformance goals.
 The Government maintained a generally satisfactory human rights performance
 and made Blow but measurable progress in instituting democratic electoral prac-
 tices. Civil peace prevailed as the ruling Gabnese Democratic Party, members of
 the opposition coalition High Council of the Resistance, and other parties conducted
 negotiations, appealed to legal institutions, and used internationalmediation to re-
 solve differences over interpretation and implementation of the Paris Accords. How-
 ever, longstanding human rights abuses continued. The security forces beat and tor-
 tured prisoners and detainees, and prison conditions remained abysmal. Societal
 discrimination and violence against women, and exploitation of expatriate children
 as domestic and agricultural wokers remained problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial K'ling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killing.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Purnshment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture or cruel and inhuman punishment. However, s-
 curity forces often beat or physically mistreat prisoners and detainees as punish-
 ment and to exact confessions.
 Conditions in mostprisns are abysmal and life threatening. Sanitation and ven-
 tilation are poor, and medical care is almost nonexistent isons provide inad-
 equate food for inmates. There were no known visits by human rights monitors to
 prisons during the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for up to 48 hours of
 initial preventive detention, during which time police must charge a detainee before
 a judge. In practice, however, police rarely respect this provision. Bail may be set
 if there is to be a further investigation. Pretrial detainees have the right to free ac-
 ces to their attorneys. This ri ht is respected in practice. Detainees have the right
 to an expeditious trial, as defined by the law. Pretrial detention is limited to 6
 months or a misdemeanor and to 1 year for a felony charge. These periods may
 be extended up to 6 months longer by the examining magistrate. The Attorney en-
 eral's office estimates that roughly 40 percent of persons in custody are pretrial de-
 tainees.
 Exile is not used as a punishment nor as a means of political control, and there
 are no opposition leaders liigin exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. The judiciary is generally independent but remains vulnerable to government
 manipulation.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a public trial and the right to legal
 ounsel. These rights are generally respeted in criminal cases. Nevertheless, proce-
 dural safeguards are lacking, particularly in state security trials. The law a pplies
 the concept of presumed guilt. A judge may thus deliver an immediate ver    a
 the  tiachearing if sufficient evidence is presented by the State.
 The judicial system includes the regular courts, a military tribunal, and a civilian
 State Security Court. The regular court system includes trial courts, appellate
 courts, and the Supreme Court. The Constitutional Court is a separate   a ed
 with examining constitutional questions, including the certification of elections.
 There are no traditional or customary courts. In some areas, minor disputes may
 be token to a local chief, but the Government does not recognize such decisions. The
 State Security Court, last convened in 1990, is constituted by the Government as
 required basis to consider matters of state security.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for protection from surveillance, from searches without war-
 rant, and from interference with private telecommunications or correspondence. As
 part of criminal investigations, police may request search warrants from judges,
 which they obtain easily, sometimes after the fact. The Government has used them
 in the past to gain access to the homes of opposition figures and their families. Gov-
 
 
 eminent authorities also routinely monitor private telephone conversations, per-
 sonal mail, and the movements of citizens.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and in practice, citizens speak freely and criticize leaders. Legislators
 in the National Assembly openly criticize government policies, ministers, and other
 officials.
 The only daily newspaper is the government-owned L'Union, but there are more
 than a half-dozen weekly or periodical publications in newspaper format, represent-
 ing independent views and those of various political parties. All-including
 L'Union-actively criticize the Government and political leaders of all parties. Most
 also criticize the President.
 The National Communication Council (NCC), an appointed body, twice imposed
 restrictions on an opposition-owned radio station during election periods for broad-
 casting interviews and listener comments judged by the NCC to be dangerous to
 public order.
 The Government controls national electronic media, which reach all areas of the
 country. Four private radio stations have been licensed and a fifth operates under
 a temporary permit. Journalists are subject to an extensive code of rights and re-
 sponsibilities approved by the National Assembly in 1995.
 The Government does not interfere with broadcasts of international radio stations
 Radio France 1, Africa No. 1, or the Voice of America. Foreign newspapers and mag-
 azines are widely available.
 There are no restrictions on academic freedom, including research.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Citizens and recognized orga-
 nizations normally enjoy freedom of assembly and association which are provided
 for by the Constitution. Groups must obtain permits for public gatherings in ad-
 vance, and the Government usually grants them.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and au-
 thorities do not engage in religious persecution or favoritism. There is no state reli-
 gion. While the Government has not lifted its ban on Jehovah's Witnesses, neither
 has it enforced this ban.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights. There are no legally man-
 dated restrictions on internal movement. Police and gendarmes frequently stop trav-
 elers to check identity, residence, or registration documents, and members of the se-
 curity forces regularly harass expatriate Africans working legally as merchants,
 service sector employees, and manual laborers. They extorted bribes and demanded
 services with the threat of confiscation of residence documents or imprisonment.
 Residence permits cost up to $1,000.
 An unevenly enforced law requires married women to have their husbands' per-
 mission to travel abroad. An exit visa is no longer required for citizens to travel
 abroad. Aliens resident in the country must obtain a visa in order to leave and re-
 turn.
 The Government strictly controls the process of refugee adjudication. Coordination
 with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has improved in assisting
 refugees, and there were no credible reports that the Government had forcibly repa-
 triated illegal aliens. There were about 350 refugees at year's end.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The 1991 Constitution explicitly provides this right, but mismanagement and seri-
 ous irregularities in both the 1990 legislative elections and the 1993 presidential
 election called into serious doubt the extent to which this right exists in practice.
 In a July 1995 constitutional referendum, citizens approved by a 96 percent ma-
 jority reforms previously agreed in the Paris Accords, including most significantly
 the establishment of an independent National Electoral Commission (NEC). The ref-
 erendum was carried out under arrangements that assured that all political parties
 could monitor voting and vote counting.
 National Assembly, Senate, and municipal elections scheduled for the Spring were
 ned several times due to legislative inaction, government delays, and requests
 bythe NECfor additional time. The NEC, created in May, institutionalized a proc-
 ess in which majority, opposition, and civil service representatives organized elec-
 tions. Delays in registering voters and organizing elections were attributed by all
 sides to logistical rather than political obstacles.
 Local elections scheduled for October 20 were poorly organized and were repeated
 on November 24 in the capital, Libreville. In each case, opposition parties won most

<pre>
 101
 of the municipal council seats in the capital. This result was reversed in the official
 results of legislative elections on December 15 and December 29, in which parties
 supporting the President took more than 80 of the 120 National Assembly seats, in-
 cluding 8 of the 10 seats representing the capital. Opposition parties claimed mas-
 sive colaboration in fraud by the military and NEC magistrates in ensuring victory
 for arties supporting the President.
 Thre are no restrictions on the participation of women and minorities in politics.
 There are 6 women among the 120 National Assembly representatives and 1 in the
 Cabinet. Women serve at all levels within the various ministries, the judiciary, and
 the opposition. Despite governmental protections, indigenous Pygmies rarely partici-
 pate in the political process, and the Government has made only marginal efforts
 to include them (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government officially allows the existence of independent human rights
 groups. There are two human rights groups, neither of which was active. There were
 no reports of harassment by officials.
 There have been no active inquiries from foreign groups in recent years.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution forbids discrimination based on national origin, race, gender, or
 opinion. The Government does not uniformly enforce these constitutional guarantees
 and tolerates a substantial degree of discrimination against women, especially in do-
 mestic affairs. It has also provided a lower level of health care and educational serv-
 ices to children of families of other African nationalities than it provided to citizens.
 Women.-Violence against women is common and is especially prevalent in rural
 areas. While medical authorities have not specifically identified rape to be a chronic
 problem, religious workers and hospital staff report that evidence of physical beat-
 ings of women is common. Police rarely intervene in such cases, and women vir-
 tually never file complaints with civil authorities. Only limited medical and legal
 assistance is available.
 The law provides that women have rights to equal access in education, business,
 and investment. Women own businesses and property, participate in politics, and
 work throughout the government and the private sector. Women nevertheless con-
 tinue to face considerable societal and legal discrimination, especially in rural areas.
 By law, couples must stipulate at the time of marriage whether they will adhere
 to a monogamous or a polygynous relationship. For monogamous married couples,
 a common property law provides for the equal distribution of assets after divorce.
 Wives who leave polygynous husbands suffer severe reductions in their property
 rights. In inheritance cases, the husband's family must issue a written authorization
 before his widow can inherit property. Common law marriage, which is socially ac-
 cepted and widely practiced, affords a woman no property rights.
 The law still requires that a woman obtain her husband's permission to travel
 abroad; however, this requirement is not consistently enforced. The 1995 National
 Assembly proposal allowing husbands to alter retroactively the legal status of their
 marriages from monogamous to polygynous was never formally introduced into the
 legislature.
 Children.-The Government has used Gabon's oil revenue to build schools, to pay
 adequate teacher salaries, and to promote education, even in rural areas. Gabon has
 a relatively high infant mortality rate, and not all children have access to vaccina-
 tion. Traditional beliefs and practices provide numerous safeguards for children, but
 children remain the responsibility of the extended family-including aunts, grand-
 mothers, and older siblings. There is little evidence of physical abuse of children.
 Protection for children's rights is not codified in law.
 There is concern about the problems facing the large community of children of Af-
 rican noncitizens. Almost all enjoy far less access to education and health care than
 do children of Gabonese, and are sometimes victims of child labor abuses (see Sec-
 tion 6.d.). While female genital mutilation is not practiced on Gabonese children, it
 does occur among the resident population of expatriate Africans.
 People With Disabilities-There are no laws prohibiting discrimination against
 persons with disabilities, nor providing for access to buildings or services.
 Indigenous People.-Several thousand indigenous Pygmies live in northeastern
 Gabon. In principle they enjoy the same civil rights as other citizens. Pygmies are
 largely independent of formal authority, keeping their own traditions, independent
 communities, and local decisionmaking structures. Pygmies did not participate in
 government-instituted programs that integrated many small rural villages into larg-
 
 
 102
 er ones along major roads. As a result, their access to government-funded health
 and sanitation facilities was limited. There are no specific government programs or
 policies to assist or hinder Pygmies.
 National IRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Persons from all major ethnic groups contin-
 ued to occupy prominent positions in government, in the military services, and in
 the private sector. Credible reports suggest, however, that ethnic favoritism in hir-
 ing and promotion ia pervasive. There was evidence, especially within the armed
 forces, that members of the President's ethnic group held a disproportionately large
 share both of senior positions and of jobs within the ranks.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution places no restrictions on the right
 of association and recognizes the right of citizens to form trade and labor unions.
 Virtually the entire formal private sector work force is unionized. Unions must reg-
 ister with the Government mn order to be recognized officially. Public sector employ-
 ees may unionize although tto strike is limited if it could jeopardize public
 safety. Until 1990 there was only one recognized labor organization, the Gabonese
 Labor Confederation (COSYGA), to which all unionized workers contributed a man-
 datry percentage of their salaries. In 1992 the Government accepted the establish-
 ment of independent unions and abolished the mandatory contribution to COSYGA.
 In November 1994, the National Assembly passed an extensively revised version
 of the Labor Code, which was published and implemented in early 1995. The Code
 provides extensive protection of worker rights.
 Strikes are legal if they are held after an 8-day notice advising that outside arbi-
 tration has failed. The Labor Code prohibits direct government action against indi-
 vidual strikers who abide by the arbitration and notification provisions. It also pro-
 vides that the Government cannot press charges against a group as a whole for
 criminal activities committed by individuals. Unions and confederations are free to
 affiliate with international labor bodies and participate in their activities. COSYGA
 is affiliated with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity, while the Gaboe-
 neso Confederation of Free Unions (CGSL) is affiliated with the International Con-
 federation of Free Trade Unions. Both COSYGA and CGSL havetes theo numerous
 other international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-The Labor Code provides for
 collective bargaining. Labor and management meet to negotiate differences, and the
 Ministry of Labor provides an observer. This observer does not take an active part
 in negotiations over pay scales, working conditions, or benefits. Agreements also
 apply to nonunion workers. While no laws specifically prohibit antiunion discrimina-
 tion, the court may require employers foundgeilty by civil courts of having engaged
 in such discrimination to compensate employees.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and there are no reports that it now exists.
 d. Minimum Age for the Employment of Children.---Children below the age of 16
 may not work without the express consent of the Ministries of Labor, Education,
 andPublic Health. These ministries rigorously enforce this law with respect to Gab-
 onese children, and there are few Gabonese under the age of 18 working in the mod-
 ern wage sector. A signifcantnumber of children work in marketplaces or perform
 domestic duties. The   . idren's Fund (UNICEF) and other concerned organiza-
 tions have reported that government officials often privately use foreign child laber,
 mainly as domestic or agricultural help. These children do not go to school, have
 only limited means of acquiring medical attention, and are often victims of exploi-
 tation by employers or foster families. Laws forbidding child labor theoretically ex-
 tend protection to foreign children as well, but abuses often are not reported. There
 is no compulsory education law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code governs working conditions
 and benefits for all sectors and provides a broad range of protection to workers. The
 Code stipulates a 40-hour workweek with a minimum rest period of 48 consecutive
 hours. Employers must compensate workers for overtime work. All companies in the
 modern wage sector pay competitive wages and grant generous fringe benefits re-
 quired bylaw, including maternity leave and 6 weeks of annual paid vacation.
 Traditionally, representatives of labor, management, and the Government met an-
 nually to examine economic and labor conditions and to recommend a minimum
 wage rate within government gaidelines to the President, who then issued an an-
 nual decree. This procedure was not followed in 1995 or in 1996, in part because
 the Government was pursuing a policy of wage austerity recommended by inter-
 national inancal insttieons. The mor monyminimum wage was kept t its 1994
 
 
 level of about $125 (cfa 64,000). Wages do provide for a decent standard of living
 for a worker and family.
 The Ministry of Health has established occupational health and safety standards
 but does not effectively enforce or regulate them. Application of labor standards var-
 ies greatly from company to company and between industries. The Government re-
 portedly does not enfiorce labor code provisions in sectors where the bulk of the labor
 force is non-Gabonese. Foreigners, both documented and undocumented, may be
 obliged to work under substandard conditions; may be dismissed without notice or
 recourse; or may be physically mistreated, especially in the case of illegal aliens.
 Employers frequently require longer hours of work from noncitizen Africans and pay
 them less, often hiring on a short-term, casual basis in order to avoid paying taxes,
 social security contributions, and other benefits. In the formal sector, workers may
 remove themselves from dangerous work situations without fear of retribution.
