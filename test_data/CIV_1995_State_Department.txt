 COTE D'IVOIRE
 From independence in 1960 until 1990, President Felix Houphouet-Boigny and his
 Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI), then the only legal political party, gov-
 ered the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire. The PDCI maintained this political dominance
 following multiparty presidential and legislative elections in 1990. On Houphouet's
 death in 1993, National Assembly President Henri Konan Bedie became President
 by constitutional succession, and served out the remainder of Houphouet's term.
 Due to concerns about irregularities concerning the electoral code and voter reg-
 istration, Cote d'Ivoire's major opposition parties boycotted the October 22 presi-
 dential election and tried to interfere with the voting process. Only the ruling PDCI
 and a single small opposition party, the Ivorian Workers Party (PIT), fielded can-
 didates. President Be ie won 96 percent of the vote. On November 6, the major po-
 litical parties reached an accord which allowed for full party participation in the No-
 vember 26 legislative elections. During the legislative elections, international and
 domestic observers noted that the voting took place in a calm manner, that voters
 were knowledgeable about the choice of candidates and that the presence of party
 representatives throughout the voting process served to increase public confidence.
 Nonetheless, observers noted several areas of concern.
 Security forces include the national police (Surete) and the Gendarmerie, a branch
 of the armed forces with responsibility for general law enforcement. The Gendar-
 merie is a national police charged with maintenance of public order and territorial
 security. Designated as the country's senior service for enforcing public order, it
 takes precedence over all other security apparatus components. Th& armed forces
 traditionally have accepted the primacy of civilian authority. Security forces, includ-
 ing the Special Anticrime Police Brigade (SAVAC), were responsible for a number
 of human rights abuses.
 The economy, largely market based but heavily dependent on the agricultural sec-
 tor, performed poorly in the 1980's and early 1990's. High population growth cou-
 pled with economic decline resulted in a steady fall in living standards. The econ-
 omy showed significant strengthening following the January 1994 currency devalu-
 ation and the beginning of major structural reforms. Gross national product (GNP)
 per capita in 1995 was about $525, and the economy expanded by about 5 percent.
 A majority of the population remains dependent on sma holder cash crop produc-
 tion. Principal exports are cocoa, coffee, and tropical woods, for which world market
 pries rose in 1995.
 Despite a peaceful constitutional succession in December 1993 and multiparty
 elections in October 1995-February 1996, the Government's human rights record
 was impaired, as serious human rights abuses continued. Members ofthe security
 forces carried out extrajudicial killings of criminal suspects, and the security forces
 
 
 beat and abused detainees, using lethal force to disperse protestors, according to
 press reports and human rights groups. The Government also used arbitrary arrest
 and detention. It failed to bring to justice perpetrators of many of these abuses.
 Prison conditions are harsh and life threatening. The judiciary does not ensure due
 process and is subject to executive branch influence; prolonged detention is a prob-
 lem. The Government restricts freedom of assembly.
 Police arrested and beat demonstrators participating in October opposition
 marches and sit-ins, subjecting them to control by tear gas. The Government places
 severe restrictions on press freedom and imprisoned several journalists for breaking
 the law which makes it a crime to criticize the Government and Chief of State. In
 a highly publicized case, police beat opposition leader Abou Drahamane Sangare in
 the Office of the Minister of Security in June. Discrimination against women re-
 mains a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known politically mo-
 tivated killings by government forces. However, as violent civil crime increased, the
 security forces frequently resorted to lethal force. Credible reports indicate that
 SAVAC continued its policy of shooting to kill in the pursuit of criminal suspects.
 According to the press, best estimates suggest that at least 22 persons were killed
 by SAVAC and the regular police. The Government prosecuted no SAVAC or police
 personnel for these killings.
 Police killed four protesters in separate incidents in October, as antigovernment
 protests turned violent (see Section 2.a.). There has been no public official inquiry
 into these killings. Ten individuals died as the result of the October election period
 violence, including two security force members and eight demonstrators killed dur-
 ing crowd control efforts. Eight of the deaths occurred during the preelection dem-
 onstrations, and two civilians died on election day in a polling place melee. In addi-
 tion, against the backdrop of "active boycott" violence and a deteriorating security
 situation, ethnic strife between the Bete and Baoule claimed 25 lives in October, ac-
 cording to government figures. Harsh prison conditions were responsible for the
 death of a number of prisoners (see Section 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Despite legal protections for the rights of persons in custody, police sometimes beat
 detainees or prisoners as punishment or to extract confessions, according to local
 human rights groups. There were no public reports of government officials being
 tried for these abuses.
 On occasion, the Government punished perpetrators of crimes in the security
 forces. In July a judge sentenced a gendarme to 10 years' imprisonment for raping
 a teenage girl in a dormitory. However, these are exceptions to the rule; most of-
 fenders are not tried.
 A jurists' union official reported that suspects were beaten to obtain their confes-
 sions and were afraid to press charges against the police officers involved. Press
 photographs regularly show criminal detainees with swollen or braised faces and
 bodies, a likely indicator of police mistreatment during arrest or detention.
 Police also beat demonstrators. In May five students arrested during a demonstra-
 tion at the Abobo-Adjame Campus of the national university were beaten by police
 and detained without charge at the National Police School for 5 days.
 In June a government minister ordered police to beat opposition leader and editor
 Abou Drahamane Sangare (see Section 2.a.). In April police also detained and re-
 portedly beat unemployed youth (see Section 1.d.).
 Police routinely treat non-Ivorian Africans residing in Cote d'Ivoire (who rep-
 resent a third of the total population) more roughly than Ivorians.
 Prison conditions are harsh and life threatening. Problems include overcrowding,
 malnutrition, and a high incidence of infectious disease, conditions responsible for
 the high prisoner death rate. For example, Dabre Brahima, a member of the trade
 union confederation Dignite died in July of an undisclosed illness while incarcerated
 in the Abidjan prison. Several journalists released during the year reported that cer-
 tain white-collar prisoners are accorded special treatment. Officials denied the
 Ivorian Human Rights League (LIDHO) and other human rights groups access to
 the prison at various times this year.
 According to a LIDHO report, conditions at the main prison of Abidjan are espe-
 cially hazardous for women, with violent and nonviolent criminals, as well as mi-
 nors, housed together. There are no health facilities for women, and a number of
 
 
 67
 women have reportedly given birth at the prison without medical attention. There
 are reports of women prisoners being raped by prison guards.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Code of Penal Procedure, a
 secutor may order the detention of a suspect for up to 48 hours without
 ~ringing harges. A magistrate may order detention up to 4 months but must also
 provide the Minister of Justice with a written justification for continued detention
 on a monthly basis. However, the law is often violated. Police have held persons for
 more than 48 hours without bringing charges. According to a representative of the
 jurists' union, this practice is common, and often magistrates are not able to verify
 that those not charged are released. Defendants are not guaranteed the right to a
 judicial determination of the legality of their detention. A judge may release pretrial
 detainees on bail if the judge believes that the suspect will not flee. However, ac-
 cording to LIDHO, many prisoners are detained for long periods, sometimes years,
 awaiting trial. While reliable statistics are lacking, pretrial detainees probably make
 up 10 percent of the prison population.
 Although the law prohibits it, police restrict access to some prisoners. Although
 the Government on December 2 released Guillaume Soro, secretary general of
 FESCI, the students' union, and six colleagues, at least one student remains in jail.
 On October 10, police arrested "Sorbonne leader Bazoumana Dembele and nearly
 60 bystanders as Bazomana attempted to hold a meeting in downtown Abidjan. At
 year's end, there were conflicting reports as to whether the bystanders remain in-
 carcerated.
 Despite the frequency of arbitrary arrest, there is no accurate total of suspects
 held. In April police held in" investigative detention over 800 unemployed youth in
 Abidjan in an attempt to identify criminals. Several reported that police had beaten
 them.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The formal judicial system is headed by a Su-
 preme Court and includes the Court of Appeals and lower courts.
 According to the Constitution, the judiciary is independent of the executive branch
 in ordinary criminal cases. In practice, it follows the lead of the executive in na-
 tional security or politically sensitive cases. There are credible reports that those
 with ties to the opposition are treated more harshly by the judicial system than
 those with ties to the Government. Judges serve at the pleasure of the executive
 and are therefore likely to bend to political pressure. One jurist claims that he was
 transferred out of Abidjan because of his public appeals for a more independent ju-
 diciary.
 The law provides for the right to public trial, although key evidence is sometimes
 given in camera. The presumption of innocence, and the right of defendants to be
 present at their trials is often not observed. Those convicted have the right of ap-
 peal, although courts rarely overturn verdicts. Defendants accused of felonies or cap-
 ital crimes have the right to legal counsel, and the judicial system provides for
 court-appointed attorneys for indigent defendants. In practice, many defendants
 cannot afford private counsel, and court-appointed attorneys are not readily avail-
 able.
 In rural areas, traditional institutions often administer justice at the village level,
 handling domestic disputes and minor land questions in accordance with customary
 law. Dispute resolution is by extended debate, with no known instance of resort to
 physical punishment. The formal court system is increasingly superseding these tra-
 ditional mechanisms.
 Military courts do not try civilians. Although there are no appellate courts within
 the military court system, persons convicted by a military tribunal may petition the
 Supreme Court to set aside the tribunal's verdict and order a retrial.
 There were no reports of political prisoners in civilian jails. At year's end, there
 were five military officers in detention, reportedly as the result of alleged eoup-plot-
 ting.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Code of Penal Procedure specifies that a police official or investigative magistrate
 may conduct searches of homes without a judicial warrant if there is reason to be-
 lieve that there is evidence on the premises concerning a crime. The official must
 have the prosecutor's agreement to retain any evidence seized in the search and is
 required to have witnesses to the search, which may not take place between 9 p.m.
 and 4 a.m. In practice, police sometimes use a general search warrant without a
 name or address. On occasion, police have entered homes of non-Ivorian Africans
 (or apprehended them at large), taken them to local police stations, and extorted
 small amounts of money for alleged minor offenses.
 
 
 68
 Security forces have reportedly monitored some private telephone conversations,
 but the extent of the practice is unknown. There is no evidence that private written
 correspondence is monitored by authorities.
 Citizens are free to join, or not join, any political party.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of expression, and independent newspapers frequently criticized government poli-
 cies, the Government imposes significant restrictions. The two government-owned
 dally newspapers offer little criticism of government policy, while government-owned
 radio and television offer none at all. Moreover, while independent newspapers (8
 daily, 19 weekly), opposition leaders, and student grups voice their disapproval of
 government or presidential actions frequently and sometimes loudly, the Govern-
 ment does not tolerate what it considers insults or attacks on the honor of the coun-
 try's highest officials. It is a crime, punishable by 3 months to 2 years in prison,
 to offend the President, the Prime hinister, foreign chiefs of state or government,
 or their diplomatic representatives, or to defame institutions of the State. Moreover
 a 1991 press law created a commission to enforce laws against publishing material
 "undermining the reputation of the nation or defaming institutions of the State." A
 British group also expressed concern that the law restricts freedom of expression.
 Journalists exercise considerable self-censorship.
 In February two journalists for the proopposition newspaper La Patrie were ar-
 rested for publishing articles that alleged that President Bedie's parentage excluded
 him from running for president under the current Electoral Code. They were con-
 victed and sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment and fined for "complicity in of-
 fending the Head of State." The Government suspended publication of La Patrie for
 3 months. The journalists were released in July. Many privately owned newspapers
 criticized the election irregularities.
 In February, two editors of the Muslim weekly newspaper Plume Libre were ar-
 rested for writing articles asserting that the Government discriminated against
 Muslims in civil service hiring, firing, and promotion. In March the same two were
 sentenced to 10 months' imprisonment for "breach of the peace" and "incitement to
 violence" for another article they had written. They were released in August.
 Court treatment was more lenient in April for two editors of the government daily
 Fraternite Matin. The two received 2-month suspended sentences and were fined for
 Fublishing articles that falsely accused two opposition leaders of embezzling money
 from their political party's funds.
 In June Minister of Security Ouassenan Kone ordered the beating of Abou
 Drahamane Sangare, an opposition leader and the director of a press group Nouvel
 Horizon. Following the publication of a satirical article in the Nouvel Horizon week-
 ly Bol Kotch, Minister ouassenan Kone summoned Sangare to his office and ordered
 him beaten by police officers on the spot. President Bedie neither dismissed nor
 prosecuted Kone for his actions, despite opposition calls to do so. In September the
 Government detained two foreign journalists reporting on an opposition demonstra-
 tion in Abidjan (see Section 4.).
 The Government owns bth television channels and two major radio stations; only
 the primary government radio and television stations are broadcast nationwide.
 There are also four independent radio stations and a private television subscription
 service, Canal Horizon. While the independent stations have complete control over
 their editorial content, the Government continues to exercise considerable influence
 over official media program content, news coverage, and other matters, using these
 media to promote government policies. Much of the news programming was devoted
 to the activities of the President, the Government, the PDCI, andpro-Bedie groups.
 The National Council of Audiovisual Communication, establishedin 1991 and or-
 mally organized in 1995, is responsible for regulating media access during the 2-
 week formal political campaign period and for resolving complaints about unfair
 media access. However, members of the ruling PDCI make up the majority of the
 membership of the council.
 Many prominent scholars are active in opposition politics and are not known to
 have suffered professionally, although some teachers and professors suggest that
 they have been transferd because of their political activities. According to press
 reports and student union statements, students continue to be used as informants
 at the University of Abidjan.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembl and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly. In practice, however, that freedom is restricted when the Gov-
 ernment perceives a danger to public order, as it did from October onward when
 it used lethal force to control antigovernment demonstrations, which it had banned
 by decree.
 
 
 69
 Groups that wish to hold demonstrations or rallies are required to submit a notice
 of their intent to do so to the Ministry of Security or Interior 48 hours before the
 proposed event. The Government sometimes denied the opposition permission to
 meet in public outdoor venues. Following opposition demonstrations in September,
 the Government announced that "all marches and sit-ins would be banned for a 3-
 month period in all streets and public places." Nevertheless, Government officials
 later insisted that the decree did not represent "an absolute ban" on public gather-
 ings, and the Prime Minister declared that only those demonstrations which disrupt
 public order or block public thoroughfares would be prohibited. The decree was se-
 lectively applied; only opposition events were affected by the ban. Penalties for in-
 fraction ranged from no action to 12 months' imprisonment. More than 100 individ-
 uals awaited trial at yeai~s end.
 Opposition groups defied this ban in October. While authorities in some cities al-
 lowed the demonstrations to proceed, others enforced the decree. In September 10
 people were arrested in Abidjan, of whom 6 were sentenced to I year in prison and
 lined $200 each. In Daloa, two demonstrators were arrested, with one sentenced to
 6 months imprisonment and the other to 1 year, each was fined $220.
 Police used tear gas, batons, and arms to disperse several marches and sit-ins by
 opposition party demonstrators who protested the Electoral Code and alleged irreg-
 ularities in voter registration in September and October. Five people (including one
 gendarme) were killed and 50 people were injured as a result of these altercations.
 There has been no public inquiry.
 Police occasionally prohibit gatherings to prevent the expression of controversial
 views. An "anti-vandalism" law passed by the National Assembly in 1992 holds or-
 ganizers of a march or demonstration responsible if any of the participants engage
 in violence. LIDHO and all major opposition parties condemned the law as unduly
 vague and as one which imposed collective punishment for the crimes of a few.
 Opposition parties assert that the Constitution permits private associations to
 form. The Government rejects this interpretation and requires all organizations to
 register before commencing activities. There were no reports in the past 4 years of
 denial of registration. The law prohibits the formation of political parties along eth-
 nic or religious lines. In 1991 the Government banned the student union FESCI for
 failure to register properly. The ban was never rescinded, although FESCI was al-
 lowed to operate openly until May 1994. At that time, the Government again in-
 sisted that the organization was banned, arresting several members of its executive
 bureau. FESCI remained banned throughout the year but was active in demonstra-
 tions, ceremonies, and political party conventions.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and
 there are no known impediments to religious expression. There is no dominant reli-
 gion, and no faith is officially favored. The Government permits the open practice
 of religion, and there are no restrictions on religious ceremonies or teaching. Never-
 theless, some Muslims feel that their religious or ethnic affiliation makes them tar-
 gets of discrimination by the Government with regard to employment and national
 identity documentation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Ivorian law provides for these rights, and the Government respects
 them in practice. While the Government does not generally restrict internal travel,
 uniformed police regularly extort small amounts of money or goods for contrived or
 minor infractions by motorists or passengers on public conveyances.
 Citizens normally may travel abroad and emigrate freely, and have the right of
 voluntary repatriation. There are no known cases of revocation of citizenship. How-
 ever, the Government sometimes restricts foreign travel for political reasons.
 Cote d'Ivoire's refugee and asylum practices are liberal. The Government respects
 the right to first asylum and does not deny recognition to refugees, either by law
 or custom. Currently, there are an estimated 300,000 refugees in the country who
 have fled the Liberian civil war. There were no reported cases of involuntary repa-
 triation.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in
 monitoring, organizing, and assisting in food distribution and health care.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Presidential and legislative elections were held in October and November. The
 major opposition parties boycotted the October 22 presidential election due to con-
 cerns about the Electoral Code's candidacy requirements and about voter registra-
 tion irregularities. In declared defiance of the national laws regarding law and
 order, the opposition called for active boycott of the polls during the presidential
 election. This action included blocking polling places from access by voters and pre-
 
 
 venting delivery of election materials to the polls. Only the ruling PDCI and a single
 small opposition party, the PIT, fielded presidential candidates. President Bedie
 won 96 percent of the votes cast.
 On November 6, the major political parties reached an accord which ensured full
 party participation in the November legislative elections. These elections were, how-
 ever, suspended in 3 of the 175 districts due to government concern over Bete-
 Baoule ethnic violence and voters displaced as a result of the active boycott. Election
 results from another three districts were declared invalid by the Constitutional
 Council. The Government has not yet announced when elections in these six dis-
 tricts will be held.
 Two US. nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), the National Democratic Insti-
 tute (NDI) and the African-American Institute (AAI), observed the legislative cam-
 paign and elections together with international and national observers. Overall,
 these observers said that the elections took place in a calm manner, that voters
 were knowledgeable about the choice of candidates, and that the presence of rep-
 resentatives of parties throughout the voting process served to increase public con-
 fidence. In their preliminary report, NDI and AAI also cited three problems: voters
 and party representatives complained about electoral list accuracy; there were prob-
 lems with the distribution of voter cards; and inconsistencies and delays in the im-
 plementation of the court-ordered system for newly registered voters reduced the op-
 portunity to vote by some eligible voters. The opposition parties also cited these
 problems.
 Although the Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their govern-
 ment peacefully through democratic means, the opposition complained that the Gov-
 ernment had used the December 1994 Electoral Code to place formidable obstacles
 in the path of political rivals. The Rassemblement des Republicains held that
 Alassane Ouattara, a leading opposition rival to Bedie, had been unfairly excluded
 from entering the presidential race due to the Code's parentage, residency, and citi-
 zenship requirements. The opposition also complained of faulty voter registration
 procedures and of unfair restrictions on demonstrations after the Government is-
 sued a 3-month ban on marches and sit-ins in September in an attempt to guaran-
 tee public order (see Section 2.b.).
 Nonetheless, the opposition complained of partisan elections preparation and con-
 tinued PDCI control of the media throughout the year. The Government created a
 number of new institutions charged with elections administration and oversight of
 media access. These include a constitutional council, local and national electoral
 commissions, and a national audiovisual council.
 Under a multiparty system adopted in 1990, elections are held every 5 years by
 secret ballot. All citizens over 21 years of age can vote, and political parties are le-
 gally free to organize.
 While there are no legal impediments to women assuming political leadership
 roles, only 14 of the 169 Deputies elected to the National Assembly in November
 are women. Women hold 3 of the 17 leadership positions in the Assembly. There
 are 3 women in the 30-member Presidential Cabinet named in January 1996, and
 two members of the Supreme Court are women. There are no impediments to the
 exercise of political rights by any one of the over 60 ethnic groups.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 LIDHO, formed in 1987 and recognized by the Government in July 1990, has ac-
 tively investigated alleged violations of human rights and issued press releases and
 reports, some critical of the Government. Other groups such as the International
 Movement of Democratic Women (MIFED) have held seminars and published press
 releases critical of government abuses of human rights.
 The Government has cooperated with international inquiries into its human
 rights practices. A representative of Article 19, a London-based press freedom group,
 visited in June and issued a report in September entitled, "Silencing the Media:
 Censorship and the Elections in Cote d'Ivoire." Article 19 has expressed concern
 that many provisions of Ivorian law restrict the right to freedom of expression.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, or religion is prohib-
 ited by law, but in practice women occupy a clearly subordinate role in society. In
 other respects, the Government enforces these provisions.
 Women.-Representatives of women's organizations state that wife beating-while
 not widespread--does occur and often leads to divorce. Doctors state that they rare-
 ly see the victims of such violence. A severe social stigma is attached to such vio-
 
 
 lence, and neighbors often intervene in a domestic quarrel to protect a woman who
 is the object of physical abuse. The courts and police view such domestic violence
 as a family problem, unless serious bodily harm is inflicted or the victim lodges a
 complaint, in which case they may initiate criminal proceedings. The Ivorian asso-
 ciation for the Defense of Women (AIDF) and MIFED have protested the indiffer-
 ence of authorities to female victims of violence and called attention to domestic vio-
 lence and female circumcision. The groups also reported that women who are the
 subject of rape or domestic violence are often ignored when they attempt to bring
 the violence to the attention of the police. The Government does not collect statistics
 on the rape or other physical abuse of women. The Government has no clearcut pol-
 icy regarding spouse abuse beyond the strictures against violence in the Civil Code.
 In rural areas, ethnic custom dictates that women perform most menial tasks, al-
 though farm work by men is also common. Government policy encourages full par-
 ticipation by women in social and economic life, but there is considerable informal
 resistance among employers in hiring women, whom they consider less dependable
 by virtue of potential pregnancy. Women are underrepresented in some professions
 and in the managerial sector as a whole. Women in the formal sector, however, are
 paid on an equal scale with men.
 Children.-The Ministries of Social Affairs and of Health and Social Protection
 seek to safeguard the welfare of children, and the Government has also encouraged
 the formation of NGO's such as the Abidjan Legal Center for the Defense of Chil-
 dren.
 Primary education is compulsory but this is not effectively enforced. Many chil-
 dren leave school after only a few years. There is a parental preference for educat-
 ing boys rather than girls, which is noticeable throughout the country but more pro-
 nounced in rural areas. According to a 1991 U.N. report, females in Cote d'Ivoire
 receive only one-third of the schooling of males. Sexual harassment of female stu-
 dents by male teachers is commonplace.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is illegal, but
 is practiced nevertheless, particularly among the rural population in the north and
 west. The procedure is usually performed on young girls or at puberty as part of
 a rite of passage; it is generally done outside modern medical facilities. The Govern-
 ment does not make strong efforts to prevent the practice, and traditional authori-
 ties continue to uphold it. According to an independent expert, as many as 35 per-
 cent of women have undergone FGM. The practice is becoming less common as the
 population becomes urbanized and better educated.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no laws mandating accessibility for the dis-
 abled. Laws do exist prohibiting the abandonment of the mentally or physically dis-
 abled, as well as enjoining acts of violence directed at them. Traditional practices,
 beliefs, and superstitions vary, but infanticide in cases of serious birth disabilities
 is less commonplace. Disabled adults are not the specific targets of abuse, but it is
 difficult for them to compete with able-bodied workers in the tight job market. The
 Government supports special schools, associations, and artisans' cooperatives for the
 disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides workers the right to form unions.
 For almost 30 years, the government-sponsored labor confederation, the General
 Union of Workers of Cote d'Ivoire (UGTCI), dominated most union activity. The
 UGTCrs hold on the labor movement loosened in 1991 when several formerly
 UGTCI-affiliated unions broke away and became independent. In 1992 11 formerly
 independent unions joined together to form the Federation of Autonomous Trade
 Unions of Cote d'Ivoire. Unions are free to join these and other groups and inter-
 national bodies. Registration of a new union requires 3 months under the law.
 The right to strike is provided by the Constitution and by statute. The Labor Code
 requires a protracted series of negotiations and a 6-day notification period before a
 strike may take place, effectively making legal strikes difficult to organize. The
 UGTCI seldom calls strikes. Non-UGTCI unions frequently called strikes in the
 past. In March, Abidjan bank and insurance employees went on strike to protest the
 mandatory radio and television tax, to demand improved social security and unem-
 ployment benefits, and to demand salary increases. The Government did not meet
 these demands; the workers returned to their jobs after a month.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code grants all
 citizens the right to join unions an to bargain collectively. Collective bargaining
 agreements are in effect in many major business enterprises and sectors of the civil
 service. In most cases in which wages are not established in direct negotiations be-
 tween unions and employers, salaries are set by job categories by the Ministry of
 
 
 Employment and Civil Service. Labor inspectors have the responsibility to enforce
 a law which prohibits antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There were no reports of forced
 labor, which is prohibited by law. However, the International Labor Organization's
 Committee of Exports in its 1993 annual report questioned a decree that places cer-
 tain categories of prisoners at the disposal of private enterprises for work assign-
 ments without their apparent consent. There has been no change in this decree.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-In most instances, the legal mini-
 mum working age is 16 years, and the Ministry of Employment and Civil Service
 enforces this provision effectively in the civil service and in large multinational com-
 panies. Labor law limits the hours of young workers, defined as those under the age
 of 18. However, children often work on family farms, and some children routinely
 act as vendors in the informal sector in cities. There are reliable reports of some
 use of child labor in informal sector mining and also of children working in "sweat-
 shop" conditions in small workshops. Many children leave the formal school system
 at an early age; primary education is mandatory but far from universally enforced,
 particularly in rural areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government administratively determines
 monthly minimum wage rates, which were last adjusted following devaluation of the
 franc in January 1994. A slightly higher minimum wage rate applies for construc-
 tion workers. The Government enforces the minimum wage rates only for salaried
 workers employed by the Government or registered with the social security office.
 Minimum wages vary according to occupation, with the lowest set at approximately
 $71.49 (cfa 36,607) per month, which is insufficient to provide a decent standard of
 living for a worker and family. The majority of the labor force works in agriculture
 or in the informal sector where the minimum wage does not apply.
 Through the Ministry of Employment and the Civil Service, the Government en-
 forces a comprehensive Labor Code governing the terms and conditions of service
 for wage earners and salaried workers and providing for occupational safety and
 health standards. Those employed in the formal sector are reasonably protected
 against unjust compensation, excessive hours, and arbitrary discharge from employ-
 ment. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. The law requires overtime payment
 on a graduated scale for additional hours. The Labor Code provides for at least one

 Government labor inspectors can order employers to improve substandard condi-
 tions, and a labor court can levy fines if the employer fails to comply. In the large
 informal sector of the economy, however, involving both urban and rural workers,
 the Government's occupational health and safety regulations are enforced erratically
 at best. Workers in the formal sector have the right, under the Labor Code, to re-
 move themselves from dangerous work without jeopardy to continued employment
 by utilizing the Ministry of Labor inspection system to document dangerous working
 conditions. However, workers in the informal sector cannot ordinarily remove them-
 selves from such labor without losing their employment.
