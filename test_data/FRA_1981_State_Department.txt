 FRANCE
 
 France is a constitutional democracy in which the
 government's authority is balanced between executive
 and legislative branches. The French political
 system is based on the thesis that the plurality of
 power provides the checks and balances essential to
 ensure that the rights of individuals stand higher
 than the claims of the state. France has an
 established tradition of respect for human rights and
 of their promotion at home and abroad. The French
 Government and people fully support this element of
 national tradition and policy. The French Government
 administers a generous social welfare system designed
 to protect economic and social rights. As evidence
 of its democratic practice, France elected a new
 president and a new national assembly that turned out
 the old governing majority and installed the
 Socialist Party in power.
 A sizeable number of refugees from Southeast Asia has
 been accepted by France, and in June 1981 the new
 government announced an increase in the number of
 these refugees to be resettled in France each month.
 As for other areas, France quietly offers refuge to
 political exiles from many countries around the world.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Includ-
 ing Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by article 303 of
 the Penal Code and respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. The death penalty was abolished in
 September 1981. Prison conditions are adequate and
 physical plant facilities generally are well
 maintained. Reimbursed work programs are widely
 available to inmates, the parole system is liberal,
 and the possibility of periodic release for family
 visits is available. No reports have been received
 of ill treatment of prisoners.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no allegations of abduction or secret
 arrest by security forces.
 d. Arbitary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is
 guaranteed by French law and respected in practice.
 There is no direct equivalent of habeas corpus in the
 French legal system. There are legal limits to the
 
 (768)
 
 
 769
 length of time a suspect can be held by police before
 being transferred to a magistrate for investigation.
 Normally the limit is 24 hours, although a magistrate
 can extend the period to 48 hours. In narcotics
 cases the period is four days. With the abolition of
 the state security court in August 1981, there is no
 longer provision for six-day police custody for
 national security offenses.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right of fair public trial is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice. Suspects have the right
 to legal counsel as soon as a case is transferred
 from the police to a magistrate. Pretrial confine-
 ment in the magistrate phase is limited to four
 months for misdemeanors (law of 17 July 1970) but can
 be longer in cases of felony. French law provides
 for the right of appeal.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by
 law and respected in practice. Search warrants are
 required, and searches cannot take place between 9
 p.m. and 6 a.m. In special cases, however, such as
 drug offenses, searches may be undertaken at any time.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, In-
 cluding:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Radio and television are government-
 operated. Newspapers display a wide range of opinion
 and do not hesitate to criticize the government.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is freedom of internal movement, foreign travel
 and emigration. Arriving refugees have these rights.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Participation in democratic processes is fully
 respected. The rights of women and minorities are
 guaranteed by law. A cabinet level official is
 charged with responsibility for women's affairs.
 Women are expanding their participation in the
 national life of France as ideas about the broader
 role of women gain greater acceptance in the
 society. Labor practices entail full respect for the
 right to organize, to strike and to bargain collec-
 tively.

 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 France has traditionally been a leader in the field
 of human rights and this theme is receiving partic-
 ular emphasis under the new government elected in May
 1981. Amnesty International maintains a major office
 in Paris. The French Government participates ac-
 tively in international and regional human rights
 bodies. France ratified, with a few reservations,
 article 25 of the European Convention on Human
 Rights, accepting the competence of the European
 Court of Human Rights to receive petitions from
 private individuals in September 1981.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 French GNP per capita is $9,950 (US dollars 1979).
 Life expectancy at birth is 74, the infant mortality
 rate is 11 per 1,000 live births, the population
 *growth rate is 0.6 (average 1970-79), and the
 fertility rate 1.9 (1979). Adult literacy is 99
 percent (1979), and the adjusted primary school
 enrollment ratio is 112 (male 113, female 111).
