 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy.
 The two major political parties, the Jamaica Labour
 Party (JLP) and the People's National Party (PNP),
 have alternated in power since the first election.
 in 1944. Edward Seaga, leader of the JLP, became
 Prime Minister after his party won the general elections
 in October 1980. Many Jamaicans were killed during
 the long, violent election campaign.
 Although most of the media are government-owned, and
 under former Prime Minister Manley's government were
 highly supportive of the government, the one privately-
 owned paper contributes to the maintenance of a free
 press.
 Jamaica's legal system is based on English common
 law and an independent judiciary. The constitution
 provides for an independent director of public prosecu-
 tions to pursue criminal cases and for independent
 conmissions to oversee or inquire into various sectors
 of public life when allegations of official misconduct
 arise.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the constitution and not
 practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Legal prohibitions against cruel, inhuman and degrading
 treatment or punishment are respected. Access to
 detainees by relatives, attorneys, and friends is
 routine. Prison conditions are austere.
 There have been occasional claims of beatings of-suspects
 by police--especially during the highly charged election
 campaign when the security forces actively attempted
 to control violence. These instances were unusual.
 Officials committing such acts are liable for punishment
 if the charges are substantiated. During the heated
 1980 election campaign charges of-physical abuse by
 members of the security forces, while engaged in controlling
 politically-motivated violence, were made by some
 Jamaicans and zpublicized by the pro-government media
 and the PNP. Of the 57 complaints made against individual
 soldiers-of the Jamaica Defense Force (JDF), 28 have
 been investigated and 29 were still under investigation
 as of late November. No-court .cases have resulted
 from the allegations. The high level of violence
 marking the 1980 election campaign was attributed
 to excesses of members of the polftical parties and
 not to government policy.
 c. Disappearances
 There -is no evidence that people.have been subjected
 to secret-arrests, abductions or clandestine detention
 
 
 474
 by any official groups. Habeas corpus is guaranteed
 by the constitution and respected by the courts and
 police.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners. Arbitrary detention
 without trial does not occur. A gun court established
 in 1974 considers cases involving the illegal use
 or possession of firearms or ammunition. After arraign-
 ment, the gun court has allowed some pre-trial deten-
 tions lasting several months and convictions carry
 a mandatory life sentence.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In regular courts, accused persons receive a fair
 public trial in accordance with constitutional and
 legal guarantees and standards. Restrictions on public
 attendance and less stringent rules of evidence apply
 in the gun court, where cases are conducted before
 a judge--except in murder cases when the trial is
 heard by a jury.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Jamaican law requires judicial warrants before entry,
 except during those times when the "suppression of
 crime act' is in force. The act is currently in force
 until June 1981 when it could be further extended
 at the initiative of the government. Although no
 warrant for search is required under this act, regula-
 tions approved by parliament in 1980 require that
 every effort be made by the security forces to have
 the owner or occcupier of the premises present during
 the search. There are no substantiated reports of
 serious abuses of the right to the sanctity of the
 home.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Jamaica is nearly
 US$1, 100 per capita. Real GDP declined three percent
 in 1980 and inflation reached nearly 35 percent for
 the year, continuing the substantial decline in workers'
 incomes in real terms. Chronic foreign exchange deficits
 -- generated by rising oil import bills, mounting
 debt service, and inadequate export performance -
 have hampered performance in the import dependent
 manufacturing sector in particular, as well as in
 the agricultural sector. The lack of key imports
 in these sectors has been a significant factor in
 Jamaica's rising unemployment rate, which was officially
 estimated at 30 percent in March 1980. Despite these
 negative trends, the important foreign exchange-earning
 bauxite and tourism sectors showed improvement in
 the first half of 1980, although further gains in
 tourism are not being experienced in the second half
 
 
 475
 of the year due to widely publicized political violence
 associated with the October 1980 Jamaican national
 election.
 Like its predecessor, the Seaga government is committed
 to social programs and plans to devote a sizeable
 part of the national budget for these ends. Revamping
 of the country's health service program is one of
 the new government's immediate priorities. The quality
 of medical care has suffered from increased migration
 of physicians, which has reduced the doctor per person
 ratio to one for 3,510. Foreign exchange shortages
 prevent the importation of drugs and equipment, and
 has made it necessary for the government to reduce
 food imports. Although food production for local
 consumption has improved significantly in recent years,
 vital staples such aa flour, protein (especially chicken)
 and rice must be largely imported. Imports of these
 staples are limited to month-to-month contingencies.
 Jamaica's economic slide and budgetary constraints
 have made it necessary to scale-down the government's
 land-lease program whereby the government has attempted
 to expand access by the poor to land. In Jamaica's
 fiscal year '81 (beginning April 1, 1980, ending March
 31, 1981) the government plans to include 10,000 additional
 acres in the program, a 50 per cent cut from the year
 before. The total land under the program is approximately
 60,000 acres. Government housing programs also have
 been pared, causing special housing problems in the
 overcrowded ingston metropolitan area, which encompasses
 over 30.percent of the country's population. Due
 to budgetary difficulties, the Ministry of Construction
 will contribute only approximately $US 8.3 million
 to the housing fund in Jamaica fiscal year '81 a significant
 drop from previous years.
 Jamaica's educational system is free, but families
 are experiencing difficulties in meeting rising costs
 of uniforms and books. The adult literacy rate is
 given officially at 86 percent, while 98 percent of
 primary-age children are enrolled in government schools.
 Women are assured equal rights under the law, and
 constituted 39.5 percent of the work force in October,
 1978 (the date of the last available survey).
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly are
 guaranteed in the constitution and observed in practice.
 There is no official censorship of the media, books
 or art, nor is there any interference in academic
 studies. Jamaica's principal independently-owned
 newspaper, the Daily Gleaner, was highly critical
 of the previous government and has already put the
 new government on notice that it will continue its
 role of independent critic.
 The electronic media are government-owned. Under
 former Prime Minister Manley they followed a pro-
 government editorial policy, except for the smaller
 of the two radio stations which maintained a politically
 neutral stance. The new Seaga government has indicated
 
 
 476
 its intention to improve the independence of the publi-
 cly-owned media from political influences. The previous
 government denied applications to open independent
 radio and television stations.
 Public demonstrations and rallies are integral to
 Jamaican politics and frequently are staged by the
 major parties without government interference. During
 the recent electoral campaign, supporters of the parties
 clashed in connection with the public meetings.
 Jamaica has a strong organized labor movement which
 contributes many leaders to the political process.
 The two major unions, the Bustamante Industrial Trade
 Union and the National Workers Union, are aligned
 with the two major political parties, but operate
 as independent organizations which differ at times
 with both political movements. Unions participate
 extensively in labor-related policy decisions and
 make active use of the bargaining rights described
 in the labor relations and industrial disputes act
 of 1975. Jamaican workers, including government wor-
 kers, have the right to strike. A large variety of
 professional groups exist and are free from official
 harrassment. Many different churches and religious
 sects operate freely; membership confers neither advan-
 tage nor disadvantage.
 b: Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The constitution guarantees freedom of movement.
 There are no restrictions on foreign travel or emigra-
 tion, despite the loss of critical skills this has
 caused. The right of voluntary repatriation is respec-
 ted. The declining economic situation has had some
 impact on travel since the scarcity of foreign exchange
 inhibits visits abroad and refugees have not been
 attracted to Jamaica. In two incidents in 1980, groups
 of Haitian refugees attempting to get to the United
 States accidentally landed in Jamaica. All preferred
 to return to Haiti rather than remain in Jamaica.
 There is no evidence of discriminatory treatment of
 travellers based on nationality, race or sex.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All citizens eighteen years of age and over are eligible
 to vote and no group is denied the right to participate
 in political activity. The electoral commission,
 created in 1979, was actively involved in the preparations
 for the 1980 elections and implemented a number of
 procedural changes to protect the integrity of the
 electoral process. While there were some charges
 of impropriety in the election, these were recognized
 to be beyond the control of the electoral commission.
 Despite extensive violence during the election campaign,
 an impressive 86 percent of registered voters turned
 out at the polls. Women have equality with men under
 law, but in practice they suffer economic discrimination-
 -particularly lower pay and more difficult access
 to some jobs. The two previous governments changed
 Jamaican law to legitimize children born out of wedlock.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 
 
 477
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Jamaica has ratified the American convention on human
 rights. Former Prime Minister Manley invited Amnesty
 International to investigate allegations of violations
 of human rights at any time. Amnesty International
 replied that it saw no need for such a mission. There
 has been little interest by international or non-govern-
 mental groups in investigating human rights in Jamaica.
