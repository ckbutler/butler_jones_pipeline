 VIETNAM
 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) is a one-party state controlled by the Vi-
 etnamese Communist Party (VCP). The VCPs constitutionally mandated leading
 role and the occupancy of nearly all senior government positions by party officials
 ensures the primacy of Politburo guidelines. The National Assembly, chosen in elec-
 tions in which all candidates are approved by the party, remains largely subservient
 to the VCP, as does the judiciary. An effort is underway to reduce party intrusion
 into government operations, and government officials have more latitude in imple-
 menting policies. The Government continued to restrict significantly civil liberties
 on national security grounds.
 The military is responsible for external defense and has no direct role in main-
 taining internal security. The Ministry of Interior is responsible for internal secu-
 rity. In addition to employing a large border defense force, the Ministry controls the
 police, a special national security investigation agency, and other units that main-
 tain internal security. Acting under the control of the party and the Government,
 the Ministry enforces laws and regulations that significantly restrict individual lib-
 erties and violate other human rights. The regime uses the Ministry of Interior as
 well as a system of household registrations and block wardens to monitor the popu-
 lation, concentrating on those suspected of engaging, or being likely to engage, in
 unauthorized political activities. Some members of the security forces have commit-
 ted human rights abuses.
 Vietnam is a very poor country undergoing a transition from a centrally planned
 to a more market-oriented economy. Agriculture, primarily rice cultivation, employs
 two-thirds of the work force and accounts for one-third of gross domestic product
 (GDP). As a result of reforms, the country has witnessed rapid growth in many in-
 dustries, including construction, petroleum, textiles, and light manufacturing. Ex-
 ports, led by crude oil, rice, marine products, textiles and foodstuffs, have increased
 sharply. Estimated GDP per capita income remains little more than $200 annually.
 Particularly in urban areas, economic reforms have raised the standard of living and
 reduced party and government control over people's daily lives.
 The Government s human rights record continued to be poor, and it continued to
 repress basic political and some religious freedoms and to commit numerous abuses.
 It denied citizens the right to change their government and significantly restricted
 freedom of speech, the press assembly, association, privacy, and religion. It arbi-
 trarily detained people, including for peacefully expressing political and religious ob-
 jections to government policies, and sometimes denied citizens the right to a fair
 and expeditious trial. The Government continued its longstanding policy of not toler-
 ating most types of public dissent and of prohibiting independent religious, political,
 andlabor organizations. There were credible reports that security officials beat de-
 tainees. Prison conditions remained poor. Societal discrimination and violence
 against women remained problems. Within still-narrow parameters, the National
 Assembly and the press engaged in increasingly vigorous debate on legal, economic,
 and social issues, and there was continued progress in building a legal infrastruc-
 ture. The National Assembly passed a civil code in October and passed a law to es-
 
 
 740
 tablish an administrative court system to deal with complaints about abuse and cor-
 ruption by state officials. The trend toward reduced government interference in peo-
 ple's daily lives continued, as did the trend toward greater freedom to engage in eco-
 nomic activity. People were allowed slightly greater freedom of expression and as-
 sembly, but there were intermittent restrictions on the practice of religion.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Raling.-There were no known politically mo-
 tivated extrajudicial killings. Following a highly publicized trial and conviction by
 the Supreme People's Court, a Hanoi policeman was executed for the murder and
 robbery of a Vietnamese citizen. Little information is available on the extent of
 deaths in police custody or on official investigations into such incidents.
 b. Disapearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law rohibits physical abuse. However, there were credible reports that security
 officials Iave beaten detainees and used threats and other psychological coercion to
 elicit confessions. There were no known reports of torture of detainees. Little infor-
 mation is available on the extent of police brutality during interrogations.
 Prison conditions are poor, but they do not generally threaten the lives of pris-
 oners. Overerowding, insufficient diet, and poor sanitation remain serious problems.
 Conditions in pretrial detention are particularly harsh, and there were credible re-
 ports that detainees were sometimes denied access to sunlight, exercise, and reading
 material. Most prisoners have access to basic health care and, for those with money,
 to supplemental food. However, there were credible reports that some political pris-
 oners were denied visitation rights and that some prisons employ the use of forced
 labor. Prisoners doing hard labor complained that the diet and health care were in-
 sufficient to sustain their health, especially when they were detained in remote, dis-
 ease-ridden areas.
 Several political prisoners with serious medical conditions are being held in harsh
 conditions in remote prisons with little access to medical care. For example, Dr.
 Doan Viet Hoat (see Section i.e.) continued to serve a 15-year sentence at the
 Thanh Cam Camp, in a remote and malaria-ridden area of Thanh Hoa Province. His
 location has made it difficult for his family to provide medicine for his kidney dis-
 order. Similarly, Do Van Thac, imprisoned for 14 years for attempting to overthrow
 the Government, remain imprisoned in remote Nam Ha Province despite having suf-
 fered a stroke and suffering from heart disease. Dr. Nguyen Dan Que has been held
 in isolation at Xuan Loc Prison for nearly 2 years.
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of its prison and deten-
 tion system, although it did allow an Australian parliamentary delegation to visit
 one prison in 1995. The United Nations Working Group on Human Rights visited
 several prisons in October 1994.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.The Government continued to arrest and
 imprison people arbitrarily. Although the 1990 Criminal Procedure Code provides
 for various rights for detainees, including time limits on pretrial detention and the
 right of the accused to have a lawyer present during interrogation, in practice the
 authorities often ignore these legal safeguards.
 Law enforcement officials appear able to arrest and incarcerate people without
 presenting arrest warrants. In cases where a warrant is presented, the procurator
 rather than an independent judiciary approves issuance of warrants. Once arrested,
 detainees often are held for enghy periods without formal charges or trial. For ex-
 ample, two Americans, Nguyen Tan Tri and Tran Quang Liem, arrested in Novem-
 ber 1993 along with seven others for trying to organize a democracy conference in
 Ho Chi Minh City, were held for 21 months before finally being brought to trial in
 August; the two were released in November (see Section i.e.).
 Those arrested for peaceful expression of their views are likely to be charged
 under any one of several provisions in the Criminal Code outlawing acts against the
 State. Several Buddhists who were arrested in November 1994 for organizing an un-
 authorized flood relief mission in 1994 were held for 9 months before being tried
 in August (see Section i.e. and 2.c.) for "sabotaging solidarity."
 No official statistics are available on the percentage of the prison population made
 up by pretrial detainees or the average period of time such detainees have been
 held. Similarly, it is difficult to determine the exact number of political detainees
 in part because the Government often does not publicize arrests and frequently con-
 ducts secret detentions, trials, and sentencing.
 The Government does not use external exile as a means of political control but
 has employed internal exile to restrict the movement of certain political or religious
 
 
 741
 dissidents. For example, credible reports indicate that the leader of the United Bud-
 dhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), Thich Huyen Quang, was involuntarily moved
 from his pagoda to a more remote area of Quang Ngai Province.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-While the Constitution provides for the independ-
 ence of judges and jurors, in practice the VCP controls the courts closely at all lev-
 els, selecting judges primarily for political reliability. Reliable reports indicate that
 party officials, including top leaders, instruct courts how to rule on politically impor-
 tant cases. The President appoints judges.
 The Vietnamese court system consists of local people's courts, military tribunals,
 and the Supreme People's Court. The Supreme People's Court can review cases from
 the lower courts or tribunals. In addition, local mass organizations are empowered
 to deal with minor breaches of law or disputes, and the National Assembly in late
 1993 approved the establishment of economic courts to handle commercial-disputes.
 In its October-November session, the National Assembly passed a new 834-article
 civil code due to go into effect in mid-July 1996. The National Assembly also passed
 a law to establish a system of administrative courts to deal with complaints by citi-
 zens about official abuse and corruption.
 The People's Procuracy has unchecked power to bring charges against the accused
 and serves as prosecutor during trials. A two-person judging council, made up of a
 judge and one or more people's jurors (lay judges), determines guilt or innocence and
 also passes sentence on the convicted. The relevant people's council appoints peo-
 ple's jurors, who are to be people of high moral standards but who are not required
 to have legal training.
 Trials are generally open to the public, although judicial authorities sometimes
 closed trials or strict y limited attendance in sensitive cases. Defendants have the
 right to be present at their trial, and to have a lawyer and the defendant or his
 lawyer has the right to cross-examine witnesses. In political cases, there are credible
 reports that defendants were not allowed access to government evidence in advance
 of the trial. Little information is available on the extent to which defendants and
 their lawyers have time to prepare for trials. Those convicted have the right to ap-
 peal. Although Vietnam has made some progress in developing a legal system, many
 judges and other court officials lack adequate legal training. However, government
 efforts to develop a fair, effective judicial system were undermined by the lack of
 openness in the judicial process and the continuing subservience of the judiciary to
 the party.
 The Government continued to hold a number of political prisoners incarcerated for
 the peaceful expression of dissenting religious or political views. For example, Doan
 Viet Hoat is servinT a 15-year sentence or ublishing a reformist newsletter. Oth-
 ers arrested with him, including Pham Duc Kham, Nguyen Van Thuan, and Le Duc
 Vuong, are also serving lengthy prison sentences. Human rights activist Nguyen
 Dan Que, sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment in 1991 for publicly supporting politi-
 cal reform and respect for human rights remains in isolation in prison despite being
 in poor health. In August a Ho Chi _inh City court convicted nine people, including
 the group's leader, Nguyen Dinh Huy, and two Americans, Nguyen Tan Tri and
 Tran Quang Liem, for trying to organize a democracy conference in Ho Chi Minh
 City and sentenced them to lengthy prison terms. Following diplomatic appeals, in
 November the SRV released Tri and Liem from prison and expelled them from Viet-
 nam.
 The authorities arrested Hoang Minh Chinh and Do Trung Hieu for "antisocialist
 propaganda," apparently for writings that urged the party to admit past mistakes
 and move toward national reconciliation (see Section 2.a.). Chinh and Hieu were
 later convicted of "abusing democratic privileges."
 Vietnamese exile groups have claimed there are as many as 1,000 political pris-
 oners in the country; other reliable sources put the figure closer to 200. The Govern-
 ment continued to release prisoners as part of regular amnesties to commemorate
 important national holidays. Approximately 3,300 prisoners were released in amnes-
 ties in April, September, and December. Buddhist monk Thich Hai Chanh, who had
 been imprisoned for participating in unrest in Hue in May 1993, apparently was the
 only political prisoner released.
 f. Arbitrary interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government continued to operate a nationwide system of surveillance and control
 through household registration and block wardens who use informants to keep track
 of individual activities. However, many foreign observers believe this monitoring
 was done with less vigor and efficiency than m the past as authorities focused on
 those suspected of involvement in unauthorized political or religious activities. Anec-
 dotal evidence suggests government monitoring is stricter in the south, especially
 Ho Chi Minh City. in urban areas, most citizens were free to maintain contact and
 
 
 742
 work with foreigners, although many remained nervous about extensive social con-
 tacts.
 The Government continued to censor mail, confiscate packages, and monitor tele-
 phone, electronic mail, and fax transmissions. In the past, the arty pressed people
 to belong to one or more mass organizations, which exist for villages, city districts,
 schools, workers (trade unions), youth, and women. However, with the growth of the
 private sector, those organizations play a less important societal role. While mem-
 bership in the VCP remains an aid to advancement in the Government or in state
 omnpanies and is vital for promotion to senior levels of the Government, the party
 faced increased difficulty attracting new members.
 The Government continued to implement a family planning policy that urges all
 families to have no more than two children. In principle, the Government can deny
 promotions and salary increases to government and party employees with more than
 two children. In practice, the penalty is not applied to employees in good standing.
 For others, there are no penalties for those with more than two children, but local
 regulations permit fines based on the cost of extra social services incurred by the
 extra child, or reductions in state subsidies for those services. These penalties are
 not uniformly or universally applied.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, but in practice the Government severely limits these freedoms.
 Both the Constitution and the Criminal Code include broad national security and
 antidefamation provisions that the Government uses to strictly limit such freedoms.
 The party and Government tolerated public discussion and even criticism somewhat
 more than in the past. For example, Vietnamese citizens could and did complain
 openly about bureaucratic lethargy, administrative procedures, corruption, and even
 economic policy. However, the Government continued to clamp down on free speech
 that ventured outside narrow limits to question the role of the party, criticize indi-
 vidual SRV leaders, promote multiparty democracy, or question the regime's policies
 on sensitive matters such as human rights. In June the authorities arrested VCP
 members Hoang Minh Chinh and Do Trung Hieu, and on November 8, tried, con-
 victed, and sentenced them to 12 months' imprisonment for "abusing democratic
 privileges" (see Section i.e.). There continued to be an ambiguous line between what
 constituted private speech about sensitive matters, which would be tolerated, and
 public speech in those areas which would not. Late in the year, the authorities ar-
 rested two more dissidents, iguyen Xuan Tu (aka Ha Si Phu) for criticizing the re-.
 gime and Le Hong Ha for involvement with efforts to convince the party to address
 past mistakes.
 The party, Government, and party-controlled mass organizations control all print
 and electronic media. Pervasive party guidance and national security legislation re-
 mained sufficiently broad to ensure effective self-censorship in the domestic media.
 In 1995 the Government closed two newspapers temporarily for questioning policy
 too bluntly, and senior party and government leaders made several speeches re-
 minding the press that it should support the party.
 The Government also approved a number of new newspapers for publication. With
 apparent party approval, several newspapers engaged in investigative reporting on
 corruption and mismanagement as wellas in open and sometimes heated debate on
 economic policy. The Government made no effort to limit access to international
 radio or television, which many Vietnamese listen to regularly, or to foreign lan-
 guage periodicals, which are widely available in the cities. The Government has not
 allowed citizens free access to the Internet, citing concerns for national security and
 cultural preservation.
 Foreign journalists must be approved by the Foreign Ministry's Press Center and
 must be based in Hanoi, and the number of foreign staff allowed each foreign press
 organization is limited. The Center monitors journalists' activities and decides on
 a case by case basis whether to approve their interview and travel requests. A For-
 eign Ministry official accompanies foreign journalists during all interviews. The
 Government censors television footage and delays export of footage by several days.
 A general trend toward increased information flow appeared to extend into the
 university system. Foreign academics working temporarily at Vietnamese univer-
 sities said they were able to discuss nonpolitical issues widely and freely in the
 classroom, but government monitors regularly attend classes taught by foreigners,
 without official notification to the teachers. Vietnamese academic publications usu-
 ally reflect the views of the party and the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right of assembly is re-
 stricted in law and practice. People wishing to gather in a group are required to
 apply for a permit, which local authorities can issue or deny arbitrarily. However,
 
 
 743
 ple routinely gathered in informal groups without government interference. The
 Gvernment generally does not permit demonstrations that could be seen as having
 a political purpose, but was more tolerant than in the past of occasional popular
 demonstrations about specific grievances against local officials. With a few excep-
 tions, the Government prohibits the establishment of private, independent organiza-
 tions, insisting that individuals work within established, party-controlled organiza-
 tions. Citizens may not establish independent political parties, religious organiza-
 tions, labor unions, or business compames, or veterans organizations.
 c. Freedom of Reliion.-The Constitution and government decrees provide for
 freedom of worship, but the regime continued to restrict severely religious activities
 it defined as at variance with state laws and policies. The Government generally
 allowed people to practice the religion of their choice, and participation in religious
 activities throug.out Vietnam continued to increase. However, the Government also
 maintained policies designed to control religious hierarchies and organized religious
 activities, in part because the Government perceives that organized religion may un-
 dermine the party's monopoly of influence. An American clergyman was detained
 and then expelled in February after meeting with Vietnamese citizens. Two other
 Americans were expelled after attending a meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses.
 Religious organizations must obtain government permission to hold training semi-
 nars and conventions, to build or remodel places of worship, to engage in charitable
 activities or operate religious schools, and to ordain, promote, or transfer clergy. All
 religious groups continued to face difficulty in obtainng teaching materials, expand-
 ing training facilities, and publishing religious materials.
 The Government requires all Budist monks to work under the party-controlled
 Buddhist organizations umbrella. The Government has continued actively to sup-
 press efforts by the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) to operate inde-
 pendently. The tension between the Government and the UBCV, which resurfaced
 in 1992 and increased in 1993-94, continued in 1995. The Government arrested
 Buddhists who have pushed for an independent organization and has harshly criti-
 cized the UBCV in a series of speeches and publications, calling it a tool of reaction-
 ary exiles. Despite SRV claims to the contrary, credible reports indicate that the
 UBCV's leader, the Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, remains under house arrest or
 other confinement in a remote area of Quang Ngai Province. Following a 1-day trial,
 five other Buddhists, including UBCV Secretary General Thich Quang Do, were
 tried, convicted and sentenced to prison in August for "sabotaging solidarity" by or-
 ganizing an unauthorized flood relief mission. The appeals of the three Buddhists
 were rejected by a Ho Chi Minh City court in October. In December the official
 press announcedthat the Government Commission on Religious Affairs had rejected
 an appeal by a small Buddhist sect-the Doan Phu Tho 18 group-and declared its
 activities illegal.
 The Government has sought to control the Catholic Church hierarchy, in part by
 requiring all clergy to belong to the government-controlled Catholic Patriotic Asso-
 ciation. it has also insisted on its right to a prove Vatican appointments. Vietnam
 allowed the appointment of some high level clerical positions that had not been
 filled for years, most notably the appointment of Cardinal Pham  Dinh Tung. How-
 ever, the Vatican remained frustrated with the Government's restrictions on the
 Church, particularly after the Government rejected four Vatican nominations, in-
 cluding its candidate for Archbishop Adjudicator of Ho Chi Minh City. The delay
 in filling the latter position prompted unusual public criticism from Ho Chi Minh
 City Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh, whose death in July left another key church po-
 sition vacant.
 A March 1994 decree allowed bishops and priests to travel freely within their dio-
 ceses, but the Government continued to restrict their travel outside these areas. In
 1995 the Church opened five training seminaries, with 120 to 150 students. How-
 ever, all students must be approved by the Government, both upon entering the
 seminary and prior to ordination as priests. The number of students permitted by
 the Government to study at the seminaries increased in 1995, but it was insufficient
 to support the growing Catholic population, estimated unofficially at 2 million.
 The Christian Missionary Alliance of Vietnam, the only government-approved
 Protestant organization in the country, enjoyed slightly greater freedom to operate.
 Church attendance grew despite continued government restrictions on proselytizing
 activities. Nongovernment organizations (NGO's) reported continued arrests and
 government harassment of some ethnic Hmong Protestants for proselytizing in
 northern Vietnamese villages.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Most citizens enjoyed greater freedom of movement within the country,
 and the Government dropped the requirement for permits for interprovincial travel.
 However, there were credible reports that local authorities required members of eth-
 
 
 nic minority groups to obtain permission to travel outside of certain highland areas.
 Officially, citizens must obtain permission to change their residence, but in practice
 many people continued to move without approval. Foreigners are generally free to
 travel throughout the country. Although the Government retains the right to ap-
 prove travel to border areas, to some areas in the central highlands, and to some
 islands, in practice, foreigners can easily travel to most border areas without ap-
 proval. Some foreigners were deported for involvement in unauthorized activities
 (see Section 2.c.).
 The Government still requires citizens traveling abroad, including government of-
 ficials, to obtain exit and reentry visas, but is more willing to grant those visas than
 in the past. Both law and regulation provide the right of a  citizens to obtain an
 exit permit with the exception of members of Vietnam's small Muslim community
 .seeking to make the hal, political activists, ertain Buddhist clerics, the mentally
 ill, or those serving prison sentences, under criminal investigation, holding state se-
 cret, suffering serious health problems, involved in tax or real estate disputes, or
 where sponsors are engaged in anti-SRV activities abroad. The Government main-
 tains the right to reject exit visa applications in these categories.
 The Government continued to permit emigtion for some categories of Vietnam-
 ese. T!e U.S. Orderly Departure Program (ODP) continued to resettle immigrant
 and refugee beneficiaries in the United States, including Amrasians, former reedu-
 cation camp detainees, and family unification cases, at the rate of about 4,000 per-
 sons per month. Other nations operate smaller resettlement programs for Vietnam-
 ese nationals. There are some concerns that members of minority ethnic groups,
 particularly highland peoples, such as the Montagnards, may not have ready access
 to these programs. Former political prisoner Nguyen Chi Thien emigrated to the
 United States under the ODP in October.
 The Government generally permits Vietnamese who emigrate to return to visit,
 but it considers them Vietnamese citizens and therefore subject to the obligations
 of a Vietnamese national under the law even if they have adopted another country's
 citizenship. However, Vietnamese who have emigrated are not able to obtain Viet-
 namese passports. Because it regards overseas Vietnamese both as a valuable poten-
 tial source of foreign exchange and expertise and as a potential security threat, the
 Government generally encourages them to visit Vietnam but monitors them care-
 fully.
 In 1988 Vietnam signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Na-
 tions High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to increase acceptance of voluntary
 repatriates, provided there was financial assistance. The agreement included a com-
 mitment by Vietnam to waive prosecution and punitive measures for illegal depar-
 ture from Vietnam of persons who return under the UNHCR Voluntary Repatriation
 Program. Vietnam also agreed to permit the UNHCR to monitor the returnees
 through direct visits. More than 72,000 Vietnamese have returned voluntarily. The
 UNHCR, which extensively monitors those who have repatriated voluntarily, reports
 that they do not face retribution or discrimination. There was no credible evidence
 to substantiate claims that refugees returning under UNHOR auspices were har-
 assed because of their status as returnees.
 Although a source of refugees itself in the past, Vietnam also has been the coun-
 try of first asylum for some refugees, particularly from Cambodia. The Government
 cooperates with the UNHCR anc[other humanitarian organizations in assisting  ref-
 ugees. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to
 refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are not free to change their government. All authority and political power
 is vested in the VCP; political oppsition and other political parties are not toler-
 ated. The VCP Central Committee is the supreme deisionmaing body in the na-
 tion, and the Politburo is the locus of policymaking. The Secretariat of the Central
 Committee oversees day-to-day implementation of leadership directives. Debate and
 criticism are limited to certain aspects of individual, state, or party performance de-
 termined by the VCP itself. No public challenge to the legitimacy of the one-party
 state or even debate on the subject is permitted (see Section 2.a.).
 Citizens elect the members of the National Assembly, ostensibly the main legisla-
 tive body, but the party approves all candidates. During the October-November ses-
 sion the National Assembly engaged in increasingly vigorous debate on economic,
 legal, and social issues, including corruption, management of the budget, and the
 long-awaited civil code. Legislators questioned and criticized ministries. The ses-
 sions' approval of a civil code was an important step in the Government's effort to
 develop a comprehensive legal infrastructure. However, the National Assembly re-
 
 
 745
 mained largely subservient to the VCP. Party officials occupy most senior govern-
 ment and National Assembly positions and continued to have the final say on key
 issues.
 The law provides the opportunity for equal participation in politics by women and
 minority grou ps, but in practice they are underrepresented. Most of the top leaders,
 including all 17 politburo members, are male. omen hold a number of important
 positions, including vice president, member of the party secretariat, and several vice
 ministerships. The President of the National Assembly, who is also a politburo
 member, is a member of an ethnic minority.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit private human rights organizations to form or
 operate. It generally prohibits private citizens from contacting international human
 rights organizations. The Government permitted international visitors to monitor
 implementation of its repatriation commitments under the Comprehensive Plan of
 Action and carried on a limited dialog with human rights organizations.
 The SRV has shown increased willingness to discuss human rights issues bilat-
 erally with other governments if such discussions take place under the rubric of "ex-
 changes of ideas" rather than as "investigations." Several foreign governments held
 official talks concerning human rights issues, and an Australian parliamentary dele-
 gation on human rights visited Vietnam in April.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and the Legal Code prohibit discrimination based on gender,
 ethnicity, religion, or social class. Enforcement of these prohibitions has been un-
 even. People released from reeducation camps have reported varying levels of dis-
 crimination in the areas of housing and education. They generally are not eligible
 to regain their citizenship rights until 1 year after their release. They and their
 families are not allowed employment with the Government, though this prohibition
 was less problematic than in the past because of the growth of private sector job
 opportunities.
 Women.Although the law addresses the issue of domestic violence, there is cred-
 ible evidence that the problem is on the rise and that the laws are not enforced ade-
 quately. International NGO workers and many Vietnamese women have stated that
 domestic violence against women is common. Most divorces are due to domestic vio-
 lence although many women remain in abusive marriages rather than confront the
 stigma of divorce. Domestic abuse appears to be more prevalent in rural areas.
 The Government, with international NGO's, and the press reported a marked in-
 crease in recent years in the trafficking of women both domestically and abroad for
 the purposes of prostitution. Organized rings reportedly lure poor, often rural,
 women with promises of jobs or marriage and force them to work as prostitutes.
 Some are kidnaped and sold as wives to men in other countries. The press and anec-
 dotal sources indicate that the problem of sex tourism is growing. The Government
 began to work more closely with NGO's to supplement law enforcement measures
 in these areas.
 While there is no legal discrimination, women face deeply ingrained social dis-
 crimination. Despite extensive provisions in the Constitution, in legislation, and in
 regulations that mandate equal treatment, and although some women occupy high
 government posts in general few women are able to compete effectively for higher
 status positions. he Government has not enforced the constitutional provision that
 women and men must receive equal pay for equal work. The large body of legisla-
 tion and regulations devoted to the protection of women's rights in marriage as well
 as in the workplace, as well as the new labor law calling for the preferential treat-
 ment of women, are distant from the reality of many, if not most, women.
 The party-controlled Women's Union has a broad agenda to promote women's
 rights, including political, economic, and legal equality, and protection from spousal
 abuse. NGO's and international organizations regard the Union highly but believe
 it will take some time to overcome societal prejudices. The Government also has a
 committee for the advancement of women, led by the Vice President, who is a
 woman.
 Children.-Reputable international organizations, including the U.N. Children's
 Fund (UNICEF) commended the Government's interest in children's issues and its
 promotion of chld welfare. Education is compulsory, but the authorities do not en-
 force the requirement, especially in rural areas (see Section 1.d.). The Government
 has continued a nationwide immunization campaign, and the government-controlled
 press regularly stresses the importance of health and education for all children. De-
 
 
 746
 spite some success, UNICEF estimates there are still 3 million children living in
 "especially difficult" circumstances. There is no information publicly available on the
 extent of child abuse (see also Section 6.c.).
 People With Disabilities.-The Government provides little official prtection or
 support for the disabled, and there are no laws mandating access. However, the
 1994 Labor Law calls on the State to protect the rights and encourage the employ-
 ment of the disabled. It includes provisions for preferential treatment for firms that
 recruit disabled persons for training or apprenticeship and a special levy on firms
 that do not employ disabled workers. It is not clear whether the Government en-
 forces these provisions. The Government has permitted international groups to as-
 sist those who have been disabled by war or by subsequent accidents involving
 unexploded ordnance.
 NationalIRacial /Ethnic Minorities.-Although the Government says that it is op-
 posed to discrimination against ethnic minorities, there continued to be credible re-
 ports that local officials sometimes restricted ethnic minority access to education,
 employment, and travel, both domestic and foreign. The Government continued to
 implement policies designed to narrow the gar in the standard of living between
 ethnic groups living in the highlands and low and ethnic Vietnamese by granting
 preferential treatment to domestic and foreign companies investing in highland
 areas. There is no information available on whether the Government continued to
 repress some highland minorities for suspected ties with resistance groups, as re-
 ported in the past.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers are not free to form or join unions of their
 own choosing unless they have obtained approval from the local office of the Com-
 munist Party-controlled Trade Union Federation of Vietnam (VGCL). The VGCL is
 the umbrella organization under which all local trade unions must operate. The
 Labor Law requires provincial trade union organizations to establish unions at all
 new enterprises with more than 10 employees as well as at existing enterprises that
 currently operate without trade unions. Management of those companies is required
 to accept and cooperate with those unions. However, many joint ventures and small,
 private companies, especially at the retail level, do not have unions.
 The Labor Law issued in 1994 provides for the right to strike under certain cir-
 cumstances. It calls for management and labor to resolve labor disputes through the
 enterprise's own labor conciliatory council. If that fails, the matter goes to the pro-
 vincial labor arbitration council. Unions have the right to appeal a council decision
 to the provincial people's court or to strike. However, the Law prohibits strikes at
 enterprises that serve the public and those that are important to the national econ-
 omy or national security and defense, as defined by the Government. It also grants
 the Prime Minister the right to suspend a strike considered detrimental to the na-
 tional economy or public safety.
 A number of strikes occurred in 1995, primarily against foreign-owned companies
 but also involving state-owned and private firms. The Government tolerated these
 strikes, which were often illegal. The new Labor Law prohibits retribution against
 strikers, and there have been no credible reports of such retribution.
 Unions are not legally free to, and do not in practice, join, affiliate with, or par-
 ticipate in international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the right to or-
 ganize unions in their enterprises, but they must be approved by the provincial or
 metropolitan branch of the VCGL They also can bargain collectively through the
 party-approved unions at their enterprises. In the past, the State generally set
 wages, since most people worked for state companies. With the growth of the private
 sector and the increased autonomy of state firms, a growing percentage of compa-
 nies are setting wages through collective bargaining with the relevant unions. Mar-
 ket forces also play a much more important role in determining wages. The Labor
 Code prohibits antiunion discrimination on the part of employers against employees
 seeking to organize.
 The Government has approved formation of a number of export processing zones
 and new industrial zones, which are governed by the same labor laws as the rest
 of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1994 Labor Law prohibits all
 forms of forced labor, and there were no reports of such practices.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Law sets the minimum
 age for employment at 15. Children as young as 13 can register at trade training
 centers, which are a form of vocational training. Vietnam has compulsory education
 laws, but laws are not effectively enforced, especially in rural areas where children
 
 
 are needed to farm. However, the culture's strong emphasis on education leads most
 people to send their children to school, rather than to work.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Law requires the Government to set
 a minimum wage, which changes with inflation and other economic changes. The
 monthly minimum wage for foreign-invested joint ventures is $35 (385000 Dong) in
 Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City and $30 (330,000 Dong elsewhere. he minimum
 monthly wage for Vietnamese companies is $11 (120,000 Dong). This by itself is in-
 sufficient to provide a worker and family with a decent standard of living. Many
 workers receive bonuses and supplement their incomes by engagg in entre-
 preneurial activities. A declining number of workers receive subsidized housing. The
 Government enforces the minimum wage at foreign and major Vietnamese firms.
 The Labor Law sets working hours at a maximum of 8 per day and 48 per week,
 with a mandatory 24-hour break each week. Any additional hours require overtime
 pay, and the law limits compulsory overtime. It is not clear how well the Govern-
 ment enforces these provisions.
 The Labor Law calls on the Government to promulgate rules and regulations to
 ensure worker safety. The Ministry of Labor, in coordination with local people's com-
 mittees and labor unions, is charged with enforcing the regulations. In practice, en-
 forcement is inadequate because of the Ministry's insufficient resources. Anecdotal
 evidence indicates that workers, through labor unions, have been more effective in
 forcing changes in working conditions than has the Government. There was no in-
 formation on the ability of-workers to remove themselves from work situations that
 endanger health or safety without jeopardy to their continued employment.
