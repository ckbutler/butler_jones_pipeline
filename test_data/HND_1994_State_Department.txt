 HONDURAS
 Honduras is a constitutional democracy with a President and a unicameral Con-
 gress elected for 4-year terms, and an independent judiciary headed by a Supreme
 Court of Justice (CSJ). President Carlos Roberto Reina took office in January as the
 fourth democratically elected president since the reestablishment of democracy in
 1982. Both major parties (Liberal and Nationalist) have now assumed power from
 the other after free elections.
 The Honduran Armed Forces (HOAF) comprise the army, air force, navy, and the
 National Police (Public Security Force-FUSEP) as a fourth branch. The HOAF op-
 erates with considerable institutional and legal autonomy, particularly in the realm
 of internal security and military affairs. It controls the police, the merchant marine,
 and the national telephone company. In November the Congress passed legislation
 which will remove the merchant marine from military control in 1995.
 The Government established an Ad Hoc Commission on Police and Judicial Re-
 form in 1993, in response to credible allegations of extrajudicial killings by members
 of the FUSEP, particularly its Directorate of National Investigations (DNI). On Jan-
 uary 6, it established a new Public Ministry containing a new Directorate of Crimi-
 nal Investigations (DIC) to replace the DNI. The Government formally dissolved the
 
 
 431
 DNI in June, but the DIC is still in the process of formation, leaving a gap ininves-
 tigative capability. Human rights organizations, including the Government's Na-
 tional Commission for the Protection of Human Rights (CONAPRODE), say there
 was a noticeable drop in reports of abuses after the DNI was abolished. However,
 members of both the armed fores and the FUSEP continued to commit human
 rights abuses.
 The economy is primarily based on       t     with a small but growing light
 manufacturing sector. The armed forces also play a sizable role in the nationaL econ-
 omy, controlling numerous enterprises usually associated with the private sector in-
 cluding several insurance companies and one of the two cement companies. tco-
 nomic activity was plagued by a drought-induced shortage of electricity, and real
 gross domestic product declined by about 2 percent. Combined unemployment and
 underemployment were approximately 58 percent, and the Government estimated
 that 62 percent of all citizens live in poverty.
 The most widespread human rights abuses were arbitrary and incommunicado de-
 tentions, and beatings and other abuse of detainees, sometimes including torture.
 There was a small number of extrajudicial killings. One major cause of human
 rights problems is the impunity enjoyed by members of the civilian and military
 elite, exacerbated by a weak, underfunded, and sometimes corrupt judicial system.
 Prison conditions remained deplorable. Other continuing human rights problems
 were violence against women, discrimination against indigenous peoples, and the in-
 ability of the judicial system to provide prisoners awaiting trial with swift and im-
 partial justice. Almost no elected official, member of the business elite, bureaucrat,
 politician, or anyone with perceived influence or connections to the elite was tried,
 sentenced, or significantly fined in 1994.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings, but members of the security forces committed several
 extrajudicial killings.
 The crime rate surged in 1994, including a rise in the number of homicides. It
 has become increasingly difficult to differentiate between homicides that may have
 been extrajudicial acts by government forces or agents and those which were com-
 mon crimes.
 In March two FUSEP agents kidnaped, tortured, and stabbed to death a 78-year-
 old evangelical pastor, Justo Irias Ordonez, in Lepaguare, Olancho (located in a re-
 mote part of eastern Honduras). Witnesses to the events claim the two agents went
 to the home of Ordonez, beat him with rifle butts, tied his hands, and took him to
 a place known as Pozo Malacate where they sodomized and killed him. The FUSEP
 commander in Juticalpa arrested the two agents and charged them with the crime.
 At year's end, they were awaiting trial by civil court.
 On November 7, the authorities suspended the Chief of Police in La Ceiba and
 two of his subordinates pending an investigation by the Attorney General's office
 into the alleged kidnaping and murder of a vendor suspected of killing an 11-year-
 old boy during an attempted burglary. Officials from the Committee for the Defense
 of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH), the Attorney General's Office, and the po-
 lice are working together on the investigation, the first time this has ever occurred,
 according to CODEH.
 Credible allegations of extrajudicial killings by members of the FUSEP, particu-
 larly its now defunct Directorate of National Investigations, led to the creation of
 the new Public Ministry to manage investigations of criminal cases. The new Min-
 istry is also responsible for investigating all cases of extrajudicial killings, including
 those of past years. The Government formally dissolved the DNI on June 11 and
 moved its functions to the new civii-controlled DIC. Human rights groups noted
 a drop in the number of reports of human rights abuses since the dissolution of the
 DNI. The Public Ministry is still in the process of training and organizing its staff
 and recruiting members for the new DIC. The attorneys and staff of the Ministry
 will lack the capability to investigate adequately current or past criminal cases until
 the DIC completes its training in the spring of 1995.
 The authorities undertook no further investigation or prosecution of alleged
 extrajudicial killings committed in previous years. These included the 1993 killings
 of Eduardo Pina van Tuyl, Guillermo Agurcia Lefebvre, Lourdes Enamorado, Roger
 David Torres Vallejos, Rigoberto Quezada Figueres, Cleofes Colindres Canales, Juan
 Jose Menendez, Glenda Patricia Solorzano Medina, and Jorge Alcides Medina Her-
 nandez; the 1992 killings of Juan Humberto Sanchez, Rigoberto Boijas, Ramon
 Castellon Baide, and Cayo Eng Lee; the 1991 murder of Manuel de Jesus Guerra;
 
 
 432
 and the 1990 killings of Francisco Javier Bonilla Medina and Ramon Antonio
 Briceno.
 The family of 18-year-old student Riccy Mabel Martinez, victim of a July 13, 1991
 rape and murder, appealed the original verdict in the case (equivalent to second-
 degree murder), and requested that the two military defendants be convicted of
 fr t-degree murder (which would preclude any possibility of pardon). The defend-
 ants filed a countersuit; at year's end, both cases were pending before the Supreme
 Court of Appeals.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances motivated by politics
 or conducted by the security forces.
 Loca human rights groups and Amnesty International continued to press unsuc-
 cessfully, for an official accounting of the 184 claimed disappearances wich oc-
 curred mainly during the early 1980's under the tenure of former armed forces Com-
 mander General Gustavo Alvarez Martinez.
 In December 1993, Human Rights Commissioner Leo Valladares presented a pre-
 liminary report on political disappearances during the 1979-89 period. On Novem-
 ber 9, a CSJ Commission announced that all but 9 of the 184 missing persons cases
 lacked the evidence required for proper legal proceedings. (The nine cases referred
 to are those or persons who were nissing or some time but were later found alive.)
 The report also noted that the survivors accused the current Minister of Defense
 of involvement in the detention, torture, and disappearance of four suspected leftists
 in 1988 (when he commanded an infantry briga ), but offered no proof. The Com-
 mission sent the nine cases warranting further action to the Attorney General's of-
 fice. All nine were reopened and at year's end, preliminary investigations were
 under way. A full investigation will be possible only when the DIC is trained and
 in place.
 On December 9 three forensic anthropologists who excavated a grave site believed
 to contain a death squad victim from the 1980's were able to confirm the identity
 of the body buried at that site since 1982 as that of Nelson Mackay Chavarria, a
 Honduran citizen. Because of serious decomposition of the body, the anthropologists
 could not determine the cause of death or whether the victim had been tortured.
 Human Rights Commissioner Valladares called for an immediate investigation by
 the Attorney General's Office and an end to impunity for those involved in the 184
 disappearances during the 1980's. The Attorney General began an investigation
 which will include testimony by members of the security forces.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture, and police and military authorities is-
 sued assurances throughout 1994 that the practice had been stopped, credible
 charges of torture and other abuse of detainees continue. Members of the police
 force resort to abuses to obtain confessions and keep suspects in jail. There were
 no reports of torture for political motives.
 One case of alleged torture involved 27-year-old narcotics suspect Fernando Flores
 Salgado. The Public Ministry reported that a FUSEP agent arrested Salgado on Au-
 gust 11 in the airport at Puerto Lempira and took him to a police station where,
 during a search of his luggage, police found an AK-47 automatic assault rifle.
 Salgado claimed he was beaten and a sack laced with lime was placed over his head,
 causing burns. The Ministry's report said the beatings continued on August 12 and,
 when the officers and their commander failed to extract information from Salgado
 about the seller of the AK-47, they took him to a lake and repeatedly submerged
 him in the water. On August 13, an assistant prosecutor from the Public Ministry
 obtained Salgado's release. Attorney General Edmundo Orellana presented charges
 against all three FUSEP agents for human rights violations, torture, battery, and
 attempted homicide. The courts in Puerto Lempira issued warrants, but none of the
 three were arrested. Prosecutors at the Public Ministry stated that FUSEP officials
 attempted to halt any investigation of the three agents by filing charges of drug
 trafficking against the assistant prosecutor who secured Salgado's release. =
 human rights groups say this is an attempt by the FUSEP to discredit the charges
 and intimidate the investigators. The FUSEP rearrested Salgado on October 15 and
 charged him with terrorism because of the AK-47 found in his possession. In late
 tber, the FUSEP dropped all charges against Salgado and the prosecutor,
 charges were also dropped against the FUSEP agents.
 On October 7, police arrested two juveniles in Tegucigalpa. The juveniles charged
 that police held them in a cell with adults and that both police and the othcr pris-
 oners beat and tortured them. Officials of Casa Alianza (an affiliate of Covenant
 House in New York), which operates a refuge for street children, obtained the re-
 lease of both of them on October 10. Following medical confirmation of the injuries
 to one of the youths Casa Alianza filed charges against the FUSEP for violating
 the youth's rights, illegal detention, and torture. It also requested a full investiga-
 
 
 433
 tion by the Attorney General's office. Market vendors and a FUSEP regional com-
 mander protested Casa Alianza's actions, asserting that the organization provides
 refuge for juveniles who commit crimes. Casa Alianza, in response, called on the na-
 tional Human Rights Commissioner to fulfill his obligation to protect children's
 rights.
 Amnesty International and Casa Alianza both received reports of minors whom
 members of the police and the army subjected to illegal arrest, ill-treatment, and
 sexual abuse. A street girl in San Pedro Sula, 11-year-old Martha Maria Saire,
 charged that two uniformed members of the military battalion based in Tamara
 grabbed and raped her. Medical examinations confirmed she had been sexually
 abused. On April 22, the authorities presented the case to the first criminal district
 court. The Attorney General's office issued arrest warrants for the soldiers, but they
 are reportedly absent without leave.
 Another case involved 16-year-old Mario Rene Enamorado Lara who lives in Casa
 Alianza's transition home in Tegucigalpa. On July 10, while on his way to the home
 in the company of other children, eight uniformed members of the FUSEl's first
 squadron stopped the group and accused Mario of having stolen a watch. They ar-
 rested him without a warrant, took him to the squadron headquarters, and placed
 him in detention in a cell with adult detainees. He charged that three policemen
 severely punched and kicked him during detention; adult male prisoners also beat
 him while he was in the cell. The same afternoon, legal counsel from Casa Alianza
 obtained his freedom, and an independent doctor confirmed injuries to his body,
 face, and head. Casa Alianza presented a formal complaint to the FUSEP and to
 the Public Ministry. Lacking an investigative arm, the Public Ministry had made
 no arrests by year's end.
 In February police officers severely beat U.S. citizen Terry George Clymire, whom
 they were in the process of arresting on civil charges. The Prosecutor's office and
 the FUSEP Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) investigated the case, but
 made no charges or arrests in the case. Charges against Clymire were dropped.
 The Office of Professional Responsibility investigates cases of alleged torture and
 abuse; OPR officials recommend sanctions for police agents found guilty of such mis-
 treatment. However, neither the FUSEP General Command nor the OPR is empow-
 ered to punish wrongdoers; only the commander of the accused agent has the au-
 thority to do so. During the past 12 months, OPR investigated eight FUSEP agents
 for abusing and beating street children in the Tegucigalpa area. The FUSEP dis-
 missed all of them, and the courts convicted three agents and gave them 30-day jail
 terms.
 Prison conditions in Honduras are consistently deplorable. Prisoners suffer from
 severe overcrowding, malnutrition, and a lack of adequate sanitation. In the Central
 Penitentiary in Tegucigalpa, there are 1,954 internees, of whom only 512 have been
 convicted and are serving sentences. More often than not, the mentally ill and those
 with tuberculosis and other infectious diseases are thrown together in the same
 cells. A new, larger detention facility in Tamara lacks water and power and prob-
 ably will not open until 1995. Prisoners with money routinely buy private cells, de-
 cent food, and conjugal visitation rights, while prisoners without money often lack
 the most basic necessities as well as legal assistance.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detertion, or Exile.-The law states that the police may arrest
 a person only with a court order unless the arrest is made during the commission
 of a crime, and that they must clearly inform the person of the grounds for the ar-
 rest. (By law the FUSEP cannot investigate; it only detains those suspected of com-
 mitting a crime.) Police must bring a detainee before a judge within 24 hours; the
 judge then must issue an initial temporary holding order within 24 hours, release
 an initial decision within 6 days, and conduct a preliminary investigation to decide
 whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation. However, in
 practice, the authorities do not routinely observe these requirements of the law.
 While bail is legally available, it is used primarily for what are ostensibly medical
 reasons. Poor defendants, even when represented by a public defender, are seldom
 able to take advantage of bail.
 Under the 1984 Code of Criminal Procedures, a judge, the police, public officials,
 or any citizen may initiate criminal proceedings. Perhaps as many as 80 percent of
 the cases reported to the police are never referred to the criminal justice system but
 instead are settled administratively by the police or by municipal courts, which are
 searate from the regular judicial court system.
 There were continued   egations that the FUSEP hired some former members of
 the DNl, and that these and other security force elements continued to practice ar-
 bitrary arrest and detention in a substantial number of cases. Local human rights
 monitoring organizations asserted, however, that this situation improved markedly
 
 
 434
 after the issuance of a report by the Ad Hoc Commission on Police and Judicial Re-
 form and the dissolution of the DNI.
 The Constitution prohibits the expatriation of a Honduran citizen to another coun-
 try; exile is not used as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-Congress elects the nine Supreme Court justices
 and the President confirms them. Their 4-year terms coincide with those of the Con-
 gress and the President. The Supreme Court appoints all the judges in the lower
 civilian courts. Some headway was made in using a career system to depoliticize the
 appointments process and to break the subcultures of corruption, clientism, patron-
 age, and influence peddling within the judiciary. In midyear the Supreme Court or-
 dered strict adherence to the judicial career law, i.e., a merit-oriented selection and
 retention process for judges and court officials, commencing with second-instance
 jutowever, both mEor political parties continue to resist the recommendation by
 the Ad Hoc Commission that they agree to a completely apolitical, independent judi-
 ciary. Members of Congss representing powerful economic and political interests
 continued to pressure the President and magistrates of the Supreme Court to permit
 politicians to appoint judges and court functionaries purely on political criteria and
 without regard to professional and ethical qualifications. The judicial system also
 still suffers from woefully inadequate funding.
 Traditionally, the Honduran Armed Forces insisted that only its courts-martial
 could try its members. However, in 1993 Congress passed a resolution restricting
 the jurisdiction of the military court system to military crimes committed by active
 duty personnel. Since then enlisted military personnel accused of crimes against ci-
 vilians have in fact been remanded to the civilian judicial system. The military con-
 tinued to accpt civilian court jurisdiction over its members, and the Public Minist
 assigned civilian prosecutors to each of the 11 military courts. It also began muc
 publicized investigations of human rights violations (past and present) by military
 personnel and followed up on anonymous published accusations of financial fraud
 by senior military officers.
 An accused person has the right to a fair trial, which includes the right to an ini-
 tial hearing by a judge, to bail, to an attorney provided by the state if necessary,
 and to appeal. The number of public defenders was doubled from 51 to 104, provid-
 ing greater legal assistance to the poor.
 Detentionf ocriminal suspects pending trial averaged 18 months and constituted
 a serious human rights problem. In an extreme case a mentally deficient, illiterate
 peasant spent 17 years in jail after being acquitted, due to the failure by responsible
 officials to process his release papers. A significant number of defendants serve the
 maximum possible sentence for the crime of which they are accused before their
 trials are ever concluded or even begun. Of the 6,042 detainees making up the coun-
 try's prison population in early 1994, 5,103, or 84 percent, had been neither sen-
 tenced nor exonerated. These judicial weaknesses, along with the almost total lack
 of thorough investigation of crimes and collection of evidence, greatly undermine the
 right of citizens to a speedy, fair public trial. In addition, some judicial authorities
 in rural areas received anonymous threats.
 The passage of the 1994 Public Ministry Law and subsequent creation of the new
 ministry, with 76 public prosecutors assigned nationally and twice that many
 planned for 1995, is intended to strengthen the citizeys ability to seek redress
 from government abuses and to enjoy fair and public trials. The Public Ministry's
 independence from the other branches of the Government also is intended to reduce
 somewhat the opportunities for the politically and economically powerful to distort
 the judicial process with impunity. The widely respected new Attorney General
 stressed the importance of personnel selection for the Public Ministry, and indicated
 he would refuse to employ former members of the DNI. In the short time it has ex-
 isted, even before becoming fully organized, the Public Ministry began investigations
 of a number of court officials on various corruption and malfeasance charges. As a
 result, the authorities dismissed 38 court officials, including 10 Superior Court
 judges and 11 justices of the peace.
 Despite the creation of the Public Ministry and the DIC, at year's end the justice
 system still favored the rich and politically influential and remained weak, under-
 funded, marginally politicized, and generally inefficient. While the Supreme Court
 made strides in both organization and investigation of corrupt court officials, the un-
 derfunded judiciary remained very vulnerable to influence and corruption.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution specifies that a person's home is inviolable and that persons authorized
 by the State may enter only with the owner's consent or with the authorization of
 a competent authority. Entry may take place only between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. or at
 any time in the event of an emergency or to prevent the commission of a crime.
 
 
 435
 However, as in previous years, there were credible charges that police and armed
 forces personnel failed at times to obtain the needed authorization before entering
 a private home. Despite a new system of "duty judges" and "duty prosecutors" to
 issue search orders, they appeared to lack the discipline to make themselves avail-
 able 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. Coordination among the police, the court, and
 the Public Ministry is improving. However, interagency liaison problems still under-
 mine the effectiveness of the system.
 Judges may authorize government monitoring of mail or telephones for specific
 purposes, such as criminal investigation or national security. However, the armed
 forces reportedly continued to use its operation of the national telephone company
 to monitor illegally telephone lines of inluential people in the Government, the mili-
 tary, and the private sector without authorization from the appropriate civilian judi-
 al authority.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, and the authorities largely respected these freedoms in practice. The
 media, while often openly critical of the Government and frequently willing to ex-
 pose corruption, are themselves subject to high levels of corruption and
 politicization. Serious investigative journalism is still in its infancy. Journalists are
 known to have requested bribes to kill stories. There continued to be credible re-
 ports of intimidation by the authorities, instances of self-censorship, and payoffs to
 journalists.
 The Government respects academic freedom and has not attempted to curtail po-
 litical expression on university campuses.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to peaceful assembly for political, religious, or other purposes. The Govern-
 ment does not generally require prior authorization or permits but may ask for a
 permit to "guarantee public order." In most cases, neither the Government nor the
 armed forces interfere in the right of citizens to assemble. For example, when sev-
 eral thousand Indians staged a protest march to the capital in July, they were al-
 lowed to occupy the center of the city for several days, withdrawing peacefully after
 meeting with the President and other officials nd winning concessions on their de-
 mands.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution protects all forms of religious expres-
 sion, and the Government respects this right in practice. Numerous foreign mission-
 aries work and proselytize throughout the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens enter and exit Honduras without arbitrary impediment, and
 travel within the country's borders is freely permitted. There were no known in-
 stances in which citizenship was revoked for political reasons. Of the 250 Haitian
 refugees who arrived in Honduras in November 1991, 45 remain.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised the right to change their government through democratic and
 peaceful means in the November 1993 elections. International observers found the
 elections to be free and fair. The national government is chosen by free, secret, di-
 rect, and obligatory balloting every 4 years. Suffrage is universal, but the clergy and
 serving members of the armed forces are not permitted to vote. Any citizen born
 in Honduras or abroad of Honduran parentage may hold office except for members
 of the clergy and the armed forces. A new political party my gainlegal status by
 obtaining 0,0OO signatures and establishing party organizations in at east half the
 country's 18 departments.
 There are no legal impediments to women and minorities participating in govern-
 ment and politics, but in practice, the proportion of women in political organizations
 and elected to office is far lower than their overall representation in society. How-
 ever, for the first time voters elected a woman, Guadalupe Jerezano, as one of the
 three vice presidents in the 1993 elections, and the losing opposition slate also had
 a female vice presidential candidate. Women hold a Cabinet ministry and Supreme
 Court position, as well as a number of vice ministerial positions. Of the 128 Depu-
 ties in Congress, 14 are women and 5 are indigenous. There are few indigenous per-
 sons in leadership positions in government or politics, although the Honduran am-
 bassador to the United Nations is a member of the Garifuna indigenous group.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras and the Committee
 of the Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared in Honduras (COFADEH) are the
 
 
 436
 
 best known and most active local nongovernmental human rights organizations.
 Prior to the Government's establishment of the Office of the Human Rights Commis-
 sioner, CODEH, with its network of offices throughout the country, was often the
 only recourse available to victims of abuses, particularly those living in rural areas.
 The nongovernmental Center for the Investigation and Promotion of Human Rights
 (CIPRODEH), established in 1991, offers basic human rights courses, holds monthly
 seminars, carries out research on issues affecting Hondurans, and serves as a source
 of information on human rights. CIPRODEH continued its human rights training
 of police officers and added training programs for the military.
 Two COFADEH staff members reported instances of harassment. On March 4,
 Berta Oliva de Nativi, COFADEH coordinator, had a telephone call interrupted by
 a male voice claiming to be a colonel who threatened to kill her and her family. Ms.
 Nativi believed the caller to be an ex-member of the notorious military intelligence
 Battalion 3-16, created in the early 1980's but now dissolved. Such threats, made
 by telephone at beth her home and office continued through March and the begin-
 ng of April. Another member of COFADEH, Dina Meethabel Meza Elvir, also re-
 ceived numerous threats and was harassed. On March 15, Ms. Elvir reported that
 a man in a car followed her for several miles and attempted to bump her vehicle.
 She obtained the license plate number. On March 16, as she was leaving her son's
 hospital in Comayaguela (a section of Tegucigalpa) she was again followed by the
 same car. Ms. Elvir presented her information to tie criminal court and also went
 to the Public Ministry, which initiated an investigation. The owner of the car was
 apprehended but was released when Ms. Elvir could not identify him. Both cases
 remain under investigation; the Attorney General's office offered protection to beth
 women.
 The Governmental Inter-institutional Commission on Human Rights (CIDH), es-
 tablished in 1987 to respond to domestic and international inquiries and to inves-
 tigate human rights violations, is largely ineffective, as it does not receive full co-
 operation from military and civilian judicial authorities. The Government provides
 the Human Rights Commissioner with insufficient funds, leaving him dependent
 upon contributions from international organizations such as the United Nations
 Children's Fund. He has proposed that the Human Rights Commissioner be elected
 by Congress, with its power derived from the Constitution.
 Government officials continued to meet and cooperate with representatives of local
 and international human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution bans discrimination based on race and sex. Although it also bans
 discrimination on the basis of class, in fact, both the military and the political and
 social elite generally enjoy impunity before the legal system. Members of the socio-
 economic upper class are rarely arrested or jailed.
 The Constitution provides for 2 years of compulsory military service for male citi-
 zens between the ages of 18 and 30, although only Hondurans from the middle and
 lower classes have been forcibly recruited into the armed forces. In May, at Presi-
 dent Reina's initiative, and over the opposition of the armed forces, Congress unani-
 mously voted to abolish involuntary military service. Although the measure, as a
 constitutional amendment, will have to be approved again in 1995 in order to be-
 come effective, the President ordered an immediate suspension of forced recruit-
 ment. However, in late September, in the face of strongly diminished armed forces
 levels, President Reina ordered the resumption of compulsory military service. A
 draft lottery was held on November 19 to fill 6,500 open positions in the armed
 forces. Most upper-class youths continued to avoid conscription, either as students
 or through their names being left off the lottery eligibility lists.
 Women.-Women are represented in at least small numbers in most of the profes-
 sions, but cultural attitudes limit their career opportunities. In theory, women have
 equal access to educational opportunities, but family pressures often serve to brake
 the ambitions of women intent on obtainng higher education. The law requires
 women, who make up 51 percent of the work force, to be paid equal wages for equal
 work, but their jobs are often classified as less demanding than those of men, as
 a justification for paying them lower salaries.
 Violence against women remains widespread, and serious weaknesses in the
 Penal Code severely impede efforts to combat it. Visitacion Padilla, a women's
 human rights group, has called for legislation to make violence against women a se-
 rious crime. The majority of such violence takes place within the family. The courts
 do not take action in domestic violence cases unless the victim is badly battered and
 incapacitated for more than 10 days. Except in the case of children age 12 or under,
 rape is considered a private crime. Rape victims over age 12 ar  therefore required
 
 
 437
 to hire a rivate prosecutor, a luxury few can afford. The penalties for rape are rel-
 atively Wgt, ranging from 3 to 9 years' imprisonment. There are no shelters specifi-
 cally maintained for battered women. Although the law offers some redress, few
 women take advantage of the legal process, belevin that judges would be unwilling
 to apply the law vigorously. Sexual harassment in  e workplace is also a problem,
 as graphically described in testimony to the U.S. Senate in September by a 15-year-
 old female garment worker.
 Some organizations have begun to offer assistance to women, principally targeting
 those living in the rural sectors and marginal neighborhoods of cities. The Hon-
 duran Federation of Women's Associations, for example, provides home construction
 and improvement loans, offers free legal assistance to women, and lobbies the Gov-
 ernment on women's causes. The human rights group CIPRODEH began an edu-
 cation program to make women aware of their rights under the law.
 Ch.drel.-The Government is committed to providing basic education and health
 care to children, but is unable to prevent abuse of street children (see Section 1.c.)
 and child workers (see Section 6.2.). In Tegucigalpa, there are about 1,300 street
 children, many of whom have been sexually molested; at least 10 percent are chron-
 ically addicted to glue sniffing. Over 75 percent of the street children find their way
 to the streets because of severe family problems; 9 percent are abandoned. Many
 of these children when arrested, are housed with adults and abused. Both the police
 and members of the general population em ploy violence against street children.
 Casa Alianza worked with the police to en dabuse of children who are arrested.
 However, vigilante violence and allegations of police abuse continue to be a problem.
 Indigenous People.-The small community of indigenous people have little or no
 ability to participate in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, or the
 allocation of natural resources. All indigenous land rights are communal and the
 law prohibits sale of such property either by individuals or the tribe. Tribal lands
 are often poorly defined in documents dating from the mid-19th century, and in
 most cases lack legal title based on modern cadastral measurements. The Honduran
 Forestry Development Corporation makes decisions regarding exploitation of timber
 resources on indigenous lands, often over strnuous tribal objection. Usurpation of
 indigenous lands by nonindigenous farmers and cattle ranchers is common.
 The courts commonly deny legal recourse to indigenous groups and show bias in
 favor of the nonindigenous parties, who are often people of means and influence.
 Failure to obtain legal redress frequently provoked indigenous groups to attempt to
 regain land through invasions and other tactics, which usually provoked the au-
 thorities to retaliate forcefully. To focus governmental and public attention on their
 needs, several thousand Indians from all over the country marched to the capital
 city of Tegucigalpa on July 12 to support complaints of Indians from the Intibuca
 region about illegal logging. President Reina and his Cabinet met with Indian rep-
 resentatives and agreed to address the problem and to consider long-term rec-
 ommendations regarding the Indian situation. A congressional committee drafted
 legislation to create a new county composed exclusively of Indian communities, and
 the Government promised to build schools and roads and to ensure greater rotec-
 tion of the forests in which the Indians live. However, on October 3, severa thou-
 sand Indians of various tribes made a followup march to Tegucigalpa to remind the
 Government of its promises and to complain of increasing problems with the armed
 forces in their areas.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no formal barriers to participation by dis-
 abled persons in terms of employment, education, and health care but neither is
 there specific statutory protection for them. There is no legislation ihat requires ac-
 cessibility for disabled persons to government buildings or services.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to form and join labor
 unions, and with the exception of some "parallel" unions formed by the Government,
 the unions are independent of government and political parties. Although only about
 20 percent of the work force is organized, trade unions exert considerable economic
 and political influence. They frequently participate in public rallies against govern-
 ment policies and make extensive use of the media to advance their views. There
 are also three large peasant associations directly affiliated with the trade unions.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, along with a wide range of other
 basic labor rights, which the authorities honor in practice. The Civil Service Code,
 however, stipulates that public workers do not have the right to strike. (This does
 not include those working in state-owned enterprises.) There were legal and illegal
 strikes during the year by public and private schoolteachers, mail workers, banana
 workers from Chiquita Brands, and workers in a dozen or more foreign-owned
 maquiladora (in-bond processing) plants exporting textiles to the United States.
 
 
 A number of private firms have instituted "solidarity" associations, which are es-
 sentially aimed at providing credit and other services to workers and management
 who are members of the association. Membership in these associations increased
 slightly during the year. Organized labor, including the American Federation of
 Labor-Congre ss of Industrial Organizations and the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions, strongly opposes these associations on the grounds that they do
 not permit strikes, have inadequate grievance procedures, and neutrlie genuine
 and representative trade unions.
 The trade union movement maintains close ties with various international trade
 union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Co//ectivel.-The law protects workers'
 rights to organize and to bargain collectively; collective bargaining agreements are
 the norm for companies in which workers are organized. However, although the
 Labor Code prohibits retribution by employers for trade union activity, it is a com-
 mon occurrence. Employers threaten to close down unionized companies harass
 their workers, and in some cases fire them for trying to form a trade union. Employ-
 ers actually dismiss relatively few workers for union activity once a union is recog-
 nized; these cases, however, serve to discourage other workers from attempting to
 organize. Workers in both unionized and nonunionized companies are under the pro-
 tection of the Labor Code, which gives them the right to seek redress from the Min-
 istry of Labor. Labor or civil courts can require employers to rehire employees fired
 for union activity, but such rulings are uncommon. Generally, however, agreements
 between management and unions contain a clause prohibiting retaliation against
 anyworkerwho paicpated in a strike or union activity.
 The same labor reguat ions apply in export processing zones (EPZ's) as in the rest
 of private industry. Unions are active in the government-owned Puerto Cortes free
 trade zone (all seven maquiladora companies the  re unionized), but factory own-
 ers have resisted efforts to organize te new privately owned industrial parks. To
 date, none of the EPZ plants has been organized. In the absence of a union and col-
 lective bargaining, several of the EPZ plants have instituted soldarity associations
 which to some extent exist as company unions for the purpose of setting wages and
 negotiating working conditions. Others use the minimum wage to set starting sala-
 ries and adjust the wage scale by negotiating with common groups of workers and
 individuals depending on skill, years of em ployment, and other related criteria.
 Talks between unions and EPZ plants continue.
 In February an EPZ irm fired 4 female workers involved in union organizing ac-
 tivities; in response, 5,000 workers took over the Continental Industrial Park near
 El Prgreso on February 10, dosing 8 factories. Five days later, workers occupied
 five factories at the Galaxy Industrial Park for the same reason. In June 6,000
 workers took over the highway leading to the Puerto Cortes industrial area, closing
 6 factories that had fired several pregnant women in violation ef the Labor Code.
 Labor leaders blame the Government for permitting management to take such ac-
 tions, and say this poblem will continue until the Ministry of Labor is reorganized
 to make it more efficient. They criticize the Ministry for not enforcing the Labor
 Code, for taking too long to make decisions, and for being timid and indifferent to
 workers' needs. In the month-long strike between Chiquita Brands and its union,
 for example, the Ministry of Labor and four separate commissions named by the
 President were unable to end the conflict.
 The Labor Code clearly prohibits blacklisting, nevertheless, there was credible evi-
 dence that informal blacklisting occurred in the privately owned industrial parks.
 When unions are formed, organizers must submit a list of initial members to the
 Ministry of Labor as part of the process of obtaining official recognition. Before offi-
 cial recognition is granted, however, the Ministry must inform the comp any of the
 impending union organization. Ministry officials have consistently been unable to
 provide effective protection to workers. There are credible reports that, particularly
 n the EPZ sector, some inspectors have gone so far as to sell companies the names
 of employees involved in forming a union, which some companies used to dismiss
 union organizers before recognition was granted. There is also credible evidence that
 military intelligence maintains files on union activists.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsoy Labor.-The Constitution and the law pro-
 hibit forced or compulsry labor. Although there were no official reports of such
 practices, allegations of forced overtime in EPZ plants, particularly for women, are
 credible.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit the employment of minors under the age of 16, except for hildren
 between the ages of 14 to 16 who have the permission of their parents and the Min-
 istry of Labor. Employers legally  i  children under the agoef 16 must certify
 that the young person has fiished or is finishing his or her compulsory schooling.

 The legal age for working without parenta consent is 16. The Ministry of Labor
 grants a numbr of these work permits to 14- and 15-year-olds each year. It is com-
 mon for 12- and 13-year-olds to obtain these documents or to purchase forged per-
 mits which use the Labor Ministiy's letterhead
 The Ministry of Labor does not effectively enforce child labor laws, and violations
 of the Labor Cod occur frequently in rura areas and in small companies. Many
 children work in small family farms, as street vendors, or in small workshops to
 supplement the family income. According to the Ministry of Labor, human rights
 ups, and organizations for the protection of children, the most significant child
 labor preblem is in the construction industry. A 15-year-old girl also testified before
 a US. Senate subcommittee in September that children below the legal employment
 age work in the garment assembly sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions ct Work.-In December the Government decreed in-
 creases ranging from 15 to 33 percent in the minimum wage, the first since June
 1993. Daily pay rates vary by the sector of the economy affected and geographical
 zones: the lowest minimum wage is $1.60 (14.95 lempiras) per day in the a culture
 sector. The highest minimum wage is in the mining sector at $2.79 (26 empiras)
 daily. Urban workers earn slightly more than those in the countryside. The Con-
 stitution and the Labor Code stipulate that all labor be fairly paid, but the Ministry
 of Labor lacks the staff and other resources for effective enforcement. Even after the
 third consecutive annual increase, the minimum wage is considered insufficient to
 provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 The law prescribes a maximum 8-hour day and a 44-hour workweek. There is a
 requirement for at least one 24-hour rest period every 8 days. The Labor Code pro-
 vids for a paid vacation of 10 workdays after 1 year and 20 workdays after 4 years.
 However, employers frequently ignore these regulations due to the high level of un-
 employment and underemployment, and the lack of effective enforcement by the
 Ministry of Labor.
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing national health and safety laws,
 but does not do so effectively. There is no provision for a worker to remove himself
 from a dangerous work situation without jeopardy to continued employment. Reli-
 able reports indicate that there are still as many as 50 deaths per year resulting
 from serious health and safety hazards facing Miskito Indian scuba divers employed
 in lobster and conch harvesting off the Caribbean coast. Some complaints, although
 fewer than in previous years, allege the failure of foreign factory managers to com-
 ply with occupational health and safety aspects of Lar Code regulations in fac-
 tories located in free zones and industrial parks.
