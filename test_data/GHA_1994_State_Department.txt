 GHANA
 Ghana continues its transition from a single-party, authoritarian system to that
 of a constitutional democracy. Flight Lieutenant (retired) Jerry John Rawlings be-
 came the first President of the Fourth Republic, following the controversial elections
 of 1992. This ended 11 years of authoritarian rule under Rawlings and his Provi-
 sional National Defense Council (PNDC), who had seized power from an elected gov-
 ernment in 1981. The Constitution calls for a system of checks and balances, with
 an executive branch headed by the President, a unicameral Parliament, an inde-
 pendent judiciary, and several autonomous commissions, such as the Commission
 for Human Rights and Administrative Justice. While acknowledging irregularities,
 international monitors accepted the validity of the election results. Four opposition
 parties, however, claimed massive fraud in the presidential election and boycotted
 the December 1992 Parliamentary elections, leaving the President's coalition in full
 control of the Parliament and the Government.
 Several security organizations report to various government departments. The po-
 lice are responsible for maintaining law and order and come under the jurisdiction
 of an eight-member Police Council. The Bureau of National Investigation (BND,
 under the Minister of the Interior, handles cases considered critical to state secu-
 rity. Allegations continue that police have been involved in human rights abuses,
 especially in areas remote from the capital. Although the security apparatus is con-
 trolled by and responsive to the Government, monitoring, supervision, and education
 of the police in particular are poor. With the majority of the population illiterate
 and unaware of their rights, human rights abuses such as beatings and detention
 without charge still go unreported.
 After years of economic mismanagement, Ghana is attempting to rebuild its in-
 dustrial base. More than 60 percent of the population still draws its livelihood from
 the land. Gold, cocoa, cocoa products, timber, and energy are major traditional
 sources of export revenues. The Government is making slow progress in its efforts
 to privatize state-owned enterprises, and annual economic growth has averaged 4.5
 percent since the inception of an economic recovery program in 1983.

 The number and severity of human rights abuses continued to decline. The small
 but independent press, human rights monitoring groups, and opposition parties
 were vigorous and outspoken in criticizing various aspects of government policy.
 However, the government-owned media, wich reach by Tar the largest audience, did
 not often criticize government policies. Except for journalist Gershon Dompreh, who
 continues to serve a prison sentence for writing a press article deemed to be "eco-
 nomic sabotage," there are no known political prisoners or detainees. Discrimination
 and violence against women, however, remained significant problems, as well as
 abuses stemming from pretrial detentions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was one report of an
 extrajudicial killing. In April a 7-year-old boy from Adiembra in the Brong Ahafo
 Region died after sustaining injuries during a joint police/military frontier demarca-
 tion exercise. A police report said that the operation had been peaceful, but follow-
 ing rumors of the boys death, the Government ordered BNI to investigate. The BNI
 reported that there had been excesses, but failed to specify who was responsible.
 The Regional Administration found the report inconclusive and ordered a new inves-
 tigation.
 On August 30, the High Court in Accra convicted the police inspector and con-
 stable charged with beating a prisoner to death on June 7, 1993, at Tlia of man-
 slaughter but sentenced them to only 18 months in prison. The journalist Kwesi
 Pratt was unsuccessful in his efforts to persuade the Government to investigate
 extraudicial killings in the early years of-PN C rule, despite police professions in
 1993 of willingness to investigate such killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that the digiy of all persons shall be inviolable and that
 no one shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment, or any other condition that detracts from his dignity and worth as
 a human. Nonetheless, police continued to beat prisoners and other citizens. The au-
 thorities stated that some abuses by police were investigated but announced no re-
 sults; there were no known instances of police being tried and convicted for such
 abuses.
 Prisons are in most cases antiquated, and conditions are extremely harsh. Most
 prisons are overcrowded; nutrition and sanitation are poor. Although the Govern-
 ment has occasionally commuted the sentences of ill or aged prisoners, failure to
 provide adequate and timely medical care to prisoners has resulted in deaths.
 The Government allows monitoring of prison conditions by members of the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Ezile.-The Constitution provides protection
 against arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile, and it states that an individual de-
 tained shall be informed immediately, in a language he understands, of the reasons
 for his detention and of his right to a lawyer and to an interpreter, the latter at
 state expense. It also requires judicial warrants for arrest and provides for arraign-
 ment within 48 hours. In practice, however, many abuses occur, including detention
 without charge for longer than 48 hours and failure to obtain a warrant for arrest.
 The court has unlimited discretion regarding the setting of bail, which can be ex-
 cessive. It may refuse to release prisoners on bail and instead remand them without
 charge for an indefinite period, subject to weekly review by judicial authorities. It
 is common to remand a prisoner into investigative custody. The Constitution re-
 quires, however, that a detainee who has not been tried within a "reasonable, time
 s all be released either unconditionally or subject to conditions necessary to ensure
 that he appears at a later date for court proceedings. Approximately 30 percent of
 the prison population consists of pretrial detainees. Despite the provisions of the
 law, abuses occur. People are sometimes detained for trivial offenses or unsubstan-
 tiated accusations.
 There were no known political arrests in 1994. The Government does not practice
 forced exile and continues to encourage Ghanaians with valuable skills who are liv-
 ing abroad to return, including dissidents. In some cases the Government has of-
 fered amnesty. Some former government and discredited PNDC officials have re-
 turned and resumed careers and political activities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tral.--The Constitution establishes two basic levels of
 courts: superior and lower. The superior courts include the Supreme Court, the Ap-
 peals Court, the High Court and regional tribunals. Parliament may decree lower
 courts or tribunals. Cgal safeguards are based on British legal procedures. Defend-
 
 
 102
 ants are presumed innocent, trials are public, and defendants have a right to be
 present, to be represented by an attorney (at public expense if necessary), to present
 evidence, and to cross-examine witnesses. In practice, authorities respect these safe-
 guards.
 The Constitution provides for a Commission for Human Rights and Administra-
 tive Justice to investigate alleged violations of human rights and take action to rem-
 edy proven violations. The Commission was sworn in during October 1993 and has
 established offices in regional capitals and districts. It has held workshops to edu-
 cate the public on human rights issues.
 The traditional courts operate alongside the regular courts. The Chieftaincy Act
 of 1971 gives village and other traditional chiefs powers in local matters, including
 authority to enforce customary tribal laws dealing with such matters as divorce,
 child custody, and property disputes. Traditional courts fail to meet accepted stand-
 ards of fairness an due process.
 After losing a series of significant cases in 1993, the Government posed no serious
 challenges to judicial independence during the year. There were no charges of judi-
 cial corruption. So far as is known, there are no political prisoners with the excep-
 tion of Gershon Dompreh, a journalist serving a 20-year sentence for economic sabo-
 the Government dropped its case against Kwesi Pratt a political activist and
 journalist, and Professor Albert Adu-Boahen, leader of the New Patriotic Party. The
 authorities had charged them with obstruction of justice for refusing to testify in
 a public tribunal.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Observ-
 ers assume the Government continues to engage in surveillance of citizens engaged
 in activity which it deems objectionable. In the past, this included monitoring of
 telephones and mail.
 Although the law requires judicial search warrants, police do not always obtain
 them. The Constitution provides that a person shall be free from interference within
 the privacy of his home, property, correspondence, or communication. This article
 has yet to be tested.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flict.-During the ethnic conflict in the Northern Region, which began in February,
 police used excessive force in a number of cases. In the regional capital of Tamale,
 security forces trying to disperse a crowd fired into it, killing at least 1 person and
 injuring 30 to 40 others. Police also beat villagers indiscriminately during the course
 of the conflict. In response to the inability of the police to control the situation, the
 Government declared a state of emergency and deployed regular army units to re-
 store order. Parliament voted to lift the state of emergency in August, at which time
 the army units handed authority back to the police.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of sp)eech
 and press, and opposition political parties and others have used it vigorously in
 criticizing the Government. However, the authorities continued to pressure the gv-
 ernment-run media for conformity. The Government dominates the print and elec-
 tronic media, owning the radio and television stations and the two daily news-
 papers. The official media continue to emphasize the positive aspects of government
 policies, although they also cover charges of corruption or mismanagement in gov-
 ernment ministries and state-owned enterprises. In general, the state-owned media
 do not criticize government policies or President Rawlings. The Government occa-
 sionally subjects journalists to discipline or dismissal for articles deemed unaccept-
 able. As a result, the official media practice self-censorship. There were occasions
 when the government-owned media carried editorials critical of the Government but
 did not criticize top officials.
 Most Ghanaians obtain their news from the government-owned electronic media
 and British Broadcasting Corporation radio. Under the Constitution, individuals are
 free to own radio and television stations. The Government has to date, how-
 ever,issued no private broadcast licenses. One firm, the Independent Media Corpora-
 tion of Ghana, began broadcasting after having waited for almost 1 year without re-
 sult for its application for a license. The Government confiscated the firm's radio
 equipment, effectively shutting the radio station down. The matter is now before the
 courts.
 The independent press continues to publish unimpeded, with newspapers and
 magazines critical of the Government, including personal attacks on the President,
 his wife, and his close advisers. However, independent newspapers and magazines
 tend to be small, poorly financed, and not widely distributed outside Accra. More-
 over, the Criminal Libel Law, enacted in 1960 and based on the British model, holds
 
 
 103
 the potential for inhibiting freedom of the press. The law states that anyone who
 communicates a false report injuring the credit or reputation of the State is guilty
 of a felony punishable by imprisonment. Foreign periodicals are sold in Accra and
 other major cities. Issues containing articles critical of the Government circulate
 freely.
 In general, the Government has not suppressed freedom of speech, press, or aca-
 demic freedom on university campuses. The National Union of Ghanian Students
 (NUGS), one of the more vocal critics of the Government, is allowed to organize and
 hold meetings.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association; it does not require permits for dem-
 onstrations.
 Students injured by security forces during a March 1993 demonstration have been
 compensated, but the authorities did not punish the police officers involved.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state-favored religion and no apparent advan-
 tages or disadvantages attached to membership in any particular sect or religion.
 Foreign missionary groups have generally operated throughout the country with a
 minimum of formal restrictions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Count ry, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Ghanaians and foreigners are free to move throughout the country
 without special permission. Police checkpoints exist countrywide to prevent smug-
 gling, but most are left unmanned during daylight hours. Roadblocks and car
 searches are a normal part of nighttime travel in Accra.
 Ghanaians are generally free to travel internationally, to emigrate or to be repa-
 triated from other countries. Of the 10,000 Ghanaians who sought refuge in Togo
 following the ethnic conflict in the Northern Region, it is estimated that half have
 returned. As members of the Economic Community of West African States
 (ECOWAS), Ghanaians may travel without visas for up to 90 days in member
 states.
 Ghana continues to host a substantial refugee population, some 94,000 Togolese
 who fled to Ghana in 1993. Ghana also provides refuge to an estimated 20,000 Libe-
 rians. In addition, over 15,000 Ghanaians residing in Liberia returned to their home
 villages, often imposing great strain on government social services.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Ghanaians last exercised the right to change their government through the demo-
 cratic process in presidential elections held in 1992. International observers noted
 serious problems in the electoral process but concluded, on balance, that they did
 not change the outcome. However, opposition parties protested the results by boy-
 cotting subsequent parliamentary elections.
 Thus, except for two independent members, all 200 members of Parliament belong
 to one of the three parties that supported President Rawlings, whose PNDC party
 won 95 percent of the seats. The Covernment took some steps to bring the opposi-
 tion into the political process, including electoral reform.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of gender and there are no
 obstacles to the articipation of women in government. Several ministers and Coun-
 cil of State members are women. There are 16 women parliamentarians. Although
 all ethnic groups are represented in the Government, members of the Ewe ethnic
 group of which President Rawlings is a member, are over represented in high-level
 public positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigations of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights organizations continued to grow in number and strength and oper-
 ated without government interference or restriction.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, dis-
 ability, language, or social status. The courts are specifically empowered to enforce
 these prohibitions.
 Women.-Ghanaian women continue to experience societal discrimination. Women
 in urban centers and those with skills and training encounter little overt bias, but
 resistance to women in nontraditional roles persists. Women in the rural agricul-
 tural sector remain subject to traditional male dominance and difficult labor condi-
 tions.
 Violence against women (including rape and wife beating) remains a significant
 problem. It usually goes unreported and seldom comes before the courts. The police
 
 
 tend not to intervene in domestic disputes. The media increasingly reported cases
 of assault and rape. Women's rights groups are active in educationa campaigns and
 in programs to provide vocational training, legal aid, and other support to women.
 The Government is also active in educational programs in support of women's
 rights.
 Children.-Within the limits of its resources, the Government is committed to pro-
 tecting the rights and welfare of children. There is little or no discrimination
 against females in education, but girls and women frequently drop out due to soci-
 etal or economic pressures. Statistics show an equal male/female ratio in school en-
 rollments in Grade 1, dropping to 2 to 1 by Grade 6, 4 to 1 at the secondary level,
 and 9 to 1 at university level.
 There are traditional discriminatory practices against females which are injurious
 to health and development. In particular, female genital mutilation (FGM) is a seri-
 ous problem.
 According to one study, the percentage of women who have undergone this proce-
 dure may be as high as 30 percent, although most observers believe 15 percent to
 be more accurate. Such mutilation is practiced mostly in the far northeastern and
 northwestern parts of the country. In August Parliament passed a law making FGM
 illegal. In September the Government charged a practitioner of FGM with causing
 harm after circumcising four girls, one of whom was taken to hospital bleeding se-
 verely. The prisoner is still in police custody.
 Another practice, found primarily in the Volta region, constitutes abuse of chil-
 dren. The tro-kosi (or "vestal virgin") system is a traditional practice in which a
 young girl, usually under the age of 10, is made a virtual slave to a fetish shrine
 for offenses allegedly committed by a member of the girl's family. The belief is that
 if someone in a family has committed a crime, such as stealing, members of the fam-
 ily may begin to die in large numbers unless a young girl is given to the local fetish
 shrine to atone for the offense. The girl becomes the virtual property of the fetish
 priest and may become his wife. These girls are seldom allowed to go to school and
 must work on the priest's farm and perform other labors for him. When the fetish
 slave dies or reaches maturity, the family is expected to replace her with another
 young girl for the fetish shrine.
 The practice of tro-kosi is clearly illegal but persists because traditional beliefs are
 deep-seated. There has been some minimal success in encouraging the substitution
 of sacrificial animals in place of girls. It is estimated that there may be 1,000 fetish
 slaves bound to various shrines.
 National /RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Although the Government plays down ethnic
 differences, its opponents occasionally complain that it is dominated by the Ewe eth-
 nic group from Eastern Ghana. Like the President, many of his close advisers are
 Ewe, but many ministers are of different ethnic origins.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution specifically provides for the rights of
 people with disabilities, including protection against exploitation and discrimination.
 It also states that "as far as practicable, every place to which the public has access
 shall have appropriate facilities for disabled persons." In practice, however, this pro-
 vision has yet to be implemented.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-This right is restricted, as the Trades Union Ordi-
 nance confers broad powers on the Government to refuse to register a trade union.
 However, the PNDC did not, and the present Government has not, interfered with
 the right of workers to associate in labor unions. The law prohibits civil servants
 from organizing or joining a trade union, bargaining collectively or striking.
 About 10 or 15 percent of workers belong to unions. The Industrial Rerations Act
 (IRA) of 1965 still governs trade unions and their activities. The Trades Union Con-
 gress (TUC) is the only existing confederation, though it has no legal monopoly. In
 recent years it has been led by experienced union leaders who, aided by a revised
 union constitution and by-laws, continued to define an autonomous role for the TUC
 within the PNDC regime. In the last 3 years, the TUC has taken a somewhat more
 confrontational stance vis-a-vis the Government and has been quite critical of some
 of its economic policies.
 The law recognizes the right to strike. Under the IRA, the Government estab-
 lished a system of settling disputes, first through conciliation, then arbitration. A
 union may call a legal strike if negotiations and mediation fail. However, because
 no union has ever gone through the complete process, there have been no legal
 strikes since independence. Nevertheless, the Ghana Medical Association, the
 Ghana National Association of Teachers, and the University of Ghana's porters,
 drivers, and phone technicians staged major strikes in 1994 without government
 retribution. The IRA prohibits retribution against strikers, and this is enforced.
 
 
 There has been no progress in implementing the Government's declared intention
 to establish labor tribunals to arbitrate industrial disputes certified as deadlocked.
 The TUC is affiliated with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity
 (OATUU) headuartered in Accra and is a member of the International Confed-
 eration of'Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The IRA provides a frame-
 work for collective bargaining and some protection against antiumon discrimination
 as well. Trade unions engage in collective b aining for wages and benefits with
 both private and state-owned enterprises witout government interference. The
 Government, labor, and employers negtiate together, however, through a tripartite
 commission to set minimum standards for wages and working conditions. The law
 requires employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination to reinstate workers
 fired for union activities. No union leaders have been detained in recent years for
 union or other activities.
 There are no functioning export processing zones in Ghana.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and it is not known to be practiced except in the tro-kosi system (see Section 5).
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) continues to urge the Government to
 revise various legal provisions that permit imprisonment with an obligation to per-
 form labor for offenses that are not countenanced under ILO Convention 105.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Labor legislation sets a minimum
 employment age of 15 and prohibits night work and certain types of hazardous labor
 for those under 18. In practice, child employment is widespread, and young children
 of school age often perform menial tasks during the day in the market or collect
 fares on local buses. Observance of minimum age laws is eroded by local custom and
 economic circumstances that encourage children to work to help their families. Offi-
 cials occasionally punish violators of regulations prohibiting heavy labor and night
 work for children. Inspectors from the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare are re-
 sponsible for enforcement of child labor regulations. They visit each workplace an-
 nually and make spot checks whenever they receive allegations of violations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-In 1991 minimum standards for wages and
 working conditions were set by a tripartite commission composed of representatives
 of the Government, labor, and employers. The minimum wage rate combines wages
 with custoary benefits, such as a transportation allowance. The current daily mm-
 imumo wage of $0.76 (739 cedis) is insufcin for a single wage earner to su pport
 a family. In most cases households have multiple wage earners, some family farm-
 ing, and other family based commercial activities.
 The law sets the maximum workweek at 45 hours, with one break of at least 38
 consecutive hours eve7 7 days. Through collective bargaining, however, the basic
 workweek for  ost umonized workers is 40 hours. Occupational safety and health
 regulations are in effect, and the Labor Department of the Ministry of Health and
 Social Welfare occasionally imposes sanctions on violators. Safety insecor are few,
 however, and ploorly trained. They take action if matters are calledi to their atten-
 tion, but lack the resources to seek out violations. Workers have the right to with-
 draw themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued em-
 ployment, but they rarely exercise this right.
