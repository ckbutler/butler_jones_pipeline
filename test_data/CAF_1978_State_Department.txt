 CENTRAL AFRICAN EMPIRE
 
 Constitutional rule returned to the Central African
 Empire (CAE), after an eleven-year hiatus, in December
 1976 with the proclamation of the Empire. However, all
 individual civil and political rights are legally
 limited and are further subject to abridgement by direct
 intervention of the Government. The new Constitution
 contains a specific bill of rights which guarantees
 basic civil and religious liberties and some political
 rights. Plans call for national and party elections
 within a few months. Despite authoritarian rule and a
 single party system, the Central Africa record during
 the past decade on some aspects of human rights, e.g.,
 freedom of religion and opportunities for women, is
 fairly good.
 Several widely-publicized incidents -- including the
 detention of two western journalists in July 1977 and
 the elaborate coronation ceremony in December 1977
 diverting a large portion of the budget from pressing
 economic needs -- have focused attention on the country's
 human rights record. Official discussions with the
 United States have demonstrated a responsive sensitivity
 on human rights issues. The Government has made deci-
 sions designed to ameliorate the situation and stressed
 its intention to continue the current trend. The
 Government also approved attendance by the Director
 General of its justice Ministry and a leading lawyer at
 a human rights colloquium sponsored by the Rwandan
 Government.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The new Constitution contains a bill of rights patterned
 on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Torture
 is not specifically proscribed. All individuals are
 entitled to "security of the person". The extent to
 which torture is utilized, if at all, is unknown.
 
 
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is
 not sanctioned by law. Nonetheless, prison conditions
 are harsh. Beatings are a common form of discipline.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 According to law, detention without charges is limited
 to six days. At that point, a detainee must either be
 formally charged or permitted to go free. In practice,
 however, the preventive detention of perhaps several
 hundred persons a year occurs without judicial recourse.
 Four of the seven political prisoners reported by
 Amnesty International in February 1977 were released in
 December 1977.
 The mistreatment and jailing of a British journalist in
 July 1977 provoked considerable unfavorable publicity.
 As a result, the Government has made substantial efforts
 to accommodate the international press. No further
 incidents have occurred.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Officials in the national judicial system endeavor to
 insure that laws (patterned on the French system) are
 properly executed and that legal procedures are fairly
 and openly applied. However, because there are only a
 few trained personnel, the system is woefully inadequate
 to cope with the demands placed upon it. The result is
 inordinate delay severely hampering the efficient
 administration of justice.
 The Permanent Military Tribunal which had great judicial
 latitude is not provided for in the new Constitution and
 has apparently ceased to function.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the home is guaranteed in the new
 imperial Constitution. Except for infrequent abuses in
 politically-related cases, it is usually respected, and
 there have been no known instances recently.
 
 
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The development strategy of the government of the
 Central African Empire is summed up in the national
 slogan, "to clothe, to house, to feed, to care for, and
 to educate."
 Within the limited resources available to it and with
 the assistance of foreign donors, the nation has had
 some success in implementing this mandate. Expansion of
 health, education and agricultural services has high
 priority. The Ministry of Education receives the
 largest portion of government revenues, 24.4 percent of
 all expenditures. The ambitious 1976-81 five-year
 development plan focuses upon marketing and transpor-
 tation infrastructure, creation of skilled labor,
 and agricultural and animal husbandry.
 Corruption exists, although it is difficult to measure
 the extent of abuses. When caught, offending offi-
 cials are imprisoned. At least one former minister is
 currently serving a sentence for corruption.
 In the implementation of its development strategy, the
 Government appears to practice no discrmination on the
 basis of sex, ethnic, racial or religious considerations.
 The country's limited financial resources, poor infra-
 structure and skilled manpower constraints, however,
 limit its ability to deliver services and commodities
 effectively to many parts of the country.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of religion is generally respected; diverse
 religious organizations are protected by the new Consti-
 tution. The right of access to knowledge, association
 and privacy are protected, but not always observed;
 concern over security of the state takes precedence.
 International mail is regularly censored.
 
 
 The press is government-controlled and assembly for
 political purposes is subject to government authorization.
 The national trade union is sponsored and controlled by
 the Government.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Although there are security checks for travelers, there
 are few limitations on movement within the country.
 Economic rather than political factors restrict foreign
 travel and emigration. Borders with neighboring coun-
 tries are open and there is some informal nomadic
 movement.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 As part of the change from a republic to a monarchy in
 December 1976, the new Constitution fulfilled to some
 extent the Government's announced intent to restore
 representative institutions. The Constitution calls for
 creation of a national assembly which is to join the
 executive branch as one of the two main elements of the
 government, under the overall supervision of the Emperor.
 All adults are to be eligible to vote in party and
 national assembly elections. However, all deputies are
 to be required to be members of the sole political party
 and are to enjoy limited parliamentary immunity.
 Elections appear likely in 1979.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No outside independent organizations are known to have
 requested permission to investigate human rights viola-
 tions in the Central African Empire. Amnesty Interna-
 tional declined the Government's invitation to attend
 the December 1977 coronation ceremonies.
