 KAMPUCHEA
 1. Overview
 Nowhere in the world are human rights more beleagured than in
 Kampuchea. For the individual Khmer in 1979, the fundamental
 human right of survival was threatened.
 Following four years of brutality at the hands of the Pol Pot
 regime (Democratic Kampuchea or DK), the Khmer people in 1979
 were further victimized by famine, armed conflict and epidemic
 disease--the consequences of a massive Vietnamese invasion
 and occupation of their country.
 Beginning in 1975 the Pol Pot regime forced mass migration
 from cities to rural areas in an attempt to bring about a
 return to traditional Khmer agricultural techniques and to
 isolate the Khmer society from nearly all foreign contact and
 assistance. Extremely harsh living conditions in these rural
 areas were exacerbated by minimal food rations and non-
 existent medical care. The resulting disruption of food pro-
 duction, destruction of the urban-based public health system,
 and dislocation caused by the forced migration gravely weak-
 ened the stamina and health of the Khmer people. The Khmer
 population of seven million in 1975 appears to have decreased
 to approximately 5.5 million. In addition, the Pol Pot regime
 employed terror including widespread systematic torture and
 executions as a means of consolidating its control over the
 Khmer population. Many of those executed were officials of
 the former government, the educated elite, and those who had
 traveled abroad or had foreign contacts. The regime's cam-
 paign to purge Khmer society of its traditional Buddhist heri-
 tage and its assault on family life undermined the core of
 Khmer civilization.
 In late 1977, border tensions between the Government of Demo-
 cratic Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, which
 had been festering since 1975, brought shallow Vietnamese in-
 cursions and a year later a massive Vietnamese invasion which
 quickly spread throughout the country.
 2. The Vietnamese Invasion and Its Aftermath
 a. Life in Vietnamese Controlled Zone
 Many Khmer who suffered under Pol Pot's rule at first wel-
 comed the Vietnamese invaders as liberators. In the early
 weeks of the invasion, the Vietnamese forces disestablished
 the communal living patterns, liberalized food rations and
 loosened restrictions on social interaction. Buddism was
 permitted to reemerge.
 Acceptance of the Vietnamese was short-lived, however, because
 of widespread abuses by the occupying Vietnamese troops.
 Such abuses included seizure of food and personal property,
 the sale of international food assistance for gold, theft
 of religious and art treasures which subsequently appeared on
 the black market in Ho Chi Minh City, and instances of loot-
 ing and rape by Vietnamese soldiers. Many Khmer sought to
 escape to resistance areas or, much more frequently, to the
 safety of the Thai frontier. Anxious to maintain control
 over the population they had conquered, Vietnamese troops
 often shot escapees on sight, according to refugees. Ethnic
 Chinese among the Khmer population were singled out by the
 Vietnamese for especially harsh treatment and many were ex-
 pelled after being stripped of their possessions. For those
 
 (463)
 
 
 464
 Khmer who remained in Vietnamese controlled areas, conditions
 of life regressed to a level of suffering similar to that
 which they had endured during the years of brutal Pol Pot
 control; tightly regimented production teams and communal
 life were reinstituted.
 b. Life in DK Controlled Zones
 The Khmer also continued to suffer at the hands of Pol Pot
 forces which sought savage revenge on those Khmer believed to
 have cooperated with the Vietnamese invaders. Even villages
 where Vietnamese forces had merely passed through suffered
 brutal retribution once the Vietnamese had left the area.
 One refugee told of having seen in early March at Chup and
 Prey Muan, Siem Reap Province, large numbers of corpses of
 local villagers who, he was told, were slaughtered by DK
 forces after they were "contaminated" by the Vietnamese pre-
 sence. The DK regime continued its massive violations of
 human rights in 1979. For the general population under its
 control, the reign of terror, including capricious and syste-
 matic executions, continued, and conditions of livelihood
 were severe. Immediately after the Vietnamese invasion, the
 DK authorities butchered the most senior Muslim leader then
 thought to be in Kampuchea, Haji Res Abdullah. In those areas
 where the DK restored its control, it both exacted severe
 retribution against "collaborators", and restored forced com-
 munal living.
 3. The Struggle for Control of the Population
 As the Khmer-Vietnamese fighting increasingly took on the
 character of a protracted guerrilla struggle, both sides
 sought to control the population. Pol Pot troops forced
 people to follow them off productive land into remote, malaria-
 infested regions where the DK resistance was based.
 The Vietnamese encouraged and in some instances coerced move-
 ment of the population away from areas susceptible to Pol Pot
 influence. As a result, large squatter settlements, developed
 close to centers of Vietnamese control. In the spring for a
 brief peiod, the Vietnamese pressed ethnic Chinese Khmer to
 cross over the frontier into Thailand.
 The consequence of this population movement from agricultural
 lands, and Vietnamese confiscation of farming and fishing
 implements in some instances, combined with general insecurity
 through Kampuchea, drastically reduced the primitive agri-
 cultural system's capacity to assure sufficient food as it had
 in 1977-78. The resulting failure of the 1979 crop yield
 greatly exacerbated existing shortages caused by the Vietnamese
 invasion. Moreover, the Vietnamese reportedly denied food to
 populations not securely under their control in order to pre-
 vent it from reaching the resistance forces. These essen-
 tially man-made conditions and the tactics employed by both
 sides created the basis for the famine which swept Kampuchea
 in 1979.
 4. Food Denial and Diversion in the Vietnamese-Controlled
 Zone
 Vietnamese authorities in Kampuchea and the forces of their
 surrogate Heng Samrin implemented a policy of food denial and
 diversion from any Khmer whom they feared might aid the re-
 sistance. This resulted in starvation of scores of thousands
 and extreme suffering among many more.
 As the world community came to understand the severity of the
 
 
 465
 food shortages resulting from the disruptions and dislocations
 produced by the Vietnamese invasion and subsequent fighting,
 international concern about the plight of the Khmer people
 grew rapidly. The International Committee of the Red Cross
 and UNICEF, among others, sought early in February to make
 contact with the contending parties in order to arrange
 humanitarian assistance for civiliams caught up in the
 fighting. In July, after many weeks of negotiations, the
 ICRC and UNICEF received permission to enter Phnom Penh to dis-
 cuss modalities for launching an international humanitarian
 relief program for the Khmer. Not until September, however,
 was a plan tentatively accepted permitting the stationing of
 the nucleus of an international staff in Kampuchea.
 Thereafter, the Vietnamese (and the Heng Samrin forces)
 adopted tactics which obstructed the program and effectively
 blunted its scope. The Phnom Penh authorities permitted no
 international medical personnel into Kampuchea; refused to
 allow mechanics (who were essential to maintain the fleet of
 trucks needed for food transport) into Kampuchea; and refused
 to allow international humanitarian organizations to establish
 a communications system to coordinate relief flights and ship-
 ments from the outside. Although existing ports of entry
 were clearly inadequate to handle sufficient food and medicine
 to meet the needs of the Khmer people, the Vietnamese steadily
 refused to permit overland shipment of relief supplies from
 Thailand or to open regional airports to internal distribu-
 tion or to flights from points of supply outside of Kampuchea.
 In spite of this obstruction of the relief effort, relief sup-
 plies did begin to arrive in significant quantities toward
 the end 6f 1979, thanks to the determination of international
 relief officials. However, the incoming relief supplies
 remained stockpiled in warehouses at the ports of entry. In
 spite of the availability of increasing numbers of interna-
 tionally-supplied trucks (and hundreds of Vietnamese military
 vehicles), and the desperate need of Khmer civilians in the
 countryside, the Vietnamese undertook to distribute food only
 in the immediate environs of Phnom Penh. At year's end the
 Vietnamese submitted reports to International relief officials
 which accounted for the distrubution of less than ten percent
 of over 40,000 million tons of international food aid de-
 livered to ports of entry under Vietnamese control.
 As resentment to Vietnamese domination grew among the Khmer,
 the Vietnamese military sought to enforce stricter controls
 over the people. Central to the Vietnamese strategy was con-
 trol of food. In addition to extremely tight control of food
 distribution, the Vietnamese sought to preclude local food pro-
 duction in many areas. According to numerous reports from
 refugees from different areas of Kampuchea, Vietnamese/Heng
 Samrin forces attempted to prevent local Khmer from harvesting
 the meager 1979-80 rice crop. In late October-early November
 in Battambang, reports told of farmers ordered by local Viet-
 namese/Heng Samrin officials not to harvest local rice crops,
 but rather to permit Vietnamese forces to "take care of" the
 crop. Farmers disobeying these orders were subject to arrest
 and possible execution. Khmer in other areas, notably Siem
 Reap-Oddar Meanchey, told of rice fields being mined to pre-
 vent harvesting. Reports from Kompong Speu told of extreme
 food shortages and of Vietnamese policies forbidding local
 harvesting. A villager from Pursat reported that people there
 were reduced to harvesting rice by hand since Vietnamese
 troops had confiscated rice sickles.
 In a December 18 statement which echoed the frustration of
 many international relief officials in attempting to meet the
 
 
 466
 
 humanitarian needs of the Khmer people, the French chari-
 table organization Medecins-Sans-rontieres said:
 "Today, in Cambodia, children are dying of starva-
 tion in front of tons of rice. Humanitarian organ-
 izations investigating the problem are provided
 only with traditional guided tours by local of-
 ficials. After long efforts to look into the pro-
 blem the International Red Cross has declared
 publicly that aid is not being forwarded to its
 intended recipients. Some observers have tried to
 make us believe that Cambodia is being reborn and
 that food is being distributed. Faced with such
 lies, Medecins-Sans-Frontieres can no longer be
 silent."
 There were also frequent reports during 1979, which are dif-
 ficult to confirm, of Vietnamese diversion of international
 relief supplies. In early December, there was a
 report that relief supplies placed in warehouses in Kampong
 Som during the day were removed at night and shipped to
 Vietnamese military units. Refugees from Phnom Penh have also
 reported that sacks of international rice purchased from
 Thailand (easily identifiable because of their markings) were
 seen daily being delivered to Phnom Penh's markets by Peoples
 Army of Vietnam soldiers. In the markets--where rice was the
 principal medium of exchange--credible observers noted that
 SRV troops always had substantial quantities of rice to
 barter with, while the Khmer people had very little.
 5. Food Denial and Diversion in the Democratic Kampuchea
 Zone
 There are fewer reports on living conditions and food denial
 policies in the DK controlled zones, perhaps because those
 zones were substantially less extensive. It is clear, how-
 ever, that strict control of food (and medicines) is as much
 a part of the DK strategy as of Vietnamese.
 Khmer civilians walking to international border feeding
 stations to obtain relief supplies to carry back to their
 families deep in Kampuchea faced the hazard of confiscation
 of these supplies by DK as well as Vietnamese and Heng Samrin
 troops.
 Within the DK zone, available rations are not shared with
 needy civilians. International observers who have visited
 DK-controlled areas, or who have witnessed DK populations on
 the march in the Thai-Khmer frontier, have frequently remarked
 on the relative fitness of the DK in comparison to the women,
 children and elderly accompanying these forces. Any food
 produced !:. the DK zone remains under the control of DK
 authorities.
 6. Conclusion
 Vietnamese-PRK control of most of the Khmer population and
 territory places in their hands life or death decision about
 relief flow to millions of Khmer. Although relief supplies
 are moving from Thailand into areas along the Thai-Khmer
 border, including into resistance-controlled areas, and some
 relief is reaching Khmer in Vietnamese-controlled zones within
 100 kilometers of Phnom Penh, there are vast areas in the
 central, northern and western regions where several millions
 of people remain in desperate condition.
 While both sides claim to have improved conditions relevant
 to human rights concerns in their areas of control, including
 restoration of religious freedoms and other democratic
 rights, it remains clear that egregious violations of basic
 human rights continue under both the Vietnamese/Heng Samrin
 and Pol Pot leaderships, who continue to place political-
 military objectives ahead of the needs of those they claim
 to represent.
 There remains no constitution, no codified legal system and
 no meaningful attention to the rights of women and minorities
 in Kampuchea. Indeed, the fundamental issue of survival of
 the Khmer people themselves remains unaddressed.
 
 
 DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The North Korean government, or "Democratic People's
 Republic of Korea" (DPRK), was formed in 1948
 during the Soviet administration of the northern
 half nf the Korean peninsula; the North Korean
 people are subjected to rigid control measures
 similar to those in effect during the Stalin era
 in the USSR. Persons who fail to cooperate with
 the regime face imprisonment, confiscation of
 property, or enforced removal to remote villages.
 Observation by informers is so prevalent that the
 average citizen is distrustful of even his closest
 associates. Afiy movement from one area to another
 requires documentary permission. Punishment for
 "political crimes," a recognized category of
 offenses, is severe.
 The Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea is a
 closed, authoritarian collectivist state. Although
 some internationally respected human rights are
 acknowledged by the DPRK constitution and laws,
 individual rights are subordinated in practice to
 the overriding aim of imposing a social revolution
 and marshalling a show of unanimous popular
 support for the country's governing system and its
 leaders.
 The government is completely controlled by the
 Korean Workers' Party (Communist Party), which is
 in turn under the essential domination and control
 of one man, Kim Il-song, and his family. The
 latest constitution, promulgated in 1972, purports
 to guarantee a wide range of rights, including
 political processes; freedom of the press, religion,
 work,- and association; and freedom from sex
 discrimination. Other articles of that constitution
 eliminate or render meaningless the guarantee of
 those rights.
 The state's invasion of the individual's activities
 in North Korea goes well beyond those of assekbly
 and expression. The authorities attempt fully to
 shape the consciousness of the populace. Pre-
 school children are drilled in adulation of Kim
 Il-song and his family through memorization of
 poems and fables, while youths and adults are
 forced to participate in daily indoctrination
 sessions conducted by mandatory youth organizations
 or at places of employment. The daily work schedule,
 when combined with the forced indoctrination,
 leaves workers exhausted with almost no free time.
 This deprivation of freedom renders almost meaningless
 any rights the North Korean population might
 otherwise have and constitutes one of North Korea's
 strongest controls on its populace. The propaganda,
 
 (467)
 
 
 468
 which strives for ideological purity and for rote
 recitation of party maxims and positions, has
 succeeded in producing a society in which differences
 of opinion on political issues are never seen, at
 least by non-Koreans. The result is that North
 Korea's society is perhaps the most highly regimented
 and controlled in the world today. At least two
 North Korean security organizations enforce
 these controls.
 North Korea has adopted as its state philosophy-
 ideology Kim Il-song's pronouncements on "juche,"
 or self-reliance. Kim's thoughts and actions, as
 well as the exaggerated or invented histories of
 Kim's relatives, are preached with such zeal,
 repetition, and thoroughness to the North Korean
 populace that they become the closest thing to
 religion that North Koreans have. Unlike religion,
 however, detailed knowledge of and reverence to
 Kim Il-song are not optional in any way; there is
 no choice but to follow the "beloved fatherly
 leader."
 Virtually no outside information, other than that
 approved and Oisseminated by the North Korean
 authorities, is allowed to reach the North Korean
 public. Foreigners who have traveled to P'yongyang
 have been surprised to learn how little the North
 Korean populace knows of the outside world.
 Despite North Korean claims of being a "socialist
 society," the DPRX is far from "classless."
 Security ratings for each individual are based on
 such considerations as whether any of the individual's
 relatives or associates collaborated with the
 Japanese occupation, attempted to defect, or came
 from suspect areas where there has been resistance
 to the regime. These ratings determine access to
 certain schools, positions, stores, as well as
 admission to the Korean Workers' Party, the route
 to the highest levels and privileges of the
 society. Any individual whose relative or close
 family associate has gone to South Korea will be
 treated as suspect by the North Korean authorities.
 Ideological considerations and control mechanisms
 have come to differentiate North Koreans into"
 highly stratified classes, with the governing
 minority perched clearly on.the top.
 Just as little outside information reaches North
 Koreans, little information on them reaches the
 outside world. The tight controls enforced on
 both Koreans and visiting foreigners by the North
 Korean regime render it difficult to obtain
 specific information on the society. The regimentation
 has been readily visible to every visitor, but
 information on specific criminal-justice procedures
 has been almost completely unavailable. Torture
 is outlawed but reportedly practiced on those
 
 
 469
 accused of "political" offences. Its use on
 suspected "spies" is a matter of policy and record --
 for example, the Pueblo crew in 1968 was beaten,
 starved, and otherise abused. In this regard, an
 account released by Amnesty International on the
 imprisonment in North Korea of Venezuelan poet Ali
 Lameda has given valuable specific information for
 this report. Other details have been provided
 over time by visitors and by the trickle of persons
 who are able to escape or otherwise leave North
 Korea.
 A special aspect of North Korean performance in
 the human rights arena is its treatment of Koreans
 originally resident abroad who elect to immigrate
 to North Korea, the overwhelming majority of whom
 have come from Japan. While the DPRK strives to
 coax these persons of Korean ancestry to North
 Korea for propaganda and possibly labor purposes,
 its reception for such immigrants does not match
 its promises. The immigrant has his property
 confiscated, is placed under close surveillance
 because of his "corruption" by Western exposure,
 is given a smaller food allotment than other North
 Korean citizens, and is restricted from visits by
 family members still resident abroad, except in
 areas that are carefully controlled to allow North
 Korean monitoring of all things said by the immigrant.
 Those who hint at negative aspects of the DPRK or
 imply a desire to emigrate are severely punished.
 Many of those immigrating to the DPRK are never
 again heard from by relatives and friends remaining
 outside.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Ali Lameda's report on his imprisonment explains
 that torture and beating were used on Korean
 prisoners during interrogation, although physical
 torture was not used on Ali Lameda and a fellow-
 foreigner, Jacques Sedillot. Crew members pf the
 Pueblo were beaten. Further information is N
 unavailable.
 b.   Cruel,, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 Lameda reports deprivation of food to force "confessions,"
 as well as solitary confinement, continuous interrogation,
 enforced waking periods, poor or non-existent
 medical treatment, and deprivation of visits,
 parcels, correspondence, writing materials, newspapers,
 and clothing changes. Prisoners are reportedly
 regarded as persons without rights.
 
 
 470
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The North Korean constitution explains that an
 individual exists only for the benefit of the
 collective whole; citizens must strictly display
 a high degree of collective spirit; vigilence is
 necessary against opponents of the socialist
 system, who are "hostile elements"; and the
 courts are to protect the socialist system, not
 the individual citizen. These provisions allow
 arrest without charge and imprisonment for long
 periods without trial. Lameda was reportedly
 told that his requests for a lawyer of his choice
 and an open trial were "bourgeois." Persons are
 imprisoned for political crimes, both those of
 conscience and those of overt acts. Imprisonment
 is jiistified by the supremacy of the state over
 individual interests and rights.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Lameda was twice denied public trial. After his
 first arrest he was imprisoned for a year without
 a hearing; after the second, he was put through a
 closed session without benefit of counsel of his
 choice or even knowledge of the charges. In the
 past, North Korea has purged individuals or
 groups from positions in the government or party
 without public trial. Those purged from party or
 government positions have frequently disappeared
 from public view; one cannot ascertain the "punish-
 ments" meted out for falling out of party favor.
 There is no effective right of counsel. North
 Korean media contain no reports of trials, and
 the closed nature of that society prevents further
 knowledge of whether trials are public or fair.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The North Korean Constitution guarantees to
 citizens the inviolability of person and residence.
 Lameda reported, however, that his residence was
 not respected and that listening devices were
 used against him. The obvious monitoring~arrangements
 and evidence of constraint on North Koreans7o1
 those rare occasions when their overseas relatives
 have a chance to meet them, as well as North
 Korea's unremitting effort to bend and control
 the thoughts of its populace, lend little credence
 to claims that the regime respects inviolability.
 of person or residence.
 
 
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care, and Education
 North Korea provides free health care and education
 to all eligible citizens, while food and shelter
 are provided at nominal cost. Basic foodstuffs
 such as rice and cabbage are reportedly rationed
 for equal distribution, and there are no reports
 of malnutrition or starvation, although the
 populace is denied beef, pork, and other "premium"
 foods, which are reserved for the elite. Distribution
 of other material goods, as well as access to the
 privileges of travel, information on the outside
 world, the best health care, and special schools
 are strictly limited to the highest levels of the
 party and government. Even North Korea's relatively
 positiv record in distribution of the most basic
 necessities must be set against a background of
 its consistent use of about 20% of the GNP for
 military purposes, the second-highest level in the
 world. This policy seriously stunts the progress
 of the overall civilian economy and delays rewards
 for the Korean people's efforts. North Korea has
 attempted to excuse the harsh penalties on life-
 style exacted by its military spending by citing
 need for defense against attack from the South.
 The North's program of building a huge army arrayed
 in clearly offensive deployment belies these
 claims.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The North Korean constitution states that all
 citizens have freedom of speech, press, assembly,
 association, and demonstration. In practice,
 however, those rights are nullified by other
 articles of the constitution which require citizens
 strictly to obey the "socialist norms of life" and
 to obey a "collective spirit." All political
 activities are dictated by the Korean Workers
 Party, which also controls the individual's place
 of residence and work. The party has promulgated
 rules preventing, among other things, workers'
 transfers that would affect production schedules
 or marriages that would require relocation of
 either of the two workers concerned. Although
 freedom of religion is also allegedly guaranteed,
 North Korea in fact severely persecuted Christians
 and Buddhists from the late 1940's, using enforced
 membership in North Korean "religious organizations"
 as a means to identify and control these groups
 and individuals. Pyongyang uses the remaining
 organizational facades to proclaim the practice of
 religious freedom, but has long since purged the
 
 57-265 0 - 80 - 31
 
 
 472
 memberships out of existence. All media in North
 Korea are strictly controlled by the authorities,
 and there is no freedom of the press.
 b.   Freedom of Movement within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Internal travel is more restricted in North Korea
 than in probably any other state; documents are
 required for any movement away from the vicinity
 of one's residence or place of work. A system of
 frequent checks is maintained by the police. In
 this regard, Pyongyang is unique among Asian
 capitals in its lack of bicycles, which the North
 Korean regime has apparently suppressed to reduce
 mobility. Foreign travel is limited strictly to
 DPRK officials or showcase performers. Tourism,
 even to allied Communist countries, is unknown.
 Emigration, which would be entirely inconsistent
 with North Korea's internal line that there is no
 finer existence than that in the DPRK, is completely
 suppressed.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The constitution states that all citizens above
 the age of 17 may vote and be elected, but the
 political processes are under the total domination
 of the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party,
 which is headed by Kim Il-song, who also heads
 the government. The legislature, the Supreme
 People's Assembly, is a rubber-stamp body which
 has never taken any action other than unanimous
 passage of resolutions presented to it. In an
 effort to create an appearance of democracy,
 North Korea has sanctioned several "minority
 parties," but these exist only as rosters of
 officials (completely supporting the government
 lines) and in token representation in the National
 Assembly. The right to assemble is strictly
 controlled by the party and the state security
 organizations. The average citizen is completely
 excluded from any real participation in the
 political process unless he becomes a memlber.of
 the Korean Workers' Party (KWP), the selectioh
 process for entrance to which is long and rigorous.
 Even the lower levels of the KWP have no voice,
 serving only to carry out the fiats, decrees, and
 "on-the-spot guidance" promulgated by the party's
 leadership, dominated by Kim Il-song, who has
 filled other positions in the leadership with
 family members or cronies. The North Korean
 Constitution purports to give equal rights to
 women, but few reach the higher levels of party
 and government. Trade-union activity is controlled
 for and by the state; notable in this regard is
 the reported lack of concern or equipment for
 safety in North Korea's factories and mines.
 4.   Governmental Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Amnesty International has requested a visit to
 North Korea; Pyongyang has given no response.
