 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a one-party state in which individual rights, basic
 freedoms, and due process are generally respected while some
 political rights are restricted. Mucb of the power is
 concentrated in the hands of the President, Kenneth Kaunda, who
 was reelected without opposition to his fifth consecutive
 5-year term in 1983. He is advised by a central committee of
 party leaders and governs through a Cabinet and a Parliament.
 Candidates for political office at any level must be members of
 the United National Independence Party (UNIP), but there is
 strong competition for parliamentary seats within the
 single-party structure. The President possesses sweeping
 powers--conferred on him by emergency legislation which dates
 from 1964--to suspend observance of legal rights in the
 "interest of state security." The Constitution also allows the
 National Assembly to suspend basic constitutional guarantees.
 The Zambian Intelligence and Security Service is tasked with
 intelligence gathering and counterespionage responsibilities.
 In 1986 laws creating a volunteer vigilante force under the
 Ministry of Home Affairs were enacted. Urban crime and
 smuggling are widespread and growing, severely taxing the
 limited capabilities of Zambia's police and military forces.
 Food riots in Lusaka, the capital, and several other cities in
 mid-December further strained the security forces and saw the
 first use of army troops in a civil disorder in 20 years.
 Zambia's economy continues to be severely depressed due to
 factors such as high debt servicing, low prices for the
 country's mineral exports, low agricultural production, and
 internal management problems. Also, the rapid rate of
 population growth is outstripping increases in productivity.
 There has been a continuing decline in the standard of living,
 but the Government is taking steps to improve management of the
 economy and to encourage the private sector.
 Following a South African airstrike against Zambia on May 19,
 there were widespread detentions of persons suspected of being
 South African spies. A number of these people, primarily white
 foreigners, were mistreated, sometimes severely. Several
 governments formally protested mistreatment of their nationals
 while under detention.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no killings for which there was evidence of
 political motivation or government instigation.
 b. Disappearance
 No cases of politically motivated disappearance were known to
 have occurred.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, but there are credible
 allegations that police and military personnel have resorted to
 torture when interrogating detainees. A number of foreign
 
 
 365
 ZAMBIA
 nationals have alleged that they were detained and tortured in
 order to extract confessions that they were foreign agents.
 The courts frequently order investigations to ascertain if
 confessions or statements were made after torture or physical
 or mental mistreatment and have consistently rejected
 statements obtained under duress. Abuses of prisoners are
 reported to include beatings, sexual abuse, pain inflicted on
 various parts of the body, long periods of solitary
 confinement, and threats of execution or physical
 mistreatment. Prisoners have successfully sued the State for
 damages as a result of prison abuses.
 Zambian prisons are severely overcrowded, understaffed, and
 unsanitary. In the past 21 years, the prison population has
 grown from 5,000 to 11,000 with no corresponding growth in
 facilities. Medical facilities are meager, but prisoners with
 serious medical problems are treated in public hospitals.
 Prisoners are generally segregated by sex, seriousness of
 offense, and age group. There is no institutional
 differentiation in the treatment of different categories of
 prisoners charged or convicted under civil or criminal statutes.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the state of emergency, in effect since independence in
 1964, the President has broad discretion to detain or restrict
 the movements of persons. Detention procedures have been
 revised to conform with the provisions of the Constitution and
 have increased the President's authority. The President can
 order that a detainee be incarcerated indefinitely and is not
 legally bound to accept a court's ruling of acquittal if he
 still believes that the detainee is guilty. In practice,
 however, detainees are almost always released if the court
 finds in their favor. By law, presidential detainees are
 entitled to formal notification of the reasons for their
 detention within 14 days of arrest; publication of their
 detention in the government Gazette; access to counsel;
 frequent visitation by family and colleagues; immediate
 representation to the detaining authority; and the right to
 seek judicial review of the detention order by an independent
 and impartial tribunal after 1 year. Presidential detainees
 have their cases heard by the High Court and have the right to
 appeal to the Supreme Court.
 It is estimated that approximately 25 presidential detainees
 are currently held in Zambia. During 1986 presidential
 detention was used to arrest about 20 persons. Most of the
 detainees are seeking their release through court actions, but
 this can be a slow process which takes anywhere from a few
 months to several years. Detainees can sue the State for
 unlawful detention and false imprisonment.
 The 22-year old state of emergency also gives law officers and
 defense personnel extraordinary powers. Police officers of
 assistant inspector rank and above may arrest without a warrant
 and detain a person for up to 28 days if the officer has reason
 to believe that a presidential detention order is justified.
 Police must provide the detainee with the reasons for his
 detention within 14 days of arrest. However, there are
 credible reports that these rights are not always respected.
 Security officers have broad powers to search suspects and
 their homes and sometimes act without warrants when looking for
 smugglers or illegal aliens.
 
 
 366
 ZAMBIA
 Slavery, involuntary servitude, and forced labor are prohibited
 by the Constitution. These prohibitions are observed in
 practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Zambian judicial system consists of a Supreme Court with
 appellate powers and a series of lower courts, of which the
 High Court is the most important. Presidential detainees are
 not automatically guaranteed public trials, but the majority
 have been tried in public. The safeguards of English common
 law are provided in court cases not involving presidential
 detainees. Independent observation confirms the independence
 of the Zambian judiciary from executive branch influence. The
 President's power to appoint and transfer judges has sometimes
 been cited as proof that judicial independence can be
 compromised. However, there is no evidence that such power has
 swayed court decisions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government does not require membership in political
 organizations and usually does not monitor correspondence or
 telephones or otherwise interfere in family life. The sanctity
 of the home is generally respected, except in isolated
 incidents relating to the national emergency or to roundups of
 illegal aliens. In such cases, security forces often enter the
 homes of suspects without search warrants.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is considerable freedom of press and speech in Zambia,
 and the press regularly reports criticism of government
 activities expressed by sources ranging from elected officials
 to average citizens. The two national dailies are owned by the
 Government and the party respectively, but substantial
 commentary critical of party and government performance is
 permitted. The papers discuss economic policy, corruption, and
 poor administration. However, negative comments concerning the
 Head of State, the concept of the one-party state, or the
 national philosophy, "Humanism", are prohibited. Journalists
 and commentators know the limits of criticism and also avoid
 reporting which could lead to charges of libel and slander.
 An independent biweekly paper, which is sometimes critical of
 official policies, is published by an association of churches,
 and two other independent papers focus on mining and financial
 subjects. Television and radio are owned and operated by the
 Government, but frequent panel discussion programs provide for
 a wide range of views on Zambian issues.
 While the possibility of censorship of foreign publications and
 news items exists, it is seldom invoked. Academic freedom is
 highly respected in Zambian society, and educators are
 outspoken in their commitment to an educational system free of
 government influence. There is little or no governmental
 influence in matters relating to curriculum, student selection,
 or faculty assignment.

 ZAMBIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Police permits are required for meetings, rallies, or marches.
 These permits are issued routinely, unless the Government
 believes the proceedings are likely to be directed against
 local authorities. While there is a ban on all political
 activity outside the one-party structure, Zambia has a
 profusion of trade associations and professional groups which
 can serve as unofficial pressure groups on various economic,
 political, and social subjects.
 Zambia has a-history of strong labor union organizations,
 dating from the establishment of large copper mines during the
 1930's. Zambia's 18 national labor unions, which are organized
 by industry or profess ion, are all members of the Zambia
 Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU). Member unions defend worker
 interests, especially regarding wages and conditions of work,
 and have the right to bargain collectively. Under existing
 legislation, strikes are permitted only for specific reasons
 and only after all other-recourse has been exhausted.
 Virtually all strikes are illegal, since they almost always
 commence before the mandatory process of mediation has run its
 course. However, the Government has normally relied on
 persuasion and continued mediation, to end strikes once they
 have begun. A series of wildcat strikes during 1985, involving
 workers in such important sectors as finance and mining,
 resulted in a government decree declaring workers in most
 sectors of the economy "essential" and therefore liable to
 prosecution for illegal strike action. However, the Government
 has yet to invoke this decree. The ZCTU is not controlled by
 the party or Government, and union leaders frequently criticize
 government policy on such subjects as wages, economic policy
 conditions of service, and.labor representation in party and
 government organs. The ZCTU is-democratic and regularly
 conducts open elections to select its leadership. It is active
 in the International Labor Organization and is a member of the
 organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed and has been
 publicly supported by President Kaunda. Zambia has no state
 religion, and adherence to a particular faith does not confer
 either advantage or disadvantage. Christian missionaries from
 a wide variety of faiths operate in the country. While
 Jehovah's Witnesses are prohibited from proselytizing, the sect
 functions openly, and its freedom not to participate in various
 secular activities such as voting, singing the national anthem,
 and saluting the flag, has been upheld in the courts and
 supported by senior party leaders. Lay associations and
 religious youth groups operate independently of party control
 or influence.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The President may, under the emergency legislation, restrict
 the movement of persons within Zambia, although this authority
 is seldom if ever used. The Government also reserves the right
 to refuse to issue or to withdraw passports to prevent foreign
 travel by persons whose activities are considered inimical to
 Zambian interests. Such restrictions are occasionally
 applied. Strict currency regulations also serve to inhibit
 foreign travel or emigration.
 
 
 368
 ZAMBIA
 Acquisition, loss, or revocation of citizenship is governed by
 constitutional provisions and laws administered by the
 citizenship board. However, the President also has power to
 grant or revoke citizenship on an extraordinary basis.
 Zambia has long played host to a considerable refugee
 population that originates in several strife-torn southern
 African countries. The United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that there are approximately 130,000
 refugees in Zambia. The largest group of refugees is from
 Angola, with significant numbers from Zaire, Namibia,
 Mozambique, and South Africa. Smaller numbers are from Malawi
 and Zimbabwe. Many of the Angolans and Zaireans have
 spontaneously resettled in western and northwestern provinces
 respectively since the ethnic compositions on both sides of the
 border are similar. The Zambian Government operates two large
 refugee resettlement centers, and the Southwest African
 People's Organization operates one camp.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since 1973, the United National Independence Party, with an
 estimated membership of less than 10 percent of the adult
 population, has been Zambia's sole legal political party.
 Power is concentrated in the hands of the President as leader
 of the party and Head of State. He plays a dominant role in
 determining the membership of Zambia's top executive
 institutions, the party central committee, and the Cabinet,
 although traditionally both bodies contain a general balance of
 regional and tribal representation.
 Candidates for political office at any level must be members of
 the party and are subject to close examination for suitability
 by senior party authorities. In practice, the political system
 is open to individuals of somewhat divergent opinions provided
 they are willing to work within the one-party structure and not
 challenge the President's preeminent position. In the latest
 parliamentary elections in 1983, 760 candidates contested 125
 seats; 40 incumbents were defeated, including 7 ministers of
 state.
 The National Assembly is reflective of constituent interests
 and sometimes thwarts or modifies executive branch policies and
 programs. It can also be critical of such policies, as was
 demonstrated a number of times in 1986 when members of
 Parliament railed against government expenditures, poor
 services, and economic reforms. Presidential and general
 elections are by universal suffrage, but the numbering of
 ballots, which could be cross-checked against voter
 registration numbers, could undermine the secrecy of the ballot.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 While there is no public record of the Zambian Government
 having been subject to such investigations during 1986, the
 Government neither encourages nor hinders inquiries or visits
 by human rights organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Economic and social needs and cultural aspirations are met on a
 generally nondiscriminatory basis in Zambia.
 
 
 369
 ZAMBIA
 Under statutory law, women generally enjoy full equality with
 men, and women participate increasingly in Zambia's social,
 economic, and political life. They hold some senior positions
 in the party, the Government, and the judiciary and are gaining
 increasing representation in the professions and higher
 education. In 1986 there were 3 women on the party's 25-member
 central committee. Nevertheless, the majority of Zambian women
 still occupy traditional roles. Customary law and practice
 still compete on a de facto basis in most rural areas with
 Zambia's Constitution and codified laws. Customary statutes
 place women in subordinate or unequal status with respect to
 property, inheritance, and marriage. The Law Development
 Commission is seeking ways to remove such anomalies. In
 Zambia's traditional society, women's primary role is bearing
 and raising children. They also make a major contribution to
 food production. Female students can be admitted to secondary
 school with lower passing marks than male students as part of
 Zambia's "affirmative action" program.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Zambian law regulates minimum health and safety standards and
 worker rights in any industrial undertaking. Boards appointed
 by the Government, which include worker and employer
 representatives, fix minimum wages, overtime pay rates, and
 conditions of employment. Women are excluded from night work
 and a variety of hazardous occupations. Age restrictions apply
 to the industrial sector, and there are only a few cases of
 employees under age 16. However, persons under age 14 are
 often employed in the commercial and agricultural sectors.
