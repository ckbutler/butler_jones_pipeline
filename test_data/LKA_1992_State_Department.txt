 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka's constitutional, multi party form of government features a strong exec-
 utive presidency and a unicameral legislature elected by universal adult suffrage.
 President Ranasinghe Premadasa was elected to a 6-year term in 1988, and his
 United National Party (UNP) won a majority of seats in Parliament in 1989. The
 violent ethnic conflict waged for nearly 10 years between the Government and the
 Liberation Tiers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), an organization fighting for a separate
 state for the Tamil minority continued in 1992. The LTTE, in an effort to drive the
 Muslim and Sinhalese population out of the predominately Tamil northern province
 and the mixed Tamil/Muslim/Sinhalese eastern province, escalated its attacks on in-
 nocent civilians from these two communities. Armed Muslim groups retaliated by
 massacring innocent Tamils, and the resulting tensions further complicated the
 search for a peaceful solution to the war.
 The 25,000-member police force, which includes 2,000 police commandos in the
 special task force, provides for internal security. Responding to the insurgency, the
 Government has expanded its armed forces to 60,000 members. According to the
 U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, total military expenditures for 1989
 were $223 million. Due to the continued fightin  defense sending has increased
 and will continue to do so for the near future. The army, whose roops are poorly
 trained and inadequately equipped, has borne the brunt of the fighting with the
 L=E. The 8,000 to 10,000 paramilitary home guards are charged with providing
 security against LTTE attacks for the Muslim and Sinhalese communities in the
 northeast. Except for the Muslim home guards, security personnel are overwhelm-
 ingly Sinhalese. All security elements were responsible for human rights abuses.
 Sri Lanka's mixed economy depends heavily on exports of tea, textiles, and rub-
 ber. Despite a continuing fiscal drain caused by large military outlays, the economy
 grew by almost 5 percent in 1991. This wasprimarily due to economic reform, in-
 cluding the removal of most price controls and subsidies, the lowering of tariffs, and
 a reduction in the size of the government bureaucracy.
 Although the level of violence continued to decline somewhat from what it had
 been 2 years ago, there were still serious human rights abuses. There were an esti-
 mated 650 extrajudicial and combat-related civilian deaths, at least 125 of which
 were attributed to deliberate attacks by the security forces. There were also some
 200 disappearances--a sharp reduction from 1991-most of which were attributed
 to the security forces. Other problems included torture and abuse of detainees; arbi-
 trary arrest and detention; and restrictions on freedoms of speech, press, assembly,
 and association. The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and the Emergency Regula-
 tions (ER), both of which give security forces wide powers such as preventive and
 incommunicado detention, remained in effect and were the source of many abuses.
 However the Government does appear to be making efforts to end human rights
 abuses. These efforts included the continued implementation of Amnesty Inter-
 national (A) and United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) rec-
 ommendations accepted by the Government in 1991; folowup visits by those organi-
 zations in 1992; and permitting International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 access to detainees as well as ICRC human rights training for security forces. Ac-
 cording to knowledgeable observers, attacks on civilians by government forces ap-
 pear to be the result of lapses in discipline rather than policy decisions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The Government's security forces,
 the LTTE, and other militant groups continued to engage in political killing on a
 large scale. At least 125 deaths were reliably attributable to deliberate attacks by
 government forces; most occurred in and around Sri Lanka's eastern province.
 Unlike in previous years, however, there were no reports of killings by govern-
 ment-sponsored vigilante groups. There were less than 10 reports of extrajudicial
 executions or political killings by the security forces in the south, an area where
 thousands died in past years. On the other hand, the government security forces in
 Batticaloa district, in the Eastern province, had a particularly bad record. The
 
 
 1175
 killings there included extrajudicial executions of suspected LIPE cadres, civilians
 shot while fleeing from the army, and a number of apparently random killings. In
 one incident, reliable sources reported that 10 noncombatants, including several
 people over 60 years of age, were deliberately killed by the army near
 Kokkadichcholai in Batticaloa district in late June. In July the handcuffed bodies
 of five people arrested in an army cordon and search operation in the same district
 were discovered. All five had been shot in the head at close range.
 The LTTE is believed to have committed at least 400 politically motivated
 killings, most involving indiscriminate attacks on civilians (see Section 1.g.). Press
 reports from the LTTE-controlled northern peninsula also indicate that the LITE
 summarily executed 37 'traitors" and "deserters" during July. Credible sources also
 blamed the LTrE for a number of extrajudicial executions in the eastern province
 but it was impossible to determine exactly how many. On August 8 a bomb killed
 a group of 10 senior military officers. The LIrE claimed responsibility. In Novem-
 ber, Navy Chief Clancy Fernando was killed by a motorcycle bomb on a crowded
 Colombo street. Fernando had been targeted by the LITE, who claimed responsibil-
 ity for his assassination.
 Quasi-independent irregular forces armed by the Government, including Muslim
 home guards and anti-LTTE Tamil militias (which fight alongside the army and
 draw an army salary), were responsible for roughly 120 deaths. In several separate
 incidents, Muslim home guards responded to LTr'E attacks on Muslim civilians by
 massacring dozens of Tamil civilians (see Section 1.g.). The anti-LTE Tamil groups
 wer also responsible for several killings, including the April 14 execution of seven
 civilians in the eastern district of Ampara. While both these gups are nominally
 under government control, discipline exercised over them has been lax, particularly
 in the case of the home guards, among whom communal passions have sometimes
 overwhelmed attempts to impose discipline.
 Moves to punish security force members for past human rights abuses showed lit-
 tle progress. The Commission of Inquiry appointed to investigate the June 1991
 massacre of 67 civilians at Kokkadichcholai found the army responsible but said it
 lacked sufficient evidence to indict specific individuals for the attack. The army then
 announced that it would try 1 officer and 19 soldiers in a military court. The officer
 was convicted on two charges and was cashiered. The 19 soldiers were acquitted.
 Although the officer became the first one ever tried and punished for his role in a
 massacre, his light sentence and the other acquittals raised doubts about the Gov-
 ernment's willingness to punish members of the military for abuses.
 However, the local police, the district magistrate, and the local military com-
 mander were carrying out investigations into the August 9 killings of 35 Tamil civil-
 ians at Mailanthani in the eastern province. Ten survivors of the attack had identi-
 fied 16 soldiers from a nearby army camp as perpetrators of the massacre. There
 were also a number of ongoing investigations of and judicial proceedings against po-
 lice officers accused of past human rights violations, but as of year's end none of
 those cases had resulted in a member of the security forces being convicted and pun-
 ished for human rights violations.
 At least a dozen court cases are known to be pending against police officers or
 others accused of murder during the height of the campaign against the Janatha
 Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), an extremist Sinhalese revolutionary group. These
 cases, which date from 1988-1991, have proceeded slowly owing partly to killing
 and intimidation of witnesses and partly to a large backlog in the judicial system
 and the fact that such cases are not given special priority.
 Another case involving the son of a UNP politician and nine others (including sev-
 eral military men) accused of murdering three university students in 1988 is bein
 heard in the court of Colombo's Chief Magistrate. No progress was made toward
 identifying and punishing those responsible for murdering Richard De Zoysa in Feb-
 ruary 1990 (see Country eports for 1990 and 1991).
 b. Disappearance.-Since 1983 some 12,000 persons disappeared in Sri Lanka.
 The overall number of disappearances declined during 1992, from nearly 900 in
 1991 to somewhat over 200 in 1992. Most of the disappearances took place in the
 eastern province and were centered around the district of Batticaloa, where reliable
 observers estimate that over 150 people had disappeared. Nearly 50 disappearance
 occurred in other districts of the north and east, such as Jaffna and Trincomalee.
 Regular army troops and army special forces were believed responsible for most, if
 not all, of these disappearances. They appear to have resulted from a lack of dis-
 cipline, compounded, however, by a climate of impunity, as abuses were perpetrated
 by local commanders acting outside the chain of command. The security forces are
 believed responsible for the fewer than 10 disapearances that occurred in the south.
 Observers in the eastern province reported that the LTTE was responsible for a
 number of disappearances in that area during 1992, but it was impossible to deter-
 
 
 1176
 mine exactly how many. In addition, 300 persons believed captured by the LTTE
 in 1991 remain unaccounted for, the LTrE -has refused all requests for information
 concerning their fate.
 The Government's decision to give the ICRC unhindered access to detention cen-
 ters, police stations, and army camps played an important role in reducing the num-
 ber of disappearances attributable to the security forces, particularly in the south.
 The work of the Human Rights Task Force (HRTF), a quasi-independent govern-
 ment body set up to register detainees held under the ER and PTA and monitor
 their welfare, has also been important in this regard, though the HRTF is still hin-
 dered by a lack of resources and less than full cooperation by the security forces.
 The term of the Presidential Commission appointed to inquire into allegations of
 abductions and disappearances occurring afer January 11, 1991, was extended in
 1992 for an additional year, but the Government declined to extend the Commis-
 sion's mandate to cover cases occurring before January 1991. As of September 1992,
 the Commission had received some 3,000 complaints of disappearances, 453 of which
 fell within its mandate. The Commission completed its inquiry into only seven of
 these cases and forwarded its recommendations to the President, who wll decide
 what, if any, legal action to t ak e. Local and international human~ rights organiza-
 tions criticized thie Commission's slow progress, the result of a narrow legal man-
 date and strictly defined standards of evidence. Each of the seven reports so far
 completed by the Commission has been over 500 pages fong.
 In a case involving the abduction and disappearance of 32 young men from the
 town of Embilipitia i~n 1989, the persons allegedly responsible were publicly identi-
 fied by the Chairmnan of the ITRTF, but no legal action has so far been taken against
 them.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution forbids torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment or punishment, the ER allow the use in court of confessions made to police
 officers and place the burden of proof on defendants to show that a confession was
 extrIated under duress. Beatings are routinely given during interrogations, and se-
 vere beatings or torture were reported by many detainees during 1992. Some gov-
 ernment security officials acknowledged that security forces used torture to elicit in-
 formation and cooperation from suspected members of the LiTE. Women's rights ac-
 tivists reported that female detainees were sometimes sexuall assaulted while in
 detention during 1992 but did not have precise statistics on tie number of cases.
 Victims and their family members also reported severe mistreatment of prisoners
 held by the L  IrE.
 Several cases were frled in the Supreme Court on behalf of detainees who claimed
 to have been beatin or tortured by members of the security forces during 1992. In
 atleast onecase thecourt orderedthe Governmentto paymonetary compensation
 to the victim, but no members of the security forces were known to have been pun-
 ished.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-By law authorities must inform an ar-
 rested person of the reason for his arrest and within 24 hours bring him before a
 magistrate who may authorize bail or, for serious crimes, order continued detention.
 Detainees are generally brought before a magistrate within a few days of arrest, but
 there continued to be reports of detainees who are never informed of the reasons
 for their arrest. A suspect may also be detained without bail up to 3 months or
 longer if a court so rules.
 The PTA, adopted in 1979, and the ER, which must be renewed monthly by Par-
 liament with the extension of the state of emergency in effect since 1983, provide
 exceptions to the above rules, and both permit preventive and incommunicado de-
 tention. A person held under the PTA may be detained without charge for up to 18
 months, though there have been cases in which persons have been held longer.
 Under the ER, security forces may detain a suspect for up to 3 months before he
 must be presented to a magistrate. Magistrates are not empowered to investigate
 the circumstances leading to a person's arrest and continued detention but must re-
 mand him to a prison where he may be held in preventive detention indefinitely.
 Courts may grant bail for persons held under the ER, but this ha ppens only infre-
 quently; once charged, PTA detainees are ineligible for bail. Visits by family and ac-
 cess to lawers are normally restricted under these laws.
 The Hig Courts may order that any detainee be produced at any time, and per-
 sons detained under the ER and the PT A may challenge the legality of their deten-
 tion by filing habeas oesus petitions in the Court o  Apeals or by charing the
 Government befor    e Supreme Court with violating fundamentaconstitutional
 rights. Over 380 habeas corpus petitions were fled during 1992, but only a few de-
 tainees were released. More than 500 fundamental rights cases were filed during
 the same period, with the result that some 200 people were released from detention.
 
 
 1177
 In some cases, detainees who were released were also awarded monetary compensa-
 tion. The legal requirement that fundamental rights cases be filed within 30 days
 of the alleged infringement was relaxed; the law now requires only that such cases
 be fied within 'a reasonable period" after the date of the alleged infringement. This
 requirement had made it virtually impossible for persons detained incommunicado
 or relatives of detainees to bring such suits.
 In August the HRTF released its first annual report. According to the report, the
 task force visited 7,356 people in 166 places of detention, including prisons, deten-
 tion centers, rehabilitation camps, police stations, and army camps. In resonse to
 recommendations made by Al, the HRTF opened offices in severaf provincia towns,
 set up a 24-hour information "hot line," and began assisting detainees in need of
 medical or legal aid. The Chairman of the HRTF appears to have unrestricted ac-
 css to places of detention throughout the country, including prisons, detention cen-
 ters, police stations, and army camps. This access was gradually extended to other
 members of the HRTF, though access to army camps by members of the task force
 other than the chairman remained largely dependent on the good will of the local
 army commander. AI's recommendation that the HRTF be notified by the security
 forces of all arrests has been partially implemented; the security forces provide pen-
 odic listings of all detainees to the IRTF, but the p rovision of such lists is not auto-
 matic and is again dependent on the good will of the security forces rather than any
 statutory or regulatory requirement.he HRTI~s work is also complicated by the
 fact that the PTA and the ER allow people to be held in undisclosed places of deten-
 tion. In addition to the HRTF the ICRC regularly visited over 400 places of deten-
 tion throughout the country. he ICRC appeared to have better access than did the
 HRTF to places of detention in the war zones of the north and east. Though the
 Government accepted Al's recommendation that receipts be issued to family mem-
 bers of persons detained in army cordon and search operations, the army has not
 put this recommendation into practice.
 A three-person advisory board within the Ministry of Defense, first established in
 1988, reviews PTA and ER cases and makes nonbinding recommendations for han-
 dling them. Detainees are categorized according to the perceived threat they present
 to society and then recommended for continued detention, rehabilitation, or release.
 The number of persons held in detention continued to decline during 1992, from
 roughly 5,500 at the begiing of the year to between 3,500 and 5,000 at the end
 of September. At least 500 had been held for more than 3 years without trial. Ap-
 proximately another 1,500 were in rehabilitation camps, where they were being
 given vocational training prior to release. Of those still in detention camps, 300
 were indicted on criminal charges, according to government sources.
 Large numbers of Tamil youths mostly young men, were rounded up by the secu-
 rity forces in the east and the Colombo area during 1992. Most were released after
 a few days, but some remained in detention and many disappeared (see Section
 1.b.). As of the beginning of October there were approximately 500 Tamil prisoners
 being held in the north and east; another 1,000 or so were held in prisons and de-
 tention centers in the south, mostly in and around Colombo.
 There were reports that the LTTE was holding over 2,000 prisoners in the north,
 but these could not be verified. With the exception of 41 policemen held since 1990,
 the LTTE does not give the ICRC or other humanitarian organizations access to its
 detainees.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-In ordinary criminal cases, defendants are ac-
 corded substantial due process rights, but trials under the PTA and ER lack several
 significant safeguards. Persons accused of criminal acts generally receive a fair pub-
 lic trial are informed of the charges and evidence against them, and are rep
 resented by the counsel of their choice. Persons tried on criminal charges in the hig%
 courts and the courts of appeal are provided an attorney at government expense if
 necessary. The Government does not provide attorneys in other cases, although pri-
 vate legal aid organizations assist some defendants. Public trial by jury is the cus-
 tom.
 Juries are not provided in trials under the PTA on grounds that jury members
 could be intimidated. Confessions are admissible in PTA and ER cases but not in
 cases tried outside the PTA and ER framework. Most ER and PTA convictions rely
 heavily on confessions, and the burden of proof of charges of coercion rests on the
 defendant. Those convicted under the PTA or the ER have the same right of appeal
 to the courts of appeal and the Supreme Court as those sentenced in other cases.
 In practice, however, most people held under these acts have never been formally
 charged and therefore cannot make use of the appeals process.
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary. The President appoints
 all judges of the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, and the high courts. The Chief
 Justice and two Supreme Court judges comprise a Judicial Service Commission
 
 
 1178
 which appoints, transfers, and dismisses lower court judges. Judges serve from time
 of appointment to mandatory retirement age (65 for Supreme Court judges and 62
 for others). Because of the hostilities in the northeast, the judiciary functioned only
 in a few larger towns in the east and one town in the north.
 The Government alleges that all of the people held under the ER and the PTA
 are members or suspected members of either the JVP or the LTlE. It is impossible
 to determine how many of the 3,500 detainees it acknowledges holding might prop-
 erly be termed political prisoners, as defined in these reports (see Appendix A).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government generally respects indivdual privacy and the sanctity of the family and
 the home, and the judiciary usually upholds privacy rights in cases that reach the
 high courts. Search and arrest warrants are normally required to enter private
 premises, but the PTA permits certain police officers to enter and search any prem-
 ises without a warrant and seize "any document or thing" when there is a presump-
 tion or evidence of support for, or involvement with, unlawful activity.
 Government monitoring of telephones and correspondence is believed to occur on
 a selective basis.
 g. Use of Excessie Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Hostilities between the Government and the LTTE, exacerbated in the east-
 ern province by LrITE attacks on Muslim and Sinhalese civilians and retaliation by
 Muslim home guard, continued throughout 1992 and resulted in many indiscrimu-
 nate killings. On August 9, a group of some 20 soldiers, angered by the LoTE's kill-
 ing of 10 popular senior officers the previous day, massacred 35 residents of the
 nearby Tamil village of Mailanthani .The army said that it was investigating the
 incident, and survivors identified 16 of the alleged perpetrators. There were also
 several cases reported of indiscriminate bombing or shelling of civilian targets by
 government security forces. In one such incident, 23 civilians were reported to have
 been killed when the air force attacked a Hindu temple in the northern district of
 Mullaitivu. The Government responded to the incident by appointing a commission
 of inquiry, but the commission had not released its report as of year's end.
 Attacks such as the one at Mailanthani were largely the result of  r army dis-
 cipline rather than deliberate government policy. In 1992 the President frequently
 reiterated his view that the war in the northeast was one against the LTTE, not
 the Tamil people, and this view is believed to be shared by other top-level
 decisionmakers in Colombo. Nonetheless, the Government's failure to punish appro-
 priately those who commit such abuses creates a climate of impunity which permits
 them to continue. The LTTE has adopted a strategy of deliberately attacking inno-
 cent civilians in an effort to drive non-Tamils out of areas it claims. Over 400 people
 died in such attacks durin 992. In one particularly grisly case, 170 Muslim villag-
 ers including women, childrn, and the elderly were shot and hacked to death by
 the LItE on October 15. The LTTE also used bombs indiscriminately against civil-
 ian targets. On April 10, an LTTE bomb killed 25 civilians in the eastern district
 of Ampara. A September 1 bombing killed another 22 people. Overall, 78 civilians
 were killed by LTmtE bombs in the fhrst 9 months of 1992. The LTPE also stoped
 buses or trains and massacred the passengers on at least three occasions. Fort  our
 people died in such attacks during the first 9 months of the year.
 LTTE attacks on civilians sometimes were followed by reprisal attacks on Tamil
 civilians by security forces and the paramilitary Muslim home guards. In one such
 instance, after 59 Muslims were massacred by the Li  at Alinchipathana village,
 Muslim gunmen attacked two neighboring Tamil villages and killed 56 civilians in
 what appeared to be a vengeful attempt to match the number of Muslims killed.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and expression but permits these rights to be restricted by law in the interests of
 national security. Though infrequently invoked, both the ER and the 1978 Par-
 liamentary Powers and Privileges Act place clear restrictions on freedom of speech.
 Under the ER, sentences of up to 20 years in prison may be imposed for "inciting
 feelings of disaffection, hatred or contempt of the President or the government" or
 "creating discontent or disaffection among the inhabitants of Sri Lanka." In April
 the ER was used to bring charges against a newspaper editor who published allega-
 tions made by a fugitive former police officer of government involvement in human
 rights violations. Another editor was charged under the Criminal Code for publish-
 ing material on the same subject. At yers end, a Colombo high court jud e ruled
 that the first editor had not violated the emergency regulations by publishing the
 allegations, but the Attorney General's office vowed to appeal the ruling. These at-
 tempts by the Government to limit public discussion of the allegations were success-
 ful.
 
 
 1179
 The Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act allows Parliament to impose an un-
 limited fine or up to 2 years' imprisonment on anyone who criticizes a member of
 Parliament. The Act was invokedin 1992 to call the editor of a weekly newspaper
 before Parliament to answer for an allegedly defamatory article.
 There were no prosecutions for distributing "antigovernment" literature during
 1992. However, in August the police attacked a group of opposition activists in a
 suburb of Colombo and seized the leaflets they were distributing.
 The Government controls the country's largest newspaper chain, although a vari-
 ety of independent newspapers and journals provide a range of viewpoints on for-
 eign affairs and domestic issues, including human rights. Many newspapers openly
 criticize the ruling party and Government. Many small-circulation periodicals are
 also published by opposition political parties and special interest groups. Inter-
 national news is not subject to government control. The Government owns the radio
 and two of the three television networks. All local news must be approved by the
 Government prior to being broadcast on these networks.
 There was no formal political censorship in 1992, but journalists assert that gov-
 ernment pressure or the threat of pressure forces the press to exercise careful self-
 censorship. Although the Government denies it, many journalists allege that the
 Government exerts pressure on the press by controlling permits for the import of
 newsprint and through placement of paid government announcements and advertis-
 ing. In 1992, as in 1991, there were reliable reports that state-owned and state-af-
 filiated banks manipulated credit in order to put pressure on independent or opposi-
 tion newspapers. Repeated police searches were used to harass at least one out-
 spoken opposition newspaper.
 There were several incidents during 1992 in which opposition journalists or jour-
 nalists covering members of the opposition were assaulted. On August 7, men armed
 with knives and pistols attacked a group of local and international journalists cover-
 ing an opposition political event, beating at least one reporter and stealing the
 equipment of several others. On two separate occasions in December, police sent in
 to disperse peaceful demonstrators singled out and attacked journalists-and in par-
 ticular photorphers--covering the events. In one case a photographer covering a
 protest called by the opposition to mark U.N. Human Rights Day was badly beaten
 by police and had to be hospitalized; in the second incident, police held a gun to
 the head of a photographer and ordered him to stop taking pictures of a student
 demonstration. Beginning with the August attacks, the Foreign Correspondents' As-
 sociation and the Free Media Movement protested to the Government following each
 incident, but the Government has taken no remedial action. In another violent inci-
 dent, a political cartoonist known for his unflattering portrayals of the President
 was threatened by armed men who entered his home in the middle of the night;
 the following day the same journalist was attacked and slashed with a knife. Two
 suspects were arrested in connection with the attack, but both were later released
 for lack of evidence.
 For its part, the LTTE tolerates no dissent. The print and broadcast media in
 areas under its control are tightly regulated. The LITE has been known to execute
 those who criticize it or disagree publicly with its policies. In the past, university
 professors, members of nonviolent Tamil opposition parties, and human rights mon-
 itors have been among those killed.
 The LTTE holds numerous prisoners of conscience, including the poet and wom-
 en's activist Thiagarajah Selvanithy, who has been imprisoned since August 1991
 for her participation in a play critical of the LITE. At least two others involved in
 the prod uction of the play were also imprisoned by the LTYE. The group University
 Teachers for Human Rights based in the LTTE- controlled Jaffna peninsula, has
 been the target of severe LATE repression. One of its members was killed by the
 LTTE in 1989 and the rest were forced underground.
 Although academic freedom is generally respected, political activities on univer-
 sity campuses are restricted under the ER. The Government has defended this ac-
 tion as necessary to ensure that student political activity, such as that used by the
 JVP to close the universities for 3 years, would not disrupt education.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, but these rights are restricted under provi-
 sions of the ER and the PTA.
 As a general practice, the police issue or deny permits for outdoor meetings or
 processions at the discretion of the superintendent of police in each locality. During
 1992, the police allowed opposition political rallies to proceed without official hin-
 drance, though there were several cases in which unknown persons disrupted oppo-
 sition rallies or assaulted members of the political opposition (see Section 3). In sev-
 eral instances, permits issued for opposition rallies were later revoked without ex-
 planation.
 
 
 1180
 An Emergency Regulation issued in 1990 prohibiting political and disruptive ac-
 tivity in schools and workplaces remains in effect. Under it, permission for meetings
 must be obtained from the head of an institution.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution establishes Buddhism as the official re-
 ligion, which the Government must aprotect and foster." It also provides for the
 rights of members of other faiths, including Hindus, Muslims, and Christians, to
 practice their religions freely. Religious groups are free to maintain active ties with
 coreligionists in other countries, and many Sri Lankans perform religious travel
 each year.
 Religious publishing and proselytizing are allowed, and foreign clergy may work
 in Sri Lanka. For over 30 years, however, the Government has forbidden the entry
 of new foreign Jesuit clergy, while allowing those already in the country to remain.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution grants every citizen "freedom of movement and of
 choosing his residence within Sri Lanka" and "freedom to return to Sri Lanka."
 These provisions are generally honored. However, curfews, checkpoints, and other
 actions taken by both the Government and insurgent forces have had the effect of
 inhibiting free travel in large parts of the north and east. In addition, the LTTE
 has explled all Muslims from the areas of northern Sri Lanka which lie under its
 control; expropriated Muslim lands, homes, and businesses; and threatened Muslim
 families with death if they attempt to return to their homes.
 The Government does not restrict the travel abroad of its citizens.
 Sri Lanka does not permit the entry of refugees or displaced persons from other
 countries, nor does it help refugees who attempt to stay in the country while seek-
 ing permanent residence elsewhere. There were 620,000 internally displaced per-
 sons living in camps in Sri Lanka in 1992. Most li in in camps, primarily financed
 by the Government, in the northeast or adjacent provinces.
 At the begnning of the year there were over 100,000 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees
 living in refge camps in southern India. During 1992 over 30,000 of these refugees
 returned to Sri Lanka. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees oper-
 ated freely in Sri Lanka, supporting government refugee relief efforts in the north
 and east and funding transit camps for persons returning from India. Over 100,000
 Sri Lankan Tamils have also sought refuge in Western Europe and North America
 over the last few years. Many orthem have been denied refugee status and some
 may eventually be returned to Sri Lanka.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their gverment through peri-
 odic multipaarty elections on the basis of universal adult surage.
 Sri Lanka has a vigorous political opposition. A total of 26 parties are recognized
 by the Commissioner of Elections, and members of 12 of these hold seats in Par-
 liament. Although members of each ethnic community can be found in many of the
 political parties, the two most influential parties generally draw their support from
 the Sinhalese community. Historically, these two p arties have alternated in power.
 In 1988 and 1989, several formerly militant Tamil groups emerged as political par-
 ties in the northeast. Eighteen Tamils currently hold seats in the 225-member Par-
 liament.
 Members of bth the ruling party and the largest opposition p arty have occasion-
 ally used violence to disrpt one another's rallies or harass members of the opposing
 party. Following the failed attempt in 1991 to impeach the President, the levelof
 harassment directed against the political opposition increased. Members of the
 Democratic United National Front (DUNE), a breakaway faction of the ruling party,
 were singled out for particular harassment. In April a group of armed men attacked
 the home of a DUNE organizer, causing extensive damage and injuring his wife.
 Later that month, a rally called by the AUNF had to be canceled whien armed men
 fenced off the site of the proposed meeting and the police withdrew the group's loud-
 speaker permit. Severalparty activists were assaulted when they attempted to ad-
 dress the crowd gathere  outside. In August armed men attacked local and foreign
 journalists covering a DUNE petition drive. In late August, one of the founders of
 the DUNE was attacked by armed men who fired several shots in the air and struck
 him on the leg with an iron rod.
 Harassment was also directed against the main established opposition party, in-
 cluding the abduction (and subsequent release) of a party organizer in May and an
 attack on members of an opposition-cntrolled municipal council near Colombo in
 July. In September the Supreme Court upheld President Premadasa's election vic-
 tory in 1988 dismissing the opposition's legal challenge that the election had been
 fraudulent. On several occasions in 1992, the Government used the emergency regu-
 
 
 1181
 lations to promulgate laws unrelated to the ongoing conflict in the northeast, there-
 by bypassing normal parliamentary procedures. It promulgated laws governing the
 setting up of local school boards, the illegal felling of timber, and the disruption of
 manufacturing in the free trade zones in this manner. Local civil libertarians criti-
 cized these actions as representing a parallel lawmaking system not subject to par-
 liamentary control.
 There are no de jure impediments to women's participation in politics or govern-
 ment, but the social mores of some communities have the effect of inhibiting wom-
 en's  participation  in  activities  outside  the  home. Although  they   are
 nL oderrepresented, women serve at senior levels in both sectors. Eleven women hold
 seats in Parliament; two are deputy ministers and one is the Minister of Health.
 The leader of the opposition, a former Prime Minister is a woman.
 The indigenous people of Sri Lanka, known as Veidas, number less than a thou-
 sand. Them are no de facto or de jure restrictions on their participation in the politi-
 cal life of the country. Preferring to maintain their traditional way of life, the
 Veddas have resisted government attempts to integrate them into Sri Lankan soci-
 ety.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several local nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), including the Civil Rights
 Movement and the Movement for Interracial Justice and Equality, monitor human
 rights, collecting information from families of victims or members of citizen commit-
 tees near the sites of alleged incidents. The Government generally does not respond
 to their periodic reports and appeals. In 1992 two lawyers representing a group pro-
 viding legal assistance to detainees held under the ER andPTA were threatened
 by masked gunmen who demanded that they stop filing petitions alleging infringe-
 ment of the fundamental rights of detainees. The Government responded to these
 thrats by providing the lawyers with 24-hour police protection.
 A variety of international N's are active in Sri Lanka, providinghumanitarian
 relief services to those affected by the conflict in the northeast. The Government al-
 lows these organizations to operate largely unhindered, subject only to security con-
 siderations in the war zone. The government commission set up in December 1990
 to look to o the activities of NGO's has investigated or is currently investigating the
 activities of several domestic NGO's. There is evidence that at least one of these in-
 vestigations is politically motivated. To date, no human rights groups have come
 under the Commission's scrutiny.
 In 1991 the Government invited Amnesty International (Ai) and the UNHRC
 Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances to send teams to Sri
 Lanka. The Government ag eed to adopt 30 of the 32 recommendations Al made
 after the visit and all 14 of the UNHRC Working Group's recommendations though
 one key working group recommendation was only partially adopted. The rec-
 ommendations not adopted by the Government involved broadening the mandate of
 the commissiona disappearanes (see Section 1.b.) to include investigation of cases
 occurring before January 1991 and repealing the indemnity act which protects secu-
 rity force members who may have committed human rights violations before 1989.
 The Government made progress in implementing many of the 44 recommendations
 it accepted, but the major weakness remained its unwillingness or inability to insist
 on local compliance with higher level directives and to punish past human rights
 violators. At the invitation of the Governmentbonth AI and the UNHRC Working
 Group made followup visits in October 1992. Both groups noted improvements in
 the overall human rights picture but have suggested improvements in the imple-
 mentation of the recommendations, especially at the working levels.
 The Government continued to provide the ICRC with virtually unrestricted access
 to its detentin ofacilities, allowing the ICRC to register detainees and monitor their
 treatment. It also permitted the ICRC to transport government- and donor-provided
 food and medicine into the war zone. The ICRC also provided human rights training
 and materials to the Sri Lankan military and police.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Seb Religion. Language, or Social Status
 Tamis have long believed with se justification, that they ontinue to suffer
 systematic discrimination in competition or university entrance, employment oppor-
 tunities, and other matters under government control. While official discrimination
 continues in some fields (see below), there has been no evidence of systematic or
 official discrimination in university enrollment or government employment for the
 past 3 years. In 1990 the Government decreed that hiring for the public service
 would be based on ethnic groups' proportions in society. pholding a suit filed by
 a Tamil public servant, the Supreme Court ruled in 1991 that promotions must be
 
 
 1182
 based on merit but did not address the hiring issue. Under the Constitution's 13th
 Amendment, enacted in 1987, Tamil and Sinhala were both made official languages
 and English the "link" languae. The current Government has made efforts to elimi.
 nate discrimination based on language. In mid-1991, all parties represented in the
 Parliament agreed to establish a Select Committee to examine Sri Lanka's ethnic
 problem. As of the end of the year, the Committee had reached a consensus on the
 need to devolve power, but this fell short of the demands of the Tamil parties.
 Despite these efforts by the Government to end discrimination, the nearly 200,000
 stateless Tamils (so-called Indian Tamils) living in the tea-growing highlands con-
 tinue to suffer particular discrimination, especially in the Governments allocation
 of education funds. No longer qualifying for citizenship under Indian law, they were
 also denied Sri Lankan citizenship by laws adopted after independence. Under a
 1986 agreement, the Sri Lankan Government agreed to grant citizenship to all re-
 maining stateless Tamils. In 1988 the Government eliminated processing delays by
 passing a law making extension of citizenship to those stateless persons automatic
 upon a simple request. However, this new legislation did not cover the 85,000
 Tamils who themselves or whose parents once applied for Indian citizenship but
 who now wish to stay in Sri Lanka. While they could legally be compelled to leave
 Sri Lanka, the Government has assured Tamil leaders that none will be forced to
 do so.
 Sri Lankan women have equal rights under national civil and criminal law. How-
 ever, questions related to family law-including marriage, divorce, child custody,
 and inheritance-are subject at the local level to the customary law of each particu-
 lar ethnic or religious group. Muslims, for example, are guided by Islamic law in
 these matters. The Constitution guarantees equality in public sector employment,
 but women have no legal protection against discrimination in the private sector.
 Women's rights activists say that sexual assault and other forms of violence
 against women are common in Sri Lanka but that for cultural and social reasons
 Sri Lankan women are unlikely to report such abuse. According to women who work
 with victims of sexual assault, rape and other forms of violence directed against fe-
 male domestic servants is a particularly pernicious problem. Women's groups report
 that victims of rape must face police and judicial officials whose sympathies often
 lie with the accused rather than the victim.
 There are several organizations actively working to promote women's rights and
 greater awareness of women's issues. As a result, public awareness of the problems
 raced by women has been increasing over the last few years, but to date the Govern.
 ment has undertaken no significant initiative to deal with the problem.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the PTA, the Government specified that many
 sectors of the economy include "essential services" and that work stoppages in such
 sectors can be declared illegal. While the Government has not prosecuted any strik-
 ers under these laws for the past few years, and a few strikes have occurred in sec-
 tors covered by the law, some trade union leaders have continued to argue that the
 law and its applications is contrary to International Labor Organization Convention
 29.
 The Constitution provides for the right to form and join trade unions. Seven or
 more workers may form a union, draw up their own charter, elect their own rep-
 resentatives, and formulate programs. About 25 percent of the work force belongs
 to trade unions. There are just over 1,000 trade unions, the majority of which have
 less than 100 members. Eighty-six percent of all union members belong to one of
 the 10 largest trade union federations. Although there are a few independent trade
 unions, most large worker organizations are affiliated with political parties and play
 a role in the political process. Two unions are affiliated with, but are not directly
 controlled by, the governing UNP. Unions are free to affiliate internationally, and
 various Sri Lankan trade union federations are affiliates of the major international
 trade union organizations.
 Although all workers, other than public servants, have the right to strike, the
 President may invoke the 1989 Emergency Services Act (ESA) to declare any strike
 illegal. All government services and over three-quarters of the country's industrial
 and agricultural enterprises have been declared essential services. Under the cur-
 rent state of emergency, workers performing essential services who go on strike may
 legally be fired without any recourse by the workers. In practice, the ESA is such
 an effective threat that it is rarely used to stop a strike.
 Civil service employees have no right to strike, but they may submit grievances
 to the Public Service Commission for relief. Union activists and labor lawyers claim
 that the Commission is biased against employees. By contrast, employees of state
 corporations, including the two large state banks, are unionized. The strength of
 
 
 1183
 these unions is such that they have halted privatization of the state banks as well
 as of tea plantation assets. Prolonged union strikes against private enterprises can
 also lead to a government takeover of the enterprise. For example, in 1990 a cold
 storage firm was taken over. When it was returned to the private sector in 1992,
 union-supported politicians required the company to retain a union-designatedgen-
 eral manager and otherwise limited the normal decisionmaking powers of the firm.
 From January to August, there were 81 strikes, 56 of which were in the estate
 sector (tea, rubber, coconuts), technically an essential service sector. Twenty-five
 strikes occurred in the manufacturing sectors and 10 of these were in the export
 processing zones (EPZs), where there are no labor unions. The other strikes were
 initiated by one or more trade unions.
 A complaint against Sri Lanka regarding legal restrictions on the right to strike
 was continued under examination in 1992 by the ILO's Committee on Freedom of
 Association.
 The National Labor Advisory Committee (NLAC), a tripartite body (employers,
 employees and government representatives) created in 1990, recommended amend-
 ing the ESA so that workers striking on legitimate labor complaints could not be
 terminated without recourse. This recommendation was referred to the Cabinet sub-
 committee on monetary affairs, which is chaired by the Prime Minister (who is also
 the Labor Minister). As of the end of the year, no further action had been taken.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers are expressly grant-
 ed the right under the law to bargain collectively. For those organizations in which
 workers are represented by trade unions, the unions undertake the bargaining.
 Where unions are lacking, so-called work councils, composed of employees, employ-
 ers and often a public sector representative, are the forums for collective bargaining.
 In the EPZ's, the work councils are referred to as Joint Consultative Councils. Col-
 lective bargaining takes place especially in state corporations and the private sector,
 where it occurs in an estimated 15 to 20 percent of businesses. In 1992 five collec-
 tive bargaining agreements were signed.
 Antiunion discramination is prohibited by law, and workers who believe that they
 have suffered discrimination as a result of their union affiliation or who believe that
 the ight to bargain collectively has been abridged may lodge complaints with the
 Commissioner of Labor, the Labor Tribunal, or the Supreme Court. Department.of
 Labor officers, who are stationed throughout the country, may mediate when work-
 ers and employers are ot able to resolve a dispute.
 In one case in mid-1990, a Korean company which purchased a state-owned tex-
 tile mill that had been plagued by frequent work stop pages and strikes for several
 years immediately closed down the factory for 6 months. After extensive retooling,
 the factory was reopened in January 1991, but seven union leaders were not reem-
 ployed. The Labor Department took the company to court. As of the end of 1992,
 six of the union leaders had been rehired, but the situation of the seventh had not
 been resolved.
 Workers in the nonplantation agricultural sector and most of those employed in
 small businesses, as well as workers in the EPZ's, are not represented by unions.
 Unionization in the zones is not prohibited by law but is actively discouraged in
 practice by employers and the Government. The Government used to deny union or-
 ganizers entry into the zones, citing security concerns, but in 1992 it agreed to
 admit trade union organizers into the EPZ's if they were invited in writing by a
 member of a Joint Consultative Council. Each invitation is to be valid for one visit
 only. The Councils, which meet monthly with management, traditionally have re-
 placed trade unions in the EPZ's. As of the end of the year, no union organizer had
 ever been invited into the EPZ's.
 Frustrated by the difficulties in entering the EPZ's as labor union representatives,
 a local lawyer and others founded the Workers Solidarity Organization (WSL),
 whose purpose is to look after the needs of its members who work in the EPZ's. The
 organization helps workers pursue grievances through channels already available to
 them. In August the general secretary of the organization reported that police offi-
 cers entered his home and demanded copies of the lists of members in the WSL.
 He refused, but claims that he and his family subsequently have been harassed.
 Workers in the EPZs have the same rights as other workers in the country, in-
 cluding the right to strike. In November and December, there were a number of
 strikes for wage increases in textile factories in the EPZ's. Those strikes were large-
 ly settled through a combination of collective bargaining and government mediation.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor in Sri
 Lanka has essentially been outlawed since 1844, with the passage of an ordinance
 abolishing slavery. In addition, forced and compulsory labor is contrary to both com-
 mon law practices and the fundamental rights portion of the current Constitution.
 In particular, freedom of association, occupation, and movement are guaranteed,
 
 
 1184
 
 and no person may be imprisoned except by due legal process. Sri Lanka is also a
 signatoryr or ILO Convention 29, which has the force of law. Its ratification of ILO
 Convention 105 is still pending.
 There has been no evidence of bonded or forced labor in Sri Lanka. Given the
 level of economic development in the country, however, it is impossible to rule it out
 completely, but it is not pervasive, systematic or legally tolerated in Sri Lanka.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Employment of children under age
 14 is prohibited by law, except that younger children may work 1 hour before and
 after school for their families. Employment of persons between the ages of 14 and
 18 is subject to certain restrictions. In addition, employers are required to provide
 young workers with annual leave, rest periods, and meal breaks similar to those
 proviaed to adult workers. The law is not effectively enforced.
 A 1991 government study reported 500,000 children aged 10 to 14 working in the
 informal labor market. Children reportedly workin farming, rice milling, coir pro-
 duction, fisheries, passenger transport, and street vending. Labor Department offi-
 cials report no children working in factories or in the organized plantation sector.
 Labor Department officials conducted a sample survey of Colombo homes and dis-
 covered many children in the 10 to 14 age range working as domestic servants.
 Social workers are increasingly concerned about child prostitution, which has ac-
 companied the growth in the tourist industry. A 1991 government study found that
 20,000 youths under 18 were engaged in prostitution. Public awareness of child
 labor is increasing, but efforts to redress it have been hampered by the weakness
 of official enforcement, the lack of viable options for the children, and the fact that
 in many cases child workers are an important source of income to families living
 in abject poverty.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage, but 38
 wage boards, covering 100 occupations in industry, commerce, services, and agri-
 culture, set minimum wages andworking conditions. Representatives of employers,
 employees, and government sit on the boards which consider cost of living and other
 factors when setting wages.
 Remuneration tribunals also set wages in some cases. In addition, the Board of
 Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) sets minimum wages and working conditions for
 workers in the EPZ's. Minimum wages in the zones tend to be higher than wages
 outside the zones for similar work. Minimum wages are considered insufficient for
 a worker to support a standard family of five, but there is often more than one
 bread winner in a nuclear family andseveral in the usual extended family. The
 minimum wage is effectively enforced by the Labor Department and the courts.
 Most permanent full-time workers in firms employing 15 or more people are cov-
 ered by laws that technically prohibit them from working more than 45 hours per
 week (a 5 2-day workweek). Such workers by law also receive 14 days of annual
 leave and 14 to 21 days of medical leave in addition to numerous local holidays. Ma-
 ternity leave is available to female workers.
 The safety and health of workers is protected under a variety of laws, which set
 workplace health and safety standards and fines of up to $150 may be levied on em-
 ployers who violate the prescribed standards. However, the laws do not appear to
 be enforced effectively. The Department of Labor employs a small staff of engineers
 to inspect workplaces but the staff is inadequate. The Labor Department conducts
 nationwide worker education programs on health and safety issues in an effort to
 increase worker awareness and encourages the use of safety equipment, such as
 earplugs, helmets and machine guards. However, most workers are not properly in-
 structed on the risks they are taking.
