 BURUNDI
 Burundi is a one-party state under the leadership of
 President Bagaza who assumed power in 1976 by a bloodless
 coup d'etat. The government has since continued to espouse
 a program of national reconciliation and political and
 economic reform. It set out to achieve these goals in the
 face of considerable obstacles and with very limited
 resources. Landlocked Burundi is a poor country. It
 has a very high population density, with most people living
 at a subsistence level on tiny farms scattered over the
 country's hilly countryside. The nation has few natural
 resources, and the remaining unused arable land and forests
 are under increasing pressure because of population growth.
 The literacy rate and general education levels are low.
 Health care is meagre.
 A crucial factor in Burundian society is the country's
 ethnic structure. While all Burundians speak the same
 language and have the same culture, the minority Tutsi (15
 percent of the population) have for centuries dominated
 the political, social, and economic life of the country.
 From time to time this domination has-led to violence as
 the majority Hutu (84 percent of the population) have
 tried to increase their power. The most recent and
 devastating example of this occurred in 1972, when an
 estimated 100,000 to 150,000 people, virtually all Hutu,
 died in government-sanctioned massacres. About 100,000
 Hutu fled to neighboring countries, most to Tanzania and
 to Rwanda, where the majority Hutu overthrew Tutsi rule in
 1959.
 To address these problems, the government adopted a
 comprehensive strategy with emphasis on the cultural and
 linguistic unity of the Burundian people. In 1980,
 judicial and administrative reforms which benefitted all
 Burundians, regardless of ethnic origin were implemented.
 A legal code on the family promulgated in January 1980
 gave increased rights to women. Work on a new penal code
 continued. A new constitution was scheduled to be presented
 to the government for its formal consideration in January
 1981. (Burundi at present has no written constitution.) A
 nightly curfew which had been imposed since 1976 ended in
 April 1980. The role of civilians in the formerly military-
 dominated government was increased. The military council
 which ruled the country since the 1976 coup was replaced
 in December 1979 by the civilian-based Central Committee
 of the National Union for Progress and Unity, UPRONA, the
 nation's sole political party. Membership in the party was
 encouraged. With the signing of major new foreign assistance
 projects in agriculture, energy, health care, and education,
 1980 also witnessed an increase in the government's'capability
 to pursue its commitment to economic development. The
 government has promulgated a new foreign investment code
 with basic guarantees.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Articles 52, 53, 67, 68, and 180 (Book Two) of the Burundi
 Penal Code deal  with the treatment of prisoners. Torture
 
 
 is forbidden by law and there were no reports of torture
 in 1980. Beatings occasionally occur during the arrest
 and questioning of prisoners, particularly those who
 threaten violence against the police, resist arrest, or
 are arrested in connection with violent crimes.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 Executions, which take place only after due process, are
 rare. Prisons are overcrowded and dirty, but most prisoners
 are left to themselves and not abused. However, prisoners
 arrested for violent crimes such as rape or murder and those
 who resist arrest may be ill-treated. The government claims
 to discipline police and prison officials guilty of abusing
 prisoners. There is no independent information to confirm
 or refute these claims.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of disappearances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The state has broad police powers which permit arbitrary
 arrests and imprisonment. For example, individuals have
 been arrested as a form of harassment for indiscreet
 behavior, e.g., criticizing the president or his policies.
 These powers are used mainly against people suspected of
 sedition, treason, corruption and misuse of government
 funds. Fewer than twenty such political arrests occurred
 in 1980. Legally, a person may be held for only five days
 before being charged, but some are detained for longer
 periods of time. Preventive detention exists but is not
 common.
 e. Denial of    Fair Public Trial
 Burundi law provides for speedy public trials with counsel.
 The law specifies that charges must be stated formally
 within five days of an arrest. The lack of trained legal
 personnel often cause delays from several weeks to several
 months. By law, the judiciary is independent of the executive
 and the military, but the separation of powers is blurred in
 practice.
 A state security court was established by presidential
 decree on April 17, 1980. It has jurisdiction over both
 civilian and military personnel who are accused of acts
 against the state. The mandate of the court allows it
 jurisdiction over almost any felony case the government
 chooses to refer to it. The court is presided over by the
 President of the Supreme Court and four counsellors
 appointed by the president. The counsellors are nominated
 by the minister of justice. The counsellors must comprise
 one representative from the judiciary, one from the
 military and two public individuals. The prosecutor
 before the Supreme Court represents the state before the
 security court as well. The main difference between the
 state security court and the civilian courts are that state
 security court proceedings need not be public and the only
 form of appeal is a motion for reconsideration before the
 same court. No cases have been brought before the court
 since its creation.

 f. Invasion of the Home
 Court warrants are required by law for an official to
 enter a private residence. Exceptions sometimes occur
 in politically-related cases, e.g. if an individual is
 suspected of plotting against the state. There have been
 no reports of other kinds of violations of the home such
 as bugging or demolition.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care,
 and Education
 Government policies and priorities are directed heavily
 toward improving the economic rights of the people. In
 1980, the government continued its emphasis on promoting
 economic growth, particularly among the poorest sectors of
 the population, increasing food production, and improving
 the delivery of health care and education services.
 Burundi's low level of economic development affects both
 Hutu and Tutsi. In rural areas, differences in economic
 status between the two ethnic groups are not discernable
 in the vast majority of cases. In the country's few urban
 areas, Tutsis have long dominated government and education
 and continue to have the edge. The Bagaza government is
 expending scarce resources to expand the provision of
 services to the rural poor. The 1980 developing budget
 reflects major cutbacks made necessary by declining revenues
 from coffee, but the budget continues to give priority to
 the needs of the rural poor.
 Burundi's economy is overwhelmingly dependent on a primi-
 tive agricultural sector which supports 90 percent of the
 population. Most Burundians engage primarily in subsistence
 agriculture suplemented by such cash crops as coffee, tea
 and cotton. Lower world coffee prices plus a smaller 1980
 coffee crop left the country with an estimated 40 percent
 decline in export revenue.
 The country has one of the highest population densities
 in Africa, and population growth is estimated at 2.2
 percent. Nearly half of the population is under age 15.
 Per capita incomes are among the lowest in the world.
 The growth of the population puts increasing pressure on
 the country's scarce arable land and forest resources.
 Health and educational facilities are inadequate. There
 is one doctor for every 30,000 people. Infant mortality
 rates are at least 130/1000 live births. Life expectancy
 is 45 years.
 Primary education is in principle free to all residents
 and school   enrollments are increasing annually. Even
 with substantial foreign assistance, however the government
 projects that it will be able to provide primary school
 education for only 28 percent of the relevant age group
 by the mid 1980s.
 secondary schooling consists of free government schools
 and tuition-charging private, generally religious,
 schools. Due to inadequate facilities, only a small
 fraction of those completing primary school can obtain
 places in secondary schools. The University of Burundi,
 
 
 the country's only institution of higher learning, is
 a state institution offering free education on the European
 model to those few students able to obtain places in
 a highly competitive environment. It has recently
 embarked on a large-scale building program, and enrollments
 are increasing more than ten percent annually.
 Women have essentially equal legal status with men in
 nearly all aspects of life in Burundi. In practice,
 cultural traditions continue to limit the participation of
 women in public life. Aware of this gap, the government
 announced a new civil code on the individual and the
 family in January 1980. It eliminated the legal requirement
 for the payment of a dowry as a condition of marriage,
 forbade polygamy, and permitted divorce by mutual consent.
 Less than 15 percent of the secondary school spaces are
 available for women. However, once women have received
 a higher education they can generally find employment
 quickly, given the country's lack of trained personnel.
 The government has insured that women are represented at
 the senior levels of the UPRONA party; e.g., central
 committee. The women's affiliate of UPRONA, the Union
 of Burundian Women (UFB), promotes education, health
 care and community development activities and is called
 upon regularly to stimulate mass support for the UPRONA
 party.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The government controls all domestic media. The French-Lan-
 guage Daily (Le Renouveau) and Kirundi Language Weekly
 (UBUMWE) are published by the Ministry of Information,
 which also runs the only domestic radio station. Editorial
 direction comes from the Presidency and is pro-government,
 but occasionally editions have featured muted criticism of
 government mismanagement and raised political and economic
 issues. There is no television station in Burundi, and in
 November 1980 the government seized all television sets
 used by Burundian nationals to watch telecasts from Zaire.
 Foreign movies are subject to censorship, but cuts are
 generally made only on material deemed sexually explicit
 which might offend public morals. In 1980 one issue of a
 popular foreign magazine was supressed because it contained
 an item on domestic politics which the government considered
 sensitive. Normally there is no interference with the
 distribution of foreign publications. The government
 encourages academic inquiry into the social and.natural
 sciences.
 The express authorization of the government is required
 for all political meetings or speakers, and this
 effectively guarantees government control of public fora.
 The labor movement is affiliated with the country's only
 political party and follows government policy. Wildcat
 strikes lasting a few hours have occurred, but a govern-
 ment-controlled mediation process rules out any longer
 or officially-sanctioned strikes.
 
 
 Freedom of religion is observed in Burundi. However, the
 involvement of many foreign missionaries in social work
 with the poor, who are overwhelmingly Hutu, frequently has
 aroused such government suspicion as to lead it to expel
 missionaries from the country. There were a few expulsions
 in 1980, whereas 74 missionaries were expelled in 1979.
 There have been no reports in 1980 that the government
 has prevented the church and missionary groups from
 replacing expelled missionaries or refused admission to
 new arrivals. The government has made clear that churches
 are free to carry out their work, but must confine their
 activities to religion and stay out of political matters.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Movement is generally free within Burundi. A night curfew
 in Bujumbura was lifted in April 1980. Foreign travel and
 emigration arelopen to all. The government encourages
 voluntary repatriation. Burundi's refugee apd asylum
 practices are humane. Cooperation with the United Nations
 High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is close. The
 country's 50,000 refugees, primarily Tutsis of Rwandan
 origin who fled to Burundi in the early sixties, receive
 good treatment and most have been successfully resettled.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The military-backed government rules by decree, without
 popular referendum procedures. The government endeavors
 to control all political activity. Only one political
 party, the government sponsored UPRONA party is permitted,
 It is open to all Burundians who profess allegiance
 to its principles. The government announced in 1979 that a
 recent membership drive had resulted in over one million
 new members, or over half of the adult population of the
 country. Since UPRONA is organized down to the communal
 level, it can in theory act as a vehicle for the communica-
 tion of grass roots political concerns to the leadership.
 The position of the party in the structure of the government
 was strengthened substantially at the time of the party's
 national congress in December 1979. The 49 member UPRONA
 central committee and its eight-member politbureau replaced
 the Supreme Revolutionary Council, composed of twenty-nine
 senior military officers, which had ruled Burundi from
 1976. Both the politbureau and the central committee are
 chaired by the president, who is also president of the
 party. The membership of the central committee and to a
 lesser extent the politbureau includes a cross section of
 Burundian society -- men, women, youth, labor. Hutus are
 represented at the ministerial level of government and
 are represented in the senior ranks of the party, but
 only to a minor extent given the proportion of Hutus in
 the population. The military is represented in each
 major party body,, five out of eight in the politbureau
 and fiftean out of forty-nine on the central committee. The
 party undertook in 1980 to draft a constitution that would
 be presented to the government for its formal consideration
 in January 1981. It is not clear whether the new con-
 stitution will be adopted by a referendum or by an extra-
 ordinary party congress.

 4. Government Attitudexand Record Regarding Internatibnal
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The previous government refused to permit outside investiga-
 tion of human rights violations in Burundi following, the
 civil strife of 1972-73. In 1980, there were no reports to
 indicate that the current government has received requests
 for outside assessments on human rights. The government is a
 member of the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
 There are no domestic human rights groups.
