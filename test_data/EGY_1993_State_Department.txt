 EGYPT
 According to its Constitution, Egypt is a social democracy in which Islam is the
 state religion. In July the People s Assembly reelected President Hosni Mubarak,
 who was unopposed to a third 6-year term by a 439 to 7 margin. In accordance with
 the Constitution, Mubarak's election was put to a popular referendum in October
 in which he received more than 96 percent of the votes cast. The President appoints
 
 
 1165
 the Cabinet, which is responsible to him. The National Democratic Party (NDP) has
 been in power since its establishment in 1978. It commands large majorities in the
 popularly elected People's Assembly and the Shura (consultative) Council. One oppo-
 sition party is represented in the People's Assembly; others boycotted the previous
 People a Assembly election in 1990 and are not represented.
 There are two security services under the Ministry of Interior: the General Direc-
 torate for State Security Investigations (GDSSI), which conducts investigations and
 interrogates detainees, and the Central Security Force (CSF), which enforces cur-
 fews and bans on public demonstrations and conducts paramilitary operations
 against alleged terrorists. Both the GDSSI and CSF have been implicated in many
 reports of torture and other abuses of prisoners and detainees.
 Egypt has a mixed economy dominated by an inefficient public sector. Under an
 ongoin economic structural adjustment program, Egypt has reduced or eliminated
 subsidles on consumer goods, agricultural inputs energy, and services and has liber-
 alized the currency and capital markets. The dovernment is moving slowly to re-
 structure or privatize many state-owned companies. Low economic growth rates and
 a growing population have contributed to a decline in real per capita income in each
 year since 1988.
 The Constitution provides for various human rights, including a multiparty politi-
 cal system, regular elections, the rule of law, an independent judiciary, freedom of
 opinion, and the right to peaceable assembly; a number of them are limited in prac-
 tice, and there are many other serious abuses. The human rights situation contin-
 ued to deteriorate in 1993 as a result of actions by terrorist groups, the Govern-
 ment, and nonviolent Islamic activists. Egypt's security services and terrorist groups
 ontinued to be locked in a cycle of violence. Terrorist gups attacked government
 officials, security forces, Egyptian Christians, and foreign tourists. Many innocent
 bystanders died in terrorist attacks. The Government also  rpetrated many abuses,
 including the arbitrary arrest and torture of hundreds of detainees, the use of mili-
 tary courts to try accused terrorists, the failure to punish officials responsible for
 torture, infractions committed under the Emergency Law, the harassment of jour-
 nalists, and the Government's attempt to gain greater control over civil society. Al-
 though most of the arbitrary arrests, detentions without trial, and torture were per-
 petrated on suspected members of terrorist groups, the police also victimized non-
 violent Islamic activists and ordinary citizens. In 1993 actions by nonviolent Islamic
 activists posed a danger to the freedom of expression. The NDP dominates the polit-
 ical scene to such an extent that, as a practical matter, Egyptians do not have a
 meaningful ability to change their government. Women and Egyptian Christians
 face discrimination based on tradition and some aspects of the law.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In 1993 at least 12 persons died
 from injuries allegedly sustained while in police custody. It was also learned in 1993
 that another person, Ahmed Hamido AI-Sawi, reportedly died under torture in De-
 cember 1992. The Government has not adequately investigated or publicly explained
 these deaths. According to the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR),
 medical reports released on deceased detainees in 1993 fail to note the origins, and
 even the existence, of scars in alleged torture cases. Seven of the deceased were re-
 portedly suspected Islamists: Mohamed Gomaa and Abdul Satar Abdullah who died
 in August; Ahmed Farouk Ali, Bahaa Abdel Raouf, Eissa Taher El-Bishari, and
 Ahmed Abdel Rahman who died in September and El-Mohammadi Mohamed Morsi
 who died in October. Delegations from the United States raised this and other
 human rights issues in a continuing dialog with top Egyptian officials.
 According to the Islamist newspaper Al-Shaab, Mohamed Gomaa died under tor-
 ture at Tora prison. According to Ministry of Interior officials, Ahmed Farouk Ali,
 27, died of a heart attack at the State Security headquarters in Cairo on September
 2 after 1 day in police custody. Ahmed was arrested for his alleged role in the failed
 assassination attempt on Interior Minister Al-Alfi in August. A preliminary report
 issued by the Ministry of Interior's Directorate of Health Affairs stated that Ali's
 body had "several bruises on the face and death occurred as a result of failure in
 heart and respiratory functions." However, the final report issued in November stat-
 ed that death was not due to physical abuse, but "occurred due to normal reasons."
 The five other persons who died are not believed to have any connections to
 Islamist groups. They are: Mahmoud Hussein Mohamed who died in May from inju-
 ries sustained during interrogation by security forces (see Section 1.c.); Abdel Gayed
 Sayed Abdel Gayed who also died in May; Emad Saad El-Hawashi who died in Sep-
 tember; and Effat Mohamed and Hosni Salah Sayed who died in October.
 
 
 1166
 In addition to the 12 persons cited above, at least 4 other persons died after alleg-
 edly Jumping from windows or stairwells to escape arrest or avoid giving informa-
 tion to the police. These include Haithem Abdel Sabour Kahlaf; Ahmed Kahlaf;
 Eissa Taher guleiman, who allegedly jumped from a window at the Aswan Security
 Directorate headquarters in April and Ahmed Abdel Halim, who allegedly jumped
 from the top of an apartment building stairwell in October while under police escort.
 At least 201 people were killed in civil unrest in 1993, the highest recorded level
 since 1981. Security forces killed at least 63 suspected terrorists and an undeter-
 mined number of bystanders. A number of the deaths caused by security forces ap-
 peared to result from an excessive use of lethal force. In March security forces sur-
 rounded a mosque in Aswan and opened fire with automatic weapons after the wor-
 shipers inside refused to depart. At least nine persons inside the mosque were killed
 in what was reportedly a one-sided exchange of fire. Also in March, security forces
 conducted several raids on the homes of alleged terrorists in the Cairo area, killing
 9 persons, including the wife and child of an alleged terrorist, as well as a raid in
 Assiyut city in which they killed 10 alleged terrorists. The three assaults in March
 occurred only a few days after the murder of police officers by terrorists, suggesting
 a retaliatory motive behind at least part of the cycle of violence. After assuming of-
 fice in April, Minister of Interior Hassan Al-Alfi deemphasized mass arrests and
 large-scale police raids on alleged terrorist strongholds.
 A majority of the deaths resulting from civil unrest in 1993 were caused by terror-
 ist groups. Terrorists killed at least 83 members of the security forces and 54 civil-
 ians. At least 26 of the civilians died in terrorist bombings. As they have in recent
 years, terrorists also continued to attack Egyptian Christians. They murdered at
 least nine Coptic residents of Assiyut Governorate, including physicians, students
 and Ibrahim Hana, a village official. They also burned churches and other prop-
 erties owned by Copts.
 Terrorist groups claimed responsibility for the attempted assassination of Prime
 Minister Atef Sedky in November; the attempted assassination in August of Interior
 Minister Hassan A1-Alfi; the assassination in August of Qena Governorate Deputy
 Director of Security Brigadier General Abdel Halim Ghobara, his driver, and body-
 guard; the attempted assassination in July of Army General Othman Shahine in
 Cairo; the assassination in April of Assiyut Governorate Deputy Director of Security
 Brigadier General Mohamed Abdel Latif El-Shimi, his bodqard, and driver and
 the attempted assassination in April of the Information Minister Safwat Al-Serif.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of new disappearances in 1993, but
 three cases dating from 1988 1989, and 1990 remain unsolved.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Penal Code prohibits the use of torture to obtain a confession, there
 is convincing evidence that police and security forces systematically practice torture.
 Such a determination was made in August when a state security court found that
 all 27 defendants tried for the October 1990 assassination of People's Assembly
 Speaker Rifaat AI-Mahgoub were tortured while in custody. The court acquitted 17
 defendants of all charges but sentenced 10 to prison on related charges. The presid-
 ing judge found that security forces used "hideous methods to extract confessions."
 However, no action was taken to punish the officials responsible for the torture.
 In September a military court ordered the release from detention of Sami
 Salamah Abdel Mumin, one of 35 defendants in a trial of alleged terrorists. The
 court decision was based on a complaint by Abdel Mumin that both his feet were
 crippled and his kidneys injured by physical abuse committed by security officers
 while he was in police custody.
 Mahmoud Hussein, 45, died in May several days after his release from police cus-
 tody, reportedly owing to injuries sustained during interrogation by security forces
 for his alleged connection with terrorist groups. The Government stated that it was
 investigating the case, but at year's end there had been no public statement.
 The Government generally investigates torture complaints in cases involving per-
 sons arrested for common crimes and has punished offending officers. However, the
 Government does not adequately investigate torture complaints in cases involving
 detainees in political or religious cases. There is no public record that offending offi-
 cers in such cases are punished, thus suggesting that the Government tacitly con-
 dones the mistreatment of those it considers to be opponents.
 Officers of the Interior Ministry's GDSSI are known to practice torture on both
 alleged terrorists and nonviolent Islamists. Torture, which takes place in police sta-
 tions, at GDSSI offices, and at CSF camps, is used to extract information, coerce
 the victims to end their antigovernment activities, and deter others from such ac-
 tivities.
 Torture victims are usually taken to GDSSI offices where they are handcuffed
 blindfolded, and questioned about their associations, religious beliefs, and politicai
 
 
 1167
 views. Victims have reported the following torture methods: During interrogation,
 detainees are frequently stripped to their underwear, hung by their wrists with
 their feet touching the floor, hung upside down, or forced to stand for prolonged pe-
 riods; doused wit hot and cold water; beaten; forced to stand outdoors in cold
 weather, and subjected to electric shocks. Some victims in 1993, including female
 detainees, reported that they were threatened with rape.
 As many as 10 days may elapse from the date of arrest until detainees enter the
 enal system. During that period, detainees are usually held at GDSSI offices where
 hey are questioned and often tortured. The security forces do not acknowledge any
 detention during that period, pointing to the lack of any documentary proof of ar-
 rest. The lack of written records during the early days of arrest invites the abuse
 of detainees and frustrates investigations into torture complaints. The Government
 denies that such ' temprary disappearances" occur and maintains that all arrests
 are conducted with warran   nd that written records are always kept on the
 whereabouts of detainees.
 Moreover, the security forces sometimes transfer detainees from prisons to other
 facilities where they are interrogated  tortured, and then returned to prison. No
 written records are kept on such transfers.
 To pressure fugitives to surrender, security forces have taken their relatives, in-
 cluding minors and female family members, into custody. An undetermined number
 of such detainees have been physically abused while in custody.
 Persons arrested for ordinary criminal offenses are commonly mistreated by the
 local police. Moharned All Mohamed All, 38, arrested in January for car theft, was
 allegedly hung by his wrists for extended periods and beaten with a stick while in
 police custody. An investigating officer allegedly injectd a mixture of water and
 human waste into his leg, causinggangrene. On October 17 Ali appeared in court
 on a stretcher and told the judge that the police had injected his leg with feces after
 he refused to confess to several car thefts. The court acquitted Ali on one charge
 of ar theft but sentenced him to 6 months  other charges. At year's end, there
 had been no public record of any investigation into Ali's alleged mistreatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exi/e.-Arbitrary arrest and detention are widely
 practiced against alleged terrorists and others thought to threaten national security.
 However, in some mass arrest operations, security forces have subjected villages to
 collective punishments, so that many persons with no association with terrorist
 groups have been taken into custody. Such arrests and detentions are conducted
 under the State of Emergency, which has been in effect since President Anwar
 Sadat's assassination in 1981. The present Emergency Law is scheduled to expire
 on June 30, 1994.
 Under the Emergency Law, the Interior Minister may detain a person without in-
 dietment for 90 days.Detention orders are issued by public prosecutors who have
 limited powers to commit individuals to confinement. Some detainees are not al-
 lowed to inform their relatives of their detention, and access to legal counsel has
 been delayed. In theory, those arrested under the Emergency Law should be in-
 dicted or released within 90 days. In practice, the Government often simply writes
 a new detention order for those whose release has been ordered by a court--in effect
 continuing to detain them without due process for prolonged periods. However, most
 detainees are released much sooner, after interrogation. Under the Emergency Law,
 there is a continuous flow of new arrests and releases from detention.
 Under ordinary criminal procedure, arrested persons are charged with violations
 of specific laws, have the right to a judicial determination of the legality of arrest,
 and should be formally charged within 48 hours of arrest or be released. Arrests
 under this procedure occur openly and with warrants issued by a district prosecutor
 or a judge. There is a system of bail. However, the regular Penal Code also gives
 the State wide detention powers. State prosecutors may obtain court orders to de-
 tain persons for 45 days and to confine them for up to 6 months to complete inves-
 tigations. Detainees are often released without explanation or acknowledgement
 that charges have been dropped.
 The Penal Code contains several provisions to combat terrorist violence. These
 provisions broadly define terrorism to include the acts of "spreadingpanic" and "ob-
 structing the work of authorities," allow the police to hold sus  or 24 hours be-
 fore obtaining arrest warrants, and prescribe the death penalty for persons found
 ilty of terrorism and life imprisonment for membership in a terrorist group.
 ogyptian human rights monitors estimate that about 140 Palestinians were in de-
 tention during the thisrd quarter of 1993. Many entered Egypt illegally from the Is-
 raeli-occupied territories. Others are legally resident in Egypt and are under inves-
 tigation for alleged political activities. Some Palestinian detainees reportedly have
 been tortured.
 
 
 1168
 
 There are no reliable statistics on the number of persons in detention. Observers
 estimate that at the end of 1993, 3,000 persons were in detention under the Emer-
 gency Law many for political reasons.
 e. Deniak  T air Public Trial.-Although the judiciary in recent years has exer-
 cised considerable independence and has sometimes upheld defendants' constitu-
 tional rights against acts of abuse by executive branch officials, the Government has
 used its powers under the Emergency Law to use military courts to create "emer-
 gency" state security courts (civilian and military) to try suspected terrorists, thus
 circumventing the regular courts. Trials in such state security courts do not meet
 international standards for fair trial (see below).
 There are three levels of regular civilian criminal courts: primary courts, appeals
 courts, and the Court of Cassation, the final stage of criminal appeal. There is also
 a Supreme Constitutional Court, but its jurisdiction is limited to constitutional chal-
 lenges. It does not hear criminal appeals. There are no juries. Criminal cases are
 heard by panels of three judges. Most trials are public.
 There are three sets of special courts for criminal cases: civilian and military state
 security courts and the courts of ethics. The state security courts have jurisdiction
 over serious offenses such as armed insurrection. They are divided into upper and
 lower divisions.
 Trials in a civilian state security court are heard by three judges, but two military
 officers may be added by presidential decree to the upper division. Defendants be-
 fore a civilian state security court may be indicted under the Penal Code or the
 Emergency Law. When an indictment is handed down under the Emergency Law,
 the court is designated an emergency state security court.
 A defendant has no judicial appeal from an emergency state security court. How-
 ever, he may file an appeal for clemency from the President-or the Prime Minister,
 acting on powers delegated by the President-who is empowered to amend, com-
 mute, or cancel decisions or order a retrial. These powers mean that acquittals, as
 well as convictions and sentences, may be canceled and the defendant retried for
 the same offense.
 In 1993 the Government subpoenaed Omar Abdel Rahman and 48 of his alleged
 followers for retrial on charges related to their alleged roles in      a  1989
 antigovernment riot. An emergency state security court had acquitted the defend-
 ants of all charges in 1990, but the acquittals were never ratified by the Prime Min-
 ister, who subsequently ordered the defendants retried on grounds that the Court
 had committed several procedural errors.
 In 1993 the Government used military state security courts to try civilian defend-
 ants accused of terrorist acts or of belonging to terrorist organizations, claiming that
 civilian trials were too lengthy and civilian judges too susceptible to intimidation
 under the current "exceptional circumstances." These courts are comprised of three
 military officers. The presiding judge usually has general officer rank. In January
 the Supreme Constitutional Court upheld the use of military courts to try civilian
 cases. It ruled that the President of the Republic, acting under powers in the Emer-
 gency Law, is authorized to refer any crime to a military court.
 According to Egyptian military sources, at least 446 civilian defendants accused
 of committing terrorist acts, or belonging to terrorist organizations, have been tried
 in military courts since late 1992. Most defendants were tried in groups ranging in
 size from as few as 8 to as many as 65 persons, but many suspected terrorists were
 tried individually. The military courts reportedly acquitted 205 defendants, sen-
 tenced 177 to less than 5-year terms, 26 to more than 5-year terms, and 38 to death.
 The Government maintains that the civilian defendants receive fair trials in the
 military courts. It argues that all military judges have the same legal training as
 judges in the civilian courts; defense attorneys are accorded sufficient time to review
 the prosecution's files and inspect the State's evidence; trials are conducted under
 the same procedures used in civilian courts; defense attorneys have the right to
 cross-examine and to call any witness; military judges apply only the Penal Code
 in trying cases involving civilian defendants-no civilian defendant is subject to
 military law or military punishments; there are adequate safeguards against the ad-
 mission of confessions obtained under duress; defense attorneys are appointed by
 the Bar Association at state expense for indigent defendants; verdicts are reviewed
 by two panels of military judges, who examine the trial procedures before the ver-
 dicts are forwarded to the President for ratification; and all defendants have a con-
 stitutional right to appeal for clemency from the President.
 However, the military courts do not afford the defendants due process before an
 independent tribunal. The military courts are less independent than the civilian ju-
 diciar, as the judges and prosecutors are both part of the State's executive author-
 ity. The military judges do not appear to grant defense attorneys adequate access
 to case files or time to meet with defendants; they tend to rush complex cases with
 
 
 1169
 many defendants so that most cases are tried within 6 weeks. Moreover, as with
 the civilian emergency state security courts, defendants in military court trials do
 not have the right of judicial appeal. Sentences and trial procedures are reexamined
 by military review panels, although the defendants may appeal to the President of
 the Republic. Finally, there is no information that the large numbers of defendants
 acqitted in recent military trials have been released from prison.
 The court of ethics hears cases falling under Law 95 of 1980 which makes illegal
 such activities as "endangering the public safety," inciting youth "to depart from re-
 ligious values and loyalty to the fatherland" and denying the three "heavenly reli-
 gions." It has an upper and lower division. The ethics courts allow nonjurists to try
 cases. In recent years, the ethics courts have been used relatively infrequently to
 try "economic crimes" such as corruption and drug trafficking. An ethics court con-
 viction denies the defendant the right to engage in certain occupations or activities.
 A person may be tried in a state security court and an ethics court on similar
 indictments: in the former for criminal offenses and in the latter for the financial
 gains associated with those offenses.
 In the regular civilian court system, the President appoints all judges based on
 nominations from the Higher Judicial Council, a constitutional body designed to en-
 sure the independence of the judiciary. The Council is composed of senior judges,
 lawyers, and law professors, and is chaired by the President of the Court of Cassa-
 tion. It regulates judicial promotions, salaries, transfers, and disciplinary actions. In
 practice, however, the Minister of Justice, an executive branch officer, has consider-
 able influence over judicial appointments and transfers. Judges may be appointed
 as prosecutors and vice versa.
 [n recent years, the judiciary has exercised considerable independence from the
 executive branch. Judges on occasion have ordered inquests into torture cases; ac-
 quitted defendants in cases where confessions were extracted by torture; challenged
 the ban on workers' strikes; defended the right to nonviolent ideological opinion;
 overturned bans on prohibited political parties; and overturned an election law that
 discriminated against independent candidates and dissolved the People's Assembly
 elected under that law.
 There are no reliable statistics on the number of convicted political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 continued to be substantial abridgment, under the Emergency Law, of constitutional
 provisions regarding the right to privacy. In theory, police must obtain warrants be-
 ore undertaking searches and wiretaps, and courts have dismissed cases in which
 warrants were issued without sufficient cause. Police officials who conduct searches
 without proper warrants are subject to criminal penalties, although these are sel-
 dom imposed. The Emergency Law, however, empowers the state to search persons
 or places without warrants.
 Intelligence agencies and security services frequently place political activists, sus-
 pected subversives, journalists, and writers under surveillance, screen their cor-
 respondence (especially international mail), search them and their homes, and con-
 fiscate personal property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Iwluding:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and to a large extent the Government refrains from curtailing politi-
 cal expression. Egyptians openly express their views on a wide range of political and
 social issues, including vigorous criticism of the Government, without fear of ret-
 ribution. Nevertheless, there are some limitations on the freedom of speech and
 press. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are often targets of criticism, but the
 ress law stipulates fines or imprisonment for criticism of the President or a foreign
 lead of state. In recent years, however, journalists have, within limits, criticized the
 President without harassment, although he may not be satirized in cartoons.
 Most major dailies are government owned, their editors in chief appointed by the
 President, and generally follow the government line. Nevertheless, criticism of gov-
 ernment policies is frequently found in the government-owned press.
 The opposition newspapers are associated with political parties. Most are weeklies
 with small circulations, except the centrist daily Al-Wafd and the smaller Islamist
 semiweekly Al-Shaab. They give greater prominence to human rights abuses in
 Egypt than do state-run newspapers. The opposition press is independent but is
 printed and distributed by a government-owned publishing house.
 The Government influences the press in several ways. It controls the right to pub-
 lish through its power to license newspapers. The Higher Press Council, chaired by
 the Speaker of the Shura Council, has the power to approve applications for new
 publications. Most members of the Higher Press Council are close to the ruling Na-
 tional Democratic Party and are inclined to follow the Government's lead.
 
 
 1170
 In 1993 there was a pattern of government interference with freedom of expres-
 sion, including the arrest or harassment of Egyptian journalists, the increased har-
 assment of foreign journalists, and the confiscation of printed material from the
 market. In June a prominent journalist, Mohamed Sid Ahmed, was called in for
 questioning for several hours regarding statements attributed to him in a U.S.
 newspaper on the morale in the Egyptian armed forces. At the same time, a retired
 army general, employed as a military affairs analyst at a government-affiliated in-
 stitution, was detained for 6 days for statements about the Egyptian armed forces
 attributed to him in the same article. Neither was charged with any crime, however.
 In October security forces arrested and detained overnight the Chairman and Vice
 Chairman of the Socialist Labor Party (SLP), Adel Hussein and Mohamed Helmy
 Murad, and two journalists for Al-Shaab, the SLPs newspaper, Salah Bedeiwy and
 Ali Al-Qammash. The four were reportedly questioned by state prosecutors about
 publishing articles in A-Shaab that allegedly harmed Egypt's national interests,
 spread extremist views, insulted President Mubarak, and accused the Government
 of riggingthe October 4 national presidential referendum. The Government did not
 file any charges. In October the Government also proposed amending the Press Law
 in a way that would give the Government greater control over membership in the
 journalists' syndicate, thus impairing the independence of Egypt's journalists, who
 must be licensed by the syndicate. Many journalists objected to the proposal, and
 in November the Government quietly shelved the poposal in exchange for a "review
 of the profession" to be undertaken by the journalists syndicate.
 Foreign journalists in Egypt reported a pattern of increased harassment from gov-
 ernment security forces. Several journalists were summoned for questioning, report-
 edly because of government concern that their reporting on internal events has
 damaged Egypt's reputation.
 State-owned television and radio are more limited in the news they cover than
 are newspapers. Criticisms of government policies and reporting on human rights
 abuses are almost never broadcast on radio and television. Political parties do not
 have access to broadcast facilities even during election campaigns.
 Books and works of art may be confiscated or banned by decree of various min-
 istries without a court order. The Ministry of Interior regularly confiscates leaflets
 and other works by Islamic fundamentalists. In 1993 it prevented the public sale
 of audio cassette tapes by some Islamic preachers whose preachings were considered
 to foment sectarian strife. Activists are frequently arrested and detained for distrib-
 uting antigovernment pamphlets. In 1993 military courts convicted a number of ac-
 tivists for possessing antigovernment printed material and sentenced them to prison
 terms. In August the Minister of Interior barred the public sale of "Omar Abdel
 Rahman, the Earthquake That Shook the World," a book printed in Egypt.
 The Ministry of Defense may ban works about sensitive security issues. Plays and
 fims must pass Ministry of Culture censorship tests as scripts and as final produc-
 tions. In April the Ministry of Culture censored several scenes containing amorous
 embraces in Albert Farag's "Divorce Wedding," a play produced at the American
 University in Cairo. The Ministry of Culture also censors foreign films. Censors en-
 sure that foreign films made in Egypt portray Egypt in a favorable light. Censors
 review scripts bfore filming, are present during filming, and have the right to re-
 view the film before it is sent out of Egypt.
 The Ministry of Information censors television productions and foreign news pub-
 lications. In 1993 the Ministry impounded, or otherwise prevented the sale of, some
 issues of a number of foreign publications. The Ministry does not usually inform the
 management of foreign publications of the reasons for impoundment. In October
 state prosecutors ordered the confiscation of "No to Mubarak's Reelection," a book
 published by the Socialist Labor Party.
 The Islamic research association at Al-Azhar University has legal authority to
 censor the publication of the Koran and Islamic scriptural texts. In recent years,
 however, A-Azhar has passed judgments on the suitability of nonreligious books
 and artistic productions. Although these pronouncements do not have the force of
 law, the Egyptian publishing industry usually complies with AI-Azhar pronounce-
 ments and does not publish or distribute works deemed offensive by AI-Azhar au-
 thorities, For years, A-Azhar has banned the sale of "The Children of Gebelawi,"
 a 1959 novel by Egypt's Nobel laureate, Nagib Mahfouz. In 1993 al-Azhar banned
 at least three works: the complete works of antifundamentalist writer Farag Foda,
 who was assassinated in 1992; 'Creations of Flying Passions," a novel by Christian
 author Edward Kharrat; and a collection of poems by Muslim author Hasan Talab.
 In January President Mubarak signaled his public approval of AI-Azhar's censorship
 role, stating "when A-Azhar ren[ers an opinion (on censorship) it is expressing our
 adherence to our faith. Thus we cannot dictate to AI-Azhar what it should do."
 
 
 1171
 
 The Government does not impinge on academic freedoms at universities. How-
 ever, the gowth of Islamist influence in the education system poses a threat to civil
 liberties. In April an Arabic language professor at Cairo University, Nasr Abu Zeid,
 was denied promotion to full prolessorship because a promotion panel found that his
 writings on the origin of the Koran were heretical. In June a group of Islamist law-
 yers acting as private individuals petitioned a court to dissolve Abu Zeid's marriage
 to his wife Ebtehal Younes. The petitioners claimed that Abu Zeid's writings are he-
 retical and thus, as an apostate, he leall could not be permitted to remain married
 to a Muslim woman. The case was still in progress at the end of 1993.
 In June an Islamic preacher, Shaykh Mohamed A-Ghazali, testified in court that
 any Muslim who objects to the imposition of Islamic law effectively rejects his faith
 and is an "apostate." The Shaykh added that any Muslim who kills an apostate has
 carried out the legitimate punishment prescribed by Islamic law and should be
 treated with leniency. Al-Ghazali was called to testify as a friendly witness for sus-
 pected terrorists on trial for the 1992 murder of antifundamentalist writer Farag
 Foda. His remarks were interpreted by many Egyptian intellectuals to condone the
 murder of secularists who are deemed apostates.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There continue to be substan-
 tial restrictions on this freedom. Under the Emergency Law, Interior Ministry ap-
 proval is required for public meetings, rallies, and protest marches. Permits are gen-
 erally granted for indoor rallies and those restricted to university campuses.
 The   iis    of Social Affairs has the authority to liense and dissolve "private
 organizations.  Licenses may be revoked if such organizations engage in political or
 rei ious activities.
 Since 1985 the Government has refused to license as private organizations the
 Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) and the Arab Organization for
 Human Rights (AOHR) on grounds that they are political organizations. Both con-
 tinue to operate openly (see Section 4). However, in August the Interior Ministry
 prevented EOHR officials from convening meetings with their local chapter mem-
 bers in several towns in southern Egypt.
 In 1993 the People's Assembly approved a new law governing the activities of pro-
 fessional associations. The law stipulates that no association may elect a governing
 board without a quorum of 50 percent of its general membership. If the quorum is
 not met  another election is scheduled in which 33 perent of the membership are
 reuired to elect the bard. Failing that quorum, the judiciary is authorized to ap-
 point a caretaker governing board until new elections can be organized. The law was
 adopted to prevent further gains in the professional associations by Islamist can-
 didates who had done well in elections with low voter turnouts.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Although the Constitution provides for this freedom,
 there are important limitations. Islam is the state religion. Most Egyptians are
 Muslim, but approximately 10 per cent of the population, 5 million people, belong
 to the Coptic Orthodox Church, the largest Christian minority in the Middle East.
 There are other small Christian denominations. The small Jewish community
 practices its religion without harassment. Members of recognized religions maintain
 links with coreligionists abroad. The foreign clergy pursue their ministries without
 harassment, but all non-Muslims are barred from proselytizing. In 1993 four West-
 erners were detained for more than 2 months and then expelled for proselytizing
 Muslims.
 Islam accepts Christian and other converts, but Muslims face legal problems if
 they convert to another faith. T-.ere is no clear legal prohibition against conversion
 or proselytizing, but the Penal Code prohibits any person from "degrading or dis-
 daining any or the holy religions or any of its religious sects" with "the intention
 of harming national unity and social peace." This is interpreted as forbidding the
 conversion of Muslims. Conviction is punishable by imprisonment.
 In the past, state security forces have harassed, detained for prolonged periods,
 and sometimes tortured Egyptian Christians for proselytizing Muslims. In August
 the state security police arrested Kamel Soliman Badr, 33, a lay member of a Cairo
 church for printing or photocopying booklets containing the testimonies of Egyptian
 Muslims who have converted to Christianity. Badr was officially charged with the
 abovementioned Penal Code offense.
 Egyptian courts have upheld the principle that Muslims may not change their
 identity papers to reflect their conversion to a new religion. As a consequence, mar-
 ried male converts from Islam must register their children as Muslims, as the law
 considers them Muslims.
 An 1856 Ottoman decree still in force requires non-Muslims to obtain what is now
 a presidential decree to build or repair a place of worship. Coptic Christians main-
 tau, they are frequently unable to obtain such authorization. As a result, some com-
 munities use private buildings and apartments for religious services. However, in
 
 
 1172
 1992 and 1993 the Government increased the number of building permits issued to
 Christian communities to an average of more than 20 a year, compared to the aver-
 age of 5 permits a year issued in the 1980's. Most permits appear to be for the re-
 pair of existing structures and not for construction of new churches. Christian and
 Muslim reformers urge the abolition of the Ottoman decree, but Islamic fundamen-
 talists defend the building restrictions.
 In theory, mosques must also be licensed by the Government. The Penal Codepro-
 hibits using a place of worship for antigovernment speeches, and the Ministry of e-
 ligious Affairs proposes themes and monitors sermons. In practice, the Government
 cannot control all sermons, especially at "unauthorized" mosues where sermons
 sometimes invoke antievernment, anti-Christian, and anti-Western themes. The
 Government continued its efforts to bring private mosques under its administrative
 control as a means to counter extremism. In recent years, the police have closed sev-
 eral unlicensed churches and mosques, although others continue in operation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Countr, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is freedom to travel within Egypt except in certain military
 areas. Egyptian males who have not completed compulsory military service may not
 travel abroad or emigrate, although this restriction can be circumvented. Unmarried
 women under 21 must have permission from their fathers to obtain passports; mar-
 ried women require permission from their husbands. Citizens who leave the country
 have the right to return. In October the Government discontinued the practice of
 requiring a special travel permit, issued by the Ministry of Interior, for Egyptian
 citizens to visit Israel.
 In recent years, the Government has denied permission to Christian converts from
 Islam to travel abroad. In a recent case, police arrested a convert to Christianity
 at Cairo airport and prevented .er from boarding a flight to Europe. The Govern-
 ment also sometimes prevents travel for political reasons. In March security forces
 prevented Faten, the second wife of Omar Abdel Rahman, from departing Egypt for
 a pilgrimage to Mecca.
 The deportation of Egyptian citizens and aliens granted political asylum is prohib-
 ited and not practiced. Egypt is host to thousands of refugees, but only a few are
 granted the right to resettle in Egypt. In the past, some Ethiopians and other Afri-
 cans, who see documentation as refugees by the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees, have been detained by the police and transported to areas near
 the Libyan or Sudanese borders where they are released. Some have returned to
 their countries; others have found their way back to Egyptian cities.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) dominates the 454-seat People's As-
 sembly, the Shura Council, local governments, the mass media, labor, the large pub-
 lic sector, and the licensing of new political parties, newspapers, and private organi-
 zations to such an extent that, as a practical matter, Egyptians do not have a mean-
 ingful abiity tochange the national government.
 In 1993 President Hosni Mubarak was elected unopposed to a third 6-year term
 by the People's Assembly. In October Mubarak's reelection was submitted to the
 public in a national referendum in which 96 percent of the voters approved it. The
 Government claimed that 86 percent of the electorate went to the polls, although
 the actual figure was believed to be much lower. Under Egypt's electoral system,
 the electorate was not presented with a choice among competing presidential can-
 didates; it was offered the opportunity only to vote for or against Mubarak's reelec-
 tion. Two opposition parties, the Wafd and the Islamist-affiliated Socialist Labor
 Party, urged the public to boycott the referendum, and two other parties, the leftist
 Tagammu and the Nasserist, urged the public to vote against Mubarak. The other
 opposition parties endorsed Mubarak's candidacy.
 In the 1990 People's Assembly election, NDP candidates won 383 seats of 444
 elected, independents won 55, and a leftist party won 6. Seven opposition parties
 boycotted the election.
 Women and Copts generally do not hold positions of senior leadership in the Gov-
 ernment or political parties. The Constitution reserves 10 Assembly seats for presi-
 dential appointees, which assures some representation for Copts and women. Ten
 women hold Assembly seats: seven elected and three appointed. Five Copts sit in
 the Assembly: one elected and four appointed.
 The Assembly debates government proposals, and members exercise their author-
 ity to call Cabinet ministers to explain policy, but the legislature does not have suf-
 ficient authority to challenge or restrain the executive. Many executive branch ini-
 tiatives and policies are carried out by ministerial decree without significant legisla-
 tive oversight.
 
 
 1173
 Presidential appointments do not require legislative approval; the executive initi-
 ates almost all legislation; the Assembly may not modify the budget except with the
 Government's approval; and there is little oversight of the Interior Ministry's use
 of Emergency Law powers. The military budget is prepared by the executive and
 not debated publicly. Roll-call votes in the Assembly are rare. Votes are generally
 reported in aggregate terms of yea's and nay's, and thus constituents have no inde-
 pendent method of checking a member's voting record.
 There are 12 recognized opposition parties. New parties must be approved by the
 Parties Committee, a semiofficial body dominated by the ruling National Democratic
 Party. To form a party without a license is a felony. In 1993 the Committee did not
 grant registration to any new political party. However in June an administrative
 court ordered the Committee to issue a license to the 4ocial Justice Party. A court
 also reinstated the former leadership of the Young Egypt Party. In January a court
 upheld the ban on the Awakening Party, claiming the party's program includes so-
 liciting funds outside Egypt, an activity prohibited by law.
 The law prohibits political parties based on religion. Nevertheless, Muslim Broth-
 erhood partisans are active. Some have served in the Assembly as independents or
 members of other recognized parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no officially recognized local human rights organizations. The Govern-
 ment refuses to license them as "private organizations" (see Section 2.b.) on the
 grounds that they are political organizations.Nevertheless, the Egyptian Organiza-
 tion for Human Rights (EOHR) and the associated Arab Organization for Human
 Rights (AOHR) oprate openly. EOHR's field workers visit prisons and call on gov-
 ernment offices. Both the EOHR and AOHR have challenged the ruling on their
 legal status in the courts. In 1993 the Government did not interfere with EOHR's
 relocation to larger offices in Cairo and did not interfere with its receiving money
 from abroad.
 In February an EOHR official was stopped and questioned by security forces while
 accompanying a representative from the U.S.-based Middle East Watch (MEW) on
 a fact-finding mission in southern Egypt. In August the Ministry of Interior pre-
 vented EOHR officials from holding meetings in several southern Egyptian towns.
 In May Amnesty International released a report on human rights abuses related
 to the Government's antiterrorist campaign. The Government issued an official re-
 sponse asserting that terrorism requires the imposition of emergency laws; that
 cases of abuse occur in Egypt but they are few and should not obscure Egypt's
 record of respect for human rights; and that the human rights record of any country
 should not be based on exceptional cases but on a comprehensive study of the coun-
 try's social, cultural, political realities.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Egyptian law provides for equality of the sexes, but aspects of the law
 and many traditional practices discriminate against women. Under Egyptian law,
 only males can transmit Egyptian citizenship. In rare cases, this means that chil-
 dren born to Egyptian mothers and stateless fathers a: themselves stateless.
 Laws affecting marriage and personal status generally correspond to an individ-
 ual's religion, which for most Egyptians is Islam. A 1979 liberalization of the family
 status law strengthened a Muslim woman's rights to divorce and to child custody
 but in 1985 the changes were found unconstitutional on grounds they conflicted
 with Islamic law and were repealed. Under Islamic law, non-Muslim males must
 convert to Islam to marry Muslim women, but non-Muslim women need not convert
 to marry Muslim men. Muslim female heirs receive half the amount of a male heir's
 inheritance, while Christian widows of Muslims have no inheritance rights. A sole
 female heir receives half her parents' estate; the balance goes to designated male
 relatives. A sole male heir inherits all his parents' property. Male Muslim heirs
 have the duty to provide for all family members who need assistance.
 Egyptian women have employment opportunities in government, medicine, law,
 academia, the arts, and, to a lesser degree, in business. About 100 officers in the
 Egyptian diplomatic service are women, including 3 ambassadors. Social pressure
 against women pursuing a career remains strong, however, and some Egyptian
 feminists say that a resurgent Islamic fundamentalist trend limits further gains.
 Women's rights advocates also point to other discriminatory attitudes and practices
 such as female circumcision and the male relative's role in enforcing women's com-
 pliance with religiously prescribed codes of sexual conduct. In 1993 Fatma Abdul
 Raouf was denied employment as a magistrate in a public prosecutor's office, the
 
 
 1174
 first step in Egypt to becoming a judge, because she is a woman. She is currently
 suing the Ministry of Justice or sex discrimination. There are no women judges in
 Egypt-
 F-mily violence against women does occur, but its extent is unknown. Abuse with-
 in the family is seldom discussed publicly, owing to the value attached to personal
 privacy in this traditional society.
 There are at least two active women's rights groups, one affiliated with EOHR.
 The other is the Communications Group for the Enhancement of the Status of
 Women, which has published a booklet on the legal rights of Egyptian women.
 Children.-The Government is committed to the protection of children's welfare.
 According to law, public education is compulsory until age 12, and the employment,
 or job training, of children under age 12 is prohibited. For many years, the Govern-
 ment has operated a "reading for all program" which seeks to bring literacy to older
 children and adults. The Government has also employed the media to promote chil-
 dren's education and welfare. Examples include Egypt's annual international chil-
 dren's film festival and television programming aimed at children's education. How-
 ever, despite the Government's commitment to children's welfare, child labor is a
 widespread problem. Moreover, much of the resources for children's welfare are pro-
 vided by international aid donors, especially in the fields of education and child im-
 munization programs.
 Female genital mutilation (excision), which international health experts have con-
 demned as damaging to both physical and mental health, occurs-predominantly in
 rural areas--but there are few reliable statistics on its extent. Excision and the
 more drastic infibulation are practiced in some parts of upper Egypt. Female exci-
 sion is not illegal, but doctors are prohibited from performing it in government hos-
 pitals.
 Religious Minorities.-The approximately 5 million Coptic Christians are broadly
 discriminated against by the Government and are also the objects of violent assaults
 by terrorists.
 Government discriminatory practices include delays in issuing church building
 and repair permits; the detention and mistreatment of some Muslim converts to
 Christianity; laws that prevent Muslims from changing their identity papers to re-
 flect their conversion to Christianity (see Section 2.c.); anti-Christian discrimination
 in education embodied in a requirement that all public school students memorize
 Koranic verses as part of their Arabic studies; a ban on the hiring of Christian Ara-
 bic teachers in public schools since the curriculum involves study of the Koran; the
 production of Islamic television programs, some with anti-Christian themes; job dis-
 crimination in the police, the armed forces, and government agencies; reported anti-
 Christian  discrimination   in  admission   to  state   medical   schools;  and
 underrepresentation in government. There are no Coptic governors and few Copts
 in the upper ranks of the military, police, and diplomatic service.
 In addition to the murders of Copts by terrorists described in Section L.a., terror-
 ists attempted to murder a Coptic novelist, Shehata Guirgis, in Assiyut in April.
 The area of Dairut, Assiyut Governorate, the scene of a massacre of 13 Coptic resi-
 dents in May 1992, is reportedly still tense as Coptic residents fear for their safety
 outside their homes. Islamists have obstructed church repairs and construction and
 harassed Copt-owned businesses. Christians have complained that the Government
 has been lax in protecting Coptic lives and property. Security forces arrest terrorists
 who perpetrate violence against Copts, but the Government does not always prevent
 attacks and does little to correct nonviolent forms of discrimination, including its
 own.
 Several times in 1993 Minister of Education Hassan Kamel Behei Eddine stated
 publicly that religious intolerance has become more pronounced in the public school
 system. In March the Minister expelled four female secondary school students for
 aying an audio cassette tape in their classroom which reportedly contained anti-
 Christian remarks. Although the students were reinstated 2 weeks later, their ex-
 pulsions sparked antigovernment and anti-Christian demonstrations in their home
 town. In the disturbances, at least 52 persons were hurt, and petroleum bombs were
 thrown at a local church.
 People with Disabilities.-The Government makes serious efforts to address the
 rights of the disabled. It works closely with United Nations agncies and other
 international aid donors to design job training programs for the diabled. The Gov-
 ernment also seeks to increase tNe 'public's awareness of the capabilities of the dis-
 abled in television programming, the print media, and in educational material in
 the public schools. Although there is no known legislation for access to public accom-
 modations, the disabled are provided with preferred seating on government-owned
 mass transit buses.
 
 
 1175
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Egyptian workers may, but are not required to, join
 trade unions. A union local, or worker's committee, may be formed if 50 employees
 express a desire to organize. Most union members, about 25 percent of the labor
 force, are employed by state-owned enterprises. The law stipulates that "high ad-
 ministrative" officials in government and the public sector may not join unions.
 There are 23 industrial unions, all required to belong to the Egyptian Trade
 Union Federation (ETUF), the sole legally recognized labor federation. A 1993 cri-
 tique by the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) noted that the labor
 union law of 1978 impinges on worker rights in the following ways: The law defines
 which trade unions may be established, the manner in which they are to be orga-
 nized, and their aims; it also prohibits the establishment of more than one trade
 union federation; the Government may disapprove or revoke the charter of any
 trade union, thus rendering it an illegl organization; with court approval, the Min-
 ister of Labor has authorty to dissolve the national governing board of a trade
 union; the law does not deme under what circumstances the national governing
 board of a trade union may dissolve the board of an affiliated union local. Moreover,
 only one union is allowed per workplace.
 The International Labor Organization's Committee of Experts (COE), which has
 Iong noted these same defects, ured the Government in 1993 to guarantee to all
 workers the right to establish trade union organizations outside the existing trade
 union structure, to recognize the right of workers' organizations to elect their rep-
 resentatives in full freedom and to administer the finances of their activities with-
 out interference by the public authorities, and to remove restrictions on the right
 to strike.
 The Government has shown no sign that it intends to accept the establishment
 of more than one federation. The ETUF leadership asserts that it actively promotes
 worker interests and that there is no need for another federation. The ETUF is
 nominally independent of the Government, but ETUF officials have close relations
 with the ruling NDP, and some are members of the People's Assembly and the
 Shura Council.l'hey speak vigorously on behalf of worker concerns, but public con-
 frontations between ETUF and the Government are rare. Disputes are more often
 resolved by consensus behind closed doors.
 Even though the right to strike is not guaranteed, strikes do occur. The Govern-
 ment considers strikes a form of public disturbance and hence illegal. Strikes occur-
 ring in 1993 were brief and isolated.
 Sme unions within the ETUF have affiliated with international trade union orga-
 nizations, and others are in the process of doing so.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Under the current law,
 unions may negotiate work contracts with public sector enterprises if the latter
 agree to such negotiations, but unions otherwise lack collective bargaining power in
 the state sector. Under current circumstances, collective bargaining does not exist
 in any meaningful sense because the Government sets wages lbenefits, and job clas-
 sifications by law. Larger firms in the private sector generally adhere to such gov-
 ernment-mandated standards.
 Labor law and practice are the same in the export processing zones as in the rest
 of the country.
 c. Prohibitwn of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Fored or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and not practiced. There are no known instances of domestic or foreign workers
 forced to remain in situations amounting to coerced or forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 12. Education is compulsory until age 15. An employee must be at least 15 to
 join a labor union. The Labor Law of 1981 states that children 12 to 15 may work
 6 hours a day but not after 7 p.m. and not in dangerous or heavy activities. Child
 workers must obtain medical certificates and work permits before they are em-
 ployed. A 1989 study estimated that two-thirds of working children, perhaps
 720 000 children work on farms.
 Hfowever, children also work as apprentices in repair and craft shops and as work-
 ers in heavier industries such as brickmaking and textiles. It is difficult to verify
 how closely the Ministry of Labor enforces child labor laws, especially in family-
 owned ente 'rises.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-For government and public sector employees,
 the statutory monthly minimum wage is $11.40 (38 Egyptian pounds) for vocational
 school graduates and $14.40 (48 pounds) for university graduates (for a legally max-
 imum workweek of 6 days, 48 hours). The minimum wage has not been adjusted
 since the early 1980's. Like the base pay rates in the public sector, the minimum
 wage is supplemented by a complex system of fringe benefits and yearly bonuses.
 These additions may triple the worker's take-home pay. The minimum wage is also
 
 
 1176
 
 legally binding on the private sector, and larger private companies generally observe
 the requirement and pay bonuses as well. Smaller firms do not always pay the mini-
 mum wage or bonuses.
 The Ministry of Labor sets worker health and safety standards, which also apply
 in the export processing zones, but enforcement and inspection are uneven. Under
 the current labor law, workers may decline dangerous work assignments without
 jeopardy to their employment. The law also requires employers to provide regular
 medical examinations to employees in hazardous occupations.
