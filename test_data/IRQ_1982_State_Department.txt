 I RAQ
 The Republic of Iraq is ruled by a Revolutionary Command
 Council, itself dominated by a small group from the town of
 Takrit, and dominating in turn the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party
 of Iraq. The Council has both executive and legislative
 authority, and in effect rules by decree under the provisional
 Constitution of 1968. Saddam Hussein is President of the
 Republic and Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council. In
 1980, elections were held for a National Assembly with limited
 authority and guided by Ba'ath Party views.
 Iraq was carved out of the former Ottoman Empire at the end of
 the First World War. Its somewhat arbitrarily drawn borders
 contained many disparate groupings, most notably Shi'ite and
 Sunni Arab Muslims, Kurds in the north,. and various Christian
 sects, predominantly Assyrians and Chaldeans. Periods of
 political instability and violence often involved rivalries
 among these groups. In 1932 Iraq gained its independence from
 Britain. A military coup overthrew the monarchy in 1958.
 Successive regimes were toppled, and the Ba'ath Party came to
 power in 1968.
 Iraq has a nominally socialist form of economy but in recent
 years has permitted the expansion of a private capitalist-
 sector. The wealth generated by Iraq's oil production (in 1979
 Iraq was the Middle East's second largest producer) is used to
 promote light industrial and agricultural development, as well
 as improvements in health, education, and transportation
 services.
 Throughout 1982 Iraq continued to be engaged in a full scale
 war with Iran which began in 1980. Tens of thousands of
 soldiers on both sides have been killed or captured in the
 fighting. A Western source, after visiting one large prisoner
 of war camp for Iranians, was favorably impressed by the
 treatment they were receiving. Civilian targets have been
 bombed and shelled by both sides. However, most fighting is
 confined to military or strategic economic targets.
 There continue to be reports of deportations of Iraqis thought
 to be of Iranian origin, although not in the large numbers
 which occurred before and shortly after the war began.
 Conflict between Government forces and Kurds in the north of
 Iraq intensified in 1982. By mid-summer 1982, no Iraqis were
 permitted to travel abroad except on Government business.
 Political rights are sharply limited, mostly to a small elite
 within the Ba'ath Party, and little dissent from Government
 policies is tolerated. Media censorship is endemic. There are
 few dependable sources about many Government practices. The
 Government neither acknowledges human rights violations por
 facilitates outside investigations of allegations of human
 rights violations. Activities which the state considers
 threats to its security can lead to detention without charge,
 severe prison sentences, mistreatment, torture, or execution.
 Most of these actions are carried out by a large and feared
 internal security police force.
 Summary executions may be carried out because of suspected
 opposition to the Ba'ath, for factional reasons, or as
 punishment for lack of success in the war. Iraq has supported
 terrorist groups that engage in killings abroad.

 While there was little change in this picture in 1982, the
 Government lifted a ban on the Communist Party of Iraq,
 estimated to consist of about 2,000 hard-core members. It also
 granted a limited amnesty to Kurds. Both of these developments
 were probably related to efforts to neutralize internal
 opposition in a wartime situation.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Executions have been an established method for dealing with
 clandestine political and military opponents of the Government,
 particularly members of the outlawed Dalwa Party (Shi'a
 Muslims), the Communist Party, and Kurds. In its 1982 report,
 Amnesty International stated that it was *deeply concerned
 about the growing number of executions in Iraq. Reports
 indicated that more than 350 executions took place in 1981" for
 offenses such as alleged plots against the Government,
 political activity in the armed forces, andmembership in
 illegal parties. Because of the secrecy surrounding them,
 confirmation of executions is almost impossible to obtain.
 Amnesty International is investigating allegations of
 poisonings of political suspects. Two recently released
 political detainees were examined by doctors in the United
 Kingdom and found to be suffering from thallium sulfate
 poisoning. One later died. An American physician reported
 that medical practitioners in Iraq frequently see unmistakable
 symptoms of thallium sulfate poisoning among recently released
 political prisoners.
 Members of the political elite have been executed as a result
 of factional conflict. After the death of ex-President Ahmed
 Hassan al-Bakr in October 1982, approximately 30 of his
 supporters who had recently been purged from the Government and
 Baath Party were reportedly arrested. The Government has
 acknowledged that at least one of the purged ministers was
 executed, allegedly for gross incompetence and corruption. In
 May 1982 the commander of the Iraqi Third Division, General
 Jawad Asaad Shetna, a Kurd, was reportedly executed for alleged
 cowardice and incompetence on the battlefield.
 There are frequent claims that captured Kurdish rebels are
 executed. Amnesty International alleged also that in January,
 1981, 19 members of the Kurdish Democratic Party were executed
 and that a further 61 were under sentence of death.
 Terrorists who have resided in or transited Iraq with the
 approval of the Government have been responsible for
 assassinations abroad. Media reports linked Iraq to the 1980
 attack op the Iranian Embassy in London. At least until late
 1982, Iraq continued to tolerate the presence of the anti-PLO
 Palestinian terrorist organization Black June and the
 occasional presence of its leader, Sabri al-Banna or "Abu
 Nidal." Iraq has provided an operational base for Black June,
 which has been responsible for assassinations and fatal
 bombings in a number of European and Middle Eastern countries.
 In 1982, it was linked to the shooting of the Israeli
 Ambassador in London, the attack on a synagogue in Rome, and
 assasinations or attempted assassinations of Arab diplomats in
 Madrid, Kuwait, Pakistan, and Bombay.
 Terrorism also has been directed against the Government of
 Iraq. A Syrian-based Shia group, the Iraq Movement of the
 Mujahideen, claimed responsibility for the car-bombing which
 killed 30-60 people at the Ministry of Planning in Baghdad in
 August 1982. Iranian radio claimed the same group and other
 Shia terrorists were responsible for other terrorist acts
 within Iraq, including the December 15, 1982 bombing at the
 
 
 1149
 Iraqi News Agency in Baghdad. Iraqi Embassies and offices in
 Paris, Madrid, and Vienna were bombed in 1982.
 b. Disappearance
 Iraqi emigrants have reported that the secret police abduct
 some suspects, particularly those wanted for broadly-defined
 subversion. Family-members rarely know where or why these
 relatives are being held. It is difficult to learn whether
 there has been an execution, or whether the missing person died
 by torture. In a recent case, it was only after the persistent
 intercession of well-placed relatives and friends that the
 remains were released to the family for proper burial. Amnesty
 International asserted in 1979 that only a small percentage of
 executions are made public or confirmed.
 c. Torture
 According to former prisoners, persons arrested for political
 reasons have been tortured or mistreated. Although the
 Constitution prohibits torture, allegations persist that severe
 physical and psychological torture accompany interrogations.
 Beatings with rubber hoses or planks, suspensionnfrom a ceiling
 fan, and electric shock treatment have been reported.
 Psychological: maltreatment is said to include threatening
 prisoners with loaded weapons, playing tape recordings of
 torture sessions, and threatening members of the prisoner's
 family in his presence.
 In April 1981, Amnesty International published extracts of
 medical findings on 15 individuals who had spent up to nine
 months in detention between 1976 and 1979. Although they were
 arrested at different times and places, their accounts showed a
 uniform pattern of torture. Doctors found the medical evidence
 consistent with their accounts. Reported incidents included
 hanging by handcuffed wrists, burns by cigarettes and special
 tools, repeated beatings on the soles of feet, sexual
 molestation, threats of rape, and mock executions. A
 journalist testified that his knuckles had been burned so that
 he could not write again.
 In 1981, an expert's report to the United Nations Subcommission
 on Human Rights in Geneva stated that there were frequent
 reports of death under torture in Iraq. Political detainees
 had been killed, and their mutilated bodies returned near to
 their families' homes, according to the expert. There are no
 reports that those who employ torture are disciplined by the
 Government.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading.Tceatment or Punishment
 Degrading treatment is reportedly practiced immediately
 following arrest and during interrogation, especially when
 security matters are involved. Reportedly, such treatment is
 usually discontinued after completion of investigation or
 sentencing.
 Prison conditions for convicted criminals are better than those
 for security detainees, who have reported generally degrading
 treatment. Convicted criminals can have food provided from the
 outside and access to some medical services. Temporary
 detention facilities reportedly are crowded and unsanitary.
 Security-suspects are allowed to see relatives or attorneys
 only after interrogation is finished. Persons charged with
 common felonies usually can receive visitors, including
 attorneys. Prisoners are grouped in jail by length of
 sentences.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Iraqis are subject to arbitrary arrest on political or security
 grounds. The Government has also been known to arrest family
 
 
 1150
 members, including women and children, of persons it seeks.
 Criminal suspects are allowed judicial review of the basis of
 their detention; political detainees are not. Reliable
 information concerning the number of political detainees is
 unavailable.
 In 1979, Amnesty International issued a report alleging the
 imprisonment or detention of 760 Kurds. Amnesty International
 also has received the names of 200 Kurds allegedly executed in
 the last several years. In June 1981, it received reports that
 27 Iraqi Kurds from the autonomous region of Kurdistan were
 sentenced to death by the special military court in Kirkuk.
 Iraq specifically excluded most Kurdish rebels from its 1978
 amnesty of political prisoners, though some 400 persons
 associated with Kurdish opposition activities were included.
 In 1982, in an attempt to end increasing civil unrest in
 Kurdistan, the Government announced a broad amnesty of Kurdish
 prisoners, excluding those held for murder or kidnaping.
 Suspected dissidents from the Shi'a majority have also been
 major targets for arrest, particularly members of the outlawed
 Dawa Party. Following a July 1982 assassination attempt on
 President Saddam Hussein by a predominantly Shi'a group in
 ad-Dujal, foreign journalists reported that Iraqi security
 forces arrested more than 300 persons including family members
 of the men killed in the attempt.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials in civil, criminal and religious courts are open.
 Defendants in these courts are entitled to counsel. A lawyer
 is provided if a defendant cannot afford one. Charges and
 evidence are available for review. Appellate courts try cases
 which do not come under the jurisdiction of the revolutionary
 courts. Closed trials are the rule in the revolutionary
 courts, which hear such crimes as espionage, treason, smuggling
 and drug trafficking. Closed, too, are the "special courts'
 constituted by the Revolutionary Command Council for specific
 incidents, such as the reported conspiracy against the regime
 in 1979. These special tribunals are apparently exempt from
 Constitutional safeguards of defendants' rights. Because the
 defendants are held incommunicado, the right of defense is
 proscribed. Confessions extracted by torture are used against
 the defendants. Appeals can be taken only to the Chairman of
 the Revolutionary Command Council, the President. However, the
 availability of this appeal may be ineffective, since there are
 reports that executions take place shortly after trial.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Strong cultural values reinforce Constitutional protections of
 the inviolability of the home. Police must obtain a search
 warrant before entering the home of a criminal suspect.
 Warrants are not required for the arrest of security suspects.
 Arrests usually occur outside the home and allegations of
 illegal entry are rare. There is no legal protection against
 wiretapping, which Iraqis believe to be a common practice.
 2.   Respect for Civil and PoliticalRights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government views any form of political dissent as a threat
 to the security of the country, and controls the exercise of
 the rights of speech, press, and assembly. The Constitution
 prohibits *any act aimed at undermining the national unity of
 the people, provoking racial, sectarian, and regional bigotry,
 or violating gains and achievements of the country.'
 The Government owns and operates the press, radio, and
 television. The media do not criticize the Government. The
 
 
 1151
 news-is strongly biased in favor of the Government. Opposition
 viewpoints are not heard. Very few foreign periodicals reach
 Iraq and Western newspapers are not sold on newstands. Foreign
 visitors' newspapers, magazines, and cassettes often are
 confiscated at the airport. To control the dissemination of
 political leaflets, typewriters and photocopying machines must
 be registered with the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings in Iraq are organized only under the auspices
 of the Government. Free association and demonstrations without
 Government approval have met with severe repression.
 The unionized workforce is estimated at about 100,000. Workers
 legally have the right to strike after providing notice to the
 Ministry of Labor, but no strikes have been known to occur
 since 1968. The unions initiate grievances to management, but
 a primary union function is to indoctrinate members with
 Ba'athi doctrine. Surveillance keeps union members under
 control. Union membership is a prerequisite for employment in
 many sectors.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Iraq is an ethnically and religiously diverse society. The
 Government, dominated by the Sunni Muslim Arab minority,
 pursues a secular policy aimed at assimilating Iraq's various
 ethnic and religious groups, including the Jewish, Yezidi, and
 Christian minorities and the Shi'a Muslim majority.- In some
 instances, this takes the form of trying to wean groups away
 from their cultural traditions, languages, ethnic identities
 and ways of life. In 1982, however the Government has relaxed
 implementation of this policy in some cases, and has more
 actively sought the support of ethnic and religious minorities
 as recognized subgroups of the citizenry.
 Some 500,000 Christians constitute about four percent of the
 population. They enjoy freedom of worship in churches of
 established denominations, which receive some support from the
 state, but not freedom to proselytize or hold meetings outside
 church premises. Convents and monasteries exist and some new
 churches are constructed. In early 1980, the Government
 instituted obligatory Koranic studies for all students
 including non-Muslims. The measure was withdrawn after the
 Christian community and visiting Arab-American groups
 vigorously opposed it.
 The largely urbanized Chaldeans are-the wealthiest and the best
 educated of the Christian groups.   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
 Aziz is a Chaldean. Other Chaldeans occupy mid-level
 Government positions. Syriac Christians are often found in the
 lower ranks of the civil service. Armenians are concentrated
 in private business. Assyrian Christians, often less educated,
 and more recent arrivals from rural areas, are, on the whole,
 poorer than the other groups.
 A 1981 law gave the Ministry of Endowment and Religious Affairs
 the authority to promulgate laws and regulations governing
 places of worship, appointment of clergy, religious literature,
 and participation in religious councils and meetings. Because
 of the potential authority this would give the Government over
 religious matters, the law caused concern among some religious
 leaders in Iraq and in the United States. Some Iraqi
 Christians have stated their belief that the law was designed
 to provide a legal mechanism for the Government to control the
 Shi'a. To date this law has not been invoked against the
 Christian sects, and a Government source indicated that the law
 would soon be amended in the areas found most objectionable by
 the religious leaders.
 
 
 1152
 
 The Shi'a, who make up 55 percent of the population, have felt
 economically and socially disadvantaged by the governing
 Sunnis. Traditionally at the bottom of Iraqi society, they
 suffer economic discrimination and occupy mostly unskilled
 jobs. They have less access to basic commodities and consumer
 goods, and disproportionately suffer Baghdad's housing
 shortage. Shi'ites were major targets of a campaign of
 arrests, executions, and expulsions following with the
 Iranian-inspired terrorist attacks on senior Government and
 Ba'ath Party officials in 1980. Shi'a clergy operate under
 close Government supervision and must submit Friday prayer
 sermons to the authorities for approval. The Government
 administers the principal Shi'ite shrines. In an effort to win
 support from the devout, it allocated increased amounts of
 money in 1982 to refurbish and maintain Shi'ite shrines and
 Sunni mosques. Shi'a and Sunni religious officials receive
 government salaries. In recent years the Government and Ba'ath
 Party have sought to recruit more Shi'a to positions of
 prominence. The Government now allows some
 previously-prohibited Shi'ite religious practices such as
 public self-flagellation and processions.
 The Jewish community in Iraq is believed to number fewer than
 300. The extent of the community's religious activity and
 other liberties is not known. Although the last of some 200
 Freemasons imprisoned in 1973-1974 were amnestied in July 1979,
 some members of the Baha'i sect may still be imprisoned.
 Organized activities by Freemasons and Baha'is are prohibited.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 A mass relocation of Kurds took place after the 1974-5 Kurdish
 rebellion. The Government created a 36 kilometer wide security
 zone along much of the borders with Iran and Turkey. It moved
 Kurds and others from the zone to distant areas. Most of those
 forcibly relocated have been allowed to return to the north,
 although not to their original villages. Most have been
 resettled in Government-built centers.
 Over'30,000 Iranians and Iraqis of Iranian descent were
 summarily expelled to Iran in April 1980, and thousands of
 others were reportedly expelled subsequently. Those remaining
 live with the threat of deportation and may face other official
 intimidation. Many 'Iranian' families have been in Iraq for
 generations. Some claim their forebears were not from Iran but
 had claimed to be Iranian to evade Ottoman military
 conscription. Citizens considered to be of Iranian origin bear
 specially marked identification, often precluding desired
 employment. Those already employed face impediments to
 advancement, in addition to the threat of deportation.
 Sensitive border and other security areas are off limits.
 Civilian travel in the war zones is restricted. There are
 police checkpoints on highways and outside every major town,
 but most Iraqis and foreigners travel freely in non-restricted
 areas. Foreign diplomats must obtain permits from the Foreign
 Ministry for travel to areas outside of Baghdad, but these are
 usually granted.
 Iraqi passport fees are reasonable. All Iraqis wishing to
 travel abroad are required to obtain exit permission. Citizens
 are usually limited to one trip per year outside the Arab
 world. Those with records of political activity may find it
 difficult to obtain travel documents; many wait years to
 receive exit permits. Because of the war with Iran, in 1981
 Iraq imposed a travel ban on all Iraqi males between the ages
 of 18 and 45, with few exceptions. Physicians working for the
 Government also were precluded from travel, regardless of age.
 It is extremely difficult for highly skilled technicians or
 specialist engineers to leave the country. Travel to the
 United States requires specific permission.
 
 
 1153
 Students and teachers may leave the country only during school
 vacations. A married woman must have the permission of her
 husband to travel. The Government can also require a
 prospective Iraqi traveller to post a substantial bond to
 assure return. If students on scholarship abroad do not
 return, their families must repay the costs of the education.
 Although there are no formal restrictions on emigration, many
 Iraqis attempt to leave the country surreptitiously. Minority
 members are not known to face special emigration restrictions.
 Many emigrants leave behind substantial property because of the
 difficulty of transferring assets out of the country.
 Penalties for violating exchange laws can be severe.
 In February 1980 the Revolutionary Command Council passed a
 resolution requiring alien spouses of Iraqi citizens who have
 resided in Iraq for five years to naturalize or to leave Iraq
 without their families. The Government confiscates such
 aliens' residence permits until they naturalize.
 In recent years the Government has instituted special programs
 to encourage qualified professionals to return to Iraq. Aliens
 of Iraqi origin can apply for a document which will permit them
 to enter and exit Iraq without procuring a visa.
 In August 1979, Iraq offered a special amnesty to Iraqi Kurds
 outside the country who wished to lay down their arms and
 return. Five Kurds prominently associated with the 1974-1975
 rebellion returned in December 1979, and were appointed as
 counselors to the Kurdish Affairs Bureau of the Iraqi
 Revolutionary Command Council. There are unconfirmed reports
 that as many as 10,000 of the Kurds who fled following the
 1974-1975 rebellion have returned under this special amnesty.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Iraq is ruled by a small group of officials headed by Saddam
 Hussein. Most of the members of this group are linked by
 family roots in the town of Tikrit. This group rules by
 dominating the Ba'ath Party. The party has a large membership,
 but only the "active members' -- some 10,000 -- participate
 meaningfully in party activities. Political power is
 concentrated first in the Tikriti group, and then more widely
 among the Sunni Arabs. Shi'a and Kurds hold important
 positions, but not the most politically powerful ones.
 There are two other legal political parties, both Kurdish.
 They and the Ba'ath Party constitute the Patriotic and
 Progressive National Front, essentially a vehicle of support
 for the Government. The two non-Ba'ath parties carry on only
 limited activity. Members of the Iraqi military or security
 services may engage in political activities only within the
 Ba'ath Party. Membership in the party is not required for
 appointment to senior Government positions, but normally is
 necessary to attain political influence. Opposition groups,
 including various Kurdish groups and splinter parties, are
 severely repressed. The outlawed Da'wa Party (Shi'a
 religious-oriented) has been a major target of persecution.
 Membership or association in the group, which has engaged in
 anti-regime terrorism, bears the penalty of execution. The
 Communist Party was removed from the Front and declared illegal
 in 1979. In 1982 the Government amnestied Iraqi communists
 both those in Iraq and abroad. How many imprisoned communists
 were released is not known.
 The first general elections since the overthrow of the monarchy
 in 1958 were held in June 1980 for a National Assembly. Voters
 could choose from among many candidates, but the Government
 carefully screened all candidates before the campaigns. Voter
 turnout among both sexes was heavy and 16 women were among the
 candidates elected. Members of the Assembly are not required
 
 
 1154
 to join the Ba'ath Party, but they must pledge allegiance to
 the principles of the Ba'ath Revolution.
 Mayors and provincial governors are appointed by the central
 Government.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Iraq ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights in 1971. Iraq has not permitted outside investigations
 of alleged human rights violations and has had little contact
 with foreign human rights organizations. No human rights
 monitoring groups are known to exist within the country. Iraq
 described as 'without foundation' Amnesty International's April
 1981 report of the testimonies, case histories, and medical
 evaluations of 15 Iraqis allegedly tortured in Iraq in the late
 seventies. Iraq cited international accords to which it is a
 party or to which it adheres in principle, and ConstitutiQnal
 and other domestic legal protections of the rights of Iraqis.
 The Government did not reply in detail to specific charges.
 Iraq has received the President and other delegates of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to discuss the
 treatment of prisoners of war and the protection of civilians
 in the Iran-Iraq War. An ICRC delegate based in Iraq makes
 regular visits to Iranian prisoners of war and assisted in the
 repatriation of some 25 Iranian and Iraqi prisoners of war.
 Delegates also visited the Iraqi-occupied territories in Iran.
 4.   Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Throughout the seventies the Ba'ath regime made substantial
 progress in improving the standard of living by concentrating
 on education, health, and welfare reforms. While the most
 evident gains have taken place in urban areas, many Government
 policies focus on assisting rural dwellers.
 Iraq has a centrally-controlled, nominally socialist economy.
 Major industries, including petroleum, are state-owned. Gross
 national product per capita almost quadrupled during the
 seventies, from $630 to $3,021. Much of this increase,
 however, represented a pro rata share of accumulated foreign
 reserves resulting from higher oil prices. The Government
 channeled much of its oil earnings into development, rather
 than into consumer purchasing power. Wage increases slightly
 lead the 15-17 percent inflation rate. Urban dwellers have
 experienced the greatest relative rise in their standard of
 living. In the period 1976-1979, 40 percent of the rural
 population remained below the absolute poverty level. At the
 end of 1982, oil exports were at about one-fifth of pre-war
 levels. Despite large subsidies from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,
 Iraqi foreign exchange reserves face increasingly severe
 strain. The Government has responded by curtailing all but the
 most essential development projects. Nonetheless, basic
 necessities and consumer goods remained available at or above
 pre-war levels.
 Health care is free or provided at a token fee. Although
 serious shortages of qualified personnel persist, medical
 professionals and workers increased from 9,000 in 1968 to over
 40,000 in 1980. The number of medical and nursing training
 institutions increased in the same period from three to
 sixty-five. There was one doctor per 2,000 persons in 1980.
 Iraq's estimated population was 13,805,000 in 1981. Life
 expectancy at birth has increased from 51.7 years in 1969-1971
 to 56.2 years in 1980, with infant mortality rates in 1981 at
 92 per 1,000 live births. These gains were due to improved
 health care and greatly increased urban and rural access to
 safe drinking water.
 
 
 1155
 Education is free through the university level. The Government
 offers a wide range of scholarships for advanced study abroad.
 In the last ten years, enrollment in and the number of primary
 and secondary schools has more than doubled. Female
 enrollment, especially at the primary level, largely accounted
 for the dramatic rise. The number of students in vocational
 schools and universities has increased markedly. The
 Government claims that implementation of the anti-illiteracy
 law of 1976 has raised Iraq's literacy rate to 70 percent.
 ,The'land-reform program ended the feudal system of the past but
 has-not yet replaced it with a viable system. President Saddam
 -Hussein abandoned a program to impose collective farms on the
 East European model in April 1981, and land has been returned
 to private ownership. Substantial funds for agricultural loans
 to single family units have been authorized.
 Heavy migration to the cities has resulted in substandard
 living conditions there. Numerous public housing projects are
 under construction. An extensive system of subsidies and
 controls keeps the prices for food staples, utilities, and
 :transportation reasonably low.
 The Government has made substantial efforts to improve the
 status of women in Iraq and to enhance their participation in
 the work force, both in terms of numbers and level of skill.
 The law guarantees women equal employment and educational
 opportunity, equal pay, and equal rights in property and
 business ownership. The shortage of male labor intensified by
 the war further has boosted the numbers of women in a wide
 range of occupations. In 1980, the Air Force College admitted
 its first group of female pilot trainees. A personal status
 law of February 1978 permits women to institute divorce
 proceedings-and outlaws coerced marriages. Many women,
 however, still adhere to traditional norms, due to social,
 cultural, and religious pressures.
