 ARGENTINA
 In the fourth year since its return to constitutional
 government, theArgentine people and their elected leaders
 continued to demonstrate in 1987 a strong commitment to
 democracy and-the rule of law. Argentina is governed by a
 Constitution with an elected president, bicameral legislature,
 and autonomous judiciary. In 1987 Argentina held its third
 successful national election in 4 years, following an extended
 campaign, free and open debate, dozens of rallies, and full
 press coverage. All elements of the ideological spectrum are
 represented in Argentine. politics.- Criticism of the Government
 and opposition to it are freely expressed. The military and
 police operate under civilian political control and the courts
 review charges of abuses. Respect for individual rights is
 strong.
 A political crisis occurred in 1987 concerning prosecution of
 military personnel for alleged-abuses committed during the
 1976 to 1983 period, of military rule. The Government's
 attempt to bring a definitive end to the prosecutions through
 the so-called "punto final" law of December 1986 brought
 hundreds of cases to the federal courts early in the-year.
 Following-anApril uprising by-a group-of military officers,
 Congress passed-a "due obedience" law, the practical effect of
 which was to protect from prosecution a-l but an.estimated 50
 retired, and perhaps one or.two active duty officers. Some
 human rights'activists and opposition leaders-criticized the
 law, but all. agree that it-was adopted in-full accord with
 constitutional requirements. Tensions over human rights
 trials lessened considerably in the latter half of the year.
 The inefficiency of the judicial system and conditions in
 Argentine prisons provoked some protests in 1987, but reforms
 currently before Congress and new construction are expected to
 ameliorate the problems. Political bombings increased in
 1987, but injuries and damage were minimal, and none were
 conclusively attributed to any institution. The Government
 received generally high marks from all observers on its
 respect for the basic'human rights of its citizens.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no credible reports of political killings by the
 Government in 1987. Some human rights organizations,
 political movements, and press representatives criticized
 police--particularly in Buenos Aires province--for the number
 of deaths resulting from armed confrontations with criminal
 suspects. The most widely publicized of these incidents
 occurred in the district of Ingeniero Budge, where three men
 were shot and killed by local police in May while allegedly
 resisting arrest. Critics claim police routinely shoot to
 kill. The police note that most of the disputed killings
 occur in dangerous zones of Buenos Aires where officers feel
 threatened.
 Apparent politically motivated bombings rose substantially in
 1987. Most were small explosions late at night, causing
 little damage or injuries. Targets covered the political
 spectrum, including the right, left, national parties,
 military, church, human riqhts groups, press, and judicial

 ARGENTINA
 officials. The incidents clstered around high profile
 events, such as the Pope's visit in early April, the Easter
 week military crisis and military trials debate, and the
 September 6 national elections. The perpetrators never
 claimed formal responsibility for the bombings, and there is
 no consensus on the possible identity of the persons or groups
 responsible. There have been few arrests.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known abductions, secret arrests, or
 disappearances linked to or condoned by the Government during
 1987. In at least one instance, that of the overnight
 abduction of a student member of the Argentine Communist Party
 in July and her subsequent abduction in November, critics
 charged that members of the security forces were acting as
 unauthorized vigilantes against political opponents. A number
 of kidnapings connected to criminal extortions occurred. Not
 all were reported to the authorities; some ended in release of
 the victim without identification of the perpetrators.
 The Undersecretariat of the Interior for Human Rights
 estimates that 39 minor children whose parents disappeared
 during military rule have been identified since 1984.
 Eighteen were returned to their families, 11 remain with
 adopted families, 6 cases are before the courts, and 4 were
 determined to have died. In 1987 the Government identified
 four children living in Paraguay as offspring of Argentine
 citizens who disappeared during military rule. The Government
 requested their return and recalled its Ambassador in August
 for 3 months to protest the official Paraguayan refusal to
 return the children and their purported parents. The
 Paraguayan courts have reopened the case for further
 consideration.
 In October-November, the Argentine Federal Police broke up a
 kidnap gang that operated in the late 1970's and early
 1980's. Six police officers were arrested for the kidnapings
 and murders of three Argentine businessmen. One later
 committed suicide in jail, and a seventh committed suicide to
 avoid arrest. Evidence so far suggests that the police
 officers operated purely for extortion, with no political
 overtones. The families of the victims and at least one
 prosecutor have suggested that members of an Argentine army
 intelligence unit were also involved.
 in August President Alfonsin signed a decree providing
 pensions to spouses and minor children of victims who
 disappeared between 1976 and 1983.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture   A 1985 criminal code
 reform provides penalties for torture similar to those for
 homicide. Argentina has ratified the U.N. Convention Against
 Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Ireatment or
 Punishment. In spite of the reforms and ratification, some
 human rights groups accuse police of continuing to mistreat
 prisoners. There are procedures for investigating claims of
 mistreatment administratively, through the Undersecietariat of
 Interior for Human Rights and through the Courts. Argentina's
 prisons are generally old, and the condl'tions provoked some
 prison protests, hunger strikes, and riots in 1987. Some
 prisoners and wardens were injured. The number of prison
 
 
 373
 ARGENTINA
 disturbances in 1987 was fewer than in the year before.
 Government officials say they are improving prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Argentina has a wpll-developed legal code containing express
 protections of individual rights and controls on police arrest
 and investigatory powers. Arrests require probable cause or a
 judicial order, and the law provides for a judicial
 determination of the legality of detention. However, the
 penal code gives the courts authority to detain individuals
 without notice or charges for up to 8 days during
 investigations. Even in the case of minor offenses, holding
 suspects without charges for several days is not uncommon.
 Forced or compulsory labor is forbidden by law and is not
 practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Argentina's judicial system is widely recognized as fair and
 independent, if frequently slow and cumbersome. The
 Constitution and penal code provide for trials before
 professional judges and appellate review of all judicial
 rulings, including those of military courts. Federal courts
 interpret constitutional protection against "arbitrary" trial
 process to permit wide-reaching review of criminal
 prosecutions.
 Inadequate resources and time-consuming procedures seriously
 impede the judicial system. In 1987 the Secretary of Justice
 submitted draft judicial reforms to the Congress which are
 designed to streamline the judicial system through more
 efficient legal procedures and professional personnel. Oral,
 as opposed to written, testimony would be permitted for the
 first time in criminal prosecutions.
 As in most civil law countries, trial by jury does not exist;
 verdicts are rendered by judges. The police have legal
 authority to judge misdemeanor cases, which are often settled
 by senior police officials. The legal system provides for
 public defenders, but in 1987 caseloads exceeded what these
 officials could handle. The right to bail is provided by law
 and observed in practice.
 Some human rights groups claimed there were 12 political
 prisonere incarcerated at the start of 1987. The Government
 asserts that the prisoners were convicted for violent crimes
 prior to the 1976 military coup, by constitutional courts
 whose verdicts could not be summarily overturned by the
 executive branch. Human rights groups believe the prisoners
 were convicted under proceedings lacking in minimum due
 process. The prisoners claim they confessed under torture or
 duress and were denied an adequate defense. Six of the
 prisoners were released in 1987 following judicial review of
 their-cases and ppplication of Argentina's 1984 law counting 1
 year in prison since 1976 as 2 years. Six remain in jail.
 The Inter-American Human Rights Commission has agreed to
 review the case of one of those who has since been released.
 Argentina's best known former guerrilla, Montonero leader
 Mario Firmenich, was convicted and sentenced to life
 imprisonment in May for murder and kidnaping. He has appealed
 the conviction.

 ARGENTINA
 Tension resulting from the prosecution of military personnel
 for human rights abuses committed during military rule erupted
 into political crisis in 1987. Following the December 1986
 "punto final" law imposing a 60-day deadline for initiating
 additional military prosecutions, as many as 400 cases were
 brought before the federal courts by March. In April an Army
 major refused to respond to a subpoena, and a Lieutenant
 Colonel gathered a group of supporters at the Campo de Mayo
 Army Base to demand redress on prosecutions and other issues.
 After several tense days, the officers returned to their
 bases. In May Congress passed legislation legitimizing the
 "due obedience" principle by which virtually all military
 personnel below the ranks of colonel or navy captain are
 presumed to have acted under orders between 1976 and 1983 and
 are not subject to prosecution. The Supreme Court upheld the
 constitutionality of the principle of "due obedience," thus
 effectively reducing the number of prosecutions to an
 estimated 50 retired and possibly one or two active duty
 officers. Some of the tension with the military dissipated
 after passage of this law. Isolated incidents occurred at
 individual bases in late 1987, but none approached the
 intensity of the April crisis.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is constitutional protection against unreasonable search
 and seizure. Few cases of arbitrary intrusion by the State
 into the private lives of persons were reported in 1987. A
 1985 bill providing criminal penalties for arbitrary
 interference with personal privacy, home, or correspondence
 remains pending in the Congress.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Argentina enjoys a free press. An active and independent
 press covers the political spectrum. Criticism of the
 Government is fully tolerated, and opposition viewpoints are
 freely expressed. Nevertheless, the State owns 40 percent of
 the radio stations and controls the franchises on others as
 well as the franchises for television stations it does not
 already own. Three of the four principal Buenos Aires
 television channels which are syndicated throughout the
 country are government owned. Some observers criticize both
 the government domination of the national newsprint industry
 and the "right of reply" law which exists in many provinces.
 Representatives of the Argentine press charged the Government
 with prior censorship in May when it sought and obtained a
 court order prohibiting publication of a paid advertisement
 defending a former military junta member convicted in 1985.
 An appellate court subsequently overturned the lower court's
 injunction, but the affected newspapers have appealed the case
 to the Supreme Court for a definitive ruling on the
 constitutional right to publish without injunction. These
 issues were fully debated in the national press. Critics did
 not accuse the Government of limiting or controlling debate,
 although some believe the Government's Secretariat for Public
 Information influences press coverage of certain political
 matters.
 At its 1987 Conference, the Inter-American Press Association
 (IAPA) was generally satisfied with'respect to the press in
 Argentina. IAPA was critical, however, of Argentina's "right
 
 
 375
 ARGENTINA
 of reply" laws, the injunction against a paid advertisement,.
 the law prohibiting newspapers f-rom owning broadcast stations,
 and the specific case of a provincial editor who was sued for
 refusing to reveal his news sources.
 Academic freedom is respected. Students and faculty complain
 about, and in some cases have engaged in strikes to protest,
 the limited government resources dedicated to public education.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All groups and political parties are free to organize and
 assemble. Argentine law requires political parties to support
 the Constitution and a democratic, representative, republican,
 and federal form of government in order to register for
 elections. At present, no party has been denied registration.
 During the 1987 election campaign, dozens of parties held mass
 rallies. The police receied some criticism for the manner in
 which they broke up a demonstration against the Pope's visit
 in April and the arrests of several members of the "Mothers of
 Plaza de Mayo" human rights organization for defacing a
 national monument in July. In neither instance were the
 police accused of trying to'stifle peaceful assembly.
 The labor movement is a major independent, economic, and
 political force. About one-third ofothe work force is
 unionized. Ptevib s military regimes suspended laws 1overning
 labor relations and systematically blocked many trade union
 rights. Aftev months of debate ih'1987, the Congress has'-
 passed legislation recasting the legal'cbdes to'restore free
 collective bargaining and the normal ground rules for
 industrial relations and trade bnion'actigities.
 Argentina's largest labor organization, the General
 Confederation of Workers (CGT), was active economically and
 politically in 1987; 'The CGT and maty-individual unions
 engaged-in consultations with-employdrs and the Government on
 issues affecting labor and the economy. Unions have the right
 to strike in Argentina, and many exercised that right in
 1987. The CGT led several geheral'-strikes of one day or
 less. The Confederation and-member binions-played an active'
 role in the September 1987 national election campaign.
 Argentine unions are active in the internatibhal trade union
 movement.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion,
 but also establishes Roman Catholicism as the state religion.
 The Government provides financial support to the Roman
 Catholic Church and the Constitution requires the president
 and vice president to be Roman Catholics. *Other religions
 must complete a pro forma registration with the Government to
 obtain legal recognition. Missionaries from any religion are
 permitted to enter Argentina and proselytize. The non-Catholic
 population is growing. Argentina's Jewish community (at an
 estimated 300,000, the largest such community in Latin America)
 practices its religion without officialrestraint.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 International and internal travel as well as emigration are
 unrestricted. Refugees are not forced to return to countries
 
 
 376
 ARGENTINA
 from which they have fled. In September the Government
 declared an amnesty for undocumented aliens residing in
 Argentina.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Argentina is a federal republic, governed by an elected
 president, bicameral legislature, and an independent
 judiciary. Since September 1983, Argentina has held three
 national elections to choose a president, vice president,
 provincial governors, all national deputies, provincial
 legislatures, mayors, and municipal councils. By all
 accounts, each election was free, fair, and democratic. The
 September 1987 national elections resulted in major gains for
 the principal opposition Justicialist Party and losses for the
 governing Radical Party.
 Twenty political parties--ranging from left to right--will be
 represented in the Congress as a result of the September
 election. Additional parties won election in individual
 provinces. From the powerful Justicialists to miniscule
 provincial movements, Argentina's opposition parties operate
 freely. Women and minorities have full political rights and
 are not excluded from political life.
 Women participate freely in Argentine politics. There were
 scores of women candidates in the three national elections
 since 1983. Effective December 1987, 13 women sit in the
 National Chamber of Deputies, a body of 254 members, and 3
 women sit in the 46-member National Senate.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International, the International Committee of the Red
 Cross, and a host of international human rights organizations
 enjoyed free access throughout Argentina. Eleven domestic
 human rights organizations operated openly in 1987, despite
 occasional bombings, death threats, and harassment from
 unidentified sources. During January and February, the
 organizations brought hundreds of charges to the federal
 courts related to disappearances during the years of military
 rule. Most of Argentina's human rights groups-actively
 opposed and openly lobbied the Government against passage of
 the "due obedience" law in May.
 Suspected Nazi war criminal Josef Franz Leo Schwamberger was
 arrested in November and is being held for possible
 extradition to the Federal Republic of Germany. Jewish
 organizations expressed satisfaction with the arrest and
 extradition but concern at the lengthy delay in locating and
 arresting the suspect.
 Argentina plays an active role in both the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission and the Organization of American
 States' Inter-American Human Rights Commission. The
 Government has ratified the American Convention on Human
 Rights (1984) and the U.N. Conventions on Torture, Civil and
 Political Rights, and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
 (all in 1986).

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language? 0or Social Status
 Argentine* women are active in government, the professions,
 politics, and private voluntaryor'qanizations. Although there
 is no official policy of discrimi-nation against them, women
 have to contend with some discrimination -that is rooted in
 cultural, economic, political, religious, and social
 structures. Legislation banning.-sex discrimination is.pending
 in the Congress.
 Argentina, adheres to the U.R. Convention for the Elimination
 of Discriminbtion AgainSt Women. In June the Congress'passed
 legislation recognizing divorce in -Argentina.
 About 20 percenb of Argentina's full professors and about 50
 percent of the assistant professors are women. One private
 university has a woman rector-- Almost 50 percent of the
 medical and law school graduates in 1987 were women.
 There is -a current of anti-Semitism in Argentine society and
 occasional anti-Semitic incidents occur. In the final months
 of 1987, Argentina's Jewishcommunity expressed concern at
 signs of increasing anti-Semitism.' They specifically cited
 anti-Semitic remarks during a public Mass in September,
 anonymous threats following the Schwamberger arrest in
 November, .and a' November synagogue bombing.. A draft bill
 providing crimirnal penalties for racial, religious, and other
 forms of discrimination is, pending in Congress.  - �
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Argentina 'offers comprehensive protection of workers' rights.
 The maximum workday is 8 hours; the maximum workweek-.is 48
 hours. Premiums must be paid for work beyond those limits.
 Children under 14 years of age may not work except in the
 family. Minors of ages 14 and 15 may work but not more than 6
 hours a day or 35 hours a week. The same-law-applies to minors
 16 to 18 years of age, although competent authority may allow
 an exception. Rules governing vacations, minimum wages, and
 occupational health and safety are comparable to those in
 other Western industrial nations, and are respected in
 practice.
