 GUINEA
 The People's Revolutionary Republic of Guinea is a one-party
 socialist state. Sekou Toure has been the nation's only
 President since Guinea's decision to break away from the
 French community and declare its independence in 1958. The
 party-state, under the direction of President Toure, remains
 the supreme authority. The government has always been
 concerned about its security. This attitude led to the
 arrest and imprisonment of many suspects, some of whom were
 condemned and, on occasion, executed.
 A general amnesty of all Guinean "exiles" was issued in July
 1977, and thousands of emigrants have been permitted to
 return to Guinea. The regime's fears for its survival were
 lessened in March 1978 with normalization of Guinea's
 relations with neighboring Senegal and Ivory Coast. The
 more relaxed climate is reflected in many aspects of Guinean
 political, economic, and social life. Internal security
 controls have been relaxed, and international movement of
 goods and people has been eased. The attempted assassination
 of President Toure on May 14, 1980 has not changed the
 situation.
 Sekou Toure's socialist philosophy and policies have
 emphasized ideological commitment rather than material
 rewards as an incentive for production. The opening up
 of the private market economy in 1977-78, however, has made
 available more food and consumer goods. More attention is
 being devoted to agriculture, and there are beginning signs
 of an improved standard of living.
 Government pronouncements emphasize the rights of the
 community over individual human rights, although the govern-
 ment in January 1978 ratified the International Covenant of
 Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The government regu-
 larly emphasizes the individual's duty to the revolution, to
 the party-state and to the nation. The government maintains
 broad police powers and pervasive security apparatus.
 While exact information is not available, the number of
 political prisoners has been sharply reduced over the past
 several years. Hundreds have been released since 1977,
 including some 10-20 (among whom were several former senior
 officials) freed in October 1980. The Amnesty International
 1980 Report alleges that 15 people were arrested on political
 charges in 1979, that 6 of them died in prison, and that
 others confessed under torture.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture, which is not prohibited by Guinean law, has
 occurred in the past. Amnesty International in its 1980
 report claims that 6 of 15 persons arrested in 1979 for
 plotting against the state are reported to have died in
 prison after having been deprived of food and water for
 several days. Amnesty International further claims that
 confessions reportedly were obtained by torture.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prison conditions in Guinea are generally very poor. Ill
 treatment and poor conditions in Guinean prisons are
 a recognized feature of the prison system, and in past
 years deaths in prison were not uncommon. The impression
 is-that conditions are most difficult for those held in
 solitary confinement. Prisoners not held in solitary
 confinement are supplied with food by family or friends.
 The Amnesty International Report 1980 expresses the fear
 that many prisoners have been killed in prison or died as a
 direct result of ill-treatment and poor conditions. It
 claims that 500 prisoners known by name have not reappeared
 and may have died in prison. The government of Guinea has
 not permitted any international agency to have access to
 detainees. There have been no reports of summary executions
 in 1980. There are no reports that treatment of prisoners
 differs according to type of conviction, social class, race,
 sex or religion. Prisoners released during the past few
 years have spoken of efforts to improve prison fare and
 fatten up prisoners before they are released. Police
 handling of suspects is frequently rough.
 c. Disappearances
 Arrests and detentions by security forces in Guinea are not
 publicized, but in past years the news of their occurrence
 seemed to have had no difficulty in finding its way through-
 out the community. No reports of prolonged or permanent
 disappearance have been received in 1980.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There is no legal prohibition against "preventive detention"
 and no provision for habeas corpus. Persons can be arrested
 and held without charge and without fixed terms.
 As noted above, tne Amnesty International Report 1980
 asserts that 15 political arrests occurred in August 1979.
 Following the attempted assassination of President Toure in
 May 1980, there were a number of arrests and detentions.
 However, they seem to have been handled as normal public
 security -- rather than political -- investigations.
 Amnesty International Report 1980 estimates that out of
 thousands arrested in 1971 and 1976, fewer than 20 long term
 political prisoners are still held in Guinea. Since May
 1977, several hundred prisoners have been released, includ-
 ing former senior government officials. In 1980 the govern-
 ment has continued to release prisoners including three
 former senior officials in November. The number of political
 prisoners appears to have been substantially reduced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Ordinary citizens have access to the courts, but most civil
 complaints are handled at the local administrative level
 before they reach the courts. This procedure corresponds
 to African tradition and provides considerable scope for
 testimony by plaintiffs, defendants and witnesses. Guinean
 courts are controlled by the party-government. In civil and
 criminal cases constitutional and statutory procedures
 exist, but do not seem to be consistently applied. Guinean
 law does not permit professional lawyers in private practice.
 
 
 111
 In some instances defendants have legal counsel; this seems
 to occur when defendants so request -- which is very rare --
 or when the government decides to appoint counsel, usually
 well-educated private citizens. Those charged with security
 or political offenses do not have benefit of counsel. They
 are required to make their own defense without being aware
 of the charges or evidence against them. No political
 trials are known, however, to have taken place in Guinea
 since 1976.
 f. Invasion of the Some
 Police may enter homes without warrants to pursue suspects
 or to obtain evidence. There are no reports of bugging,
 demolition or sealing doors or windows of homes.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Heath Care'and Education
 The government is committed to the provision of vital needs
 for food, shelter, health care, employment, and education.
 Inappropriate government policies and doctrinaire ideology
 contribute to a low economic growth (.4 percent in 1979)
 and difficulty in attaining these goals.
 In agriculture, the party-state has focused its limited
 resources more on collectivized production than on the small
 individual farmer who still produces all but a small
 percentage of total output.
 Property ownership is not a right of Guinean citizenship.
 Legal title to all land belongs to the state with families
 retaining customary land use rights. Reallocation of vacant
 land is the responsibility of elected neighborhood party
 committees. Most urban development has been characterized
 by spontaneous settlement and informal leasing arrangements
 outside government control.
 The 1977 market riots brought significant changes in economic
 life and in the psychological atmosphere within Guinea
 including the abolition of the economic police responsible
 for enforcing the government's pricing policy, the resumption
 and promotion of private market activity, and greatly
 increased availability of food and consumer goods.
 These measures have resulted in improved living standards.
 The rural population is largely self-sufficient in food-
 stuffs, and food supplies in urban areas have been adequate,
 with prices on the free market remarkably stable. In July
 the government announced salary increases averaging 20-25
 percent.
 Guinea's economic and commercial development -- and its
 population's overall quality of life -- are still very low.
 In 1979 the per capita gross domestic product was $292.
 Life expectancy averages 43 years and the infant mortality
 rate was 175 deaths per 1000 live births (1972). Corruption
 appears to be relatively petty, although it is an issue of
 growing concern to the government.
 
 
 112
 The Guinean government has devoted substantial resources
 (20 percent of total government expenditure) to educational
 facilities, which are free at all levels. The literacy rate
 has increased since independence from less than one percent
 to over 10 percent. Merit plays a large part in selecting
 candidates for technical training or advanced education
 abroad, but nepotism and favoritism exist. Education
 in rural areas is inferior, but courses in agronomy are
 now offered at over 30 centers in the countryside. The
 number of college students in Guinea has increased from
 virtually none at the time of independence to over 15,000 in
 recent years. Basic housing and health care are currently
 the subject of United Nations and bilateral development
 programs for Guinea. There'is approximately one physician
 per 17,509 people. The government is encouraging foreign
 firms to build housing in Conakry. Income disparities in
 Guinea are not, for the most part, large, and income tax
 rates are progressive.
 The Guinean government has made an effort to improve
 the position of women in society. Women are not legally
 discriminated against,-and, in general, Guinea's legal
 guarantees for women are matched by observance in practice.
 In spite of African tradition which tends to limit their
 role, women in Guinea are unusually active and strong in the
 economy and in the society. Even though lagging somewhat
 behind their proportionate numbers in educational enrollment
 and in employment, women are involved in education, medicine,
 ,and social work, are becoming more prominent in the police
 and military, and are influential in the nongovernmental and
 market sector of the economy. As noted above, the 1977 riot
 by market women forced one of the most fundamental changes
 in Guinean society in recent years.
 Women are found in key positions in several ministries,
 are usually included in Guinean delegations to international
 meetings, and are active in all organizations of the party-
 state.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speecn, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Guinean government does not tolerate dissent from its
 political and ideological tenets. Islam is officially
 supported and Christianity is tolerated. There appears to
 be a campaign against animistic practices but no persecution
 of any organized religious groups. Assembly is subject to
 police controls. All the media are government-controlled,
 and no opposition views are aired. The media from time to
 time criticize government offices for such abuses or
 corruption. Few publications are available and all are
 censored.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement, while traditionally a part of African
 custom, is not guaranteed oy Guinean law. Families and
 tribal groups are frequently spread across the state frontiers,
 and substantial movement has been permitted and observed
 in recent years. Internal movement remains, as it has been
 
 
 113
 for the past several years, substantially free. Documents
 are often required, but they are readily obtainable and do
 not present unreasonable difficulties for Guinean travelers
 within the country. Legal entry into and exit from the
 country remains subject to control, but enforcement has
 become notably relaxed, and Guineans appear to be able to
 move without great difficulty across borders with neighboring
 states. The return of former Guinean "exiles," mostly those
 who departed for economic reasons, continues at a relatively
 brisk pace since the general amnesty of all "exiles" announced
 in 1977. The official government attitude of encouragement
 to those intending repatriation does not apply to those
 considered as traitors or enemies of the state. Women and
 other groups are not subjected to different rules in matters
 of internal travel, emigration, or repatriation.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Guinean people are regularly exhorted by their leaders
 to participate in the political process and adhere to a
 continuing "revolution" which the single party-state conducts
 in their name under the authoritarian leadership of President
 Toure. There is little freedom to dissent or to avoid
 taking part in the regime-directed political activity which
 guides most aspects of national life. There are no opposition
 organizations existing openly. President Toure sees many
 petitioners and supplicants, and the government contends
 that the party-state structure, with its constant meetings
 down to the level of the local communities and popular
 referenda provide adequate reflection of the people's
 wishes.
 Labor unions do not constitute an independent force in
 Guinean society. They are controlled by the government,
 and their potential political role is entirely taken up by
 the party.
 The political role of women in Guinea matches the special
 influence and power which they enjoy in economic life.
 Traditionally providing President Sekou Toure one of the
 most numerous, articulate, and faithful political groups in
 his power base, women have also demonstrated -- as in the
 market riots described above -- that in some areas they have
 the will and the capability to bring about policy changes.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The government of Guinea continues to reject charges
 leveled by the International League for Human Rights and by
 Amnesty International regarding political prisoners and
 their treatment. There is no indication that the government
 has ever, on any occasion, officially provided any information
 concerning the status of political prisoners. Amnesty
 International Report 1980 states that President Toure made
 strong criticisms of international efforts for the protection
 of human rights and did not reply to Amnesty International's
 inquiries about the condition of detention at Boiro prison
 camp or about the number of political prisoners still held
 there.

 Guinea is a party to the 1978 International Convention on
 Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, and participated in
 the 1980 Organization of African Unity Conference on People's
 and Human Rights.
