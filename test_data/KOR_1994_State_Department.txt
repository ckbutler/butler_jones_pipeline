 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The Republic of Korea is governed by a directly elected president and a unicam-
 eral national assembly selected by both direct and proportional election. The ruling
 Democratic Liberal Party continued its efforts to reform the political system and the
 economy but still has not been able to eliminate some vestiges of its authoritarian
 past.
 Responsibility for maintaining internal security lies with the National Security
 Planning Agency (NSP), the Korean National Police (KNP), and the Defense Secu-
 rity Command (DSC). In July the National Assembly created an intelligence over-
 sight committee to serve as an independent watchdog on security agencies. Accord-
 '   to legislation passed in 1993, the NSP is restricted from interfering in domestic
 politis and has investigative authority only in cases involving terrorism, espionage,
 and international crime organizations. Although the 1993 legislation was intended
 to prevent human rights abuses by these security agencies, there continued to be
 some credible reports of such abuses.
 Korea has become a major industrial power and achieved rapid economic growth
 despite a lack of natural resources. After an economic slowdown in 1993, production
 rose in 1994 with an increase in the gross national product exceeding 8 percent.
 However, a number of problems remain, including high levels of rural migration to
 the cities, labor shortages, unbalanced regional development, an inefficient agricul-
 tural sector, and inadequate infrastructure.
 The Government took some steps to strengthen judicial independence and in-
 crease awareness of human rights by appointing new judges, prosecutors, and po-
 lice. However, it slowed the pace of reform in response to increased tensions with
 North Korea over the nuclear issue, a rise in violent student demonstrations, and
 labor unrest, and it shelvedplanned reform of labor laws. Korea's labor statutes and
 practice continued to fall short of international standards. There continued to be
 credible reports that the police deprived some suspects of access to counsel and sub-
 jected some suspects to verbal threats and sleep deprivation during interrogation.
 " There was also one onfirmed case in which authorities physically abused a suspect
 under interrogation. Women continued to face legal and societal discrimination and
 widespread physical abuse, and there is still no effective legal redress for these
 problems.
 The Government continued to subject released political prisoners to surveillance
 and required them to make regular reports to the police under the Social Surveil-
 lance Law. The Government has not addressed the issue of amnesty or redress in
 
 
 622
 
 some of the cases of prisoners who are serving long sentences on charges believed
 to have been fabricated by previous governments. Some of these prisoners were re-
 portedly subjected to torture to extract confessions and to trials that did not meet
 international standards of fairness. Although direct government control over the
 news media has virtually disappeared, the wide latitude provided judges in deter-
 mining the motive behind the production, sales, and distribution of "pro-North Ko-
 rean" or "pro-Communist" literature and the possibility of arrest under the National
 Security Law (NSL) have curtailed press freedom.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killings by the police or military. In August a bystander at a radical
 student rally was interrogated and assaulted by a group of demonstrators who sus-
 pected him of being a government informant. The man died shortly afterwards, and
 one of the students has been indicted in this case.
 b. Disappearance.-Ther were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Government has ordered investigating authorities to protect the human rights
 of suspects, and allegations of abuse by authoritieof f those in custody for question-
 ing continued to decline. Nonetheless, prosecutors continued to place much empha-
 sis on extracting confessions from suspects. In spite of government directives dis-
 couraging sleep deprivation as a technique for obtaining confessions, there contin-
 ued to be credible reports of police questioning suspects through the night, of sus-
 pects being denied the right to talk to a lawyer for several days ater arrest, and,
 in at least some instances,of physical abuse. The Government has confirmed that
 police physically abused murder suspects under interrogation in one particular case
 in Pusan. Also, dissidents Kim Sam Sok and his sister Kim Un Ju, who were ar-
 rested in September 1993 under the NSL, claimed that they had been abused while
 in detention. Both charged that the police had used sleep deprivation, verbal
 threats, and beatings to extract confessions from them. Kim Sam Sok also charged
 that he had been sexually abused by authorities while his sister cited threats of
 rape (see Section i.e.). An investigation of these allegations is ongoing, but evidence
 has not yet surfaced to substantiate their claims of sexual abuse.
 There were also reports of verbal abuse and threats during questioning. These re-
 ports were particularly frequent during the mass arrests of students following the
 upsurge of violent protests over the summer.
 The Government continued to investigate and consider cases in which former de-
 tainees argued that they deserved redress for torture suffered in the past. However,
 the Government has failed to provide an effective mechanism for redress, such as
 an independent body to investigate complaints of human rights violations. It re-
 mained relatively rare for officials accused of abuse or harassment of suspects to be
 prosecuted.
 Prison diets are adequate, but the prisons offer little protection against cold in
 winter and heat in the summer. Consequently, some prisoners claim that the condi-
 tions have damaged their health. There have been a few claims that prison guards
 have used excessive for or have needlessly put prisoners in manacles. Prisoner ac-
 cess to reading materials has improved signifcantly in recent years. There is little
 independent monitoring of prison conditions, although representatives of human
 rights groups may see certain prisoners if approved by the prison warden.
 d. Arbitu Arrest, Detention, or Exil-Korean law is vague with respect to de-
 tention and prosecutors have wide latitude to interpret the law. The NSL defines
 espionage in brad terms and permits the authorities to detain and arrest persons
 who commit acts viewed as supportive of North Korea and therefore dangerous to
 the Republic of Korea. Authorities arrested not only persons spying on behalf of
 North Korea but also those who exercised their freedom of speech to criticize the
 Government or to praise North Korea, its leader Kim II Sung, or Kim II Sunbes "self-
 reliance ("uchen) political philosophy. The United Nations Human Rights Commit-
 tee termed the NSL "a major obstacle to the full realization of the rights enshrined
 in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights." The Government ar-
 rested over 200 dissidents under the NSL during the year, more than twice as many
 as in 1993.
 Article 7 of the NSL permits the imprisonment for up to 7 years of anyone who
 "with the knowledge that he might endanger the existence or security of the State
 or the basic order of free democracy, praised, or encouraged, or propagandized for,
 or sided with the activities of an antistate organization. The legal stand  for
 knowing that one might endanger the existence of the State is vague. Consequently,
 
 
 623
 a number of Koreans have been arrested for what appears to be simply expressing
 leftwing views. In February the police arrested members of Heemangsae, a singing
 group whose song lyrics express support for "juche" philosophy under the NSL's
 provisions. In May the police arrested students in Kwan  who built an altar hon-
 oring Kim 11 Sung during a demonstration and charged them with violating the
 NSL The police also investigated university professors at Kyongsang University
 under the NSL because a textbook they had written several years ago used Marxist
 jaon and echoed some of the ideology of Kim Il Sung (see Section i.e.).
 The Government's rationale for keeping the NSL is that North Korea is actively
 trying to subvert the South Korean Government and society and that special cir-
 curnstances call for limiting some forms of expression to block the greater danger
 to freedom and democracy posed by totalitarianism. The effect is to relieve the Gov-
 ernment of the burden of proving in a court of law that any particular speech or
 action does, in fact, threaten the nation's security.
 The law requires warrants to be issued by judges in cases of arrest, detention,
 seizure, or search, except if the person is apprehended while committing a criminal
 act, or if a iudge is not available and the authorities believe that the suspect may
 destroy evidence or escape capture if not quickly arrested. In such emergency cases,
 judges must issue arrest warrants within 48 hours after apprehension, or, if a court
 is not located in the'same county, in 72 hours. Police may detain suspects who vol-
 untarily come in for questioning for up to 6 hours but must notify the suspects' fam-
 ilies. However, they do not always respect these legal requirements.
 Upon issuance of an arrest warrant, the security services normally must release
 suspects after 30 days unless an indictment is made. Hence, detainees are a rel-
 atively small percentage of the total prison population. Article 19 of the NSL gives
 judges the power to approve requests to extend the detention period an additional
 20 days making detention legal for up to 50 days. The Constitutional Court how-
 ever, ruiled that while the authorities may extend detention beyond the legal limit
 of 30 days for those suspected of "serious" violations, such as spying or organizing
 an antistate group, they may not do so in cases in which the suspects are charged
 only with praising North Korea or failing to report NSL violations.
 The Constitution specifically provides for the right to representation by an attor-
 ney. However, prosecutors prohibit attorneys from accompanying their clients dur-
 ing interrogation. The Government began to permit suspects during the investiga-
 tive phase to consult with "duty lawyers," a new system set up by a non gover-
 mental association of lawyers. However there were numerous complaints that ac-
 cess to a lawyer was restricted during this phase. There is a functioning system of
 bail, but human rights lawyers say that bail is generally not granted in cases in-
 volving serious offenses, and, even when the offense is relatively minor, bail often
 will not be granted unless the victim of the alleged crime agrees to the bail request.
 There were no cases in 1994 of political dissidents being exiled without due proc-
 ess.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The Constitution provides defendants a number
 of rights in criminal trials, including presumption of innocence, protection against
 self-incrimination, freedom from retroactive laws and double jeopardy, the right to
 a speedy trial, and the right of appeal. When a person is physically detained, the
 initial trial must be completed within 6 months of arrest. These rights are generally
 observed. Trials are open to the public, but the judge may restrict attendance if he
 believes spectators may seek to disrupt the proceedings.
 The President appoints the Chief Justice and most justices of the Constitutional
 Court. Although judges do not receive life appointments, in recent years the judici-
 ary has shown increasing independence, and that trend continued in 1994. Judges
 cannot be fired or transferred for political reasons. Judicial officials generally con-
 sidered committed to the independence and integrity of the judiciary were appointed
 to important positions i 1994.
 In  July Chief Justice Yacn Kwan nominated six new justices to the Supreme
 Court, including a lawyer previously active in the human rights movement. In a no-
 table instance of judicial indepndence, prosecutrs who sought to arrest Kyongsang
 University professors in September under the NSL for writing a Marxist textbook
 were thwarted by a judge who denied the warrants, arguing that prsecutors had
 not provide d evidence of the professors' pr-Communist activities. Similarly, in the
 case of Kim Sang Sok and Kim Un Ju, the Supreme Court limited the kind of evi-
 dence that could be deemed a "state secret." The Kims, who were convicted on
 charges of working with North Korean agents overseas, were cleared on appeal of
 passing a "state secret" (a South Korean newspaper), thus reducing their sentences
 by from 1 to 3 years.
 _Judges generally allow considerable scope for examination of witnesses by bth
 the prosecution and defense. Cases allegedly involving national security and crimi-
 
 
 nal cases are tried by the same courts. Although convictions are rarely overturned,
 appeals often result in reduced sentences. Death sentences are automatically ap-
 piaed. The Constitutional Court, which began operation in 1988, continued to grow
 mn its role of interpreting the Constitution.
 The courts continued to investigate allegations of past abuse of political dis-
 sidents. Human rights groups believe that many of these prisoners were sentenced
 to long prison terms on trumped up charges of spying for North Korea during the
 1970's and 1980's. Furthermore, they had been held incommunicado for up to 60
 days after their arrest, subjected to extreme forms of torture, forced to make acon-
 fessions," and convicted after trials that did not conform to international standards
 for a fair trial. Human rights groups allege that some of these political prisoners
 have been denied early parole because they refused to renounce real or alleged com-
 munist beliefs. Those political prisoners who have been released continue to be sub-
 jected to police surveillance and requirements to report their activities regularly to
 the police.
 Ii a celebrated case, the families of 65 prisoners sued the Government, arguing
 that these dissidents had been imprisoned arbitrarily by past regimes. Human
 rights groups claim that this case and others like it have received only perfunctory
 investigation and that those who received unfair trials in the past still languish in
 prison.
 It is difficult to estimate the number of political prisoners, i.e., those jailed for ex-
 ercising their political rights unaccompanied by violence, because it is not clear
 whether particular persons were arrested for merely exercising the right of free as-
 sociation or were detained for committing or planning acts of violence or espionage.
 Because of a wave of violent protests in 1994 over such issues as government trade
 policy and the attendant government clampdown on dissidents, the number of Kore-
 ans arrested for politically related crimes increased substantially. Some human
 rights monitors estimate that the number of political prisoners in Korea increased
 to more than 500 in 1994. However, their definition of political prisoner generally
 includes all persons imprisoned for acts that were politically motivated, without dis-
 tinction as to whether the acts themselves included violence or other criminal be-
 havior. The number of political prisoners and detainees as defined by international
 standards appears to number under 200.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In gen-
 eral, the Government honors the integrity of the home and family. In the past, the
 security services conducted varying degrees of surveillance, including wiretaps, of
 political dissidents. The Antiwiretap Law and the law to reform the NSP were de-
 signed to curb government surveillance of civilians, and appear largely to have suc-
 ceeded. The Antiwiretap Law lays out broad conditions under which the monitoring
 of telephone calls, mail, and other forms of communication are legal It requires gov-
 ernment officials to secure a judge's permission before placing wiretaps, or, in the
 event of an emergency, soon after placing them, and it provides for Jail terms for
 those who violate this law. Some human rights groups argue that a considerable
 amount of illegal wiretapping is still taking place and say the lack of an independ-
 ent body to investigate whether police have employed illegal wiretaps hinders the
 effectiveness of the antiwiretapping law.
 South Koreans are not allowed to listen to North Korean radio in their homes or
 read books published in North Korea if the Government determines that they are
 doing so for the purpose of helping North Korea. Student groups make plausible
 claims that government informants are posted around university campuses. Persons
 with backgrounds as political or labor activists may find it difficult to obtain some
 forms of employment or advance in such fields as government, broadcast media, and
 education.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While most political discourse is unrestricted,
 under the NSL the Government limits the expression of ideas that the Government
 considers Communist or pro-North Korean. The Government's definition is so broad
 that it often includes the nonviolent views of persons, which the Government op-
 poses. Although most radio and television stations are state supported, the stations
 maintain a large degree of editorial independence in their news coverage. The cen-
 sorship board, which screens movies for sexual or violent content before they are
 released, followed more liberal guidelines in 1994. Consequently, a broader range
 of films was released to the public.
 While the Government has abandoned direct control over the news media, it con-
 tinues to exercise considerable indirect influence on the media. Because many
 former journalists hope to become government officials, journalists and editors often
 practice self-censorship, avoiding or softening criticism of the Government in order
 
 
 625
 to advance their careers. Moreover, while the Government's anticorruption cam-
 paign curtailed government payments of money to reporters, it did not eliminate
 them.
 The libel laws sometimes allow the Government or other complainants to win
 judgments against publications for articles that are unflattering but not necessarily
 untrue. In March -Kim Hyon Chol, President Kim Young Sam's son, sued the
 Hangyoreh Sinmun newspaper after being the subject of an unflattering article.
 This case has not yet been adjudicated. In a celebrated case, some Ewha University
 students sued Newsweek magazine after it published an article describing many
 Ewha students as materialistic "slaves to money." The magazine was ordered to pay
 $25,000 to each of three Ewha undergraduates whose photographs were used to il-
 lustrate the story.
 Prosecutors continued to indict dissidents under the NSL for producing, selling,
 or distributing pro-North Korean or pro-Communist materials. Court precedents
 allow Koreans to possess these kinds of publications for purely academic use, profit,
 or curiosity, but not with the intent of subverting the State. Prosecutors sometimes
 abuse the discretion allowed them in determining motives for possessing or publish-
 ing such material. In 1994 it led to a number of arrests of publishers and writers.
 In one such case, polie arrested Park Clhi Kwan, Chief Editor of 11-Tee publishing,
 for possessing and pulishing a novel about laborers in steel mills originally pub-
 lished in North Korea. In September plie asked prosecutirs to seek an indictment
 of Cho Chung Rae, author of 'Taebek Mountain, a novel published several years
 ago that depicts Communist partisans in South Korea in the 1940's in a sympathetic
 'Me Government continued to allow, within its guidelines, an increase in media
 coverage of North Korea. South Korean television networks continued to broadcast
 edited versions of North Korean television programs. The media extensively re-
 ported on U.S. and South Korean talks with North Korean officials, sending report-
 ers to cover U.S.-North Korean talks in New York and Geneva.
 In July the authorities began investigating eigit Kyongsang University professors
 whose textbook on Korean society was deemed by prosecutors to endorse North Ko-
 rean ideology. This investigation caused an outcry in the scholarly community as
 being a serious infringement of academic freedom. Prosecutors who sought to arrest
 several of the professors under the NSL were denied warrants by a judge who ar-
 gued that the prosecutors had not provided evidence of the professors pro-Com-
 munist activities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Law on Assembly and
 Demonstrations prohibits assemblies considered likely to undermine public order. It
 forbids outside interference in peaceful assemblies approved by the authorities. The
 law requires that the police be notified in advance of demonstrations of all types,
 including political rallies. Police must notify organizers if they consider the event
 impermissible under this law. Associations, except those whose aim is deemed by
 the Government to be the overthrow of the State, operate freely.
 In general, police showed restraint and discipline in the face of severe provocation
 during violent demonstrations in 1994. During the first part of the year authorities
 issued demonstration permits with few restrictions. However, because of an upsurge
 in violent protests, which increased more than fourfold in the first quarter of 1994,
 authorities became more restrictive. Such universities as Konguk and Sogang for-
 bade rallies on campus. In the past, Korean universities traditionally had been a
 safe haven for virtually all forms of political protest. Unlike in 1993, the Govern-
 ment did not support the "South-North Human Chain for Peace and Reunification"
 organized by the National Council of Churches in Korea (KNCC) and authorities
 limited the scope of the human chain rallies. The Government also blocked other
 Liberation Day demonstrations organized by student groups and by a dissident coa-
 lition representing "Pomminnyon (Pannational Alliance for Unification), arguing
 that the rallies would lead to violence.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this provision in practice.
 d. Freedom ofMovement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-For most citizens, there is universal freedom of movement within the
 country. However, police may restrict the movements of some political prisoners who
 were released from prison. Foreign travel is generally unrestricted, but travel to
 North Korea is allowed only with government approval. One of the conditions is that
 the trip must not have a political purpose--that is to praise North Korea or criticize
 the South Korean Government. Travelers to North Korea who do not meet this cri-
 terion are likely to be punished upon their return to South Korea. For example, au-
 thorities revoked the publishing license of Park Bo Hi, President of a newspaper in
 Seoul, after he made an unauthorized trip to North Korea. Police also arrested
 
 
 626
 Pomminnyon leaders Reverend Kane Hee Nam and Ahn Hee Chan who planned to
 enter North Korea through Panmuiomto attend Kim II Sung's funeral.
 Between August 1989 and August 1992, 539 South Koreans in 18 different groups
 visited North Korea, and another 2,247 contacted North Koreans with government
 approval. In 1994, however, the two sides had few exchanges because of renewed
 tensions caused by North Korea's refusal to allow complete International Atomic En-
 erg Agency inspections of its nuclear facilities.
 the past, the Government has forbidden some Koreans convicted of politically
 related crimes from returning to Korea. In September the NSP lifted the entry ban
 on composer Yun I Sang, a  isident who has been living in Berlin for a number
 of years. However, the Government required that he refrain from any political activ-
 ity while in Korea and that he give an accounting of his political activities overseas
 before authorities would allow him into the country. (Yus refused these conditions
 and decided against returning to South Korea.)
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees and other humanitaian organizations in assisting refugees, and there
 were no reports of forced expulsions of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Korean people have the right to elect their own government. The Constitu-
 tion, as amended in 1987, provides for the direct election of the President and for
 a mixed system of direct and proportional election of legislators to the unicameral
 National Assembly. The President serves a single 5-year term and may not be re-
 elected. The National Assembly's term is 4 years.
 There is universal suffrage for all citizens aged 20 or above, and elections are held
 by secret ballot. Kim Young Sam, who took office in February 1992, is Korea's first
 civilian chief executive in nearly 30 years.
 Because of cultural traditions and discrimination, women occupy few important
 positions in government. In past governments, the only woman in the Cabinet had
 been the second minister for political affairs, whose portfolio was Women's Affairs.
 Currently there are two women in the Cabinet, holding portfolios of Women's Affairs
 and Education. In addition, a woman was appointed mayor of Kwangmyong City,
 and a female legislator was appointed to chair one of the special committees of the
 National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several nongovernmental private organizations are active in promoting human
 rights, and they operate without government restriction. Chief among these groups
 are the Lawyers for a Democratic Society, Sarangbang, the Human Rights Commit-
 tee of the National Council of Churches in Korea, the Korean Bar Association, and
 "Minghyup,' an association of the families of poitical prisoners. These groups pub-
 lish reports on the human rights situation in Korea and make their views known
 both inside and outside the country. Government and ruling party officials generally
 have been willing to meet with international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-A conservative Confucian tradition has left women subordinate to men
 socially, economically, and legally. In some companies women are expected to resign
 upon marriage or no later than the birth of their first child. There has been some
 limited and gradual change in social mores and attitudes affecting women; for exam-
 ple women have full access to education, and a few have become government offi-
 cias and hold elected office.
 The Government has not effectively enforced equal employment opportunity legis-
 lation dating to 1988. As a result there are very few women who work as company
 executives or leading officials in government. While women account for just over 40
 percent of the economically active population, the average female worker's wage re-
 mained a little over half of that of the average male worker.
 The traditional preference for male children continues in Korea today, although
 it is less pronounced among people in their twenties and thirties. Korean law bans
 sex testing and abortions except when the woman's life is in danger, a hereditary
 disease would be passed along, or in case of rape or incest. However, fetal sex test-
 ing and abortion of female fetuses remain common, and it is estimated that when
 today's children reach marrying age there will be 400,000 "surplus bachelors.'
 Violence against women remains pervasive, and the law does not provide ade-
 quate protection. Spouse abuse is common, and some women's rights groups main-
 tain that it has worsened in the past few years. The Amended Family Law, which
 
 
 627
 went into effect in 1991, permits women to head a household, recognizes a wife's
 right to a portion of the couple's proprty, and allows a woman to maintain greater
 contact with her offspring after a ivorce. Although the revisions helped abused
 women, divorce still remains a social taboo, and there is little government or private
 assistance for divorced women. These factors, plus the fact that divorced women
 have limited employment opportunities and have difficulty remarrying, lead some
 women to stay in abusive situations. The Government has created some shelters for
 battered women and increased the number of child care facilities, which gives
 women in abusive situations more options, but women's rights groups say they fall
 far short of effectively dealing with the problem.
 Korea has an extremely high rate of reported rapes. A 1992 report by the Na-
 tional Police Agency estimated that 9.8 women per 1,000 are raped in South Korea.
 Since that time, the number of reported cases may well have risen. The activities
 of a number of women's groups in Korea have increased awareness of the impor-
 tance of reporting and prosecuting rapes as well as less serious offenses such as sex-
 ual harassment in the workplace. In a precedent-setting case this spring, a female
 researcher at Seoul National University who alleged sexual harassment by a profes-
 sor was awarded approximately $40,000 in damages. The award received wige and
 favorable media coverage, but such cases remain the exception to the rule. Accord-
 ing to women's rights groups, cases involving sexual harassment or rape generally
 go unprosecuted, and perpetrators, if convicted often receive very lenient sentences.
 Children.--Children s human rights and welfare have not been prominent social
 policy issues. The Government continued to devote an increasing share of the overall
 budget to social expenditures, which includes those related to the welfare of chil-
 dren.
 Child abuse has not been studied extensively, and statistics on such abuse are
 limited. Reported cases of child abuse have generally numbered less than 50 in re-
 cent years. Although experts believe that a number of cases go unreported, in-
 stances of child abuse still appear to be relatively rare. According to official statis-
 tics, the number of runaway children each year has dropped from about 7,000 in
 the past to approximately 1,000. The Seoul metropolitan government runs a chil-
 dren s counseling center, which investigates reports of abuse, counsels families, and
 cares for runaway children. In the absence of a specific law against child abuse,
 however, it is difficult to prosecute and punish child abusers unless they commit a
 crime punishable under a separate law.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Republic of Korea is a racially homo-
 geneous country with no ethnic minorities of significant size. Nonetheless, regional
 rivalries exist. Persons from the southwestern region (North and South Cholla prov-
 inces) have traditionally faced discrimination. Many Koreans believe that successive
 governments led by figures from the southeastern region (North and South
 ang provines) have deliberately neglected the eonomic development of the
 Cholla provinces for political reasons. President Kim attempted to alleviate long-
 standing regional grievances, such as the violent suppression of the May 1980
 Kwangju uprising, through mre evenhanded government spending and appoint-
 ments. Centuries of isolation and a history of foreign invasion and occupation engen-
 dered a tradition of xenophobia in Korea.
 Citizenship in Korea is based on blood, not location of birth, and Koreans must
 show as proof their family genealogy. Thus, Korean-brn Chinese residents cannot
 obtain Korean citizenship or become public servants and are unlikely to be hired
 by major corporations. Due to legal as well as societal discrimination, many Chinese
 residents in-Korea have emigrated to other countries since the 1970's. Amerasian
 children are usually able to obtain Korean citizenship, and no legal discrimination
 against them exists. Informal discrimination, however, is prevalent and makes it
 more difficult for Amerasians to succeed in academia, business, or government.
 People With Disabilities.-Community and social organizations have begun to con-
 sider the rights and treatment of people with physical and mental disabilities. Al-
 though there are public displays of concern for the disabled, such as the Special
 Olympics and television documentaries, public facilities for their everyday care and
 use remained inadequate, and their general treatment by sciet   scrimiatory.
 The Government lacked adequate educational programs and schools for severely dis-
 abled people. The Government did not discriminate officially against the disabled
 who were capable of attending regular schools, but societal pressures and cultural
 biases have a negative impact on that access. The Government has introduced
 guidelines encouraging businesses to reserve a portion of jobs for the diabled. Be-
 ginning in 1995, new public buildings will be required to include facilities for the
 handicapped such as a ramp access to entrances, a wheelchair lift, and parking
 spaces for the disabled.
 
 
 628
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution gives workers, with the exception
 of public service employees and teachers, the right to free association. There are
 some blue-collar public sector unions in railroad, telecommunications, the postal
 service, and the national medical center. The Trade Union Law specifies that only
 one union is permitted at each place of work and that all unions are required to
 notify the authorities when formed or dissolved. About 16.4 percent of all Korean
 workers are members of a union.
 In the past, the Government did not formally recognize labor federations which
 were not part of or affiliated with the country's two legally recognized labor
 upi      e Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) and the independent
 KoreanMFederation of Clerical and Financial Workers. In the past several years,
 however, the Labor Ministry officially recognized some independent white-collar fed-
 erations representing hospital workers, journalists, and office workers at construc-
 tion firms and government research institutes. Korean courts ruled in 1992 that af-
 filiation to the FKTU is not required in order to be registered as a legal labor fed-
 eration. In practice, labor federations not formally recognized by the Labor Ministry
 existed and worked without government interference, unless authorities considered
 their involvement in labor disputes disruptive.
 The Government, however, did arrest unionists it viewed as acting as third par-
 ties in instigating or prolonging labor disputes. The number of workers arrestedfor
 labor-related activities increased to over 60, compared with 11 in 1993. About 30
 workers were still in jail as of year's end. During the summer, for example, authori-
 ties arrested more than 20 members of Chongihyup, an unregistered union of rail-
 way engineers, for leading an illegal railroad strike in June that paralyzed the
 transportation network for several days. Other unionists whom authorities alleged
 had entered the labor movement to foment social unrest were also arrested. In P-
 tember police detained five members of the Songnam area workers' association and
 charged them under the NSL with trying to indoctrinate workers with Kim I1 Sung's
 "juche" ideology.
 The Government continued the ban on labor union activities by public and private
 schoolteachers, arguing that the teachers' union (Chonkyojo) is an essentially politi-
 cal organization with radical aims. The Government continued its program of rein-
 stating some of the 1,500 fired teachers if they resigned from Chonkyojo.
 No minimum number of members are required to form a union, and unions may
 be formed without a vote of the fall prospective membership. Election and labor
 laws forbid unions from donating money to political parties or participating in elec-
 tion campaigns. However, trade unionists have circumvented the ban by temporarily
 resigning their union posts and running for office on the ticket of a political party
 or as an independent.
 Strikes are prohibited in government agencies, state-run enterprises, and defense
 industries. By law, enterprises determined to be of "public interest," including public
 transportation, utilities, public health, banking, broadcasting, and communications
 must submit to government-ordered arbitration in lieu of striking. The Labor Dis-
 pute Adjustment Act requires unions to notify the Labor Ministry of their intention
 to strike, and it mandates a lO-da "cooling-off period" before a strike may legally
 begin. (This period is 15  in pu lic interest sectors.) Labor laws prohibit retribu-
 tion against workers who have conducted a legal strike and allow workers to file
 complaints of unfair labor practices against employers.
 The FKTU is affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU). Most of the FKTU's 20 constituent federations maintain affiliations with
 international trade secretariats, as do KCILF white-collar federations and the KTUC
 Metalworkers Council. In response to freedom of association complaints lodged by
 Korean dissident and independent unions, the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Association again issued a report in 1994 which rec-
 ommended that the Government bring Korean labor law and policy up to inter-
 national worker rights standards in accordance with the principle of free associa-
 tion.
 The Government under President Kim continued to cultivate a mere neutral
 stance in labor disputes. For example the Government refused to intervene in the
 strike at Hyundai Heavy Industries (IM), the first time since 1987 that a strike
 at HHI did not lead to state intervention. Police intervention in labor disputes was
 relatively rare. During the summer however, the Government deployed police to ar-
 rest workers conducting sitdown demonstrations connected with the railroad and
 subway strikes. Riot police also dispersed striking workers who had occupied build-
 ings at Kumho and Daewoo factories.
 There were no reports of employer-hired squads assaulting workers in 1994.

 Since July 1991, South Korea has been suspended from the US. Overseas Private
 Investment Corporation (OPIC) insurance programs because of the Government's in-
 fringements on hedm of association and other worker i hts.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution and the
 Trade Union Law provide for the right of workers to collective bargaining and collec-
 tive action. This law also empowers workers to file complaints of unfair labor prac-
 tices against employers who interfere with union organizing or practice discrimina-
 tion against unionists. Employers found guilty of unfair practices can be required
 to reinstate workers who were fired for union activities.
 Extensive collective bargaining is practiced, even with unions that are not legally
 recognized by the Government. Korea's labor laws do not extend the right to orga-
 nize and bargain collectively to government employees, including employees of state
 or public-run enterprises, defense industries, and public and private schoolteachers.
 Workers in KorEa's two export processing zones (EPZ's), designated by the Gov-
 ernent as public interest enterprises, whose rights to organize were formally re-
 stricted, have now been given all the rights enjoyed by workers in other sectors of
 the economy.
 Korea has no independent system of labor courts. The central and local labor com-
 missions form a semiautnomous agency of the Labor Ministry that adjudicates dis-
 putes in accordance with the Labor Dispute Adjustment Law. Each labor commis-
 sion is composed of equal representation from labor (rEpresented by the FKTU),
 management, and "he public interest. Local labor commissions are empowered to
 decide on remedial measures in cases involving unfair labor practices and to medi-
 ate and, in some situations, arbitrate labor disputes. Arbitration is compulsory in
 sectors of the economy (e.g., utilities and transportation) that are deemed essential
 to public welfare.
 The Trade Union Law and Labor Dispute Adjustment Law forbid third-party
 intervention in union and labor disputes by federations not recognized by the Gov-
 ernment (such as Chonnohyup and KCIIF), but they allow recognized labor federa-
 tions, principally the FKTU, its affiliates, and some independent white-collar federa-
 tions, to assist member unions. The ban on third-party intervention also exempts
 mediation efforts by lawyers, experts, and others who have the consent of both labor
 and management, a policy much criticized by non-FKTU labor leaders.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution provides that no
 person shall be punished, placed under preventive restrictions, or subjected to invol-
 untary labor, except as provided by law and through lawful procedures. Forced or
 compulsory labor is not condoned by the Government and is generally not practiced.
 There were reports, however, of ilegal foreign workers who were not paid back
 wages by their employers but who continued to work for their employers or who
 lacked the funds to return to their home countries.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Standards Law pro-
 hibits the employment of persons under the age of 13 without a special employment
 certificate from the Labor Ministry. Because there is compulsory education until the
 age of 13, few special employment certificates are issued for full-time employment.
 Some children are allowed to do part-time jobs such as selling newspapers. In order
 to gain emplo yment children under 18 must have written approval from their par-
 ents or guardlians. Employers may require minors to work only a limited number
 of overtime hours and are prohibited from employing them at night without special
 permission from the LaborMinistry. Child labor laws and regulations are clear and
 usually enforced when violations are found, but the Government employs too few
 inspectors to carry out regular inspections.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-The Government implemented a minimum
 wage law in 1988. The minimum wage level is reviewed annually. As of September,
 1994, the minimum wage was raised to $12.00 (9,360 Won) per day. Companies with
 fewer than 10 employees are exempt from this law. Due toKorea s tight labor mar-
 ket, however, most firms pay wages well above the minimum in order to attract and
 retain workers. The FKTU and other unions continue to claim that the current min-
 imum wage does not meet the minimum requirements of urban workers. In fact, a
 worker earning the minimum wage would have some difficulty in providing a decent
 standard of living for himself and his family, despite the fringe benefits such as
 transportation expenses with which Korean companies normally supplement sala-
 ries. (The Government notes that the money an average Korean blue-collar worker
 takes home in overtime and bonuses significantly raises the total compensation
 package.) According to the Ministry of Health and Social affairs, 5.2 percent of the
 ppulation lived beIow the poverty level in 1992.
 Employers continue to discriminate against foreign workers, most of whom come
 from China, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan to work, often ille-
 gally. The Government has sought to alleviate the problem of illegal workers by ini-
 
 
 630
 tiating a pilot program whereby 20,000 foreign workers are allowed to enter Korea
 legally to work at established wages and with legal safeguards. Illegal foreign work-
 ers, however, who probably number more than 60,000, still suffer s inificant hard-
 ships at the workplace, and employers often provide them substandard living accom-
 modations. It is difficult for illegal workers to seek relief for loss of pay or unsatis-
 factory living and working conditions because they are always under the threat of
 being deported.
 Amendments to the Labor Standards Law passed in 1989 brought the maximum
 regular workweek down to 44 hours, with provision for overtime to be compensated
 at a higher wage, and also provide for a 24-hour rest period each week. However,
 labor groups claim that the Government does not adequately enforce these laws, es-
 pecialy with regard to small companies.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, but South Korea suffers from
 unusually high accident rates. The accident rate continues to decline gradually, due
 to public and union pressure for better working conditions. However, the number
 of deaths resulting from work-related accidents remains very highby international
 standards. The Labor Ministry has improved enforcement of safety standards but
 still lacks enough inspectors to enforce the laws fully. The Industrial Safety and
 Health Law does not guarantee security for workers who remove themselves from
 dangerous work environments.
