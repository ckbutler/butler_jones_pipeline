 BENIN
 In 1991 the Republic of Benin peacefully achieved the agenda
 established at the 1990 National Reform Conference to transform
 the country from a single-party, military-dominated regime to a
 multiparty democracy. Thirteen presidential candidates
 competed in the first round of presidential elections in
 March. In the presidential run-off, Prime Minister Nicephore
 Soglo, who had headed the transitional government, defeated
 decisively President Mathieu Kerekou, Benin's ruler during its
 17 years of Marxist-Leninist rule. Official observers from
 several countries found the elections free and fair. Of the 24
 political parties founded after the 1990 National Reform
 Conference, 16 ran candidates in the February legislative
 elections. No single party won a majority of the 64 seats, and
 21 parties, either alone or in alliance, are represented in the
 new National Assembly. Since its convening in July, the
 National Assembly has asserted its constitutional role as a
 check on the executive branch.
 Benin's armed forces of approximately 8,000 personnel are under
 the direction of a civilian Minister of Defense, while the
 1,500-man police force is under the Minister of the Interior.
 The once-dominant Beninese military continued to maintain a low
 profile in 1991, but their commitment to democratic changes is
 a general source of concern. The new Constitution provides for
 members of the Beninese military, as well as civilian
 officials, to disobey the orders of superiors if obedience
 would result in a serious violation of human rights. The new
 Government's goal is to keep the armed forces professional and
 depoliticized, and Cabinet members are now all civilians.
 Benin's underdeveloped economy is largely based on subsistence
 agriculture, cotton production, regional trade, and small-scale
 offshore oil production.. In accordance with World Bank and
 International Monetary Fund agreements, Benin has undertaken an
 austerity program for the purpose, inter alia, of privatizing
 many state-owned enterprises, reducing fiscal expenditures, and
 deregulating trade. Benin achieved an unexpected 3-percent
 growth rate in 1991. Nevertheless, it must still deal with a
 bloated and inefficient bureaucracy, high debt-servicing
 charges, and widespread unemployment, if development
 expectations are to be met.
 The human rights situation in Benin continued to improve
 throughout 1991. The transitional government and the newly
 elected Government respected the fundamental human rights
 provided for in the Constitution of December 1990. The new
 Constitution includes important safeguards prohibiting
 arbitrary detention and making torture a criminal offense; no
 political detainees or prisoners were held during the year.
 Several well-known officials from the previous regime were
 arrested on charges of corruption. The head of the
 now-disbanded Presidential Guard was also arrested on charges
 brought against him by a Guinean who was held without trial
 from 1982 to 1989. At year's end, none of those arrested had
 been tried.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial
 killings. However, there were isolated instances of violence
 and at least one death in the northern region in connection
 with the elections during a confrontation between supporters of
 different candidates. In late 1991, the- trial of those
 arrested and charged with this violence was in process
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and, Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The 1990 Constitution forbids torture and cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment. With public attention focused on past
 incidents and on bringing to justice those who committed acts
 of torture under the old regime, there were no reports of
 torture in 1991. Citing the need for legally admissible
 evidence, the Government has moved slowly in investigating
 persons, primarily members of the military, widely believed to
 have committed acts of torture. Moreover, for reasons that
 appear to arise from individual considerations rather than from
 fear of military reprisal, those tortured by the previous
 regime, mainly from the Communist Party of Dahomey, have not
 instituted legal cases. This makes it difficult to bring to
 justice those accused of torture.
 Prison conditions in Benin remained harsh and characterized by
 extensive overcrowding and lack of sanitation and medical
 facilities. The prison diet is-grossly inadequate, and
 malnutrition and disease are common among prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 With the release of remaining political prisoners in 1990,
 arbitrary arrest and detention ceased to be practiced by the
 central Government. Procedural safeguards against arbitrary
 arrest include a constitutional provision forbidding detention
 of more than 48 hours without a hearing before a magistrate,
 whose order is required for continued detention. There were no
 reports that th-is provision was violated, nor were there
 reports of incommunicado detention.
 The 1990 Constitution contains a provision prohibiting the
 Government from exiling any Beninese citizen, and exiles have
 returned to Benin in large numbers since the change in
 government and a presidential amnesty decree of 199G.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Benin's legal system is based on French civil law and on local
 customary law. A civilian court system operates on the
 national and provincial levels. Military disciplinary councils
 deal with minor offenses by military members but have no
 jurisdiction over civilians. The judges in the civil courts
 are career magistrates, appointed by the President. Judges are
 administratively under the Ministry of Justice. However, under
 
 
 12
 BENIN
 the Constitution, officials are answerable only to the law in
 the carrying out of their duties and may not be removed.
 Serious crimes are first presented to a magistrate who conducts
 an investigation and decides whether there is sufficient
 evidence to warrant a trial. Defendants have the right to be
 present at their trial and to be represented by an attorney, at
 public expense, if necessary.
 Under the new Constitution, the highest courts are the
 Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court, the court of last
 resort in all administrative and judicial matters. The role of
 the Constitutional Court, which has yet to be actually formed,
 is to pass on the constitutionality of Beninese laws, and thus
 to act as the main judicial counterweight to the legislative
 and executive branches of government. Until the Constitutional
 Court is seated, its-functions are assumed by the High Council
 of the Republic, a transitional body created under the National
 Reform Conference. The Constitutional Court has a mandate to
 determine the constitutionality of laws which may violate
 fundamental human rights The Constitution also provides for a
 High Court of Justice--which remained unformed in 1991--to
 preside over cases of crimes committed against the nation by
 the President or members of the Government. A number of
 judicial codes, including the penal code, were under
 consideration before the Law Committee of the National Assembly
 at year's end. Interim legislation abrogated certain
 unacceptable provisions, including those permitting "People's
 judges."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of private
 property and of the home. Police are required to obtain a
 judicial warrant before entering a private home. No violations
 of this requirement were reported in 1991. There were also no
 reports of governmental interference with private
 correspondence in 1991.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression and of the
 press and other media. These rights were respected in 1991.
 Beninese freely discussed politics in public and private forums.
 The Government continued to own and operate the most
 influential media, the local radio and television stations and
 one daily newspaper, but in contrast to the past, official
 journalists extended their coverage of sensitive matters and
 criticized the Government. When government officials
 criticized the official media's coverage of politics in a
 neighboring country, the journalists' union protested
 vigorously, a fact in turn duly reported in the official
 press. Some 20 independent private newspapers, representing a
 variety of viewpoints, circulated in Benin in 1991. The press
 and television aired widely diverging views on the
 constitutional referendum and reported on all political
 parties, including the Communist Party of Dahomey, which had
 been banned under the previous regime.
 There was no censorship of foreign books or artistic works.
 Foreign periodicals were widely available on newsstands, and
 
 
 BENIN
 much of the population listens to foreign broadcasts on
 shortwave radio.
 In general, academic freedom is enjoyed in schools and in the
 sole university. University professors are permitted to
 lecture freely in their subject areas, conduct research, draw
 independent conclusions, and form unions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly-and Association
 The Constitution recognizes the rights of peaceful assembly and
 association. These rights were respected in 1991. Multiple
 political parties exist, as do numerous religious and cultural
 organizations. Only political parties wishing to participate
 in elections need register with the Government. In April
 polic& dispersed and briefly detained some protesters who were
 demonstrating against the decision of the then President
 Mathieu Kerekou to run for reelection. The demonstrators had
 declined to seek a permit before undertaking to parade in
 central Cotonou. Once the detainees were brought before a
 magistrate, charges were dropped.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Christianity, Islam, and traditional religions coexist in
 Benin, and adherence to a particular faith does not confer any
 special status or benefit. Religious ceremonies and shrines of
 all faiths are protected by law. There are no restrictions on
 religious ceremonies, teachings, foreign clergy, or conversion
 to any religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic movement is unrestricted. The Government earlier
 dismantled police and gendarmerie roadblocks within the country
 to facilitate free movement, although a number of checkpoints
 remained. Police checkpoints had reappeared by the end of the
 year, however. Passports and exit permits needed for travel
 outside of West African countries are not difficult to obtain.
 Emigration is common. Beninese live and work in neighboring
 countries without jeopardizing their citizenship.
 Benin welcomes refugees and helps to integrate them into
 Beninese society if they choose not to return to their country
 of origin. Refugees who marry Beninese are entitled to
 citizenship. Benin's longstanding refugee population from Chad
 declined from 600 in 1-990 to a few dozen in 1991, reflecting
 continued voluntary repatriation. At the end of 1991, a
 political crisis in Togo temporarily brought Togolese refugees
 to Benin, an estimated 15,000 at its peak. The United Nations
 Development Program has handled refugee matters in Benin since
 the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 closed in 1990.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 During 17 years of authoritarian, single-party rule, the
 Beninese were unable to change their government. The 1990
 National Reform Conference and the subsequent transitional
 government laid the groundwork for the creation of a multiparty
 democracy in which citizens in 1991 peacefully changed their
 government.in accordance with the new Constitution of December
 1990. Legislative and presidential elections were held in
 February and March respectively. In the presidential
 
 
 14
 BENIN
 elections, 13 candidates participated; none achieved an
 absolute majority. President Kerekou, who had brought
 authoritarian rule to Benin, and then Prime Minister Soglo, who
 had been appointed by the National Reform Conference, contested
 a run-off election. Nicephore Soglo won by a two-to-one margin
 in elections by secret ballot that foreign observers from the
 United States, Canada, Cote D'Ivoire, France, Germany, and
 Nigeria found to be free and fair. However reluctantly,
 outgoing President Mathieu Kerekou handed over the reins of
 government to President Soglo. The Constitution provides for a
 5-year term for the President, who is limited to two terms of
 office, and for a 4-year term of office for National Assembly
 members, who may serve an unlimited number of terms.
 In the Assembly, 21 parties are represented, with President
 Soglo's alliance holding the most seats--only 12 out of the
 total of 64.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several Beninese nongovernmental organizations monitor human
 rights, including the Human Rights Commission, the Study and
 Research Group on Democracy and Economic and Social
 Development, the Association of Christians Against Torture, and
 the League for the Defense of Human Rights in Benin. In
 contrast to the attitude of the former authoritarian
 government, which considered outside investigations into human
 rights unwarranted interference in Benin's internal affairs,
 both the transition government and the newly elected Government
 have welcomed international and nongovernmental scrutiny of
 human rights in Benin.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status.
 Such discrimination is prohibited in the Constitution and by
 law, and there is no evidence of officially sanctioned
 discrimination.
 Benin has a long tradition of regional rivalry.' This led to
 violence during the elections when northerners, who supported
 ex-President Kerekou's candidacy, and southerners clashed.
 These clashes were most severe in several northern cities and
 led to at least one death. Approximately 6,000 southerners
 fled the north temporarily as a result. Subsequent to
 President Soglo's election, southerners have reasserted their
 traditional claim to power and relatively few northerners have
 been appointed to senior governmental positions. Nor were any
 northerners elected to leadership positions in the National
 Assembly. The southern third of the country, which was favored
 in the colonial period, has about two-thirds of Benin's
 population and is itself divided among various ethnic and
 religious groups.
 The Constitution specifically states that women are by law the
 equals of men in the political, economic, and social spheres.
 The Government officially encourages opportunities for women,
 and 2 of 20 cabinet ministers are women. Beninese women also
 play a major role in the commercial sector. In rural areas,
 however, they have traditionally occupied a subordinate role
 and are responsible for much of the subsistence farm labor. In
 particular, women have not enjoyed-the same educational
 
 
 BENIN
 opportunities as men. In some parts of the country, families
 are reluctant to have their daughters educated at all.
 While no studies are available, violence against women,
 including wife beating, occurs, although it is prohibited by
 law. Police and courts are reluctant to intervene in cases of
 domestic violence, considering such affairs to be family
 matters'. Female circumcision exists, mostly in the northern
 part of the country. It is both deeply rooted in the
 traditions of certain Beninese cultures, and it is a source of
 income for those who perform the procedure. Efforts of a small
 Beninese nongovernmental committee to reduce the practice
 through educational measures have thus far-met with only
 limited success. 'A conference sponsored by the U.N.
 Interhational Children's Emergency Fund and the Inter-African
 Committee on Women's Health was held in mid-October to set up a
 national committee to address the situation.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The'Right of Association
 The December 199a-Constitution gives, workers the freedom to
 organize, to mqet, and to strike. In 1974 all preexisting
 unions were absorbed into'a single trade union center which for
 17 years was the designated mass organization of a single-party
 Marxist regime. This heretofore sole center, the National
 Workers' Union of Benin (UNSTB) declared its independence from
 the former ruling party in 1990 and claims 26 nationwide
 affiliated unions in Benin. The Confederation of Autonomous
 Unions, a separate group formed in February 1991, represents an
 additional 23 unions, mostly in the- public sector.
 Approximately 75 percent of wage earners in the modern sector
 belong to organized labor unions.
 There were a number of strikes in 1991 conducted by labor
 unions in the public, sector (teachers, airport workers, civil
 servants in the Ministries of Planning, Finance; Commerce,
 Industry, Education, and Culture, and the Public Treasury).
 For the most part, strikers were seeking back wages, in many
 cases overdue for a number of years. The Government announced
 in 1991 that it would no longer pay striking public employees
 for time away from the job due to strikes.
 Confederations and individual unions have the right to
 affiliate with international labor movements. In 1990 the
 UNSTB disaffiliated from the Communist-dominated World
 Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Beninese Labor Code provides for collective bargaining.
 The Code, which dates from 1967, is basically copied from the
 French colonial labor code, but the Marxist regime ignored many
 of its aiticles. Individual labor unions are authorized to
 negotiate with employers on labor matters and represent
 workers' grievances to both employers and to the Government,
 with the Government often voluntarily acting as arbitrator.
 The Labor Code prohibits employers fr6m taking union membership
 or activity into account when making decisions on hiring, work
 distribution, professional or vocational training, or
 dismissals. There are no export processing zones.

 BENIN
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by the Labor Code and
 is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Labor Code prohibits the employment or apprenticeship of
 children under the age of 18 in any enterprise. However,
 enforcement by inspectors from the Ministry of Labor is
 limited, and child labor does occur, especially in rural areas,
 where children below the age of 14 often work on family farms.
 Some child labor occurs in urban areas, primarily in the
 informal sector. For example, street vendors of newspapers,
 smuggled petroleum products, and foodstuffs are frequently
 under the age of 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Benin's labor force of about 2 million is primarily engaged in
 agriculture (80 percent), with less than 2 percent of the
 population involved in the modern (wage) sector. Many also
 engage in trade activities in the informal sector. For the
 wage sector, the Labor Code establishes a workweek varying
 between 40 hours (nonagricultural employees) and 56 hours
 (security guards), depending on the type of work. The
 Government administratively sets minimum wage scales for a
 number of occupations. Most of those actually employed in the
 wage sector earn a good deal more than the lowest minimum wage,
 which was last set in 1984 and is sufficient only to provide
 rudimentary food and housing for a family. It must be
 supplemented by subsistence farming or small trade in the
 informal sector if a family is to enjoy a decent living. The
 Government supports policies designed to improve the conditions
 of workers in both the agricultural and industrial sectors.
 The Labor Code also establishes health and safety standards,
 but enforcement by inspectors from the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs is limited.
