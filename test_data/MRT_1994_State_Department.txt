 MAURITANIA
 Mauritania is an Islamic republic. The 1991 Constitution provides for a civilian
 government composed of a dominant executive branch, a Senate and National As-
 sembly, and a judiciary. President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya has governed
 since 1984, first as head of a military junta, and since the 1992 election as head
 of civilian government. Election observers concluded that President Taya's 62-per-
 cent majority in a four-way election was fraudulent. Most opposition parties boy-
 cotted the subsequent parliamentary elections. The President and the Government
 have strong military support.
 The Government maintains order with regular armed forces, the National Guard,
 the Gendarmerie (a specialized corps of paramilitary police), and the police. The
 Ministry of Defense directs the armed forces and Gendamerie; the Ministry of Inte-
 rior directs the National Guard and police. There have been reported instances of
 these forces engaging in human rights abuses.
 Mauritania, with a population of 2.2 million, has a market-oriented economy
 based on subsistence farming, herding and a small commercial sector. Drought,
 desertification, insect infestation, rapid urbanization, extensive unemployment, and
 a burdensome foreign debt handicap the economy. Inadequate recent rainfall has
 contributed to urbanization, further straining government finances.
 The major human rights problem continues to be the Government's failure to re-
 solve the outstanding abuses of the 1989-91 period in which approximately 70,000
 Mauritanians were expelled or fled and some 500 members of the military were
 killed-almost entirely African Mauritanians. Hundreds more were tortured and
 maimed. In 1993 the Parliament passed an amnesty bill to preclude legal pursuit
 of those responsible. The Government has, however, paid pensions and compensa-
 
 
 tion to some survivors and to some families of those killed. Democratic institutions
 are still rudimentary, and ethnic tensions remain high, with many non-Hassaniya-
 speaking citizens continuing to feel excluded from effective political representation.
 Although the Government has instituted some judicial reform, in practice, the
 right to a fair trial continues to be restricted. Police often used brutal methods and
 the Government continued to restrict political activity, seize publications, and dis-
 criminate on the basis of language. Prison conditions are harsh and unhealthy. Soci-
 etal discrimination and female genital mutilation remain a serious concern.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed reports of
 itical killings, but two persons are known to have died while in police custody.
 n April police reportedly aprehended Ibrahima Diallo, a Sene alese taxi driver in
 Nouakchott, on suspicion of robbery. He later died in custody; po ice claimed he died
 of a heart attack. In September a young African-Mauritanian was arrested in the
 town of Nouadhibou for petty theft and died while in police custody. Credible ob-
 servers believe that police mistreatment was the cause of both deaths. Authorities
 have investigated neither of these incidents. There were a number of unexplained
 and uninvestigated deaths in the border regions with Senegal and Mali.
 Authorities brought a police officer to trial for the 1991 torture and death of a
 criminal suspect. The court found the police officer not guilty, but ordered the Min-
 istry of Interior to p ay a "deya" or blood money to the victim's family
 Extrajudicial killings from past years, primarily of African-Mauritanians, re-
 mained unresolved. The principal example of such killing involves the death while
 in military custody of a pproximately 500 largely Halpulaar and Soninke military
 and civilian personnel; the military has never released the results of an internal
 military investigation into this matter and has not brought charges against those
 responsible.
 In June 1993, the Government passed a law granting amnesty to members of the
 armed forces and police as well as to private citizens involved in killings and other
 abuses during 1990 and 1991. Lawyers representing victims' families concluded that
 the law rendered the case legally closed. The Government provided pensions to some
 victims, as well as pensions and compensation to approximately 277 widows and
 families who could document their relationship to those who were killed. The Gov-
 ernment has refused the claims of approximately another 123 women who could not
 prove their relationship to those who were killed. Government failure to investigate
 and bring to justice officials who commit killings or other abuses has created a cli-
 mate of impunity.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits the use of torture and other forms of cruel or inhuman punish-
 ment, but the police continue on occasion to beat criminal suspects while in custody.
 Authorities rarely tried or punished persons suspected of committing such abuses.
 There are credible reports that several of the 60 Islamic persons detained in Sep-
 tember and October were tortured. There has been no public investigation of the de-
 tainees' claims.
 Security forces, assigned to forestall cross-border raids in the Guidimaka area.
 near the Malian and Senegalese borders, have reportedly resorted to brutality when
 questioning people.
 Prison conditions do not meet minimum humanitarian standards. There is severe
 overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and inadequate food and medical treatment.
 There were no reports of suspicious deaths among the prison population. The only
 reports of such deaths were among the detainees in pretrial status cited (see Section
 L.a.). The prison in Nouakchott, which was built in 1960 for a projected prison popu-
 lation of 200 men, now houses 700. Observers report better conditions at the wom-
 en's prison and children's detention center in Nouakchott. At the Government's re-
 (West, a French nongovernmental organization (NGO), Pharmaciens sans Frontieres
 armacists Without Borders) is coordinating international assistance for a large-
 scaleproject to improve overall prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for due process
 and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty by an established tribunal. It
 stipulates that authorities cannot arrest, detain, prosecute, or punish anyone except
 as provided for under the law. Actual application of these safeguards continued to
 vary widely from case to case.
 The law requires that courts review the legality of a person's detention within 48
 hours of arrest. The police may extend the period for another 48 hours, and a pros-
 
 
 161
 ecutor may detain persons for up to 30 days in national security cases. Only after
 the prosecutor submits charges can a suspect contact an attorney. There were credi-
 ble reports that police detained persons incommunicado for extended periods with-
 out charge. Pretrial detention is extensive, and approximately 50 percent of the pris-
 on population has not yet been tried. Some indicted prisoners continue to be re-
 leased before trial without explanation. Familial, tribal, or political connections may
 explain some of these releases. There is a provision for granting bail, but it is rarely
 used.
 In JanusiX police arrested the President of the Mauritanian Human Rights Asso-
 ciation, Cheik Saad Bouh Kamara, searched his home, and seized his papers with-
 out an arrest or search warrant. He was detained just under the 48 hours permis-
 sible, then released without charge. Police questioned him extensively concerning
 his human rights activities and his contacts with an international human rights
 mission that had visited Mauritania just prior to his arrest (see Section 4).
 In September and October, the Government detained for 2 weeks and questioned
 60 people in connection with an alleged Islamist plot. Although the Government said
 it had evidence against the detainees, some of whom confessed to subversive activi-
 ties, the Government released them without charge. Observers reported that in
 most cases police failed to obtain warrants. Occasional reports of arbitrary arrests
 and intimidation committed by security forces continued, particularly in commu-
 nities along the Senegal River.
 e. Denial o Fair 1ublic Trial.-The executive branch controls and influences the
 judiciary, which is only nominally independent. The Ministry of Justice appoints
 judges and subjects the courts to pressure in reaching verdicts. This influence was
 evident, for example, in the court's ruling in favor of the governing party when the
 opposition parties challenged some results of the January-February municipal elec-
 tions.
 In addition t government influence over verdicts, the judicial system's fairness
 is limited by poorly educated and poorly trained judges who are susceptible to tribal
 and social pressures.
 Moreover, Shari'a (Islamic law), tribal regulations and personal connections con-
 tinue to dominate some judicial decisions.
 The formal judicial sytem includes a system of lower, middle and upper level
 courts, each with specific jurisdiction. Bridging the traditional and modern systems
 of justice are 43 department-level tribunals staffed by Qadis, traditional Islamic
 magistrates trained primarily in Koranic law. Mauritanians seeking legal redress in
 civil matters must address themselves to one of these tribunals, which operate on
 the basis of both Shari'a and legal codes. Three regional courts of appeal handle
 challenges to decisions at the department and regional levels. Nominally independ-
 ent, the Supreme Court is headed by a magistrate named to a 5-year term by the
 President. The Supreme Court reviews decisions and rulings made by the courts of
 appeal to determine their compliance with the law. Constitutional review is the pur-
 view of a 6-member Constitutional Council, composed of three members named by
 the President, two by the National Assembly President, and one by the Senate
 President.
 In theory, all defendants, regardless of the court or their ability to pay, have the
 legal right to representation by counsel during the proceedings which are open to
 the public. The law provides that defendants may confront witnesses, present evi-
 dence, and appeal their sentences, but in practice these rights are not regularly ap-
 plied.
 Courts do not treat women as equals of men with respect to legal testimony: the
 testimony of two women is considered equal to that of one man. In addition, in
 awarding an indemnity to the family of a woman who has been killed, the courts
 grant only half the amount they would award for a man's death. In addition, there
 are no female magistrates.
 There were no reported political prisoners or detainees at year's end. The Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has concluded that there are no longer
 any political prisoners and discontinued monitorin.
 Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Bome, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires judicial warrants in order to execute home searches, but the authorities
 often ignore this requirement. During the roundup of some 60 Islamists in Septem-
 ber and October, as well during the detention of human rights monitor Cheik Saad
 Bouh Kamara, police searched detainees' homes and seized papers without a search
 warrant.
 There were fewer reports of government surveillance of suspected dissidents than
 in previous years, although the extent to which the Government used informants
 is unknown.
 
 
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, but the Government continues to restrict these rights through
 prepublication press censorship. Opposition political leaders campaigned openly dur-
 ing the municipal and Senate elections in early 1994, and the government-controlled
 media provided access, albeit limited, to opposition candidates. NGO's and the pri-
 vately owned press are openly critical of the Government and its leaders.
 Antigovernment tracts, newsletters, and petitions circulate widely in Nouakchott
 and other towns.
 The electronic media (radio and television) and the country's two daily news-
 papers, Horizon and Chaab, are government owned and operated. Radio is the most
 important medium in reaching the public, and the official media strongly support
 government policies. All newspapers and political parties must register with the
 Ministry of the Interior. The Government has not refused to register any journal
 but has on occasion temporarily suspended publication of some. At times there have
 been as many as 60 independent, privately owned journals, although only around
 20 have appeared regularly. For the most part, these weeklies, published in Arabic
 or French, reached only a limited audience.
 The Ministry of the Interior reviews all newspaper copy prior to publication. The
 Press Law provides that the Minister of the Interior can stop publication of material
 discrediting Islam or threatening national security. Although the Ministry did not
 excise material from 4ournals or otherwise censor individual articles, authorities
 seized upwards of 20 individual issues of many different journals. One journal, Le
 Calame, was suspended for a month. In some cases, the Government explained its
 action, saying certain papers seized contained false allegations concerning neighbor-
 ing countries which could impinge on national security. In other instances, the Gov-
 ernment provided no specific reason for the seizures.
 In September, in protest against the seizures, the seven affiliated papers of the
 National Association of the Independent Press (ANPI) suspended publication and
 demanded changes in the Press Law to strengthen press independence. These jour-
 nals resumed publication in mid-October, while continuing to press the Government
 with their demands for a new press code.
 The country's one university is government funded and government operated. Aca-
 demic freedom is generally respected, and there were no cases in which the Govern-
 ment prevented professors from pursuing their research interests, from publication,
 or censored their lectures.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and for the most part the Government respects
 this right, although there have been occasions when it restricted public gatherings.
 The law requires that all political parties and NGO's must register with the Min-
 ister of the Interior and obtain permission for large meetings or assemblies. The
 Minister of the Interior, citing the need to ensure public order, denied a permit to
 the main opposition party, the Union of Democratic Forces-New Era (UFD-EN), to
 hold a march and rally to protest fraud committed during the January-February
 municipal elections.
 Over 16 political parties and a wide array of NGO's, many of them highly critical
 of the Government, met openly, issued public statements, and chose their own lead-
 ership. The Government recognized a number of newly formed NGOs, among them
 a new labor confederation, the General Confederation of Mauritanian Workers
 (CGTM), and the Professional Union of the Independent Press in Mauritania
 (UPPIM). The Government has not yet granted some NGO's official sanction but al-
 lowed them to operate. It has not yet recognized the Mauritanian Association for
 Human Rights, claiming that it appeals to specific ethnic groups (i.e., the African-
 Mauritanian community), and is a potentially divisive force. However, the Govern-
 ment allows the association to function.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion does not exist. Mauritania is an Is-
 lamic republic, and the law provides that all citizens are Sunni Muslim and prohib-
 ited from converting to another religion. The Government prohibits proselytizing by
 non-Muslims, and Mauritanians are not allowed to enter non-Islamic houses of wor-
 ship or to possess sacred texts of other religions.
 The Government allows the small Lebanese Shi'a community to practice its reli-
 gion privately and permits the expatriate Christian community to hold services that
 are restricted to non-Mauritanians.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriadon.-Historically there were few restrictions on travel in Mauritania's tradi-
 tional nomadic society. With urbanization and travel by automobile, the Govern-
 ment set up regular checkpoints on roads at which travelers are stopped and papers
 checked by the Gendarmerie. Following cross-border raids from Senegal, the Gov-
 
 
 163
 ernment imposed occasional temporary curfews. There were no reported cases of
 persons being denied passports for political reasons.
 Of the approximately 70,000 African-Mauritanians who were expelled by Mauri-
 tania or fled during the 1989-90 crisis, an estimated 55,000 remained in refugee
 settlements in Senegal. While many of the 15,000 Mauritanian Peuhl who took ref-
 uge in Mali during the same crisis have integrated into the population, the U.N.
 gh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) discontinued at the end of the year the
 limited assistance they had been providing to them.
 The impasse for the 60,000 refugees still in Senegal remained centered on their
 demands that the Government recognize their Mauritanian citizenship before they
 return, repatriate them as a grup under international auspices  return their land,
 and pay compensation for their losses. The Government states that it pces no r-
 strictions on the return of those expelled, and continues to encourage a gradal,
 case-by-case repatriation; some refugees have returned in this manner. However,
 the Government has so far failed to set up clearadmiistrative procedurs fr
 expellees wisbing to obtain confirmation of their citizenship and assciated rights.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens _with this right, but the Government cir-
 cumscribes it in practice. The 1992 multiparty election of a civilian President ended
 14 years of military rule, but both the opposition and international observers con-
 cluded that the elections were fraudulent. Moreover, the military continued to pro-
 vide strong support t  the regime, and some previous Military  ime     rs, in
 addition to President Taya, remained in positions of power witbin the Government
 and armed forces.
 Because the major opposition parties, including the Union of Democratic Forces-
 New Era (UDF-EN), boycotted the 1992 National Assembly elections, the President's
 party, the Republican, Democratic and Social Party ( eraDS), domiates the Genera
 Assembly, ing  66 seats of 79. The PRDS and opposition politica l parties, aswe
 as independent candidates, participated in the 1994 Senatorial elections, an rm
 candidates won all but 1 of the 18 seats at stake. Both the opposition and the gov-
 ernment parties committed fraud during the 1994 elections. Municipal councils
 elected the Senators by indirect vote.
 Women have the right to vote, but few are active in political parties. There were
 seven women im semor government positions, including one Cabinet-level post.
 There is one elected woman senator and one mayor.
 Black Mauritanians are under represented in senior government positions. Of 20
 Cabinet ministers, 3 are Black Maurs, 3 are Pulaars, and 1 is Soninke. The other
 ministers are White Maurs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are two human rights organizations in Mauritania, one of which is the
 Mauritanian League for Human Rights, an officially recognized body. The League
 has occasionally played a mediating role between the Government and representa-
 tives of the refugees in Senegal andvictims of the 1990-91 military purge. A second
 and as yet unrecognized organization, the Mauritanian Human Rights Association
 (AMDH), while not affiliated with the opposition, has many opposition members. It
 has been more critical of the Government than the League, particularly on the unre-
 solved abuses of the 1989-91 period. The AMDH called on the Government to be
 more forthcoming in addressing the vestiges of slavery (see Section 6.c.).
 In January the London-based International League for Human Rights and the
 French human rights group, Agir Ensemble, jointly visited Mauritania. Government
 officials met with representatives of the League, but refused to meet with the rep-
 resentatives of Agir Ensemble, which had previously issued a report highly critical
 of the Government's human rights record. Shortly after the group s departure, police
 apprehended the President of the AMDH and questioned about his international
 contacts, particularly those with Agir Ensemble (see Section 1.d.).
 Although the Government facilitated regular visits by the International Labor Or-
 ganization and the ICRC, it remained selective in its approach to NGO's and inter-
 national organizations. The Government asked Pharmaciens sans Frontieres to co-
 ordinate international assistance to improve prison conditions (see Section 1.c.). As
 in previous years, the Government and the UB.-based Africa Watch, which haspub-
 lished articles strongly critical of the Government's human rights record, coul not
 agree on the terms for a visit to Mauritania. Africa Watch sought written govern-
 ment guarantees concerning freedom   of movement, and uninpeded access to
 Mauritanians; the Government would only give oral assurances.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law for all citizens, regardless
 of race, national origin, sex, or social status, and prohibits racially or ethnically
 based propaganda. In practice, the Government often accords these rights on the
 basis of ethnic and tribal affiliation, social status, and political ties.
 Women.-Women have legal rights to property and child custody and, among the
 more modem and urbanized popuiation, these rights are recognized. In theory, mar-
 riage and divorce do not require the woman's consent. Polygyny exists and, as sanc-
 tioned by the teachings of Islam, a woman does not have the right to refuse her
 husband's wish to marry additional wives. In practice, polygyny and arranged mar-
 riages are increasingly rare, particularly among the Maur population. Women also
 frequently initiate a divorce.
 Traditional forms of mistreatment of women continue, mostly in isolated rural
 communities, but these practices appear to be on the decline. Such mistreatment in-
 cludes forced feeding of adolescent girls (Gavage) and female genital mutilation (see
 below).
 Resort to abuses such as wife beating appears limited. The police and judiciary
 occasionally intervene in domestic disputes, but women in traditional society usually
 do not seek legal redress, preferring to turn to family and ethnic group members
 to resolve domestic disputes.
 There are no restrictions on the education of women. Few women attend univer-
 sity and while the overall literacy rate is approximately 34 percent, for women it
 is 21 percent. The Government has a policy of opening new employment opportuni-
 ties for women in areas traditionally reserved for men, such as health care, commu-
 nications, police, and customs services. Women are well represented in government-
 owned radio and television, and many news broadcasters are women. The law pro-
 vides that men and women receive equal pay for equal work. While not universally
 applied in practice, the two largest employers, the civil service and the state mining
 company, respect this law. In the modern wage sector, women also receive generous
 faml y benefits, including 3 months of maternity leave.
 Children.-The law does not provide any special protection for children's rights.
 There are programs to care for abandoned children, but resources are inadequate.
 The Government does not enforce existing child labor laws; children often perform
 significant labor in support of their families' activities.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), most often performed on young girls, continues
 to be practiced widely among all ethnic groups except the Wolof. For the most part,
 the least severe form of excision is practiced, although some groups practice
 infibulation, the most severe form of FGM. Evidence indicates that the incidence is
 diminishing in the modern urban sector. The Government, however, does not at-
 tempt to interfere with these practices although government health workers try to
 educate women to the dangers of the practice and of the fact that it is not a require-
 ment of Islam.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic and cultural tension and alleged dis-
 crimination arise from the geographic and cultural line between traditionally no-
 madic     bc-spe   ng   assanya)           theAfrican herders
 and sedentary cultivators along the Senegal River in the Sou. Though culturally
 homogeneous, the Maurs are divided among numerous tribal groups and are racially
 distinguished as White Maurs (Beydane) and Black Maurs. The majority of the
 BlackMars are Haratine, literally "one who has been freed," although some Blac k
 Maur families were never enslaved. The southern African-Mauritanians are the
 Halpulaar (the largest group), the Wolof and the Soninke. White Maurs dominate
 positions in government, business, and the clergy. African-Mauritanians are under
 represented in the military and security sectors. They, like human rights groups,
 contend that this is based on ethnic and linguistic discrimination.
 Ethnic tensions surfaced dramatically in the mass expulsions of African-
 Mauritanians in 1989-90 and the settlement in the Senegal River area by both
 White and Black Maurs.
 Black Africans charge that the Government is misusing the 1983 land reform law
 to allow Maurs to encroach on fertile land in the Senegal River valley which tradi-
 tionally has been the preserve of black Africans. The Government claims the land
 was underutilized and used by traditional landowners to maintain a feudal system
 of serfdom.
 Language has been a divisive issue since Mauritania's independence and the es-
 tablishment of Arabic as the national language in 1973. Successive government re-
 gimes-both civil and military-which pursued a policy of "Arabization" in the
 schools and in the workplace have exacerbated interethnic tensions, putting non-Ar-
 abic-speaking African-Mauritanians at a disadvantage.
 
 
 165
 The Government has attempted to institute a flexible educational program per-
 mitting primary educatio n  multiple languages: Arabic, French, or one of the three
 African languages. One result, however, is that in seeking admission to the univer-
 sity, students not having elected Arabic are at a disadvantage. The linguistic debate
 and ethnic tension extend even to the language used in law school diplomas.
 Overt tensions between ethnic groups have lessend since the explosive ethnic vio-
 lence of 1989 to 1991, when the Government's extrajudical expulsions and reprisals
 by the security forces were clearly based on ethnicty. Nevertheless, hostility and
 bitterness persist among the Black Maur and African majority. However, there is
 little cultural identity or political cohesion within them.
 People With Disabiities.-The Government does not mandate preference in em-
 ployment or education or public accessibility for disabled persons, but provides some
 rehabilitation and other assistance for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association
 and the right of citizens to join any political or labor organization. All workers ex-
 cept members of the military and police are free to associate in and establish unions
 at the local and national levels.
 Prior to the 1993 amendment to the Labor Code, which repealed provisions re-
 stricting trade union pluralism, the government-controlled labor central, the Union
 of Mauritanian Workers (UTM), was the only labor confederation allowed by law.
 It remains the major worker confederation and many workers still view it as closely
 allied with the Government and the PRDS. The Government recognized a new con-
 federation, the General Confederation of Mauritanian Workers (CGTM), which is
 not affiliated with any political party, although most of its members favor the oppo-
 sition. It has organized some new locals, working among the heretofore unorgamzed
 self-employed workers, and has attracted a number of member unions from the
 UTM. The CGTM has protested what it characterized as preferential treatment for
 the UTM by the Government.
 International trade union activity is minimal, but unions are free to affiliate with
 international bodies. The UTM participated in regional labor organizations, and the
 CGTM was accepted as a member of the Ghana-bd United Organization of Afri-
 can Workers.
 The bulk of the labor force is in the informal sector, with most workers engaged
 in subsistence agriculture and animal husbandry, only 25 percent are employedin
 the wage sector. However, nearly 90 percent of industrial and commercial workers
 are unionized.
 The law provides workers with the right to strike, and there were several strikes
 and partial work stoppages. Most were settled quickly due to limited worker and
 union resources and government pressure. Moreover, the law stipulates that tri-
 partite arbitration committees composed of union, business, and government rep-
 resentatives may impose binding arbitration that automatically terminates any
 strike.
 The Government did not petition the United States for reconsideration of General-
 ized System of Preferences (GSP) trade privileges. The United States had revoked
 its GSP benefits in July 1993 for failure to respect freedom of association or to take
 steps to eliminate forced labor, including vestiges of slavery.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides that unions
 may freely organize workers without government or employer interference. Wages
 and other benefits are generally decided informally among individual unions, em-
 ployers, and the Government. However, the Government plays a dominant role in.
 the wage negotiations and in practice limits collective bargaining.
 Laws provide workers protection against antiunion discrimination and employees
 or employers may bring labor disputes to three-person labor courts that are over-
 seen jointly by the Ministries of Justice and Labor. The CGTM successfully rep-
 resented workers before the courts in two cases in which employers had refused to
 recogize their employees' decisions to change their affiliation from the UTM to the
 CGTM
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Mauritania has officially abolished
 slavery several times, most recently in 1980. Nevertheless, the legacy of slavery re-
 mains, particularly in its economic and psychological manifestations. Tens of thou-
 sands of persons whose ancestors were slaves still occupy positions of servitude and
 near-servitude, although such practices as coercive slavery and commerce in slaves
 appear to have virtually disappeared. In most cases those remaining in a situation
 of unpaid servitude do so due to a lack of economic alternatives.
 
 
 166
 Some freed slaves (Haratine) have either stayed with, or returned to, their former
 masters and continue to provide labor in exchange for room, board, and other basic
 necessities. Others live independently but continue in a symbiotic relationship with
 their former masters, performing occasional unpaid labor for food, clothing, and
 medical care. It is difficult to quantify the number of persons who continue to live
 under conditions of involuntary servitude. Estimates from various sources range
 from a low of a few thousand to as many as 90,000. However, no definitive figures
 exist.
 The El Hor (literally 'the free man") Movement continued to pursue its agenda
 to eradicate the vestiges of slavery and its associated mentality among former slaves
 and slaveholders. Observers report the existence of slavery among& Malian refu-
 gees--both Tuareg and Maur-who arrived in the camps in eastern Mauritania. In-
 formed estimates are that 10 percent of the 80,000 refugees in the camps are slaves.
 Efforts by U.N. workers in the camps to distribute food and other services to these
 families separately from their masters have met with strong resistance by the slaves
 themselves, who may fear retribution from their masters.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Education is not compulsory, and
 due to a lack of resources some 30 percent or more of school-age children do not
 regularly attend government schools. Labor law specifies that no child under the age
 of 13 may be employed in the agricultural sector without the permission of the Min-
 ister of Labor, nor under the age of 15 in the nonagricultural sector. The law pro-
 vides that employed children aged 14 to 16 should receive 70 percent of the mini-
 mum wage, and those from 17 to 18 should receive 90 percent of the minimum
 wage. The Labor Ministry's few inspectors provide only limited enforcement of child
 labor laws; many people consider child labor laws irrelevant (see Section 5).
 Young children in the countryside commonly pursue herding, cultivation, fishing,
 and other significant labor in support of their families' activities. In keeping with
 longstanding tradition, many children serve 'apprenticeships in small industries and
 in the informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage for adults is approxi-
 mately $67 per month (ougiya 8,300) and has not been raised since October 1992.
 It is difficult for the average family to meet its minimum needs and maintain a de-
 cent standard of living at this salary level. The standard, legal, nonagricultural
 work week may not exceed either 40 hours or 6 days without overtime compensa-
 tion, which is paid at rates that are graduated according to the number of supple-
 mental hours worked. The Labor Directorate of the Ministry of Labor is responsible
 for enforcement of the labor laws but in practice inadequate funding limits the ef-
 fectiveness of the Directorate's enorcement.
 The Ministry of Labor is also responsible for enforcing safety standards but does
 so inconsistently.
