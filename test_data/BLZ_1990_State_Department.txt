 BELIZE
 Belize is a parliamentary democracy organized under a
 Constitution enacted in 1981 upon independence from the United
 Kingdom. It is governed by a Prime Minister, a Cabinet of
 Ministers, and a Legislative Assembly. A Governor General
 represents Queen Elizabeth II in the largely ceremonial role
 of Head of State. Both local and national elections are
 scheduled on a regular, constitutionally prescribed basis, and
 the two national political parties--the People's United Party
 (PUP) and the United Democratic Party (UDP)--field competing
 slates of candidates. The Government changed hands, for the
 second time since independence, when the PUP won a majority of
 parliamentary seats on September 4, 1989.
 The 500-member Belize National Police (BNP) is responsible for
 law enforcement and maintenance of order. It is responsible
 to and controlled by civilian authorities.
 Belize is a developing nation with an economy dependent
 primarily on agriculture. The Government favors free
 enterprise aid actively encourages increased investment, bath
 foreigr and domestic.  In 1990- the gross domestic product
 increased 7 percent, and per capita gross domestic product was
 an estimated $I,25.
 Constitutional protections for the fundamental rights and
 freedoms of the individual, including women and all ethnic
 groups, are upheld by the judiciary- Persons may freely speak
 and associate, hald private property, and pursuL private
 interests. An active press buttresses the peopl',s civil and
 political rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom front:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated or other
 extrajudicial kIllings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are expressly forbidden by the Constitution, and
 this prohibition is generally respected in practice.
 In December the Government announced the formation of a
 Commission of Inquiry to investigate charges that the police
 had tortured a Guatemalan, Luis Arevalo, before deporting him
 in late October. The Commission had not released its findings
 by year's end.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest or detention, and
 these provisions are respected in practice. A detainee must
 be informed of the cause of detention within 48 hours of
 
 
 510
 BELIZE
 arrest and must be brought before a Court within 72 hours. In
 practice, detainees are normally informed immediately of the
 charges against them. Bail is granted in all but the most
 serious cases. Exile in forbidden by the Constitution and
 does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons accused of civil or criminal offenses have
 constitutional rights to presumption of innocence, protection
 against self-incrimination, defense by counsel, public trial,
 and appeal. Trial by jury is mandatory in criminal cases.
 Those convicted by either a magistrate's court or the Supreme
 Court of Belize may appeal to the Court of Appeal. In some
 cases, including those resulting in a capital sentence, the
 convicted party may make a final appeal to the Queen's Privy
 Council in the United Kingdom.
 In 1990 these constitutional guarantees were respected by the
 judiciary, although its independence from the executive branch
 was called into question by observers who noted-that Supreme
 Court justices must negotiate their contracts with the
 Administration. The Supreme Court and magistrate courts
 suffer backlogs aggravated by the inability to maintain a full
 complement of judges.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Constitutional provisions for the protection of personal
 property, privacy of home and person, and recognition of human
 dignity are generally honored by the Government.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are protected under the
 Constitution and by local custom. In practice, all viewpoints
 are publicly presented without government interference. Five
 privaiely owned weekly newspapers, two of them fiercely
 partisan, engage in lively debate of the issues. The
 opposition press is a frequent critic of government officials
 and policies. All newspapers are subject to the constraints
 of libel laws.
 With the introduction of Radio KREM, Belize's first privately
 owned commercial radio station, the government monopoly of
 radio ended. The Government also enacted legislation to
 remove the Belize Broadcasting Network from government control
 by restructuring it as an autonomous authority renamed the
 Broadcasting Corporation of Belize (BCB).
 Fourteen privately owned television broadcasting stations,
 including several cable networks, operate throughout Belize
 under the authority and regulation of the Belize Broadcasting
 Authority (BBA). The BBA asserts its right to authorize
 certain broadcasts, such as those with political content, and
 to edit any defamatory or personally libelous material from
 the political broadcasts of both parties before these are
 
 
 511
 BELIZE
 aired. As far as is known, the BBA did not exercise this
 authority during 1990.
 Academic freedom is vigorously exercised.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is constitutionally assured and honored in
 practice. Political parties and other groups with political
 objectives freely hold rallies and mass meetings. The
 organizers of public meetings must obtain a permit 36 hours in
 advance of the meetings, and such permits are not denied for
 political reasons. Under the Constitution Belizeans are free
 to form and join associations of their choice, both political
 and nonpolitical.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Belize. All groups may worship
 as they choose, and all groups and churches may establish
 places of worship, train clergy, and maintain contact with
 coreligionists abroad. Th ere is an active missionary
 presence- In: church publications and from the pulpit, church-
 leaders comment upon government and poIitical policies as-
 these affect the social welfare of.the country. A broad-based
 partnership of the Government and several different churches
 active in education successfully operates and administers most
 of Belize's primary and secondary schoQls.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the
 country. Foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation are
 unrestricted.
 While emigration is widely accepted, a wave of immigration
 from neighboring Central American countries continued to be
 controversial. As many as 40,000 Central American refugees
 have arrived in Belize since 1980, often entering illegally
 and residing in the country-without documentation- The
 original government enthusiasm for, and assistance to, the new
 arrivals waned as public resentment of their increasing
 presence spread. The Government, working with the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), planned and
 was implementing during the year a variety of assistance
 projects aimed at benefitting both Belizeans and refugees, in
 an attempt to defuse potential resentment toward the refugees
 and helping to minimize discrimination against them. In 1990
 no refugees were either forced or pressured to return to their
 countries of origin, and the Government ratified the U.N.
 Convention on Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Belize is a functioning democracy governed by a Legislative
 Assembly, with executive direction coming from a Cabinet of
 Ministers headed by Prime Minister George Price. By
 constitutional mandate, the Governor General instructs the
 leader of the majority party of the national Assembly to form
 a Government following national elections, which must be held
 at least once every 5 years. Municipal and town board
 officials are elected in local contests at 3 year intervals
 
 
 512
 BELIZE
 All elections are by secret ballot, and suffrage is universal
 for Belizean citizens 18 years and older. The UDP and PUP
 dominate Belizean political life, and each party's membership
 includes all segments of Belize's diverse ethnic groupings.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no known requests by international human rights
 organizations to investigate human rights violations in
 Belize, and no international human rights.organization
 maintains an office in Belize. Senior government officials
 state that the Government would cooperate with any reputable,
 internationally recognized human rights organization that
 wished to establish An office in Belize.
 The Human Rights Commission of Belize (HRCB), a
 nongovernmental organization that opened offices in late 1987,
 is affiliated with Amnesty International and other
 organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no widespread discrimination on ethnic or religious
 grounds. All Belizeans have equal protection under the law.
 Despite constitutional provisions of equality, Belizean women
 face some social and economic prejudices. For example, women
 can find it more difficult than men to obtain business and
 agricultural financing and other resources. Most employed
 women are concentrated in female-dominated occupations with
 traditionally low status and wages. The Government worked to
 ameliorate this problem by funding a Women's Bureau, charged
 with developing programs to improve the status of women in
 Belize. Founded in 1981, the Women's Bureau was upgraded in
 1986 to a department within the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Services. A number of officially registered women's groups
 work closely with various government ministries in promoting
 social awareness programs. Women have access to education and
 are active in all spheres of national life. Both the Governor
 General and the President of the Senate are women, and women
 hold other important positions in both the public and private
 sectors. Women generally receive the same wage as men for
 similar work, and are not impeded from owning or managing land
 or other real property.
 Domestic violence against women is a chronic problem. In 1985
 a group of Belize City residents began the Belize Women
 Against Violence Movement (WAV) which now has branches
 elsewhere in the country. The group runs a shelter for
 battered wives and a hotline for rape victims, and has
 obtained cooperation from the Ministries of Home Affairs and
 Education. The Government's committment to increasing the
 safety of women is affirmed in its Policy Statement on Women,
 the effective policy guidance for the work of the Women's
 Bureau.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 By statute and in practice Belizean workers are free to
 establish and join labor organizations. Twelve independent
 
 
 513
 BELIZE
 and active unions, with an estimated 12 percent of the labor
 force on their rolls, represent a broad cross-section of
 white-collar, blue-collar, and professional workers, including
 most civil service employees. The unions are recognized by
 the Ministry of Labor after they file with the Office of
 Registry. Members are empowered to draft the bylaws and
 constitutions of their unions, and they are free to elect
 officers from among the membership at large. Unions which
 choose not to hold elections can act as representatives for
 their membership, but only unions which hold free and annual
 elections of officers are permitted to join the national Trade
 Union Congress of Belize (TUC). By both law and precedent,
 unions are effectively protected against dissolution or
 suspension by administrative authority.
 Although no unions are officially affiliated with political
 parties, several are clearly allied with one or the other of
 the two main parties. Unions freely exercise the right to
 form federations and confederations and affiliate with
 international organizations. Unions are legally-permitted to
 strike, but unions representing essential services may strike
 only after giving 21 days' notice to the Ministry concerned.
 In practice, the Labor Commissioner acts as a conciliator in
 deadlocked collective bargaining negotiations between labor
 and management, offering nonbinding counsel to both sides.
 Historically, the Commissioner's guidance has been voluntarily
 accepted. However, should either union or management choose
 not to accept the conciliator's decision, both are entitled to
 a legal hearing of the case, provided that it is linked to
 some valid provision of civil or criminal law. There were no
 strikes during 1990-
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Article 13 of the Constitution prohibits antiunion
 discrimination both before and after the union is registered.
 Theoretically, unions may freely organize. In practice,
 however, employers are not legally required to recognize a
 union as a bargaining agent, and some employers have been
 known to block union organization by terminating the
 employment of key union sympathizers, usually on grounds
 purportedly unrelated to union activities.
 There are no export processing zones in Belize.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is forbidden by the Constitution and does not
 occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age of employment in Belize is 14 years, or 17
 years for employment near hazardous machinery. Inspectors of
 the Ministries of Labor and Education enforce this regulation,
 although in recent years school truancy officers, who have
 historically borne the brunt of the enforcement burden, have
 been less active.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 No single minimum wage covers all workers, but some categories
 of service employment, such as retail, restaurant, domestic,
 and health care jobs have legal minimum hourly wage standards
 ranging around $0 75 per hour. There are reports of employers
 
 
 514
 BELIZE
 who routinely fail to pay workers. Undocumented foreign
 workers are particularly vulnerable to this practice since
 they are less likely to complain to the authorities. No
 worker is obliged to work more than 6 days or 45 hours per
 week. Payment of overtime work is obligatory, as is an annual
 paid vacation of 2 weeks. A patchwork of health and safety
 regulations covers numerous industries, and these are enforced
 to varying degrees by the Ministries of Labor and Public
 Health. Enforcement is not universal countrywide, and in 1990
 the limited inspection and investigative resources were
 committed principally to urban and more accessible rural areas
 where labor, health, and safety complaints had been registered.
