 HAITI
 Haiti's second democratically elected President, Rene Preval, celebrated his first
 anniversary in office on February 7, the first time a democratically elected president
 reached that milestone. The bicameral, 110-member National Assembly showed its
 independence by amending bills presented by the Government, summoning the
 Prime Minister in March for a vote of confidence, and not approving the President's
 nominees for the post of prime minister in August and December. The political situ-
 ation remained unsettled following the June resignation of the Prime Minister, who
 still had not been replaced at year's end. Mayors and local councils elected in 1995
 reflected broad, popular participation in democratic local government. Elections for
 some complementary local government bodies called for in the 1987 Constitution
 were held for the first time beginning in April. These elections culminated on Octo-
 ber 3 in the election of an Interdepartmental Council, which is to function as a liai-
 son between the provinces and the executive branch. Members of the communal sec-
 tion assemblies, or ASEC's, took office in August, although the majority party
 charged that the Provisional Electoral Council had committed fraud in favor of an-
 other party in the elections for these bodies and the Senate. At year's end, the April
 elections remained embroiled in controversy, pending resolution of partisan dif-
 ferences. The judicial system-while theoretically independent-remained weak, dis-
 organized, and corrupt after decades of government interference, financial neglect,
 and corruption.
 The 2-year-old civilian Haitian National Police (HNP) continued to form needed
 specialized units and formally absorbed the National Penitentiary Administration
 (APENA) in accordance with the Constitution. In August international military
 units withdrew from the Palace, and responsibility for the security of the President
 
 
 and Government passed to the HNP palace security units. Over the course of the
 year, the HNP's leadership, in cooration with the international community, under-
 took a serious training and development effort to improve officers' skills, increase
 accountability, and bring the force into compliance with international standards.
 The United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH) was converted to the U.N.
 Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH) in August, with about 1,200 peacekeeping
 troops and 250 civilian police responsible for assisting the Government to maintain
 a secure and stable environment and advising the HNP. The UNTMIH's mandate
 expired on November 30. The U.N. Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH), with 290
 police officers from 11 countries, succeeded UNTMIH on December 1 with a 1-year
 mandate to advise, train, and support the professionalization of the HNP. Several
 mayors maintained quasi-official forces to serve as municipal police. These groups
 lack legal standing, authority to carry weapons, or legitimate powers of arrest. The
 Port-au-Prince extralegal force is said to number several dozen persons; that of
 Delmas, an adjoining suburb, about 30. The mayors of several other towns have
 much smaller corps. Some members of local government councils (CASEC's) have as-
 sumed arrest authorit in defiance of the law. Members of the HNP, the other secu-
 rity forces, and the iNormal municipal police committed some serious human rights
 abuses.
 Haiti is an extremely poor country, with a per capita annual income of about
 $300. This figure may not fully include significant unrecorded transfers from the es-
 timated 1 million Haitians living abroad, as well as income from informal sector ac-
 tivities that constitute an estimated 70 percent of actual economic activity. The
 country has a market-based economy with state enterprises controlling such key sec-
 tors as telecommunications and utilities. A formal privatization strategy is slowly
 being implemented for nine parastatal enterprises. About two-thirds of the popu-
 lation work in subsistence agriculture, earn less than the average income and live
 in extreme poverty. A small, traditional elite controls much of the countrys wealth.
 A small part of the urban labor force works in the industrial and assembly sectors
 with an equal number in government or service sector employment. Assembled
 goods--textiles, leather goods, handicrafts, and electronics-are a major source of
 export revenue and employment. Other important exports are mangoes and coffee.
 The Government relies heavily on international financial assistance.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however, a
 significant number of serious abuses occurred, and some abuses increased in fre-
 quency during the year. The police summarily executed at least six persons. Police
 officers shot and killed 11 persons while making arresTs or controlling demonstra-
 tions and wounded at least 17 others in these situations. Police were also respon-
 sible for instances of torture and at least 189 cases of mistreatment of detainees,
 including repeated, severe beatings, and a mbck execution. Poor prison conditions
 and arbitrary arrest and detention remained problems. The HNP Director General,
 following the recommendations of his Inspector General, fired at least 21 police
 agents for human rights abuses; he referred 9 of these cases to the Public Prosecu-
 tor. The police leadership made some progress in addressing management weak-
 nesses, which limit accountability for police misconduct, but many senior and mid-
 level positions remained unfilled.
 The judiciary is weak and corrupt. The Senate and Chamber of Deputies had not
 yet taken final action on a judicial reform bill by year's end; however, the draft bill
 stipulates no precise measures to bring about reform. The near-moribund judicial
 system remained incapable of processing detainees in accordance with the law, and
 a large proportion of crimes, including some that may have had political motiva-
 tions, remainunsolved. The authorities arrested an opposition politician in Novem-
 ber on accusations of plotting to assassinate the President; they released him provi-
 sionally a month later. The authorities maintained in illegal detention some persons
 arrested in 1996 who were members of the political opposition. The dogged judicial
 docket, lengthy pretrial detention, and illegal searches also contributed to wide-
 spread human rights violations. Societal discrimination against women, violence
 against women, and abuse of children remain problems, particularly the widespread
 practice of rural families sending young children to the larger cities to work as un-
 paid domestics (restaveks). Vigilante activity-including killings-remained a prob-
 The Government's limited effort to redress the legacy of human rights abuse from
 the 1991-94 period met largely with failure. Important cases, such as those from
 the 1994 Raboteau killings, languished in the courts. Judicial officials failed to begin
 processing many other complaints involving human rights abuses, although a few
 convictions were obtained. The Justice Ministry did not widely disseminate the re-
 port of the National Truth and Justice Commission and did not implement its rec-
 ommendations. In particular, although the budget included funds to compensate vic-
 
 
 tima (and their survivors) of the 1991-94 period of military rule, the Government
 disbursed none of these funds. However, on November 4 the Government opened the
 office of Protector of Citizens, an autonomous office established by the 1987 Con-
 stitution.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Extrajudicial killings by the authori-
 ties decreased compared with 1996, according to UNSMIH reports, the HNP Inspec-
 tor General, and other sources. In late April and early May, police removed at least
 three men from detention in the Cite Soleil police station and shot them, according
 to information collected by the UN/OAS International Civilian Mission (ICM). An
 ICM investigation also found that two gang leaders from Cite Soleil, reported to
 have died in the hospital from gunshot wounds suffered in a battle with police in
 October, were in fact arrested and beaten so severely that they died. On September
 22, Port-au-Prince police handcuffed an accused thief on the street and then killed
 him, according to eyewitnesses. The authorities suspended several police agents,
 pending an investigation of this killing. The police also shot a gang leader to death
 in Cite Soleil in unclear circumstances in September. In February a police inspector
 in Les Cayes, allegedly hired by a local resident, killed a citizen and shot and killed
 a fellow policeman who pursued him; he was shot and killed himself by a third po-
 liceman.
 Police were also responsible for 11 additional deaths when officers used excessive
 force in making arrests or controlling demonstrations. Off-duty police officers shot
 and killed at least seven people in personal disputes. An off-duty prison guard shot
 and killed an unarmed escapee in Cap Haitien on June 7, sparking violent dem-
 onstrations. On May 28 in Archaie prison, a detainee died after 7 days without med-
 ical care (see Section 1.c.).
 The police Inspector General completed reports on several cases of summary exe-
 cution or use of excessive force. On his recommendation, the HNP Director General
 fired 21 agents for committing human rights abuses, and sent 9 of these cases to
 the Public Prosecutor. However, few cases against police reached trial. In July in
 Cap Haitien, a criminal court found that the death of a woman shot in a public con-
 veyance by two police in 1996 was accidental. On May 23 and June 5, an investiga-
 tive judge in Port-au-Prince released without trial six police officers charged with
 murder in three separate cases that occurred in 1996. With more supervisors in
 place, the incidence of officers dismissed for misconduct, who nevertheless returned
 to duty or continued to draw pay, declined sharply.
 The head of the quasi-official security force attached to the Delmas mayors office
 shot and killed a fellow employee in the town hall on June 12; town officials refused
 to hand him over to police. The Delmas mayor confirmed to an international organi-
 zation that 6 off-duty members of the Delmas force were involved in armed inci-
 dents in Cite Soleil in which 6 persons were killed and 14 wounded on February
 25. A Parliament security guard shot and killed two supposed criminals near the
 Parliament building on June 20.
 The Special Investigative Unit (SIU) of the National Police served over a dozen
 arrest warrants in the 1994 Raboteau massacre case and continued to investigate
 other notorious human rights abuses from previous years. In January, responsibility
 for investigating the August 1996 killings of political opposition activists Antoine
 Leroy and Jacque Florivalpassed to the SmU, which arranged autopsies of the bod-
 ies and collected other evidene. In July the Government dismissed the suspended
 chief of palace security, his deputy, and eight members of the presidential security
 unit who allegediy were at the scene of the shootings. The police killed Eddy
 Arhrouet, the chief suspect in the Lery and Florival killings, during a raid on his
 home on December 14. The SIU was not present at the scene of the raid. The raid
 occurred nearly 1 year after an arrest warrant had been issued for Arbrouet, a
 former informal palace security operative. Information about oerational details of
 the raid remained unclear at year's end. Investigators made only minor progress on
 other high-profile killings, such as the March 1995 murder of Mireille Bertin, which
 were committed following then-President Jean Bertrand Aristide's return in 1994.
 None of these cases was brought to trial.
 At year's end, the Government continued to hold on undetermined charges the
 two suspects acquitted by a jury In 1996 for the killing of Minister of Justice Guy
 Malary.
 Assailants killed 20 police officers, most of whom were off duty, including several
 cases in which robbers killed them after finding their police identification. The po-
 lice arrested several suspects in these murders. Instances of mob killings of sus-
 
 
 .ec.d criminals exceeded 147. Police made at least 36 arrests in 10 cases of mob
 b. A    pearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The 1987 Constitution prohibits the use of unnecessary force or restraint, psycho-
 logical pressure, or brutality by the security forces. However, members of the secu-
 rity forces frequently violated these provisions. Police officers used excessive-and
 sometimes deadly-force in making arrests or controlling demonstrations, wounding
 more than 17 people in such situations. The police were responsible for more than
 189 cases of mistreatment of detainees. They also continued to beat demonstrators
 without arresting them in several instances.
 Members of the HNP tortured suspects in isolated incidents. In late July, the
 U.N. Civilian Police reported that beating of detainees had become common in the
 Cite Soleil police station, with some persons also being tortured. On August 8 in
 the Cite Soleil station, police undressed and whipped three women detainees. In
 mid-April Cap Haitien police took four detainees to a ruined fort outside town and
 carried out a mock execution. In September an off-duty policeman in Port-au-Prince
 seized a man, handcuffed him, and tortured him with a hot iron, rather than taking
 him to a police station. The policeman was later arrested.
 Cases in which the HNP mistreated detainees-sometimes severely-increased.
 The ICM recorded a noticeable rise in the number of complaints of beatings by the
 police. Such violations of human rights continued throughout the year. Most often,
 police beat suspected members of armed gangs during arrest or in the course of in-
 terrogation, usually with firearms or police batons. In a few cases, police forced de-
 tainees to lie prone, then walked on their backs. On other occasions, police encour-
 aged some detainees to beat others or failed to intervene when detainees beat each
 other. Another problem was the failure to provide medical treatment to ill or injured
 detainees; the Government provides no budget for medical treatment (or food) for
 detainees in police holding cells. In sporadic cases, off-duty officers used their weap-
 ons in disputes with taxi drivers or in nightclubs. Several police officers wounded
 themselves or others through negligent handling of firearms.
 The quasi-official forces connected to the Port-au-Prince mayoralt on several oc-
 casions beat female vendors who allegedly were violating market rules. Members of
 local government councils, illegally assuming police functions such as arrest, beat
 at least 11 people. On May 28, one such beating victim died in Archaie prison, and
 two CASEC-members were arrested for causing the death (see Section l.a.). A mob
 had beaten him severely before turning him over to police. Despite his obvious inju-
 ries when police took him to prison on May 19, prison officials did not obtain treat-
 ment for him.
 Prison conditions remained very poor. Prisoners and detainees, held in over-
 crowded and inadequate facilities, continued to suffer from inadequate basic hy-
 gne, poor quality health care, and 24-hour confinement to cells in some facilities.
 e increase in the prison population posed a threat to the health and life of pris-
 oners. The 17 prison facilities held 3,328 inmates in early December, up from 2,540
 in March. The rate of increase in the prison population slowed from that of 1996,
 due in part to foreign-supported programs of legal assistance for indigent detainees.
 Prison observers noted that, on occasion, prisoners claimed that guards beat their
 charges.
 Fort National prison in Port-au-Prince is the only prison facility expressly for
 women and juveniles. In other prison facilities, women are housed in cells separate
 from the men. However, overcrowding often prevents strict separation of juveniles
 from adults, convicts from those in pretrial detention, or violent from nonviolent
 prisoners.
 The Government, with the help of the international community, made some
 progress in improving prison conditions. Prisoners nationwide generally received
 two adequate meals per day-a substantial improvement over 1995, when seven
 persons in the national penitentiary died of a vitamin deficiency. The International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) funded the installation of rudimentary clinics
 in the country's prisons. The Government failed, however, to keep these facilities
 adequately stocked with medicines and other health care supplies. The APENA
 drafted internal regulations to standardize overall prisoner care; the regulations
 awaited approval by the Ministry of Justice at year's end.
 Persons detained in politically sensitive cases were often kept in police station
 holding cells, rather than in regular prison facilities. These and other holding cell
 detainees depended largely on their families for food and medicine. In some cases,
 police officers used their personal funds to buy food for such persons.
 The authorities freely permitted the ICRC, the Haitian Red Cross, the ICM, and
 other human rights groups to enter prisons and police stations, monitor conditions,
 
 
 and assist prisoners with medical care, food, and legal aid. The only interruption
 to this access occurred when the APENA director issued a directive in late January
 barring the ICM from freely visiting prison facilities. The Minister of Justice can-
 celed the directive 2 weeks later and accepted the long-pending resignation of the
 director. The ICM resumed unimpeded prison visits.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution stipulates that a person
 may be arrested only if apprehended during the commission of a crime, or if a judi-
 cial warrant has been issued. The authorities must bring the detainee before a judge
 within 48 hours of arrest. However, the authorities frequently ignored these provi-
 sions in practice.
 Arbitrary arrests continued to occur. A few of those arrested complained that po-
 lice wore masks during their arrest. The plice also made arrests based on flawed
 warrants or in the presence of a justice of the peace in lieu of a warrant, which is
 legally insufficient. In August the ICM found that a few judges began interpreting
 any arrest within 24 hours of the crime as occurring during commission of the crime
 or the immediate investigation of it, and hence not requiring a warrant. Nongovern-
 mental organizations (NGO's) providing legal assistance to the indigent reported the
 number of illegal arrests decreased in several cities. The Government released 18
 persons-members of the political opposition or former soldiers-who had been ar-
 rested in August 1996 on poorly substantiated charges of threatening state security.
 Of 57 persons the ICM considered to be in detention on such charges in September
 1996, 14 remained in custody at year's end.
 There were a few arrests related to the April 6 elections. However, these occurred
 at the instigation of local party organizations, not of the Government, and the judi-
 cial system released all those arrested within a day or two. In Mirebalais on March
 17-18 following a clash among members of several political parties, the HNP crowd
 control unit arrested 10 people without warrants. The dean of the court released
 them after a special hearing on March 18. In Jeremie on March 30, a justice of the
 peace under pressure from one political party issued warrants (which he had no au-
 thority to do) for five members of a rival party. Members of the rival party success-
 fully pressed a different judge to release those detained. On April 6 in Savanette-
 Cabral, police arrested five persons without warrants on suspicion of blocking poll
 workers the day before; the Hinche prosecutor declared the arrests illegal and re-
 leased the five the following day.
 The authorities arrested eon Jeune, former presidential candidate and occasional
 critic of the Government, on November 16 on charges of plotting against the security
 of the State and possession of illegal weapons. Jeune stated that he had been struck
 three times on the back of the neck at the time of his arrest "with the criminal in-
 tention of killing me," and that his investigations had revealed that his assailant
 was Aramic Louis, HNP Director in the Western department. Judge Gabriel Castor
 ordered Jeune's release on November 27, but Judge Onel Cadet remanded him to
 prison shortly thereafter. Judge Cadet granted Jeune provisional release on Decem-
 ber 5. After apparent problems with paperwork authorizing his release, Jeune was
 finally freed on December 11, after nearly a month in jail.
 In Cap Haitien, following the fatal shooting of a policeman, police arrested family
 members when they could not find the suspects, despite the constitutional prohibi-
 tion against arresting any person in place of another. Judicial officials or police sub-
 sequently released the family members. In another case, the brother of a former po-
 lice chief continues to be kept in a police holding cell for "his own protection," ac-
 cording to the police officer in charge.
 Arbitrary arrests by those lacking arrest powers--some elements of the security
 forces, quasi-official forces, and local government councils--occurred sporadically.
 Detainees who had never seen a judge or whose cases stagnated in the judicial
 system continued to crowd the prisons nationwide. An overbur     and inadequate
 judicial system frequently detained suspects well beyond the 48 hours permitted for
 arrainent, although respect for the 48-hour rule increased in general. In June
 and July, the 1CM detected an increase in the practice of judges permitting exten-
 sion of detention in police custody beyond the legal limit of 48 hours in several juris-
 dictions, in the mistaken belief that they had the authority to do so. Cases bound
 over to higher courts also languished. About 80 percent of the inmates in the prison
 system were awaiting trial.
 The Constitution prohibits involuntary exile of citizens. Some persons left the
 country for personal or political reasons. One person detained in July 1996 on the
 accusation of plotting against the State was released in May and left the country
 immediately, after a government official made it clear that his release was condi-
 tional on his going abroad. Otherwise, the Government is not known to have used
 exile as punishment.
 
 
 551
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but it is not independent in practice. Years of rampant corruption and govern-
 mental neglect have let the judicial system poorly organized and nearly moribund.
 The Constitution sets varying periods of tenure for judges above the level of justice
 of the peace. In practice, however, the Ministry of Justice exercises administrative
 oversit of theJudiciary, prosecutors, and court staff. The Minister of Justice fired
 sever   udges for incompetence or corruption; however, none was prosecuted on
 such charges.
 At the first level, the justices of the peace issue warrants, adjudicate minor infrac-
 tions, take depositions, and refer cases to higher judicial officials. Investigating mag
 istrates and public prosecutors cooperate in the development of more serious cases,
 which are tried by the judges of the first instance courts. Appeals court judges hear
 cases referred from the first instance courts, and the Supreme Court deals with
 questions of procedure and constitutionality.
 The judicial apparatus follows a civil law system based on the Napoleonic Code;
 the Criminal Code dates from 1832. The Constitution provides for the right to a fair
 public trial, but this right was widely abridged. The Constitution also expressly de-
 nies police and judicialauthorities the right to interrogate persons charged with a
 crime unless the suspect has legal counsel present or waives this right. While trials
 are public, most accused persons cannot afford legal counsel for interrogation or
 trial, and the law does not require that the Government provide legal representa-
 tion. Despite the efforts of local human rights groups and the international commu-
 nity to provide legal aid, many interrogations without counsel continued to occur.
 Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence and the right to be present at trial,
 to confront witnesses against them, and to present witnesses and evidence in their
 own behalf, and the Government respects these rights in practice.
 Unaddressed systemic weaknesses continued to contribute to a huge backlog of
 criminal cases, with some detainees waiting years in pretrial detention for a court
 date. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, responsibility to investigate crimes is
 unclear and authority to pursue cases is divided among police, prosecutors, and in-
 vestigating magistrates. The Code stipulates two criminal court sessions per year
 in each of the 15 first-instance jurisdictions, each session generally lasting 2 weeks,
 to try all major crimes requiring a jury trial, primarily murder. Although the court'
 system held more such sessions in more locations than in 1996, a significant backlog
 of cases remains. Moreover, if an accused person is ultimately tried and found inno-
 cent, he has no recourse against the Government for time served.
 The Government devoted some effort to the task of reforming the judicial system.
 The Justice Ministry cooperated with international donors in providing training to
 sitting magistrates, improving the administration of the public prosecutors' offices,
 improving documentation and case presentation, strengthening judicial supervision,
 and establishing prison registries. The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies did not
 complete action on a draft law on judicial reform by year's end. The bill contains
 noprecise measures to implement reform.
 There were no reports of political prisoners, although the Government continued
 to hold some political opponents on charges of threatening state security (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 Police and other security force elements did, however, conduct illegal warrantless
 searches. Members of quasi-official forces also conducted illegal searches and sei-
 zures of property. There was at least one instance in which the police arrested and
 detained family members of suspects (see Section 1.d.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press and the Government generally respects these rights. The press en-
 ergetically exercises this freedom. Print and electronic media from opposite ends of
 the political spectrum often criticize the Government.
 With an illiteracy rate of approximately 80 percent, broadcast media, especially
 Creole-language radio, have an unusual importance, and some 35 radio stations op-
 erate in the capital alone. Uncensored satellite television is available. Broadcast
 media tend to criticize the Government less than the press but freely express a wide
 range of political viewpoints. There were no reports of censorship, nor did the media
 appear to practice self-censorship. The government-sponsored daily newspaper re-
 mained closed following a 1995 dispute between the former Information Minister
 and the paper's editor.
 Foreign journalists generally circulate without hindrance. There are occasional re-
 ports of domestic journalists experiencing rough treatment at the hands of the po-
 
 
 552
 lice; however, there were no clear indications that these resulted from motives other
 than personal disputes. In December the police notified the host of a radio call-in
 proram, whose callers often criticize the Government, that they had heard of a plot
 I i him and advised him to take precautions. The host and several colleagues
 also received threats by telephone.
 The Government respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assemb!v and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the authorities generally respected these
 rights in practice. Political parties across the spectrum were able to meet and re-
 cruit members. New popular organizations, including several opposed to the Govern-
 ment or its policy, formed and held demonstrations. A stray bulled fired by police
 killed a man in Port-au-Prince in mid-May when demonstrations by students, alleg-
 edly joined by provocateurs, turned violent and the police responded with gunfire.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the right to practice all re-
 ligions and faiths, provided that practice does not disturb law and order, and the
 Government respected this right.
 d. Freedom ofMovement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government respects the right of freedom of movement within the
 country, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation. An unknown number of un-
 documented migrants put to sea seeking better economic opportunities in other
 countries.
 The Government operated, with international support, a national migration office
 to assist citizens involuntarily repatriated from other countries, notably the Domini-
 can Republic and the Bahamas.
 The Government has no policy regarding foreign nationals seeking refuge or asy-
 lum from third countries. The question of provision of first asylum did not arise.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for regular elections for local and parliamentary offices
 and for the presidency. President Rene Preval, elected in late 1995 in an election
 regarded by the international community as free and fair, continued in office. The
 Parliament, most of whose members were chosen in 1995 in elections regarded as
 administratively flawed but free and fair, continued to operate independently of the
 executive branch.
 The Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), which took office in late 1996, scheduled
 elections for local assemblies and nine senate seats. These elections were delayed
 twice before taking place on April 6. An OAS observer mission noted instances of
 irregularities and fraud at polling places and questioned the CEP's decision, made
 after the vote count was complete, not to count blank ballots. This decision resulted
 in the first-round victory of one senate candidate who would otherwise have had to
 proceed to the second round.
 After making credible allegations of irregularities and of bias on the part of the
 CEP, two parties announced their intention to boycott the second round of the elec-
 tions: The Lavalas Political Organization (OPL), whose candidates had advanced to
 the second round in six senate races, and the Open the Gate Party, whose senate
 candidate had advanced to the second round in the Port-au-Prince area. The second
 round was postponed indefinitely and had not been rescheduled by year's end. The
 resignation of Prime Minister Rosny Smarth, and the Parliament's refusal to ap-
 prove the President's first candidate for a replacement, became linked to the elec-
 tions dispute, further complicating the political situation. Late in the year, the polit-
 ical parties and the President engaged in negotiations aimed at ending the political
 and electoral impasse. These discussions resulted in several steps aimed at improv-
 ing the credibility of the elections, including the resignation of six of the nine CEP
 members and establishment of a presidentially appointed commission to examine
 the April 6 elections. However, the OPL was not satisfied that these measures
 would ensure the credibility of the electoral process. The Parliament had not ap-
 proved the President's second nominee for Prime Minister at year's end, and the im-
 passe remained.
 Members of the local assemblies elected on April 6 took office, and an indirect
 election process took place to select municipal, departmental (provincial), and inter-
 departmental assemblies. The departmental assemblies are constitutionally man-
 dated to participate in the selection of candidates for the Permanent Electoral Coun-
 cil. The controversy surrounding the April 6 vote extended to these elections as well.
 By year's end, a Permanent Electoral Council had not been selected.
 No legal impediments to women's participation in politics or government exist. In
 the recent past, Haiti has had a female President, Prime Minister, Foreign Minister,
 and Minister of Finance. The generally lower status of women, however, limits their
 
 
 553
 participation in these fields. Of the 80 sitting members (3 seats are vacant) of the
 Chamber of Deputies, 3 are women. The Senate (which usually has 27 members but
 at year's end, due to the electoral dispute, had only 18 members) had none, although
 one leading candidate in the delayed election is a woman. The election law provides
 that the deposit required of female candidates for political office is half that re-
 quired of male candidates, if the woman is sponsored by a recognized party. There
 are a few women in prominent positions in the Government, including the Women's
 Affairs Minister and the Secretary of State for Tourism.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 commenting on human rights cases. The Government tolerates their views but is
 rarely responsive to their recommendations. The exception is the HNP Inspector
 General's office, which opened a number of investigations at the request of human
 rights groups. About a dozen local human rights gups monitor conditions in the
 countr, with some working on civic education and legal aid as well.
 On Neove  e 4        vernment opened the office of the Protector of Citizens,
 an autonomous ombudsman-like office established by the 1987 Constitution. Its pur-
 pose is to investigate complaints of government malfeasance where judicial or ad-
 ministrative recourse is not available. Dr. Louis Roy was appointed the nation's first
 Protector of Citizens.
 In July and December, the Government requested and received extensions of the
 UN/OAS International Civilian Mission's mandate to December 31, and then for an
 additional year to December 31, 1998. The ICM investigated all reports of human
 rights violations, issued periodic reports and press releases, conducted civic edu-
 cation, and trained local human rights groups. The ICM also worked with the Gov-
 ernment in a variety of ways to develop its institutional capacity to prevent and pro-
 vide redress for human rights abuses.
 The National Coalition for Haitian Rights was the only other international human
 rights organization to maintain a permanent presence. Representatives of other
 international human rights organizations visited freely from time to time. The ICRC
 was active throughout the year, particularly in prison renovation and assistance to
 prisoners.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1987 Constitution does not specifically prohibit discrimination on the grounds
 of race, sex, religion, disability, language, or social status. It doesprovide for equal
 working conditions regardless of sex, beliefs, or marital status. However, there is
 no effective governmental mechanism to administer or enforce these provisions.
 Women.-According to women's rights groups, rape and other abuse of women is
 common, both within and outside marriage. The Haitian Center for Research and
 Action for the Promotion of Women in 1996 published a preliminary report of a sur-
 vey of 1,705 women interviewed in 1995. Thirty-seven percent of respondents stated
 that they or someone they knew had been raped or otherwise sexually abused; a
 third of respondents reported that they or someone they knew had been the victim
 of other types of physical violence. Nearly two-thirds had not reported the- abuse,
 most due to fear of public shame or of retribution from their assailants, but some
 because they believed that judicial penalties were insufficient. The law provides
 penalties for these crimes, but the authorities do not enforce these provisions ade-
 quately. One law excuses a husband if he murders his wife or her lover upon catch-
 ing them in the act of adultery in the home. A wife who kills her husband upon
 discovering him in the act of adultery is not excused.
 An "International Tribunal for the Elimination of Violence against Haitian
 Women" was held in Port-au-Prince November 24-26. The seminar was organized
 by some 90 women's rights and human rights organizations and assembled women's
 rights specialists from Haiti as well as other countries. The experts heard testimony
 from women who had suffered domestic, sexual, or political violence, or who had
 been targeted because they were disabled. An estimated 300 people attended the
 proceedings. In the meeting's final document, the experts noted serious short-
 comings in several areas: In the judicial system's ability to punish those who com-
 mit violence against women; in the capacity of the police to conduct investigations
 of sexual crimes or protect women who are victims of violent crime; in social and
 public health services; in protection of girls of all ages against molestation; and in
 nonsexist education. The experts also observed that many women (often the very
 poor) who have been victims of violence have a profound fear of reprisal and lack
 confidence that the legal system can provide them with justice.

 The international panel recommended revision of several laws, including making
 rape a crime against the person instead of a crime against morals; shifting adultery
 from the criminal to the civil code; and revising the civil code to recognize the rights
 of women in common law marriages. The panel also recommended revisions of
 school curriculums; free legal aid for victims of violence; training for judges, prosecu-
 tors, and police in handling crimes against women; and ratification of the inter-
 national convention against torture.
 The Ministry of Women's Affairs is charged with promoting and defending the
 rights of women and ensuring that they attain an equal status in society, but it did
 little in this regard. There are no govermnent-sponsored programs for victims of vio-
 lence.
 Women have the same legal status as men. However, women do not enjoy the
 same social and economic status as men. In some social stratums, tradition limits
 women's roles. Peasant women, often the breadwinners for their families, remain
 largely in the traditional occupations of farming, marketing, and domestic labor.
 Very poor urban women, who head their families and serve as their economic sup-
 ort, also often find their employment opportunities limited to traditional roles in
 domestic labor and marketing. Female employees in private industry or service jobs,
 including government jobs, are seldom promoted to supervisory positions. Laws gov-
 erning child support recognize the widespread practice of multiple-father families
 but are rarely enforced. Well-educated women have, however, occupied prominent
 positions in both the private and public sector in recent years. Women's rights
 groups are small, localized, and receive little publicity.
 Children.-The Government's programs do not promote or defend children's
 rights. Government health care and education programs for children are inadequate
 or nonexistent. Poorer families sometimes ration education money to pay school fees
 for male children only.
 Rural families continued to send young children to serve as unpaid domestic labor
 for more affluent city dwellers, a practice cited by a 1991 U.N. study as an example
 of slavery in the 20th century. One international organization estimated that
 250,000 to 300,000 children, 85 percent of them girls, may be victims of this prac-
 tice, called "restavek" (which means "lives with" in Creole). It is primarily lower-
 middle and lower class families who use restavek children, as the more well-to-do
 prefer paid adult employees. The Ministry of Social Affairs believes that many em-
 ployers compel the children to work long hours, provide them with little nourish-
 ment, and frequently beat and abuse them.
 Local human rights groups do not report on the plight of restavek children as an
 abuse or seek to improve their situation. The Ministry of Social Affairs believes that
 it can do little to stop this practice, regarding it as economically motivated; the Min-
 istry assigned five monitors to oversee the welfare of restavek children. Society
 holds such children in little regard, and the poor state of the economy worsened
 their situation. Port-au-Prince's large population of street children includes many
 runaway restaveks.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides that disabled persons shall
 have the means to ensure their autonomy, education, and independence. However,
 there is no legislation to implement these constitutional provisions or to mandate
 prvision of access to buildings for people with disabilities. Although they do not
 face overt mistreatment, given the severe poverty in which most Haitians live, those
 with disabilities face a particularly harsh existence.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Some 99 percent of Haitians are descend-
 ants, in whole or in part, of African slaves who won their war of independence from
 France in 1804. The remaining population is of European, Middle Eastern, North
 American, or Latin American origin. The law makes no distinction based on race.
 Longstanding social and political animosities are often tied to cultural identification,
 skin color, and overlapping issues of class in this starkly inegalitarian society. Some
 of these animosities date back to before Haiti's revolutionary period.
 The Government recognizes two official languages: Creole, which is spoken by vir-
 tually all Haitians; and French, which is spoken by about 20 percent of the popu-
 lation, including the economic elite. The inability to communicate in French has
 long limited the political and economic opportunities available to the majority of the
 population. The Government prepares most documents only in French, and, despite
 the Justice Minister's order to use Creole in the courts, judges conduct most legal
 proceedings exclusively in French. Creole was, however, the language chosen for
 parliamentary debate in the lower house.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code provide for the
 right of association and provide workers, including those in the public sector, with
 
 
 555
 the right to form and join unions without prior government authorization. The law
 protects union activities and prohibits a closed shop. The law also requires a union,
 which must have a minimum of 10 members, to register with the Social Affairs Min-
 istry within 60 days of its formation.
 Unions are independent of the Government and political parties. Unionized public
 school teachers, doctors and nurses in government hospitals, and employees of the
 government-owned telephone company went on strike during the year. Loosely orga-
 nized mass transit drivers went on strike as well. Rather than impose sanctions,
 the Government negotiated with the strikers. Six principal labor federations rep-
 resent about 5 percent of the total labor force, including about 2 to 3 percent of
 labor in the industrial sector.
 Each of the principal labor federations maintained some fraternal relations with
 various international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code protects
 trade union organizing activities and stipulates fines for those who interfere with
 this right. Unions were generally free to pursue their goals, although the Govern-
 ment made little effort to enforce the law. Union leaders assert that some employers
 in the private industrial sector dismiss individuals who participate in union organiz-
 ing activities. Organized labor activity was concentrated in the Port-au-Prince area,
 in state enterprises, the civil service, and the assembly sector. The high unemploy-
 ment rate and antiunion sentiment among some factory workers limited the success
 of union organizing efforts.
 Collective bargaining continued to be nonexistent, and employers set wages uni-
 laterally. The Labor Code does not distinguish between industries producing for the
 local market and those producing for export. Employees in the export-oriented as-
 sembly sector enjoyed better-than-average wages and benefits. Female workers in
 the assembly sector report that some employers sexually harass female workers
 with impunity. Women also assert that, while the vast majority of assembly sector
 workers are female, virtually all the supervisors are men.
 Therere e no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor and applies equally to minors. Such labor is not known to occur
 among adults. However, the Government failed to enforce this law for children, who
 continued to be subjected to forced domestic labor as restaveks in urban households
 (see Section 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age of Employment.-The mini-
 mum employment age in all sectors is 15 years. The Labor Code prohibits minors
 from working under dangerous conditions, and it prohibits minors under the age of
 18 from working at night in industrial enterprises. Fierce adult competition far jobs
 ensures that child labor is not a factor in the industrial sector. Children under the
 age of 15 commonly worked at informal sector jobs to supplement family income,
 despite the legal prohibition. Primary education is supposed to be free and compul-
 sory, but there are far too few public schools to accommodate the country's children,
 especially in rural areas. The Labor Code prohibits forced or compulsory labor,
 which applies equally to minors, but some children are forced to work as domestic
 servants (see Sections 5 and 6.c.)
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum daily wage, established in
 June 1995, is about $2.18 (36 gourdes). Annually, a minimum wage worker would
 earn about $680, an income considerably above the national average but sufficient
 only to permit a worker and family to live in very poor conditions. The majority of
 citizens work in subsistence agriculture, a sector where minimum wage legislation
 does not apply.
 The Labor Code governs individual employment contracts. It sets the standard
 workday at 8 hours, and the workweek at 48 hours, with 24 hours of rest on Sun-
 day. The Code also establishes minimum health and safety regulations. The indus-
 trial and assembly sectors largely observed these guidelines. The assembly sector
 published a voluntary code of conduct in April, committing siguatories to a number
 of measures designed to raise industry standards, including paying the minimum
 wage and the prohibition of child labor. The Ministry of Social Affairs did not, how-
 ever, enforce work hours or health and safety regulations.
 With more than 50 percent of the population unemployed, workers were not able
 to exercise the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without
 jeopardy to continued employment.
