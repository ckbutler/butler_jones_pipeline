 IRAQ
 Since its independence in 1932, Iraq has passed through
 several periods of instability and violence. The current
 government, under control of the Arab Baath Socialist
 Party which came to power by coup in 1968, presides over
 an ethnically and religiously diverse society.
 Iraq broke diplomatic relations with the U.S. during
 the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Although the U.S. maintains
 an Interests Section in Baghdad, contact with the Iraqi
 government and direct access to information is limited.
 Iraq receives no economic assistance from the U.S.
 The wealth generated by Iraq's oil reserves is being invested
 to a large degree in health and education services, housing,
 transportation, and non-petroleum sectors of the economy. A
 substantial portion goes to the military establishment.
 Iraq contends that individual rights must be subordinated to
 the state and to the rights of society as a whole. Political
 rights are sharply limited and little dissent is tolerated.
 Media censorship is endemic, and dependable sources of
 information about many government practices are scarce.
 Activities which the state considers to be threats to its
 security can lead to detention without charges, severe
 prison sentences, mistreatment, torture, and execution. The
 government does not facilitate outside investigations of
 alleged human rights violations.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Details are not easy to obtain, but it appears that torture
 is practiced against almost all persons arrested for political
 reasons. Although the Iraqi constitution prohibits the use
 of torture, allegations persist that both severe physical
 and psychological torture is used during interrogations.
 In 1979, Amnesty International noted reports that Communist
 Party members were tortured, as well as Kurds, which
 reportedly resulted in at least 12 deaths. There is no
 available evidence to indicate that those who employ
 torture are disciplined by the government.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Degrading treatment is allegedly practiced just after
 arrests and during interrogations, especially where
 security matters are involved. Reportedly, such treatment
 is not continued after completion of an investigation or
 sentencing.
 Temporary detention facilities are reportedly crowded
 and unsanitary; conditions for convicts are better.
 Prisons provide some medical services. Convicts may
 arrange to have food provided from the outside. Security
 suspects are not allowed to see either relatives or attorneys
 until after their interrogation is finished. Security
 suspects past the interrogation stage or persons charged
 with common felonies can usually receive visitors, including
 attorneys. Prisoners are jailed in groups according to
 (749)
 
 
 750
 length of sentence.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Citizens in Iraq are subject to arbitrary arrest. Felony
 suspects are protected by writ of habeus corpus; political
 arrestees are not. The U.S. has no information concerning
 the exact number of political detainees. In 1978, Iraq
 granted amnesty to 266 political prisoners and to 6,835
 felons. Iraq claimed to have released the last of its
 political prisoners in a second amnesty granted July 1979 to
 certain types of felons and to 725 political prisoners. The
 Department of State believes, but cannot confirm, that
 additional numbers of political prisoners remain incarcerated.
 Of all the reports concerning arrests, those relating to
 the Kurds are the most numerous. In 1979, Amnesty
 International rioted a report alleging the imprisonment
 or detention of 760 Kurds. These include in some cases
 the families of people sought but not yet found. Amnesty
 International also has received the names of 200 Kurds
 who have allegedly been executed over the past three
 years. The U.S. government has no other independent
 information on the number of Kurds who may have been
 arrested or executed. Iraq specifically excluded most
 Kurdish collaborators from its 1978 amnesty of political
 prisoners. However, in its 1979 amnesty of political
 prisoners, Iraq specifically included some 400 persons
 associated with Kurdish opposition activities. It is
 likely that other Kurdish prisoners still remain in
 detention.
 A mass relocation of Kurds took place at the end of the
 Kurdish rebellion in 1975. The government created a
 thirty-kilometer-wide security zone along much of the
 border with Iran and Turkey. It moved Kurds and other
 groups living in the zone from their homes to areas far
 distant. Most of those forcibly relocated have been
 allowed to return to the north, although not to their
 original villages. Most have been resettled in govern-
 ment-built centers.
 In August of 1979, Iraq offered a special amnesty to
 still-militant Iraqi Kurds outside the country who wished
 to lay down their arms and return. Expatriate Kurds,
 especially those in Iran, responded more positively to
 this offer than to similar offers in the past which had
 been greeted with scepticism. Five well-known Kurds,
 prominently associated with the 1974-75 rebellion,
 returned in December 1979 to Iraq, where they have
 been appointed as counselors to the Kurdish Affairs
 Bureau of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council.
 There are unconfirmed reports that as many as 10,000
 of the Kurds who fled following the collapse of the
 1974-75 rebellion may have returned under this
 special amnesty.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials in civil, criminal, and religious courts are open.
 Defendents in these courts are entitled to counsel; a
 lawyer is provided if a defendent cannot afford one.
 
 
 751
 Charges and evidence are available for review.
 Closed trials are the rule in the revolutionary courts,
 which hear such crimes as espionage, treason, smuggling,
 and drug trafficking. Closed, too, are the "special
 courts" constituted for specific incidents, such as the
 reported conspiracy against the central government in
 1979. Lawyers assigned to revolutionary court defendents
 are court employees. Defendents in these courts may not
 necessarily be informed of the charges against them
 prior to trial. Little information is available about
 judicial process in these cases, since they are almost
 always closed.
 What information is available indicates that revolutionary
 court trials are swift and penalties severe. In December
 1979, two government officials were hanged following their
 conviction in revolutionary courts for passing classified
 economic data to foreign companies and for attempting to
 profit personally from their official positions. In its
 1979 report, Amnesty International expressed concern over
 the imposition of the death penalty by the revolutionary
 courts in certain instances. It urged the government in
 the future to permit open, observed trials and to allow
 appeal of revolutionary courts sentences -- especially
 those of capital punishment.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The provision in the interim constitution for inviolability
 of the home is reinforced by strong cultural values. The
 law requires police to obtain a search warrant before
 entering the home of a felony suspect. While the law
 fails to extend similar protection to security suspects,
 the influence of social values helps safeguard homes
 against illegal entry. Arrests usually occur outside
 the home and allegations of illegal entry are rare.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care,
 and Education:
 Iraq's socialist economy is centrally controlled, but a
 small thriving private sector exists. Major industries
 are state-owned, including petroleum. Per capita income
 was reported by the government to be approximately $1800
 in 1978.
 The government has made major efforts to improve the
 conditions of life by raising the standard of the
 lowest socio-economic classes while placing income
 limits on those at the top. A program of land reform
 begun in 1958 continues. Much of the expropriated
 land has been turned over to collective farms and
 cooperatives rather than to individual farmers.
 Private property is allowed, but restricted as to
 the size of holdings.
 Rapid migration to the cities has produced sub-standard
 living conditions. Numerous public housing projects
 under construction are intended to improve conditions
 and reduce crowding. An extensive system of subsidies
 
 
 752
 and controls keeps the prices for basic necessities low.
 Health care is free; there is an active program for building
 clinics in both urban and rural areas. Recent medical school
 graduates are required to serve for three years in rural
 clinics. Citizens who cannot be treated in Iraq are
 eligible for government grants or exemptions from currency
 exchange laws in order to pay for treatment abroad.
 Education is free through the university level and the
 government offers a wide range of scholarships for advanced
 study abroad. Compulsory education was instituted in
 1978-79 for entering primary school students. The
 number of primary and secondary schools has almost doubled
 in less than ten years. A new literacy program, aimed at
 reducing the 53 percent illiteracy rate, could have an
 important effect on the status of women, whose illiteracy
 rate as a group is over 70 percent. Baath party ideology
 often is transmitted through literacy classes.
 The government has spearheaded efforts to improve the
 status of women in Iraq. Women are legally guaranteed
 equal employment and educational opportunities, equal
 pay, and equal rights to property and business ownership.
 A personal status law of February 1978 permits women to
 institute divorce proceedings and outlaws coerced marriages.
 Increasing numbers of women are joining the work force in
 a wide range of occupations. Many women still adhere
 to more traditional norms due to social, cultural, and
 religious pressures, but the government has provided
 the legal framework and the opportunities to allow
 them to improve their status.
 Corruption occurs, but is highly risky in Iraq where
 execution could be the penalty. There is no indication
 that existing corruption interferes with vital needs
 or denies important resources to the average citizen
 or the poor.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly
 The government views dissent as a threat to the security
 of the country, and tightly controls the exercise of the
 rights of speech, press, and assembly. The constitution
 prohibits "any act aimed at undermining the national
 unity of the people, provoking racial, sectarian, or
 regional bigotry, or violating gains and achievements of
 the country."
 The media are government controlled. The press, radio, and
 television operate under direct guidance from the govern-
 ment; they are not permitted to criticize the government
 or its policies. Media which fail to follow guidance are
 suspended, as was the Iraqi Communist Party paper in April,
 1979. Foreign periodicals, books, and movies are screened
 and censored before distribution.
 The government pursues a policy aimed at assimilating its
 various ethnic and religious groups, including the Jewish,
 Yezidi, and Christian minorities. In some instances,
 
 
 753
 this takes the form of trying to wean groups away from their
 cultural traditions and way of life.
 The size of the Jewish community in Iraq is believed
 to be fewer than 300, and is composed mainly of older
 people. The extent of the community's religious activity
 is not known. According to Amnesty International,
 about 14 of the approximately 200 Freemasons arrested
 in 1973 and 1974 remain in prison.   Bahais and Freemasons
 were specifically excluded from the amnesty Iraq granted
 to some 266 other political prisoners in 1978. Organized
 activities by Freemasons and Bahais are prohibited.
 Iraq's Christians number about 500,000 or 5% of the
 population. The Chaldeans, long-time urban residents,
 are the wealthiest and the best educated of the
 Christian groups. They frequently occupy mid-level govern-
 ment positions. Syriac Christians are often in the lower
 ranks of the civil service. Armenians often are found
 in private business. Assyrian Christians, often less-
 educated, recent arrivals from rural areas, are
 financially less well off than other groups.
 Although Iraq is constitutionally an Islamic state,
 the government advocates a secular policy. Christians
 enjoy freedom of worship in established churches, which
 receive some support from the state. Convents and
 monasteries exist and some new church reconstruction
 has been undertaken. A recent decree ordered obligatory
 Koranic studies for students; it was hastily withdrawn
 after it met with vigorous opposition from the Christian
 community.
 In late 1978, the government detained about 100 Christians,
 including some foreigners. They were reportedly arrested
 for holding unauthorized religious meetings and prosely-
 tizing. One of the foreigners was tried, sentenced to
 five years, and deported. Similar treatment was expected
 for the other foreigners involved. Although some of the
 Iraqis were tried, most if not all, of them have been
 released, according to available-information.
 The Shiite Muslims make up 50% of the population. They have
 felt economically and socially disadvantaged during centuries
 of Sunni domination. The government is seeking to raise
 standards of living and to equalize opportunities for
 economic and professional advancement. The government, now
 tolerates such Shia religious practices as public flagellation
 and mass gatherings, which it had prohibited prior to an
 outbreak of severe Shia disturbances in 1977.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 In Iraq, security areas are off limits, including parts
 of central Baghdad and sensitive border areas. Police
 checkpoints exist along all highways and outside every
 major town, but most Iraqis and foreigners travel freely
 in non-restricted areas.
 Iraqi passport fees are reasonable. The government
 
 
 754
 requires all Iraqis and most foreigners to obtain exit
 permission for travel abroad. Young men of draft age
 may find it difficult to get travel documents. Iraq
 can require a prospective Iraqi traveler to post bonds
 ranging from $2,000 to $14,000. Most foreigners who
 reside permanently in Iraq can obtain entry and exit
 documents with little difficulty.
 There are no formal restrictions on emigration, but Iraq
 discourages professional and skilled workers from emigrating.
 It restricts the transfer of assets and currency out of the
 country; penalties for violating exchange laws are severe.
 Iraq no longer practices banishment or exile. In recent
 years, the government instituted special programs to encourage
 qualified professionals to come back to the country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are four legal parties: the ruling Baath Party,
 the Communist Party and two Kurdish parties. Together
 they constitute the Patriotic and Progressive National
 Front (PPNF) -- essentially a vehicle of support for the
 government. The three non-Baath parties carry on only
 limited activity. Members of the Iraqi military or security
 services may engage in political activities only within
 the Baath Party. Alleged Communist activity in the armed
 forces resulted in the conviction and execution of 21
 people in May 1978. (Amnesty International reported in
 1979 that as many as 38 additional persons may have been
 executed.)
 The Baath Party is the only one with any real power.
 Membership is not required for appointment to senior
 government positions, but is necessary for political
 success. According to Amnesty International in its
 1979 report, restrictions on political activity outside
 the Baath Party were tightened by 1978 laws imposing the
 death penalty for a newly-created class of political
 offenses. In addition, Amnesty International reported
 widescale purges of Baathists in 1978 in the government
 and military, as well as arrests of lawyers, teachers,
 and students.
 The government is planning for national elections for
 the first time since 1968. If held, the elections are
 not expected to alter the present political system,
 although they may lead to the establishment of a
 national assembly.
 Government officials, such as mayors, governors, and
 ministers are appointed by the central government.
 The General Federation of Trade Unions customarily
 held elections, but in the past year, its ranks
 gradually have been filled with Baath Party members.
 Trade unions function primarily as social welfare
 organizations; their essentially governmental character
 makes them a channel of Baath party influence
 over the trade unions. Union membership is a
 prerequisite for employment in many sectors.
 4. Government Attitudes and Record Regarding
 International and Non-Governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Iraq has not permitted outside investigations of
 reported human rights violations. An Amnesty International
 request to send a delegation to Iraq two years ago was refused.
 The Iraqi government has not replied to several letters from
 Amnesty International. In March 1978, the government denied
 each of the human rights violations described in Amnesty
 International's 1975-76 report on Iraq.
