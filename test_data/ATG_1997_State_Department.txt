 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 Antigua and Barbuda is a'multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a member of
 the Commonwealth of Nations. A prime minister, a cabinet, and a bicameral legisla-
 tive assembly compose the Government. A Governor General, appointed by the Brit-
 ish monarch, is the titular head of state, with largely ceremonial powers. Prime
 Minister Lester B. Bird's Antigua Labour Party (ALP) has controlled the Govern-
 ment and Parliament since 1976. During the last elections in March 1994, the ALP
 retained power by capturing 10 of 17 parliamentary seats, down from the 15 it held
 under the administration of V.C. Bird Sr., the current Prime Minister's father. The
 Governor GeneraLappoints the 15 senators, 11 with the advice of the Prime Min-
 ister and 4 with-the advice of the opposition leader. The judiciary is independent.
 Security forces consist of a police force and the small Antigua and Barbuda
 Defence Force. The police are organized, trained, and supervised according to Brit-
 ish law enforcement practices and have a reputation for respecting individual rights
 in the performance of their duties.
 Antigua and Barbuda has a mixed economy with a strong private sector. Tourism
 is the most important source of foreign exchange earnings. The country is burdened
 by a large and growing external debt, which remains a serious economic problem.
 Per capita gross national product was about $7,800 in 1996.
 Although the Government generally respected constitutional provisions for politi-
 cal and civil rights, opposition parties complained that they received no coverage or
 opportunity to express their views on the government-controlled electronic media.
 Societal discrimination and violence against women also continued to be problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and the authorities generally respected
 these prohibitions.
 Conditions at the lone, 18th-century-vintage prison are primitive. While the pris-
 on is not overcrowded, death row prisoners get exercise only three times a week,
 and all prisoners receive only one meal a day, consisting mostly of cornmeal mush
 and a small piece of fish or chicken. Prisoners are permitted to supplement their
 diet if their relatives are able to bring food to the prison.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and the Government respects these provisions in practice. Crimi-
 nal defendants have the- right to a judicial determination of the legality of their de-
 tention. The police must bring detainees before a court within 48 hours of arrest
 or detention.
 There were no reports of involuntary exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 The judicial system is part of the Eastern Caribbean legal system and reflects his-
 torical ties to the United Kingdom. The Privy Council in London is designated by
 the Constitution as the final court of appeal, which is invariably employed in the
 case of death sentences. There are no military or political courts.
 The Constitution provides that criminal defendants receive a fair, open, and pub-
 lic trial. In capital cases only, the Government provides legal assistance at public
 (397)
 
 
 expense to persons without the means to retain a private attorney. Courts can reach
 verdicts quickly, with some cases coming to conclusion in a matter of days.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 of the press, and other forms of communication. Although the authorities generally
 respect these provisions in practice, the-Government has restricted opposition par-
 ties access to electronic media, effectively denying them equal coverage. The Gov-
 ernment owns one of the two general interest radio stations and the single tele-
 vision station. A religious station broadcasts without impediment. One of the Prime
 Minister's brothers owns the second radio station, and another brother is the prin-
 cipal owner of the sole cable television company. The government-controlled media
 report regularly on the activities of the Government and the ruling party, but limit
 the coverage and access of opposition parties. These restrictions led opposition lead-
 er Baldwin Spencer to initiate a constitutional challenge in 1993, and in March the
 High Court determined that Spencer had been discriminated against and denied his
 constitutional right to freedom of expression. The presiding judge called on the Gov-
 ernment to provide the opposition greater media access in the future; however, this
 ruling had limited impact in practice.
 Daily and weekly newspapers offering a range of opinion are active and often pub-
 lish vigorous criticism of the Government without government interference. Never-
 theless, when the sole daily newspaper tried to start a radio station in 1996, it was
 unable to secure a license to operate. After waiting for more than 1 year for a li-
 cense, the station began broadcasting and the police closed it after 1 day. The au-
 thorities charged the owners with operating a radio station without a license; the
 charges were still pending at year's end. The owners sued the State in December
 for illegal search and seizure and claimed that their constitutional right to
 been violated. In December the judge ruled that constitutional rights
 had not been violated even though the owners could rightly claim significant delay;
 the judge found that the Government had not been inconsistent in this case, since
 it had not granted other licenses. The owners appealed the case, pointing out that
 a progovernment station had recently been granted a license.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. The police normally issue the required permits for
 public meetings, but sometimes deny them in order to avert violent conliontations.
 While the authorities placed some restrictions on demonstrations in the past, the
 opposition held numerous rallies, public meetings, and a large march with no inter-
 ference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice.
 There were no reports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refu-
 gee status. The issue of provision of first asylum did not arise. However, government
 practice on refugee and asylum cases remains undefined.
 The Government accepted approximately 3,000 residents of Montserrat who fled
 volcanic eruptions. This influx placed a serious burden on the country's social serv-
 ices, and the Government asked the United Kingdom for assistance in meeting these
 needs. Despite the additional burdens, the Government continued to welcome
 Monserrat refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for a multiparty political system accommodating a wide
 spectrum of political viewpoints. All citizens 18 years of age and older may register
 and vote by secret ballot. The Constitution requires general elections at least every
 5 years. The law obligates the Government to hold voter registration during a fixed
 period (of only 5 days) each year, and parties conduct their own registration drives
 free of government interference.
 Except for a period in opposition from 1971 to 1976, the ALP has held power con-
 tinuously since 1951. The opposition has charged that the ALP's longstanding mo-
 nopoly on patronage and its influence over access to economic opportunities make
 
 
 399
 it extremely difficult for opposition parties to attract membership and financial sup-
 port. In 1992 public concern over corruption in government spawned the merger of
 three opposition political parties into the United Progressive P arty (UPP). The UPP
 increased its representation to seven seats from five during the 1994 election. Oppo-
 sitioa and press regularly charge members of the Government with corrupt prac-
 tices.
 No women have been elected or currently serve in the House of Representatives.
 Two women are senators, which are appointed positions. Eight of the 14 permanent
 secretaries (the top civil servant position in ministries) are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no governmental restrictions, no local human rights groups have
 been formed. There were no requests for human rights investigations or inquiries
 from individuals or international human rights groups during the year. The Govern-
 ment created and filled the post of human rights ombudsman.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, creed, language, or social sta-
 tus, and the Government generally observed its provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women is a recognized social problem. It is treated as
 a matter of public conscience, and there are nongovernmental social welfare groups
 focused on the problem. Women in many cases are reluctant to testify against their
 abusers. Police generally refrain from intervening in cases of domestic violence, and
 some women have charged credibly that the courts are lenient in such cases.
 While the role of women in society is not legally restricted, economic conditions
 tend to limit women to home and family, particularly in rural areas, although some
 women work as domestics, in. agriculture, or in the large tourism sector. Although
 the Government pledged to provide better family planning services, educational op-
 portunities, and job training, it has been slow to implement new programs. The Di-
 rectorate of Women's Affairs exists to help women advance in government and the
 professions, but progress was slow.
 Children.-The Government provides education for children through the age of 16,
 and children have access to health care and other public services.
 Child abuse remains a hidden problem. While the Government has repeatedly ex-
 pressed its commitment to children's rights, it has done little to protect those rights
 in practice. The Government pledged to establish a committee on children's rights
 and indicated it intends to strengthen monitoring and implementation of the United
 Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The United Nations Children's Fund
 helped support a study of the needs of children and families, and its recommenda-
 tions are  mg used to develop a National Plan of Action on Child Survival, Devel-
 opment, and Protection.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no specific laws mandating accessibility for
 the disabled, but there are constitutional provisions that prohibit discrimination
 against the physically disabled in employment and education. There is no evidence
 of widespread discrimination against physically disabled individuals, although the
 Government does not visibly enforce the constitutional antidiscrimination provi-
 sions.
 Section 6. Worker Rights:
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to associate freely and to
 form labor unions, and the authorities generally respect these rights in practice. Al-
 though fewer than 50 percent of workers belong to unions, the important hotel in-
 dustry is heavily unionized. There are two major trade unions: the Antigua Trades
 and Labour Union (ATLU) and the Antigua Workers' Union (AWU). The ATLU is
 associated with the ruling ALP, while the larger and more active AWU is rather
 loosely allied with the opposition.
 The Labor Code recognizes the right to strike, but the Industrial Relations Court
 may limit this right in a given dispute. Once either party to a dispute requeststhe
 court to mediate, there can be no strike. Because of the delays associated with this
 process, unions often resolve labor disputes before a strike is called.
 Unions are free to affliate with international labor organizations and do so in
 practice.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor organizations are free
 to organize and bargain collectively. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination, and
 there were no reports that it occurred. Employers found guilty of antiunion discrimi-
 nation are not required to rehire employees fired for union activities, but must pay
 full severance pay and full wages lost by the employee from the time of firing until
 
 
 the determination of employer fault. There are no areas of the country where union
 organization or collective bargaining is discouraged or impeded.
 There are no export processing zones. However, in anticipation of such a zone, the
 Government passed legislation in 1993, appointed a commissioner in 1996, and
 named a board in February to oversee potential development.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and forced labor, including that of children, and they do not exist in practice.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 stipulates a minimum working age of 13 years, which is respected in practice. The
 tripartite National Labor Advisory Board recommended in September 1996 that the
 minimum age be raised to 16, which would correspond with the Education Act. The
 law prohibits forced or bonded child labor, and it is effectively enforced (see Section
 6.c.). The Ministry of Labor, which is required by law to conduct periodic inspections
 of workplaces, has responsibility for enforcement. There have been no reports of
 minimum age employment violations. The political strength of the two major unions
 and the powerful influence of the Government on the private sector combine to
 make the Ministry of Labor very effective in enforcement in this area.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law established minimum wages for var-
 ious work categories in 1981. The lowest minimum wage, for domestic workers, is
 $0.46 (EC$1.25) per hour; the highest minimum wage, for skilled labor, is $1.30
 (EC$3.50) per hour. Most minimum wages would not provide a decent standard of
 living for a worker and family, but in practice the great majority of workers earn
 substantially more than the minimum wage. There was consideration of reactivating
 the tripartite advisory board to review the outdated 1981 rates.
 The law permits a maximum 48-hour, 6-day workweek, but in practice the stand-
 ard workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. The law provides workers a minimum of 12
 days of annual leave. There is no law that provides for maternity leave, but general
 practice arising from the collective bargaining process is to provide up to 13 weeks.
 Employers generally pay 40 percent of wages for 8 weeks of leave, while social secu-
 rity pays 60 percent. The remaining weeks are paid at 60 percent by social security.
 Where no collective agreement exists, social security pays 60 percent for 13 weeks.
 The Government has not yet developed occupational health and safety laws or
 regulations. Plans to incorporate comprehensive legislation on safety, health, and
 the welfare of workers into the existingLabor Code have not yet been implemented.
 There is no specific provision for a worker to leave a dangerous workplace situation
 without jeopardy to continued employment.
